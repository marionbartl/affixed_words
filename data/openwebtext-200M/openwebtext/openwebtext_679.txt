More on : Financial Markets
Ok , the Treasury can not borrow for free .
Three month Treasury bills , according to Bloomberg , yield something like 2 basis point .
Treasury yields are n’t hard to calculate .
But they are still my favorite indicators of the scale of the current crisis .
The fact that so many are willing to lend so much to the US Treasury for so little is a clear indicator of a lack of confidence in other financial asset .
Dr. Krugman is right .
Market analysts are more or less saying the same thing : " “ Where the credit markets are trading , it ’s all but implying a 1929 scenario , ” said Joe Balestrino , fixed income strategist at Federated Investors "
I can not match John Jansen ’s market experience -- but I share his amazement at the scale of the moves in the Treasury market today .
Jansen :
The Long Bond is trading at a yield of 3.43 percent and the dollar price has exploded 9 points today .
I have done this for nearly 30 years .
I have never witnessed this before .
The rise in the price of the ten year bond was n’t quite as dramatic , but the rise in price ( and fall in yield ) still shows up quite cleanly .
Suffice to say that surge in Treasuries -- and rise in credit spreads -- is n’t a good sign .
Investors ( including central banks ) are n’t willing to accept anything that just has an implicit government guarantee -- let alone debt with real risk .
Right now they want nothing less than the full faith and credit of the US government .
p.s. I would be interested to hear a true believer in the efficient market hypothesis explain recent moves in 30 year swap spreads .
For a primer , read Jansen .
" The 30 year swap rate is 2.84 .
It has dropped about 80 basis points on the day and is about 60 basis points rich to the 30 year Treasury .
I just spoke with an options trader about this historic move .
He said that there structured product trades buried in trading books all over the world which are melting .
There is a massive short in the 30 year sector ( in Treasury paper and in the swap market ) which resulted from sales of cheap volatility .
Some of these positions have been on the books of various entities for years and it is only recently that the chickens have come home to roost .
Each time the spread turns more negative , that movement forces some one to receive in swaps to hedge there position .
There are short the long end trades in every permutation and combination along the curve .
The receiving creates a self fulfilling prophecy which compels someone else to receive . "
I am no expert on swaps ( to put it mildly ) but it sure seems like the current move is driven by something other than fundamentals .
A negative swap spread -- according to the FT -- implies that " investors are somehow reckoning that they are more likely to be paid back by a private counterparty than by the government . "
That does n’t seem consistent with what the rest of the market is telling us ...

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The Iraqi Presidency Council approved a resolution Sunday that will allow non-U.S. foreign troops to remain in Iraq after a U.N. mandate expires at year 's end .
British troops talk in Basra last week .
Iraq on Sunday OK 'd foreign troops to remain in the country after the new year .
It was the last step for final adoption of the resolution , which won parliamentary approval Tuesday .
Iraq 's main political parties hammered out the resolution a week ago , after an impasse among parliamentary factions threatened to continue beyond the December 31 deadline .
A separate , previously approved agreement authorizes U.S. troops to remain .
Britain has about 4,100 troops in Iraq , the second - largest contingent after the United States , which has about 142,500 .
Other countries covered under the resolution -- El Salvador , Australia , Romania and Estonia -- have a total of several hundred troops in the country .
The resolution authorizes Iraq to negotiate bilateral agreements with the countries , Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said .
If it had not been approved by year 's end , their troops would have been in Iraq illegally .
In November , the United States concluded a separate agreement with the Iraqi government authorizing the continued presence of its troops .
U.S. combat forces plan to pull back from population centers in Iraq by July and to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011 .
The British government says its forces will complete their mission of training Iraqi troops by May 31 and withdraw from the country by July 31 .
In other developments :
• Four people were killed and 20 wounded Sunday when a suicide bomber targeted a demonstration in Mosul against Israeli military operations in Gaza , a Mosul police official said .

• One of three al Qaeda in Iraq prisoners at large after a Friday jail break in Ramadi was killed in a gun battle with police Saturday , and the remaining two were arrested early Sunday , according to Ramadi police and an Iraqi Interior Ministry official .
Amad Ahmed Farhan was among 40 al Qaeda in Iraq prisoners who escaped from jail at al - Fursan police station .
An Iraqi police patrol drove by Farhan 's sister 's home and Farhan began shooting at officers , a police official said .
He then fled , jumping from the roof of one house to another before a police sniper gunned him down .
The remaining two prisoners , Abdul Aleem Abdulwahab and Lazem Mohammed Ali , were found hiding in water tanks Sunday at a home where they had threatened two women and several children with weapons , the Interior Ministry said .
Of the 40 who escaped , 24 were taken into custody , six were killed in the clashes and seven others were wounded .
Ten Iraqi police also were killed .

A federal mental health examination has determined that terrorism suspect Aafia Siddiqui is mentally unfit for trial , according to a court order issued Monday .
Siddiqui was taken into custody following her July capture in Afghanistan and extradited to New York in August on charges of attempted murder following a shootout with security personnel who were questioning her .
Siddiqui was wanted by the FBI as far back as 2004 for her alleged connections to al Qaeda .
The indictment charges that when Siddiqui , a former MIT student , was detained by Afghan National Police , she was in possession of a document which mentioned , " Mass Casualty Attack " and listed various landmarks in New York , including Wall Street and the Statue of Liberty .
She had allegedly been involved in planning attacks and recruiting , according to the FBI .
During an August 2004 press conference , FBI Director Robert Mueller said , " Aafia Siddiqui is an al Qaeda operative and facilitator , she attended colleges in the Boston area , and is believed to have left Boston in January of 2003 . "
There have been allegations that Siddiqui has been mistreated while in custody .
Some human rights groups have alleged that she was detained for years overseas in various secret sites for high - value detainees .
According to a Nov. 6 , 2008 , confidential forensic examination from a federal medical center in Carswell , Texas , mental health professionals have concluded , " Ms. Siddiqui is not currently competent to proceed as a result of her mental disease , which renders her unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against her or to assist properly in her defense . "
An excerpt of the evaluation was mentioned in the judge 's order calling for a Wednesday hearing to address her mental health to stand trial .

BP to Help Commercialize Clean Energy in China
December 2nd , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
BP and the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) have agreed to establish the Clean Energy Commercialization Center ( CECC ) , a joint venture in Shanghai investing some $ 73 million to commercialize Chinese clean energy technologies .
Subject to final government approvals , the CECC venture is expected to be established by early 2009 .
The Center will draw on the expertise and experience of both partners to integrate the following energy technologies : coal gasification and conversion , carbon capture and storage , coal bed methane and underground gasification .
Speaking at the signing , Tony Hayward said : “ Truly world class technologies are now emerging from China ’s research institutions .
This Center , in bringing these innovations into commercial reality has the potential to play a significant role in delivering local energy solutions to address issues that have a global impact . ”
The CECC will also serve as an international platform for further collaboration among research institutes , enterprises and other institutions to improve indigenous Chinese innovation capabilities and market applications in areas such as clean coal conversion , zero emission technologies , and carbon capture and storage .
While I ’m happy to see progress in the way of Chinese energy and climate issues , there is no such thing as clean coal !

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Editor 's Note :
This story , originally published in the February 1992 issue of Scientific American , is being re-posted in light of Steven Chu 's nomination as U.S. secretary of energy .
Before you turn another page of this magazine , consider your actions carefully .
Every time you wish to grasp a page , you must place one finger above the paper and another below so that the distance between each finger and the paper is about equal to the diameter of an atom .
At that point , the electrons at the surface of your fingers repel the electrons on either side of the page .
This slight redistribution of charges produces an electric field that is strong enough to allow you to squeeze the page between your fingers .
Remarkably , by applying electric forces at the atomic scale , you can hold onto objects that are , on the whole , electrically neutral .
In contrast , manipulating neutral objects that are atomic in size is a formidable technical challenge .
Charged objects are much easier to control because electric and magnetic fields can exert much stronger forces over them .
Indeed , for more than a century , scientists have applied electromagnetic forces to manipulate charged particles such as electrons and ions from a distance .
But only in the past few years have researchers been able to move neutral particles at a distance with any facility .
In particular , investigators have developed instruments that use lasers to trap and manipulate atoms and micron - size particles with astonishing control .
These innovations have quickly led to a wide range of applications .
My research group and others have cooled atoms to temperatures near absolute zero-conditions that allow us to examine quantum states of matter and unusual interactions between light and ultra -cold atoms .
We have begun to develop atomic clocks and extremely sensitive accelerometers .
Our techniques are being applied to handle such individual molecules as large polymers .
In addition , we have devised an " optical tweezers " that uses laser beams to hold and move organelles inside of cells without puncturing the intervening membranes .
Almost a decade before scientists learned how to control neutral particles at a distance with laser light , they achieved some of the same tasks using magnetic fields .
They applied fields to focus atoms in beams and trap them .
After learning how to trap atoms with laser light , they turned to the vast arsenal of laser techniques to gain precise control over neutral particles .
The first trap for neutral particles was developed by Wolfgang Paul of the University of Bonn .
In 1978 he and his colleagues succeeded in trapping neutrons in a magnetic field .
Seven years later , using the same basic principles , William D. Phillips and his colleagues at the National Bureau of Standards were able to trap atoms .
The magnetic trap can hold onto particles that have magnetic properties similar to those of a tiny bar magnet .
To be more precise , the particle must carry a small magnetic dipole moment .
If such a particle is placed in a magnetic field whose strength varies from region to region , it will move toward the weakest or strongest part of the field , depending on the particle 's orientation [ see illustration on next page ] .
Paul realized that it is possible to design a magnetic field with a local minimum in the field strength , and if the magnetic dipole is originally aligned to seek a position where the field is weakest , it will remain aligned in the " weak field - seeking " orientation [ see " Cooling and Trapping Atoms , " by W. D. Phillips and H. ] .
Metcalf ; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN , March 1987 ] .
Atoms can also be trapped by laser light .
Light can exert forces on atoms and other neutral particles because it carries momentum .
If an atom is bombarded with a beam of light of a particular frequency , it will continuously absorb and reemit photons , the quanta of light .
As the atom absorbs photons , it will receive a barrage of momentum kicks in the direction that the light beam propagates .
The kicks add up to produce a " scattering " force , which is proportional to the momentum of each photon and the number of photons that the atom scatters per second .
Of course , for every photon the atom absorbs , it must emit one .
But because the photons are released with no preferred direction , the changes in momentum caused by the emission average to zero .
Absorption and emission have the net effect of pushing the atom in the direction that the light travels .
The magnitude of this scattering force is quite low .
If an atom absorbs a single photon , its change in velocity is tiny compared with the average velocity of atoms in a gas at room temperature .
( The change is on the order of one centimeter per second , the crawling speed of an ant , whereas an atom at room temperature moves at the speed of a supersonic jet . )
This scattering force was first detected in 1933 , when Otto R. Frisch used it to deflect a beam of sodium atoms .
He prepared the atoms by vaporizing sodium in a container .
To form the beam , he allowed the atoms to pass through a hole in the container and a series of slits .
Once established , the beam was bombarded with light from a sodium lamp .
Although , on average , each sodium atom absorbed only a single photon , Frisch was able to detect a slight deflection of the beam .
The scattering force that Frisch generated was far too weak to capture atoms .
Decades later workers realized that the photon - scattering rate could be increased to more than 10 million photons per second , corresponding to a force 100,000 times greater than the pull of gravity by the earth .
The first dramatic demonstration of the scattering force on atoms was made by two separate groups led by Phillips and John L. Hall at the National Bureau of Standards .
In 1985 they stopped a beam of atoms and reduced the temperature of the atoms from roughly 3 00 kelvins ( room temperature ) to 0 . 1 kelvin .
The power of the scattering force attainable with lasers gave researchers hope that they could not only stop atoms but trap them as well .
But attempts to configure several laser beams so that they could collect and concentrate atoms in some region of space seemed doomed to failure .
According to a principle known as the Optical Earnshaw Theorem , it is impossible to fashion a light trap out of any configuration of light beams if the scattering force is proportional to the light intensity .
The problem is that the beams cannot be arranged to generate only inward directed forces .
Any light that enters a trapping region must eventually escape and must therefore carry outward directed forces as well .
Even if Luke Skywalker were a physicist , the ( scattering ) force would not always be with him .
Fortunately , an atomic trap can be based on another kind of force that light can exert on atoms .
To understand this force , it is instructive to consider how small particles can be attracted to a positively charged object , such as a glass rod rubbed with cat 's fur .
The rod produces an electric field that polarizes the particle .
Consequently , the average position of positive charges in the particle will be slightly farther away from the rod than the average position of the negative charges .
This asymmetric distribution of charge is said to have a dipole moment .
The attractive dipole force exerted by the electric field on the negative charges of the particle is stronger than the repulsive force on the positive charges .
As a result , the particle is pulled toward the regions where the electric field is strongest .
Notice that this force is analogous to the magnetic dipole force first used to trap neutrons and atoms .
If the charge on the rod were negative , the electric field would induce a dipole moment of reversed polarity , and the particle would still be attracted to regions of high electric field .
Because of the dipole force , atoms can be trapped by an electric field that has a local maximum of some point in space .
Could such fields be produced by some clever arrangement of electric charges ?
For any system of fixed charges , the answer is no .
Yet an electric field with a local maximum can be achieved in a dynamic system .
In particular , because light is made up of rapidly oscillating electric and magnetic fields , a focused laser beam can produce an alternating electric field with a local maximum .
When the field interacts with an atom , it alters the distribution of electrons around the atom , thereby inducing an electric dipole moment .
The atom will thus be attracted to the local maximum in the field , just as the charged particle was drawn toward the rod .
The fact that the electric field changes rapidly does not present a problem .
As the field changes polarity , the dipole moment of the atom also switches around .
As long as the field changes at a rate slower than the natural oscillation frequencies of the atom , the dipole moment remains aligned with the field .
The atom therefore continues to move toward the local maximum .
As a result , this dipole force can be used to confine atoms .
In 1968 Vladilen S. Letokhov first proposed that atoms could be trapped in a light beam using the dipole force , and 10 years later Arthur Ashkin of AT&T Bell Laboratories suggested a more practical trap based on focused laser beams .
Although the dipole - force trap is elegant in conception , it had practical problems .
To minimize the scattering force , the light must be tuned well below the frequency at which the atoms readily absorb photons .
At those large de tunings , the trapping forces are so feeble that atoms as cold as 0.01 kelvin cannot be held in the trap .
Even when colder atoms were placed in the trap , they would boil out of the trap in a matter of a few thousandths of a second as a result of the ever present photon scattering .
In addition , the task of injecting atoms into the trap seemed daunting because the volume of the trap would only be 0.001 cubic millimeter .
For these reasons , the challenges to optical trapping seemed formidable .
Then , in 1985 , a scheme for a workable optical trap became apparent after atoms were laser cooled in all dimensions and to much lower temperatures than the stopped atomic beams .
The laser - cooling idea was first proposed in 1975 by Theodor Hansch and Arthur Schawlow of Stanford University .
In the same year , a similar scheme for cooling trapped ions with lasers was proposed by David J. Wineland and Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington .
The researchers predicted that an atom could be cooled if it is irradiated from two sides by laser light at a frequency slightly lower than the frequency needed for maximum absorption .
If the atom moves in a direction oppo- sing one of the light beams , the light , from the atom 's perspective , increases in frequency .
The light that has been shifted up in frequency is then likely to be absorbed by the atom .
The light that the atom absorbs exerts a scattering force that slows the atom down .
How does the atom interact with the light traveling in the same direction ?
The atom is less likely to absorb the light because the light , again from the atom 's perspective , has been shifted down in frequency .
The net effect of both of the beams is that a scattering force is generated , opposing the motion of the atom .
The beauty of this idea is that an atom mOving in the opposite direction will also experience a scattering force dragging it toward zero velocity .
By surrounding the atom with three sets of counterpropagating beams along three mutually perpendicular axes , the atom can be cooled in all three dimensions .
In 1985 Ashkin , Leo Hollberg , John E. Bjorkholm , Alex Cable and I at AT&T Bell Labs were able to cool sodium atoms to 240 millionths of a kelvin .
Because the light field acts as a viscous force , we dubbed the combination of laser beams used to create the drag force " optical molasses . "
Although not a trap , the atoms were confined in the viscous medium for periods as long as 0.5 second , until eventually they would leak out of the cooling beams .
Optical molasses enabled us to solve the three major problems that stood in the way of constructing a laser trap .
First , by cooling the atoms to extremely low temperatures , we could reduce the random thermal motions of the atoms , making them easy to trap .
Second , we could easily load the atoms into the trap .
Simply by focusing the trapping beam in the center of the optical molasses , atoms would be snagged as they randomly wandered into the trapping beam .
Third , by alternating between trapping and cooling light , we could reduce the heating effects of the trapping light .
A year after we had perfected optical molasses , atoms could finally be trapped with light .
Even with the loading technique used in our first trap , an optical trap with a larger capture volume was desirable .
A trap that could use the scattering force would need much less light intensity , which meant the constraints imposed by the Optical Earnshaw Theorem had to be circumvented .
The important clue of how to design such a trap came from David E. Pritchard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carl E. Wieman of the University of Colorado and their colleagues .
They pointed out that if magnetic or electric fields that varied over space were applied to atoms , the scattering force caused by the laser light would not necessarily be proportional to the light intensity .
This suggestion led Jean Dalibard of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris to propose a " magneto- optic " trap , which used a weak magnetic field and circularly polarized light .
In 1987 Pritchard 's group and my own at AT&T collaborated to construct such a trap .
Three years later Wieman 's team went on to show that this technique could be used to trap atoms in a glass cell , using inexpensive diode lasers .
Their method eliminated the precooling procedures needed in our first trapping experiments .
The fact that atoms could be trapped in a sealed cell also meant rare species of atoms , such as radioactive isotopes , could be optically manipulated .
The magneto - optic trap has become the most widely used optical trap today .
Meanwhile researchers were making rapid progress in laser cooling .
Phillips and his colleagues discovered that under certain conditions , optical molasses could be used to cool atoms to temperatures far below the lower limit predicted by the existing theory .
This discovery prompted Dalibard and Claude Cohen - Tannoudji of the College de France and the Ecole Normale and my group at Stanford to construct a new theory of laser cooling based on a complex but beautiful interplay between the atoms and their interaction with the light fields .
Currently atoms can be cooled to a temperature with an average velocity equal to three and a half photon recoils .
For cesium atoms , it means a temperature lower than three microkelvins .
Going beyond optical molasses , Cohen - Tannoudji , Alain Aspect , Ennio Arimondo , Robin Kaiser and Nathalie Vansteenkiste , then all at the Ecole Normale , invented an ingenious scheme capable of cooling helium atoms below the recoil velocity of a single scattered photon .
Helium atoms have been cooled to two microkelvins along one dimension , and work is under way to extend this technique to two and three dimensions .
This cooling method captures an atom in a well - defined velocity state in much the same way atoms were trapped in space in our first optical trap .
As the atom scatters photons , its velocity randomly changes .
The French experiment establishes conditions that allow an atom to recoil and land in a particular quantum state , which is a combination of two states with two distinct velocities close to zero .
Once in this state , the chance of scattering more photons is greatly reduced , meaning that additional photons cannot scatter and increase the velocity .
If the atom does not happen to land in this quantum state , it continues to scatter photons and has more opportunities to seek out the desired low - velocity state .
Thus , the atoms are cooled by letting them randomly walk into a " velocity trapped " quantum state .
Besides the cooling and trapping of atoms , investigators have demonstrated various atomic lenses , mirrors and diffraction gratings for manipulating atoms .
They have also fashioned devices that have no counterpart in light optics .
Researchers at Stanford and the University of Bonn have made " atomic funnels " that transform a collection of hot atoms into a well - controlled stream of cold atoms .
The Stanford group has also made an " atomic trampoline " in which atoms bounce off a sheet of light extending out from a glass surface .
With a curved glass surface , an atom trap based on gravity and light can be made .
Clearly , we have learned to push atoms around with amazing facility , but what do all these tricks enable us to do ?
With very cold atoms in vapor form , physicists are in a position to study how the atoms interact with one another at extremely low temperatures .
According to quantum theory , an atom behaves like a wave whose length is equal to Planck 's constant divided by the particle 's momentum .
As the atom is cooled , its momentum decreases , thereby increasing its wavelength .
At sl\fficiently low temperatures , the average wavelength becomes comparable to the average distance between the atoms .
At these low temperatures and high densities , quantum theory says that a significant fraction of all the atoms will condense into a single quantum ground state .
This unusual form of matter , called a Bose - Einstein condensation , has been predicted but never observed in a vapor of atoms .
Thomas ] .
Greytak and Daniel Kleppner of M.LT . and look T. M. Walraven of the University of Amsterdam are trying to achieve such a condensation with a collection of hydrogen atoms in a magnetic trap .
Meanwhile other groups are attempting the same feat in a laser - cooled sample of alkali atoms such as cesium or lithium .
Atom - manipulation techniques are also offering new opportunities in highresolution spectroscopy .
By combining several such techniques , the Stanford group has created a device that will allow the spectral features of atoms to be measured with exquisite accuracy .
We have devised an atomic fountain that launches ultra-cold atoms upward gently enough to have gravity turn them around .
Atoms for the fountain are collected by a magneto - optic trap for 0 . 5 second .
After that amount of time , about 10 million atoms are launched upward at a velocity of roughly two meters per second .
At the top of the trajectory , an atom is probed with two pulses of microwave radiation separated in time .
If the frequency of the radiation is properly tuned , the two pulses cause the atom to change from one quantum state to another .
( Norman Ramsey shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for inventing and applying this technique . )
In our first experiment we measured the energy difference between two states of an atom with a resolution of two parts in 100 billion .
How does the fountain make such precise measurements possible ?
First , the atoms fall freely and are easy to shield from any perturbation that might alter their energy levels .
Second , such measurements are limited in precision by the Heisenberg uncertainty prinCiple .
This principle states that the resolution of an energy measurement will be limited to Planck 's constant divided by the time of the " measurement . "
In our case , this time corresponds to the time between the two microwave pulses .
With an atomic fountain the measurement time for unperturbed atoms can be as long as one second , a period impossible with atoms at room temperature .
Because the atomic fountain allows extremely precise measurements of the energy levels of atoms , it may be possible to adapt the device to make an improved atomic clock .
At present , the world time standard is defined by the energy difference between two particular energy levels in ground states of the cesium atom .
Two years after the first atomic fountain , the group at the Ecole Normale used a fountain to measure the " clock transition " in the cesium atom with high precision .
These two experiments suggested that a properly engineered instrument might be able to measure the absolute frequency of this transition to one part in 10 ^ 16 , 1,000 times better than the accuracy of our best clocks .
Lured by this potential , more than eight groups around the world are now trying to improve the cesium time standard with an atomic fountain .
Another application being intensively studied is atom interferometry .
The first atom interferometers were built in 1991 by investigators at the University of Konstanz , M.LT. , the Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt and Stanford .
An atom interferometer splits an atom into two waves separated in space .
The two parts of the atom are then recombined and allowed to interfere with each other .
The simplest example of such a splitting occurs when the atom is made to go through two separated mechanical slits .
If the atom is recombined after passing through the slits , wavelike interference fringes can be observed .
The interference effects from atoms dramatically demonstrate the fact that their behavior needs both a wave and a particle description .
More important , atom interferometers offer the possibility of measuring physical phenomena with high sensitivity .
In the first demonstration of the potential sensitivity , Mark Kasevich and I have created an interferometer that uses slow atoms .
The atoms were split apart and recombined in a fountain .
With this instrument we have already shown that the acceleration of gravity can be measured with a resolution of at least three parts in 100 million , and we expect another 100 - fold improvement shortly .
Previously , the effects of gravity on an atom have been measured at a level of roughly one part in 100 .
In recent years the work on atom trapping has stimulated renewed interest in manipulating other neutral particles .
The basic principles of atom trapping can be applied to micron - size particles , such as polystyrene spheres .
The intense electric field at the center of a focused laser beam polarizes the particle , just as it would polarize an atom .
The particle , like an atom , will also absorb light of certain frequencies .
Glass , for example , strongly absorbs ultraviolet radiation .
But as long as the light is tuned below absorption frequency , the particle will be drawn into the region of highest laser intensity .
In 1986 Ashkin , Bjorkholm , ] .
B. Dziedzic and I showed that particles that range in size between 0.02 and 10 microns can be trapped in a single focused laser beam .
In 1970 Ashkin trapped micron - size latex spheres suspended in water in between two fo- cused , counterpropagating beams of light [ see " The Pressure of Laser Light , " by Arthur Ashkin ; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN , February 1972 ] .
But only much later was it realized that if a single beam is focused tightly enough , the dipole force would suffice to overcome the scattering force that pushes the particle in the direction that the laser beam is traveling .
The great advantage of using a single beam is that it can be used as an optical tweezers to manipulate small particles .
The optical tweezers can easily be integrated with a conventional microscope by introducing the laser light into the body of the scope and focusing it with the viewing objective .
A sample placed on an ordinary microscope slide can be viewed and manipulated at the same time by moving the focused laser beam .
One application of the optical tweezers , discovered by Dziedzic and Ashkin , has captured the imagination of biologists .
They found that the tweezers can handle live bacteria and other organisms without apparent damage .
The ability to trap live organisms without harm is surprising , considering that the typical laser intensity at the focal point of the optical tweezers is about 10 million watts per square centimeter .
It turns out that as long as the organism is very nearly transparent at the frequency of the trapping light , it can be cooled effectively by the surrounding water .
To be sure , if the laser intensity is too high , the creature can be " optocuted . "
Many applications have been found for the optical tweezers .
Ashkin showed that objects within a living cell can be manipulated without puncturing the cell wall .
Steven M. Block and his colleagues at the Rowland Institute in Cambridge , Mass. , and at Harvard University have studied the mechanical properties of bacterial flagella .
Michael W. Berns and his co-workers at the University of California at Irvine have manipulated chromosomes inside a cell nucleus .
Optical tweezers can be used to examine even smaller biological systems .
My colleagues Robert Simmons , Jeff Finer , James A. Spudich and I are applying the optical tweezers to study muscle contraction at the molecular level .
Related studies are being carried out by Block and also by Michael P. Sheetz of Duke University .
One of the goals of this work is to measure the force generated by a single myosin molecule pulling against an actin filament .
We are probing this " molecular motor " by attaching a polystyrene sphere to an actin filament and using the optical tweezers to grab onto the bead .
When the myosin head strokes against the actin filament , the motion is sensed by a photodiode at the viewing end of the microscope .
A feedback circuit then directs the optical tweezers to pull against the myosin in order to counteract any motion .
In this way , we have measured the strength of the myosin pull under tension .
On an even smaller scale , Spudich , Steve Kron , Elizabeth Sunderman , Steve Quake and I are manipulating a single DNA molecule by attaching polystyrene spheres to the ends of a strand of DNA and holding the spheres with two optical tweezers .
We can observe the molecule as we pull on it by staining the DNA vvith dye molecules , illuminating the dye with green light from an argon laser and detecting the fluorescence with a sensitive video camera .
In our first experiments we measured the elastic properties of DNA .
The two ends were pulled apart until the molecule was stretched out straight to its full length , and then one of the ends was released .
By studying how the molecule springs back , we can test basic theories of polymer physics far from the equilibrium state .
The tweezers can also be used to prepare a single molecule for other ex- periments .
By impaling the beads onto the microscope slide and increasing the laser power , we found that the bead can be " spot - welded " to the slide , leaving the DNA in a stretched state .
That technique might be useful in preparing long strands of DNA for examination with state - of - the - art microscopes .
Ultimately , we hope to use these manipulation abilities to examine the motion of enzymes along the DNA and to address questions related to gene expression and repair .
It has only been six years since workers have stopped atoms , captured them in optical molasses and made the first atom traps .
Optical traps , to paraphrase a popular advertising slogan , have enabled us to " reach out and touch " particles in powerful new ways .
We have shown that if we can " see " an atom or microscopic particle , we may be able to hold onto it regardless of intervening membranes .
It has been a personal joy to see how esoteric conjectures in atomic physics have blossomed : the techniques and applications of laser cooling and trapping have gone well beyond our dreams during those early days .
We now have important new tools for physics , chemistry and biology .
Renderings of a protective case for a device that resembles a smaller iPhone have been published online , rekindling speculation that Apple may be planning to introduce a new low - end handset sometime in the near future .
The images were published by iDealsChina , a publication with a mixed track record that includes accurate leaks of Griffin 's iPhone 3G casing design , but inaccurate reports on the design of the fourth - generation iPod nano and plans to include GPS in the second - generation iPod touch .
Its latest report claims the new casing design is for an iPhone nano that will be " targeted at the people who couldnât afford an iPhone " and sold at discount shops such as Wal - Mart .
Pictured to be both shorter ( the same height as the 4G iPod nano ) and fatter than the iPhone 3G , the handset would reportedly include the same sensors and camera , but feature a smaller touchscreen and lack 3G connectivity .
Naturally , iDealsChina predicts that Apple will formally introduce the device early next month at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco , adding that manufacturing of the handsets will begin on Saturday , December 20th at a daily run rate of 60,000 to 80,000 units .
The publication appears high in its convictions and goes on to say that Apple may also announce a new version of the iPod shuffle at the conference .
It encourages visitors to return to its website around the 20th , when it expects that actual photos of the new iPhone and iPod shuffle will be leaked .
Given its mixed track record and a lack of other reports making similar predictions , readers may want to treat the claims from iDealsChina with a degree of skepticism .
There are also some uncertainties regarding the affect a smaller iPhone screen would have on a device 's ability to run the wealth of existing iPhone applications .
Speaking during a recent conference call , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said his company 's strategy has been to treat the iPhone as a software platform based on " > a consistent hardware design that does not complicate matters for developers .
" I think that the traditional game in the phone market has been to produce a voice phone in a hundred different varieties , " he said .
" But as software starts to become the differentiating technology of this product category , I think that people are going to find that a hundred variations presented to a software developer is not very enticing . "
Jobs was responding to a questions about why Apple has n't broadened its iPhone line to include more than one model design and what other opportunities he may see within the market .
" I was n't alive then , but from everything I 've heard , Babe Ruth only had one home run , " he quipped .
" He just kept hitting it over and over again . "

A group of armed Islamist militants is reportedly headed to a Somali port Friday to attack pirates holding hostage a massive Saudi Arabian oil tanker .
Ships belonging to Muslim countries should not be seized , Abdelghafar Musa , a fighter with the Islamist group al - Shabab , told the Associated Press .
This undated picture taken at an unknown location shows the Saudi oil supertanker MV Sirius Star , which has been hijacked by Somali pirates .
(( Christian Duys / Associated Press ) )
" We are really sorry to hear that the Saudi ship has been held in Somalia .
We will fight [ the pirates ] , " Musa , who claims to speak on behalf of all Islamic fighters in the Horn of Africa nation , told the Associated Press Television News .
Somali pirates captured the Sirius Star last weekend about 450 nautical miles southeast of Kenya 's Mombasa port .
It 's believed to be anchored in the port of Haradheere , about midway up Somalia 's coastline .
Islamist fighters also reportedly arrived at the Somali port of Haradheere seeking information on the Sirius Star , said a local elder .
" The Islamists arrived searching for the pirates and the whereabouts of the Saudi ship , " said the elder , who declined to be named .
" I saw four cars full of Islamists driving in the town from corner to corner .
The Islamists say they will attack the pirates for hijacking a Muslim ship . "
Islamist leaders , fighting a two - year insurgency against the government and its Ethiopian military allies , deny allegations they collude with pirates and insist they will stamp down on them if they win power .
Islamists in control of southern Somalia
Somalia has not had a functioning government since 1991 .
When an umbrella Islamic group , which included the al - Shabab , controlled most of southern Somalia for six months in 2006 , there were few reports of piracy .
That umbrella group has now split , but Islamist groups have taken control of large portions of southern Somalia in recent weeks , and al - Shanab reputedly holds the largest share .
The United States views al - Shabab as a terrorist organization with ties to al - Qaeda militants who were allegedly behind the 1998 bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that left over 230 dead .
Some analysts , however , say Islamist militants are benefiting from the spoils of piracy and arms shipments facilitated by the sea gangs .
The supertanker , which is roughly 330 metres long and three times the mass of a U.S. aircraft carrier , is carrying $ 100 million US worth of oil .
The ship — itself worth about $ 100 million — has a crew of 25 people from the Philippines , Saudi Arabia , Croatia , Poland and Britain .
The pirates have asked for $ 25 million in ransom , according to unconfirmed reports .
Pirates holding 330 hostages
Cmdr . Jane Campbell , with the U.S. Navy 's 5th fleet in Bahrain , said hijacked ships are docked in four or five ports along Somalia 's coastline .
Roughly 330 merchant mariners from 25 different countries are being held hostage , she said .
The Gulf of Aden , off the coast of Somalia , has become a hot spot for pirate attacks .
( ( CBC ) )
Pirates have conducted attacks in a nautical area covering 2.8 million square kilometres , she said .
While the high - profile hijacking of the Sirius Star has thrust the issue into the spotlight , Campbell insists the success rate for pirates in the region is dropping .
In August , sea pirates had a 53 per cent success rate , she said .
That same month , the military started advising shipping companies on simple ways to prevent piracy , including how to train lookouts and quickly alter their course .
That , along with an increased military presence in the Gulf of Aden , resulted in October 's success rate dropping to 31 per cent , she said .
Campbell said the problem of sea piracy must be dealt with on land through diplomatic , economic or military means .
" Piracy is not something that will be ended on the high seas , " she said .
UN votes for sanctions
Countries have taken action to clamp down on the attacks .
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Thursday to impose sanctions on anyone engaging in or contributing to violence in the country .
Sanctions against an accused party would include the freezing of assets and a travel ban , although the 15 - member council did not define which individuals or entities would be affected .
That is expected to be decided later by a sanctions committee .
The British - drafted resolution also targets anyone obstructing delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia , where hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes .
The African Union is pressing the UN to speed up sending peacekeepers to Somalia , and one of the world 's largest shipping companies has announced it will send some of its 50 oil tankers around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa rather than navigate the Gulf of Aden .
Other shipping companies , including Norway 's Frontline Ltd. , which transports much of the Middle East 's oil to areas around the world , were considering similar moves .
Roughly 11 per cent of the world 's seaborne petroleum passes through the Gulf of Aden , where NATO , the United States , Russia , India and several other countries have warships patrolling on anti-piracy missions .
Reports from India Friday suggested the Indian navy may further increase its presence in the Gulf .
Earlier this week , an Indian warship , the INS Tabar , sank a suspected pirate " mother ship " in the Gulf and chased two attack boats .
One day after an F / A - 18D Hornet fighter jet fell from the sky and crashed into his two - story house in San Diego ’s University City neighborhood , Dong Yun Yoon returned to a home and life in ruins .
Rescue workers sifting through the debris on Cather Avenue had found the bodies of his wife , two baby daughters and mother - in - law .
Yoon , 37 , pressed a handkerchief to his face and seemed to stagger upon viewing what little remained : a charred garage wall , piles of blackened beams , the family ’s Toyota Corolla -- miraculously undamaged -- parked on the street , and flowers placed nearby in memory of his family .
“ I believe my wife and two babies and mother - in - law are in heaven with God , ” Yoon said at a news conference afterward .
“ Nobody expected such a horrible thing to happen , especially right here , our house . ”

Yoon said he bore no ill will toward the Marine Corps pilot who ejected safely before the jet plunged into the neighborhood two miles west of the runway at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar .
“ I pray for him not to suffer for this action , ” Yoon said .
“ I know he ’s one of our treasures for our country . ”
The plane was on a training flight when it crashed into the residential neighborhood Monday , setting several houses aflame .
The bodies of Yoon ’s wife , Young Mi , 37 ; his nearly 2 - month - old daughter , Rachel ; and mother - in - law , Suk Im Kim , 60 , were found Monday .
The body of his 15 - month - old daughter , Grace , was recovered Tuesday .

Rescue crews had to dig through the wreckage of the second floor -- which collapsed onto the first floor -- with hand tools to uncover her body , which was found near the first - floor entrance , said Maurice Luque , a spokesman for the San Diego Fire - Rescue Department .
The Yoons , immigrants from South Korea , had moved into the neighborhood just a few weeks ago and tried to make friends in their own quiet ways , neighbors said .
Young Mi Yoon was often seen gardening , and her mother pushed her granddaughter ’s stroller around the area , chatting up neighbors in her broken English .
“ They waved at us all the time , ” said neighbor Robert Johnson .
“ They were just nice people . ”

Dong Yun Yoon , a store manager at a retail business near the San Diego - Tijuana border , was a naturalized U.S. citizen who emigrated in 1989 .
His wife , who emigrated four years ago , had just earned her nursing degree and was planning to go back to work , said the Rev. Daniel Shin , associate pastor of the Korean United Methodist Church of San Diego , which the family attended .
He said Young ’s mother had joined the family recently to help care for the newborn girl .
“ They were at church last Sunday , ” Shin said .
“ Everybody was looking at the baby and how cute she was . ”

Residents , some of whom were prevented from returning to their homes because of the ongoing investigation and potentially toxic fumes still lingering in the wreckage , reacted with a mix of relief and sadness -- lucky to be alive but grieving for their neighbor ’s loss .
The plane narrowly missed several homes and light winds prevented the flames from spreading quickly .
Two houses were destroyed , and four sustained damage , Luque said , correcting an earlier report of three destroyed homes .
“ It ’s just providence , ” said Johnson , who was at home with his daughter and grandchild when the fighter plane crashed two houses away , sending them fleeing out their back door .
“ Thirty feet higher and the plane lands in our living room instead of theirs . ”
Neighbor Alain Blanc , a photographer who lives one house away , watched from his balcony as workers carefully sifted through the ashes .

“ In the midst of great sadness , my only comfort is those who perished never knew what happened , ” he said .
“ They did n’t have time to suffer . ”
Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - Alpine ) , the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , said the initial investigation pointed to engine failure and found no link to the structural problems that caused the F/ A fleet at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to be grounded briefly in October .
Hunter said he has asked the Marine Corps for a report on the plane ’s maintenance history to be included in the investigation .
He said it is the first crash of an F / A - 18D Hornet since the Marines took over the air station from the Navy .
Marine Corps officials disclosed Tuesday that the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln was stationed 50 miles off the coast of San Diego when the pilot departed from it on his ill - fated flight .
“ Initial indications suggest that engine failure may have played a role , though we will not know for certain until an investigation is concluded , ” Marine Corps officials said in a statement .
Advertisement
They also said the pilot was told to make an emergency “ arrested landing ” at Miramar when his equipment failure became apparent .
An arrested landing would have involved using a tail - hook device that catches the back of the plane when it touches down , much like the method used when a jet lands on an aircraft carrier .
The neighborhood is accustomed to the sound and sight of military planes at low altitude .
During
Yoon ’s news conference , several planes roared overhead , drowning out his voice .
Craig Meader said he and his neighbors , in effect , have front - row seats to the air station ’s annual air show .
“ The Blue Angels use our street to come in to Miramar , ” he said .
“ We get up on the roof and wave at the pilots . ”
Still , the thoughts of potential danger would linger , Meader said .
“ All these years living here , the big joke was that one of these days a jet could go down , ” he said .

Part 3
At the Brink
Narrator : 2 AM , September 26 , 1918 .
Already the Great War was by far the most destructive conflict in human history .
Nine million soldiers were dead , and six million civilians .
President Woodrow Wilson had committed his country to this struggle in the belief that the United States could lead the world to a better future .
But if Wilson was to shape the peace , American troops would have to play a decisive role in winning the war .
Jay Winter , Historian :
The fundamental point is how do you get into a position of dominance at the peace treaty ?
And the answer is through the barrel of a gun .
Narrator : Eighteen months after Wilson had taken his country to war , the United States was finally ready to unleash its full might .
The biggest army in American history stood silent and ready along a twenty - mile section of the Western Front known as the Meuse - Argonne .
Suddenly , the sky overhead seemed to explode , as thousands of artillery pieces opened up at once .
The men had never seen anything like it .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer : The U.S. artillery alone fired more shells , more weight of fire power into the German lines in that first four hours than the entire Union army had fired during the entire Civil War .
Narrator :
Three hours later , the bombardment lifted .
Hundreds of thousands of American soldiers clambered up the sides of their trenches and stumbled forward into the milky fog .
They carried with them President Wilson ’s dream of a bright and peaceful future .
The Voice of Hope
Jay Winter , Historian : Imagine yourself in 1918 .
You wish something good will come out of this nightmare .
Something , anything .
There is nobody in the world saying “ there will be a dawn , we can find a peace that can survive , that we can say that perhaps some of these men died for the future . ”
And the only person who stood up and said something was Wilson .
He took it on his own shoulders , a prophetic stance , a bit like Jeremiah .
You know , “ One day we shall see the light of dawn and peace striking our noble countryside . ”
It was bound to appeal to people who were looking for some degree of comfort in a world that had effectively gone mad .
Narrator : Woodrow Wilson had captured the world ’s imagination in January with his Fourteen Points : a set of proposals that amounted to a framework for an age of peace .
It had n’t ended the war , but it had provided hope to people everywhere .
The Fourteen Points were Wilson ’s creation , but it was George Creel and his Committee on Public Information who had proclaimed it to the world .
The CPI had been created to shape public opinion of the war at home and abroad .
It did such thorough work that German soldiers advancing into Russian towns found walls plastered with Wilson ’s Fourteen Points , in German , as well as Russian .
Thanks to the CPI , Wilson had become a savior to friend and foe alike .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian :
The claims of the warring European powers just sounded hollow and bankrupt .
And soldiers in the trenches and citizens of other countries had stopped listening to them , stopped believing them .
And Wilson is able to speak with a fresh voice .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
That was ultimately the reason I think Woodrow Wilson got America into the war .
If the world would buy his peace plan , then indeed we may have fought the war to end all wars .
Narrator : On September 27 , the day after the beginning of the American offensive in France , Wilson was in New York City to deliver a speech at the Metropolitan Opera House .
He had n’t spoken publicly about the war in months .
As Wilson walked onstage someone hailed him as “ the greatest president the country ever had , ” and the audience erupted in wild cheering .
When the house finally quieted down , Wilson spoke about the meaning of the war .
Like people all over the world , he believed that a tragedy of this scale could be justified only by a revolution in world affairs .
“ Common people have demanded , ” Wilson announced , “ that their governments declare what they are seeking in this war .
Their leaders respond only in statesmen ’s terms – in terms of territorial arrangements and divisions of power , and not in terms of justice and mercy and peace . ”
More and more , Wilson was taking on the role of spokesman for the common people of the world .
“ This is a people 's war , ” he warned .
“ Statesmen must follow or be broken . ”
Michael Kazin , Historian : Wilson in a sense wanted to be president of the world .
He had a near - Messianic view of his role in history .
He believed that in effect he was doing God ’s work .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
There was a kind of arrogance to Woodrow Wilson , there ’s no question about that .
It verges on his feeling he was in the confidence of God I think .
Jay Winter , Historian : Moral authority is a dangerous position to maintain .
It gives the aura of sanctity to the cause of war , and any sanctification of war is bound to redound on the head of the man or woman who proclaims it .
Lost
Voice : Ralph John :
With a parting word of warning from an officer to each man , up and over the top we went .
It was an odd feeling .
It did n't seem like fear , nor even dread , but just wonderment .
Narrator : Just five months before he jumped off with the first wave of the Meuse - Argonne offensive , Private Ralph John had been working on his family ’s farm in McIntosh , South Dakota .
His training consisted of two days ’ practice with a rifle and a short stint driving a bayonet into a mannequin .
Then he was shipped out , handed a gas mask , and sent into battle .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer : Ralph John was barely trained .
But he was a little more adept at handling a weapon because he had spent considerable time in the forests of South Dakota so he was a little bit better off than some of the men were .
Some of the men came to the front without complete uniforms , others showed up without rifles .
A sergeant asked , “ Where ’s your rifles , did you lose them ? ” and they said , “ No we were never given any . ” and he said , “ Go over anyway and pick up the first one that you see . ”
Narrator : “ A thick white fog seemed to close in from all sides , ” one of John ’s comrades recalled , “ isolating our company entirely , and nullifying all the careful instructions about keeping in touch . ”
When they entered the woods on the other side of No Man ’s Land , everything was strangely silent .
Deeper into the Argonne Forest , though , the casualties began to mount .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer : The Argonne Forest is a dense tangle .
There are ridges and valleys all through it .
A step on solid ground will be followed by a step where you ’re sinking into your knees in slop .
In some places it ’s impossible to see more than 10 feet in any direction .
It ’s almost impenetrable .
There were machine gun positions everywhere , trenches everywhere , there were sniper nests all over the place , there was barbed wire every step of the way .
Voice : Ralph John :
We were crawling , searching for machine gun nests and routing them out .
I did n't think anything of stepping over dead bodies of men with whom I had started out , or wading through a pool of blood .
I can just see them drop , and hear their requests for help .
But we had to go on and leave them lay .
Narrator :
The one reed that Private John could cling to in this hellish forest was his commanding officer .
Major Charles
Whittlesey was earning the undying respect of his men as they somehow made their objectives , day after day .
But in a week of fighting , the major had lost over half the men in his command .
The survivors were famished , exhausted … and they had lost touch with the units on each flank .
Richard Slotkin , Historian :
The problem in the Argonne Forest is no unit could maintain contact with the units on its flanks because the woods are just too thick and at this point , the units are so shrunk by casualties that they can’t cover as much front as they did at the start .
Narrator : Every step forward was taking them farther from the rest of the army .
When Major Whittlesey pointed out the danger to his senior officer on the 2nd of October , the response bordered on a reprimand : he was to continue pushing forward " without regard to flanks or losses . "
Richard Slotkin , Historian :
Do n’t worry about your flanks means if you get surrounded , tough .
And the other part is no retreat .
The American army has to prove its morale , and if you retreat , you discredit the army .
Narrator : " All right , I 'll attack , " Whittlesey replied , " but whether you 'll hear from me again I do n't know . "
Voice : Ralph John :
We had orders to advance straight north , but we run into fierce machine gun fire in thick woods .
Major Whittlesey commanded us to dig in for the night .
Early the next morning he sent men back to get orders , but they quickly returned saying they could n't get through .
We knew then that we were entirely cut off from all support , surrounded by the Germans .
There were something over five hundred men , who would become known as the Lost Battalion .
Pershing Under Siege
Narrator : The Meuse - Argonne offensive was the culminating event of General John Pershing ’s life .
The map on the wall of his headquarters traced the boundaries of his world .
The commander - in - chief of the American Expeditionary Forces marked the slightest change in the front lines and could reel off the position of every division .
Pershing was worried : the advance had fallen far behind schedule .
The general left his headquarters near the city of Verdun and ordered his driver to take him to one of the command posts near the front lines .
Within minutes his car was jammed in a landscape of horses , vehicles , artillery , and troops .
This was the lifeblood of Pershing ’s army , and it had slowed almost to a stop .
If the German planes got through , they could cut the supply lines entirely .
Pershing faced the deepest crisis of his war .
Andrew Carroll , Writer : Pershing was n’t one for showing emotion .
And he knew how a commander ’s presence affected the men , he told his other generals , do n’t ever let your troops see you look disheartened or beaten because it ’ll permeate through the entire army .
So he always had to have this façade of strength .
Narrator : When President Wilson appointed Pershing to lead the American Expeditionary Forces , he had given him one assignment : the AEF must claim a prominent role in winning the war , so that the United States could shape the peace and the postwar world .
Every aspect of national life had been turned to building an Army that could beat the Germans .
By the fall of 1918 Pershing believed the AEF was finally ready to fight a major offensive on its own .
He chose the sector between the Meuse River and the Argonne forest for his showpiece battle because it offered the best chance of ending the war in one blow .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
The master plan for Meuse Argonne offensive was to push forward and cut the main rail link between Germany and northern France — the main supply route .
It was part of a larger offensive that everybody was involved in , to drive the Germans out once and for all .
Richard Rubin , Writer : The Germans took Meuse - Argonne in 1914 and the French tried to take it back in ’ 14 and ’ 15 and ’ 16 and ’ 17 , but the defenses in the Argonne were seen at that point as insurmountable .
Narrator : Pershing ’s plan called for his troops to cut through the German defenses in just three days .
Instead of sitting in their trenches like European soldiers , Pershing believed his doughboys would sweep across the battlefield , overwhelming the enemy .
In doing so they would avoid the horrendous casualties that Britain and France had suffered .
Dan Carlin , Podcast Producer : Pershing ’s attitude is like they ’re all doing it wrong .
You know I mean with American riflemen and can - do and our history we ’re going to go in there and we ’re just going to show the Europeans how it ’s done .
Narrator :
From the moment the doughboys went over the top , nothing went according to plan .
As Pershing could see , his own supply lines had seized up .
Casualties were soaring .
With every passing hour the Germans were bringing up more reinforcements .
Soon Pershing ’s army would be locked in a war of attrition .
It was exactly the outcome he had sworn to avoid .
Richard Slotkin , Historian : Pershing believed that American riflemen would go in with their mobile tactics , swarming around pillboxes , knocking them out , moving on to the next line of entrenchments and they could n’t get through the first line .
Dan Carlin , Podcast Producer : U.S. troops were audacious and brave — reckless some Germans called them — because they ran right into machine gun fire and they assaulted things head on often .
The kind of casualties we suffered were unprecedented in U.S. history .
Narrator :
By the time Pershing reached his forward command post his famous temper was well lost .
Every commander was put on notice : any one who did not measure up would be relieved .
“ When men run away in front of the enemy , ” Pershing ordered , “ officers should stop them , to the point of shooting men down . ”
There could be no hesitation , no weakness .
Dan Carlin , Podcast Producer : Americans had to accustom themselves to the reality that it did n’t matter how great the American rifleman was , there was n’t going to be any quick victory .
Jay Winter , Historian :
The kind of warfare on the western front that the United States thought that it was going to fight , it did n’t find .
It was the same war , the same bloodbath .
Walter Reed
Narrator :
As the American offensive raged in France , civilians on the home front were coming to grips with an equally deadly enemy : influenza .
Washington DC suffered so many fatal cases that the authorities closed the public schools .
Saloons , churches , and theaters were shut down ; public gatherings were prohibited .
For Lillian Aubert , there was no avoiding the disease – she was an Army nurse at Walter Reed military hospital .
Aubert had moved to Washington five months earlier .
Back then the wartime bustle had been thrilling .
Young women had crowded three to a bed in rooming houses and paid 25 cents to bathe at the Central High School pool .
Military policemen with rifles and bayonets guarded the gates of the White House .
Soldiers kept watch over the Potomac rail bridges and bunked in tents along the riverbank .
Soon after Aubert began her work at Walter Reed , wounded soldiers began arriving from France .
“ Never think of these men as men to be pitied , ” the nurses were told .
“ These are men to be proud of , to be envied . ”
The weapons that had transformed warfare also produced new types of casualties .
Artillery caused 70 % of the deaths in the Great War , often simply disintegrating a human being .
More commonly , splinters of steel would spin off at low velocity , creating jagged wounds that were prone to infection .
Amputation was the all - too - common result .
At Walter Reed , ninety percent of the amputees needed re-amputation , cutting off the remnants of limbs that had become infected .
Aubert nursed these men as they began once more the long nightmare of convalescence .
Many would undergo it three , four , five times .
Artillery damaged even the men it did n’t maim : fully one fifth of frontline hospital admissions were victims of a terrifying phenomenon called shell shock .
Richard Rubin , Writer : Artillery was always a matter of terror for the men in the trenches .
There was absolutely nothing you could do to protect yourself .
You had shelters that you could go into , but you did n’t know if they would hold up or not .
And you did n’t know what you were facing until the shells started coming in and going off .
You did n’t know if it was going to blow up on impact or if it was going to explode over your head .
You did n’t know if it had shrapnel in it , you did n’t know if it had gas in it .
This was something that soldiers had never faced to that extent before .
Narrator : Poison gas had been introduced by the Germans in 1915 , but the Allies quickly caught on , and by 1918 it was everywhere .
Gas was was rarely fatal , but it produced horrible wounds .
Almost a third of the men in American hospitals were gas victims , and their condition was terrifying .
Edward A. Gutiérrez , Historian : Mustard gas is the most frightening chemical agent in World War I .
It actually will damage the lungs , it ’ll burn the eyes .
Any exposed skin will burn .
The most frightening thing about mustard gas is that it can settle into the ground and last for weeks , in the leaves , in the grass .
And the doughboys would just run across , not even knowing that there was gas in the area and they ’d release the gas again .
And that gas was just as toxic and just as effective .
Narrator : Even as Lillian dealt with the flood of wounded men , she began hearing talk of an epidemic that was wreaking havoc on the American Army in France .
Nancy K. Bristow , Historian :
The influenza virus of 1918 was an H1N1 virus with the capacity to infect and to kill that was unprecedented in modern times .
There ’s no preexisting immunity to the disease .
It ’s also one that ’s able to move human to human very quickly .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian :
The flu hit the United States and the world at a particularly vulnerable time ; when people were displaced , when they were hungry .
And the war accelerated the spread of the virus in part by cramming all these soldiers into troop ships and then bringing them back and forth from Europe to America .
Narrator :
In September 1918 , 40,000 soldiers were admitted to Army hospitals overseas with the flu .
Then the disease started cropping up on the home front .
Authorities told the public to avoid wearing tight shoes , tight clothing or tight gloves , to chew their food well and drink water .
Swindlers made small fortunes with potions and patent medicines .
But nothing stemmed the tide of death .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian :
This was a national catastrophe .
And the president does n’t say one thing about it .
And part of his reasoning for that was not to create panic .
But the other part was that if you start thinking too much about the flu , you ’re not thinking about the war .
Because really containing the influenza epidemic means shutting down factories , shutting down war bond drives , shutting down mobilization .
None of that can happen .
In the context of the First World War , this is just another tragedy that must be endured .
Narrator : When Lillian Aubert was assigned to the influenza ward at Walter Reed , the job was as dangerous as any on the front lines .
The first flu victim was admitted in mid-September ; soon the ward filled to overflowing .
Her patients lived , on average , just twelve days .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian : People could be perfectly healthy in the morning , start running a fever , their lungs would fill up with fluid .
And by nightfall be dead .
And there was just nothing they could do .
This is an era before antibiotics .
People do n’t understand how the flu is being transmitted .
Nancy K. Bristow , Historian :
You ’re literally drowning in your own bodily fluids in some cases , so you ’re extremities are turning purple .
Your face is turning purple .
You may have blood draining from your ears or your nose .
It was devastating .
Narrator :
By the 2nd of October the epidemic was running wild .
Coffins piled up in cemeteries ; some victims lay where they died .
That was the day Lillian developed a fever .
Her suffering was mercifully short .
Five months after she had arrived in Washington , Lillian Aubert found her final resting place at Arlington National Cemetery .
Leroy Johnston
Narrator :
It had been a long journey from the Mississippi delta to a field hospital in France .
In November 1917 Leroy Johnston had made his way from Philips County Arkansas to New York City , to join the fabled New York 15th , known as the Harlem Hellfighters .
He was drawn to a cause every bit as captivating as world peace .
Adriane Lentz - Smith , Historian :
Young black men had been given reason to hope that some good would come of the war .
The language of the war itself , the framing of it as a war for democracy already makes it a powerful and meaningful moment in the history of African Americans .
There ’s also the example of the Civil War not long before , which was a very different war , but it ’s a war that African - American involvement and African - American agitation had turned into a war literally for freedom .
Narrator : Johnston had been with the Hellfighters throughout their incredible odyssey .
They had spent 191 days under fire and suffered more casualties than any other American regiment : 1,300 of the original 2,000 men had died or been wounded .
The regiment had been shattered in the opening days of the Meuse - Argonne offensive .
Richard Slotkin , Historian :
At one point they ’re cut off .
They ’re way ahead of their supports .
They lose roughly two - thirds of their combat strength .
They just have not got the numbers any more to get anywhere .
They ca n’t even cover the German line in front of them .
Jeffrey Sammons , Historian :
They ’re basically shredded .
They ’re no longer able to fight as an offensive unit .
They ’re , you know , reduced beyond the level that they can be an effective fighting force .
Narrator : The Hellfighters were finally relieved on the 1st of October , but not before Johnston was severely wounded .
He survived long enough to reach an aid station .
Now , for the first time since he had landed in France , Leroy Johnston knew that he would make it back to Arkansas someday .
But he could n’t know what he would find there : the war had changed him ; changed everything .
Chad Williams , Historian :
The experience of traveling to France for a black southerner from a rural town was completely mind - boggling .
The French were not free of racism by any stretch of the imagination , but in comparison to how African - American soldiers were treated by white American troops , it really highlighted how bad American racism was .
Richard Slotkin , Historian :
One of the major themes in the black press had been from the start the notion that the black soldier ’s going to prove the race ’s manhood in war .
And when we come back from war , we ’re going to prove it here , in the United States .
Adriane Lentz - Smith , Historian :
There ’s that great editorial by W.E.B. Du Bois in The Crisis , where he says , “ Make way for democracy , we saved it in France and by the great Jehovah , we will save it in the U.S. or know the reason why . ”
The War Comes Home
Narrator :
As far as the newspapers were concerned , the American offensive was going splendidly .
Much of their reporting was provided directly by the Committee on Public Information .
The head of the organization , George Creel , estimated that 20,000 newspaper columns a week were drawn from CPI releases .
Alan Axelrod , Writer : Woodrow Wilson , the great democrat , wanted strict censorship .
Creel said that this would be a great mistake .
What we have to do instead is supply all of the news .
Everything anybody hears about the war has to come through the Committee on Public Information .
Creel ’s argument is that “ I ’m giving you all the facts and you are free to reach whatever conclusions you will . ”
But in fact these were very carefully edited facts .
Narrator : Creel could n’t hide the war ’s cost : casualty lists began filling whole pages in the newspaper , day after day .
As the losses mounted , the CPI redoubled its efforts to enlist civilians in the war effort .
In the fall of 1918 the CPI put on a traveling War Exposition .
It was an attempt to bring the war home , emphasizing the sacrifices that soldiers were making for their countrymen .
In Chicago , two million visitors lined up to see artifacts ranging from Zeppelin wreckage to an Iron Cross Nail Brush .
The highlight was a staged reenactment of trench warfare , complete with a working tank .
The truly dedicated could visit the Army Mess Kitchen , where , it was promised , “ Meals are served in the same manner , and using the same ‘ grub ’ as is the fare of the ‘ doughboys ’ in France . ”
“ Do your part to win the war ” was the theme of the Exposition , and George Creel was doing his best to make it the theme of American life .
Alan Axelrod , Writer : Creel was a genuine idealist .
He wanted the war to be a war of ideas , of ideology .
He did not like the idea of “ we must kill the Hun , ” he did not like the idea of “ if you are disloyal you should be killed . ”
He thought we should all get along as Americans and do what we can to win the war because that was the right thing to do .
Narrator :
But whether Creel liked it or not , there was a darker side to the running of the war .
For anyone who did n’t get in line , there could be serious consequences .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian :
There was a sense that you were being watched .
But it was n’t always clear who was watching you .
You never knew if some magazine that you had subscribed to was suddenly going to get you in trouble .
You never knew if you sang a German song that your father or grandfather had sung before that suddenly you were going to end up prosecuted .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian :
You see a rash of vigilantism aimed at making sure that anybody who might have any objection to the war does not express it .
And it ’s not now just a matter of being quiet , just do n’t say that I ’m against the war , but actively demonstrate support .
Narrator : A host of organizations made sure that every American was doing his or her patriotic duty .
The American Protective League boasted a quarter of a million members across the country .
The Justice Department gave the APL semi-official status by supplying it with armbands and badges .
League men embarked on illegal searches and seizures , detained and arrested men without charges , intimidated allegedly disloyal Americans , and broke up strikes .
In the fall of 1918 , they unleashed a series of so - called “ slacker raids ” in cities across the country .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian :
They organize “ slacker raids , ” with the idea of rounding up men who are evading the draft .
They fan out across these cities , they go into nickelodeons , they go into movie theaters , they wait at the exits of fairs to catch people when they ’re walking home , onto city buses , beaches , pulling in any guy that ’s not carrying his draft card .
These vigilante groups are wandering around just assaulting civilians .
Narrator : One September morning , 20,000 agents surrounded the entrances to every subway , train , and ferry station in New York , then launched hundreds of raids across the city .
Over three days , almost half a million men were interrogated , and 60,000 detained .
It was the largest police action in the country ’s history .
The New York raid netted just 199 draft dodgers .
Yet President Wilson was satisfied , commenting that the raids would “ put the fear of God ” into any potential shirkers .
Michael Kazin , Historian : Wilson believes that once he ’s made a decision , Americans should understand it and go along with it .
And if you oppose him , you are committing in effect , treason .
So he ’s both the great democrat and one of the most repressive figures in American history .
A. Scott Berg , Writer : Wilson ’s answer to all of this was just put the lid on it .
And maybe tighten that lid too .
We have one objective right now ; that is to fight this war and win it .
Rickenbacker
Christopher Capozzola , Historian :
The military figures that Americans get to know during the war are carefully selected by the Committee on Public Information .
They actually try to censor the information about most soldiers and remove their names from most news accounts , so when a name is picked out of the hat to be shared with the American public it ’s because that ’s a story that they think Americans will latch on to .
Eddie Rickenbacker is absolutely a case in point .
He is one of the most all - American heroes of the war .
Narrator : Eddie Rickenbacker had been fighting the odds his whole life .
His father died young , so Eddie had to drop out of school in the seventh grade and help feed the family .
After working at a foundry , a brewery , a shoe factory and a monument works , he wound up at the Columbus Buggy Company , where he fell in love with their latest product : automobiles .
John F. Ross , Writer : Rickenbacker found himself at a moment in American history when cars were going fast enough to race .
And automobile makers wanted cars to race so that they could sell them .
And here is this kid with not much to lose and everything to gain .
Narrator :
By the time war broke out Rickenbacker was a celebrity : he ’d raced in the Indianapolis 500 four times , and ranked third nationally .
But he also had an accent and a German name .
Thomas A. Hoff , Writer : Even though he ’s born in the United States , he grew up in a family speaking a combination of German and English , and he grows up with a bit of an accent .
And in fact when war breaks out there was a news story about him that he was actually the son of a German baron and he had been disgraced and sent to America to prove himself .
And so he was actually von Rickenbacker .
Narrator :
As anti-German hysteria swept the United States , the twenty - seven - year - old arranged a meeting at the War Department , determined to prove his loyalty .
John F. Ross , Writer :
He figures that all his buddies on the racing circuit , should be the guys who are going to be pilots of these new airplanes .
So he marches into Washington , DC , and he says , I got a plan for you .
And they listened to the way he spoke .
He mangled his English .
And they laughed at him .
They basically told him to get out of there .
Narrator : Rickenbacker would n’t quit .
He went to France as a driver with General Pershing ’s delegation a few weeks after America entered the war .
Through sheer perseverance he qualified as a pilot and was assigned to a fighter squadron in the spring of 1918 .
It was a dubious prize : the life expectancy of a new combat pilot was twenty days .
But the same combination of recklessness and calculation that had marked his career on the racetrack served him well in the air .
He downed his first German airplane on April 27th , and never looked back .
As Rickenbacker ’s score mounted the public fell in love with him .
John F. Ross , Writer :
These aviators really invented a new icon of American manhood .
Ultimately the old stereotypes , of cavalry leaders and charges and lumberjacks and cowboys gave way to the modern era .
And what was that ?
Well it was a pilot with his silk scarf and his goggles .
You see the beginnings of the Right Stuff right there , American manhood redefined .
Narrator : A working - class hero was a reflection of the changing nature of the air war .
Where early pilots had reveled in the image of the gallant , chivalrous airman , Rickenbacker had seen too many friends go down in flames to romanticize combat flying .
He called it “ scientific murder , ” and was constantly refining methods to make it more scientific , and more murderous .
“ Most of the pilots he killed , never knew what hit them , ” a fellow airman recalled .
“ Out of the sun , a quick burst and gone . ”
Thomas A. Hoff , Writer :
What makes him a great fighter pilot is his understanding that there was a science to flying .
And maybe it was because he was a little older , maybe it was because he had faced death a few times , he had a different perspective .
He understood the limits of his aircraft and he was going to use it as the tool it was designed to be .
Narrator : Although the papers tracked the leading pilots ’ scores like a sports rivalry , the day of the solo air ace was over ; the era of the air force had arrived .
When America declared war its air force consisted of fifty - five airplanes , fifty - one of which were obsolete .
By the fall of 1918 the United States Air Service comprised 740 front - line aircraft and 200,000 men .
Operations were carried out by ever - larger formations , coordinated with movements on the ground .
Rickenbacker ’s scientific approach to combat flying was perfectly suited to this new air war ; he was promoted to squadron leader ahead of more senior pilots on the eve of the Meuse - Argonne offensive .
“ The squadron began to love him , ” another pilot recalled .
“ I do n’t know how to explain it .
At first he was just an uneducated tough bastard who threw his weight around the wrong way .
But he developed into the most natural leader I ever saw . ”
John F. Ross , Writer :
When a pilot took command of a squadron they often lay back , did n’t fly as much , were much more cautious .
Eddie actually flew more when he became the commander of the 94th .
And I think it was that willingness to tangle , to teach novices , to let them take a kill that he set up , to fly more than anybody , to log more hours , that really made people come to regard him with such high esteem .
Narrator : Among other things , the fighter squadrons had to blind the enemy to American troop movements , and to their perilous supply lines .
A week into the offensive , Rickenbacker led a flight of twenty - four fighters on a mission to bring down two German observation balloons .
He assigned three planes to shoot down the balloons , while the rest of the group provided cover from carefully designated positions .
Rickenbacker flew thousands of feet above and behind the formation , so high that the lack of oxygen left him light - headed , while the freezing wind was an agony .
But from there he could survey the action like a general behind the lines .
As the Americans approached the balloons , Rickenbacker spotted eight German Fokkers racing in from one direction , and eleven from another .
Their red paint identified them as the most famous fighter unit of the war : the Flying Circus .
John F. Ross , Writer : The Red Baron started the Flying Circus .
By the time Eddie Rickenbacker and the Americans hit the frontline the Red Baron had already died , he was shot down himself .
But all of his Flying Circus members , all of his squadrons that he had trained were still very much alive and were very experienced .
And they were a frightening thing to behold in their Fokkers all colored in bright scarlet paint .
Narrator : Rickenbacker dove to warn the others .
He and the Flying Circus arrived at the same time , and the sky became a swirling mass of airplanes , with tracer bullets streaking in all directions .
Rickenbacker quickly set one of the Fokkers on fire , and watched as the pilot bailed out .
Moments later , one of his own comrades went down in flames .
For him , there was no escape .
John F. Ross , Writer :
In World War I , American pilots were not issued parachutes , though very serviceable parachutes existed .
But the American headquarters believed that parachutes would give them a sense of being defeatist and they would bail out of the airplane at a moment ’s notice .
This of course caused Eddie Rickenbacker to do back flips , he was so angry seeing so many of his men die who could have survived with that .
Narrator : Each American pilot was left to plan his own death should his plane catch fire .
Some carried pistols to shoot themselves , others preferred to jump .
Rickenbacker planned to inhale the flames – he ’d heard that shortened the agony .
Right now , he wanted no more of this huge dogfight miles behind enemy lines .
He coolly shepherded the group back toward friendly territory , until the Germans finally broke off the fight .
Eddie ’s careful planning and cool head had proved more than a match for the virtuosity of the Flying Circus .
His squadron downed nine enemy aircraft that day , while losing just two .
It was a sign of things to come .
As American pilots fought for control of the skies , a very different struggle was unfolding below , in the mud and darkness of the Argonne Forest .
Relief
Narrator : Reporters were calling them the Lost Battalion .
700 men under Major Charles
Whittlesey trapped behind enemy lines in a pocket 350 yards wide and 100 yards deep .
Private Ralph John was among them .
Voice : Ralph John :
The men were getting weaker and weaker .
We had robbed the dead men of everything in the way of food , water and ammunition .
The most terrible thing of all , it seemed to me , was the fact that we could do next to nothing for the wounded .
Many would almost rot before they died .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
The hillside looked like a butcher shop .
There were wounded everywhere .
There were dead everywhere .
The physical condition of the men was atrocious .
The effects of exposure were taking their toll .
The men that had been gassed , were hard to listen to .
Their gasping and snuffling in the cool damp air was very disheartening .
The medics had long since run out of anything , and all they could lend now was words of advice .
Narrator :
For four days the Germans had been trying to crush the pocket with mortars , heavy machine guns , and infantry assaults .
Through it all Whittlesey had kept the force together , but everyone knew that the end was drawing near .
Richard Slotkin , Historian : Whittlesey is really the heart and soul of the defense .
At least before the men , he never seems to lose his faith that they ’re going to survive , they ’re going to make it , they ’re going to be relieved .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer : Whittlesey was in the same mental state as the rest of the men , inside .
Outwardly he never showed one moment of cracking , but inside his turmoil was considerable .
His second in command , found him one night curled up in the bottom of his hole , asleep and crying .
The knots that were inside him had to be enormous , but he never once let on , and he continued to lead them from the front , and it endeared him to the men for life .
Narrator :
On the afternoon of October 6th , a sentry came running in , his eyes wide with fear .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
They looked off to the right flank and they could see a glow coming through the trees and the spits of flames coming at them .
Men just stood with their mouths hanging open , they did n’t know what to do .
They ’d never seen it before .
It had to be absolutely terrifying .
Thomas A. Hoff , Writer :
One of the most terrifying weapons in man ’s arsenal since we were living in caves with pointed sticks was fire .
So during the First World War the Germans and the French perfect a man packed flamethrower .
You do n’t want to be burned alive , and so that flamethrower becomes more of a terror weapon than anything else .
Narrator :
For a long moment the men stood transfixed .
Then an officer starting hollering as he fired wildly at the approaching inferno .
With that the spell was broken ; the troops began shooting blindly as they listened to the screams of men being incinerated .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
They were crying and wailing and pushing forward .
They actually got up out of their holes and began to give chase to the Germans and push them back .
It was almost a controlled riot as they did so .
And they let it be known to the Germans , was n’t gonna happen this time .
Narrator :
As suddenly as it began , the attack was over .
The forest was quiet , except for the cries of the wounded , and the sounds of survivors struggling back to their positions .
Voice : Ralph John : Such a mess you never did see .
Some of our men were dead , others dying and moaning for help .
Some were already buried and others just in pieces .
At night sometimes we would be able to bury a few of them in shallow graves , or just throw dirt over them in their dugout .
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
That was it .
They all knew that if the Germans came in one more time they were gonna walk right across that pocket .
And a blanket of despondency had fallen on that hillside .
You might hear a lot of rah-rah about the American army never giving up .
No , they had n’t given up , and they were determined to hold that hillside to the last man , but they certainly were n’t happy about it .
Narrator :
The sky darkened , a chilling rain set in .
Major Whittlesey sat staring into space , as weak and hungry as the rest .
A soldier crept up to his command post : a captain out on the road wanted to speak with him .
Whittlesey stumbled off to see what it was about .
It took the others a couple of minutes to figure out what was happening .
The stranger was an American officer .
The offensive had forced the German line back beyond the Pocket .
The siege of the Lost Battalion was over .
Voice : Ralph John : Early next morning more men arrived and the Major was right down among his men , doing anything he could for them .
It was a happy bunch started the hike back to the rear for a little rest and food .
I can well remember the first thing I had to eat was a big white onion , and boy , did I bite into it .
That night we did have so called bedding .
The nicest part of it all was to be in out of the rain .
Narrator :
The relief of the Lost Battalion kept frontline reporters so busy that they missed another big story entirely .
On that same day , just a few miles from the Pocket , Corporal Alvin York killed twenty Germans soldiers and led a whole column of prisoners back into the American lines .
" Well , York , I hear you 've captured the whole damned German army , " a general greeted him .
York ’s story received some attention when a magazine published an account soon after the war .
But he would become a true national icon years later , when his story became an allegory about fidelity and duty .
What made
York so fascinating was the fact that he had once been a conscientious objector .
This modest Christian had refused to fight until his commanding officer managed to persuade him that the war was just .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian : Alvin York is the reluctant warrior .
That ’s what makes his story so compelling .
We ’re reluctant warriors we like to believe .
He ’s skilled and effective , brave .
That ’s what we want to think about ourselves .
We turn to that story to argue wars sometimes need to be fought ; that sometimes you have to put your personal objections aside and do what ’s best for your community .
Pershing ’s Collapse , Victory on the Horizon
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
The experience in the Meuse - Argonne was far more horrible than anybody realizes .
During the Meuse - Argonne offensive we lost an average of 550 men a day , KIA , for 47 days .
Three times that wounded , every day .
It was , and remains , the largest and bloodiest battle America ’s ever been involved in .
Narrator : General Pershing seemed to have aged a decade over the past few weeks : his hair had turned gray , deep wrinkles lined his face , he fell asleep at his desk .
Most disturbing , Pershing ’s nerves were failing .
In mid-October he collapsed sobbing in the backseat of his staff car , crying out for his dead wife .
" My God , ” he moaned , “ sometimes I do n't know how I can go on . "
On the 16th of October , the general gave up his field command .
Edward A. Gutiérrez , Historian : Pershing is still trying to recover from the loss of his three daughters and his wife , who died in a fire .
At the same time Pershing was under immense pressure to get results , and he is haunted by the casualties .
Pershing halts the offensive , which is shocking .
But he had that sense to say , “ let ’s give someone else a chance , because I am frankly exhausted . ”
Richard Slotkin , Historian :
It is in a way Pershing ’s finest hour to recognize his limitations .
He steps back from immediate field command , he splits the army into two wings , lets his field commanders deal with things on the ground .
Andrew Carroll , Writer :
You could say that it was a sign of weakness , where he feels , I just ca n’t handle this .
I think you could also see it as a sign of strength to know his limitations .
He told his other generals “ you have to take this to its final conclusion .
We need to slug this out . ”
He just wanted to go after the Germans full force , be as aggressive as possible and end this conflict .
Narrator :
The troops were exhausted ; some units had been bled white .
One of Pershing ’s successors found it “ a disorganized and wrecked army . ”
But the enemy was still dangerous ; they must not be given time to recover .
As the high command rearmed and reorganized , the doughboys steeled themselves for the next phase of the offensive .
Code Talkers
Narrator : When Solomon Louis turned eighteen his friends had celebrated the fact that he could finally enlist in the US Army .
That was the joke , at any rate : Solomon Louis was already in the Army .
He lied about his age so that they could all go in together .
Fourteen of them — all full - blood Choctaw Indians — walked to the recruiting station in Idabel , Oklahoma .
Six months later , they were all in the thick of it in the Meuse - Argonne .
Edward A. Gutiérrez , Historian : Very few Native Americans were actually recognized as citizens .
Even with all of that prejudice , they volunteered in very high numbers .
America had really just finally stopped fighting Native Americans in the 1890s and as a result they were seen as very formidable warriors .
This kind of Indian warrior mythos very much resonated , not only with the public , but especially with the military .
They were excited to use the prowess of Native American soldiers .
Narrator :
By mid-October Louis ’ brigade had taken so many casualties that they were told to dig in for a couple of days .
Many of the men busied themselves with letters , but Louis did n’t have many to write .
He was an orphan ; he ’d married a girl he met at a football game just before shipping out .
She was an orphan too .
He ’d told her that he wanted someone to leave his things to if he got killed .
Solomon was talking with two friends when his commanding officer interrupted .
“ How many of you Indians talk the same language ? ” he asked .
Solomon ’s first thought was that they were in trouble for speaking Choctaw .
Back at the Armstrong Academy the first word of English he ’d learned was " soap . "
That ’s what the teachers used to wash out student ’s mouths if they were caught speaking their mother tongue .
So he was pleasantly surprised when his C.O. started asking questions .
The regiment had a problem , and the Choctaw might have the solution .
Edward A. Gutiérrez , Historian :
The Americans knew that the Germans were tapping into their lines because the Germans had been doing it the whole war .
Tapping wires was very easy to do , especially at night .
They would sneak out there , and cut the line or just listen .
So the Germans knew exactly what the Americans were up to .
Narrator : Within hours Solomon Louis and seven of his friends were assigned to each of the regiment ’s field headquarters .
From that day forward , all of the regiment ’s important messages were sent over the wires in Choctaw .
When the unit went back into action a few days later , the Germans were caught — for the first time — completely by surprise .
Edward A. Gutiérrez , Historian :
The Choctaw are able to use their own language in a very effective way , to the point where a German POW was captured and confesses that “ we had no idea what was going on .
We had no idea . ”
Armistice
Robert J. Laplander , Writer :
As far as manpower goes the British and the French were scraping the bottom of the barrel , the Germans were not far behind .
We were just getting started .
And we proved in the Meuse Argonne that we were fighters , and we were not going to give up .
Narrator :
When the Meuse - Argonne offensive resumed on November 1st , the fighting was just as savage , and the casualties appalling .
But through sheer force of will , the American Army was achieving its mission .
Michael Neiberg , Historian :
What the Americans did is tie down the Germans , make sure they ca n’t move .
The British , French and American armies keep the pressure on until they bring the Germans to their knees .
So it did n’t go the way that Pershing wanted it to go but at the strategic level , it accomplished what he needed it to accomplish .
Narrator : All along the Western Front the German Army was crumbling under the combined weight of British , French , and American assaults .
The front was moving miles a day ; German soldiers were surrendering by the tens of thousands .
And their homeland was collapsing from within .
Four years of war had reduced the population to starvation ; the economy was bankrupt , cities on the brink of revolution .
America , on the other hand , was just hitting its stride .
In late October the 2,000,000th American soldier landed in France , with another quarter million arriving every month .
John Horne , Historian :
What really I think breaks the Germans is the calculation , almost the paper calculation , that more and more Americans will just continue to arrive .
If there are already two million of them in France , at the end of 1918 , how many will there be by 1920 ?
And the Germans know that they ca n’t match that .
It ’s less the contribution in those final three months than it is the sheer spectacle that there ’s more and more and more of that to come .
Narrator :
The message came through the Swiss Embassy .
“ The German government accepts , as a basis for the peace negotiations , the program laid down by the President of the United States in his Fourteen Points message , and in his address of September 27 , 1918 . ”
Christopher Capozzola , Historian : The Germans ask for a peace on the basis of the Fourteen Points .
They know that the British and the French would seek to crush them and in fact the Germans almost want to surrender to the Americans rather than to the Allies as a whole .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian : I think Germans clutched at the idea of a Wilson who would be more sympathetic , less vindictive than either the British or the French .
If they get Wilson to manage the peace , they might not lose that much .
Narrator :
By approaching the United States and excluding the Allies , Germany had granted Wilson a leading role at the outset of the negotiations .
On the afternoon of October 22nd the president met with his cabinet to consider the German offer .
Some felt bound to consult the French and British .
Wilson disagreed .
“ The peoples of Great Britain and France are with me , ” he claimed .
“ That does not mean that their governments are of the same mind . ”
Margaret MacMillan , Historian : Wilson did have this curious thing : where he believed he spoke for the people .
It was never very clearly defined , but if you crossed him he would say “ but I have the voice of the people .
I know what the people want . ”
And he kept on appealing to the opinion of people around the world .
Dan Carlin , Podcast Producer : A man who became a part of Wilson ’s cabinet once said that he was a man of high ideals but no principles .
And the way he goes about arm - twisting reminds you of that .
He took the country into the war as an associated power rather than an ally , to be able to say , we reserve the right to broker our own peace .
Narrator : Wilson sent a note demanding the abdication of the Kaiser and the evacuation of all Allied territories .
At the same time , he strong - armed the Allies into accepting the Fourteen Points as the basis of peace negotiations .
Two weeks later , in a rail car outside Paris , a dejected German delegation signed a truce , to take effect at 11 AM on November 11th .
Eddie Rickenbacker was over no -man ’s land when the Armistice came .
Voice : Eddie Rickenbacker :
The trenches erupted .
Brown - uniformed men poured out of the American trenches , gray - green uniforms out of the German .
From my observer ’s seat overhead , I watched them throw their helmets in the air , discard their guns , wave their hands .
Then all up and down the front , the two groups of men began edging towards each other across no - man ’s - land .
Seconds before they had been willing to shoot each other ; now they came forward .
Hesitantly at first , then more quickly , each group approached the other .
Suddenly gray uniforms mixed with brown .
I could see them hugging each other , dancing , jumping .
Americans were passing out cigarettes and chocolate .
Star shells , rockets and flares began to go up , and I turned my ship towards the field .
The war was over .
The Day After
Narrator : News of the Armistice reached Washington at around 3 in the morning .
By the time the day got underway practically every city , town and hamlet in America had erupted in celebration .
Ignoring official warnings about the flu , people gathered , embraced strangers , formed spontaneous parades , listened to bands and speeches .
In Cloverport , Kentucky , “ every man , woman , child and baby in town gathered on Main Street beating tin pans , washtubs , and most anything they could find . ”
The people of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania expressed desire for a great religious service of thanksgiving , but in the meantime police had to close the saloons at 11 in the morning after a bar brawl got out of control .
By nightfall America was having a party that would be remembered for decades .
The suffragist Alice Paul made a point of ignoring the celebrations .
“ Self - government is victorious throughout the rest of the world , ” she declared , “ but here it is delayed and obstructed by the United States Senate . ”
Yet women ’s suffrage was gaining converts every day .
The President himself had come around .
Paul could sense that her victory , too , was n’t far off .
In fact , there was much to celebrate .
The United States had helped rescue its two closest allies .
Even the most jaded observers could hope that a better day was dawning .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
The message that was given to Americans was that we had won this war and I think it empowered Americans .
It infused them with this sense that there ’s a certain American responsibility .
Narrator : “ Everything which America has fought for has been accomplished , ” President Wilson proclaimed .
“ Complete victory has brought us , not peace alone , but the confident promise of a new day as well , in which justice shall replace force and jealous intrigue among nations .
It will now be our fortunate duty to assist in the establishment of democracy throughout the world . ”
But even as Wilson heralded the triumph of American values , many of his countrymen worried about the fate of democracy at home .
Michael Kazin , Historian :
The end of the war does not mean the end of repression .
There ’s still a lot of pent up anger among Americans who support the war against those who opposed it .
They are considered to be dangerous radicals .
There was just as much tension about loyalty and disloyalty after the Armistice as there was during the war itself .
Narrator : During the nineteen months that the United States was at war , American society had been torn apart by questions of loyalty .
More than 2,000 citizens were prosecuted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts , and thousands of enemy aliens interned .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian :
These two acts really become tools to shut up people who refuse to be quiet about their opposition to the war , especially leftwing organizations , socialists , the IWW .
Now the government has the legal authority to suppress them , and it uses that at will .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian :
You ca n’t actually measure the impact of wartime repression solely by the number of prosecutions — and there were tens of thousands .
But for every prosecution there might be tens , hundreds , thousands of “ friendly ” visits by government agents warning someone not to say what they said or write what they wrote .
We also need to look at the chilling effect that this repression had on every American .
Narrator :
The silencing of predominantly left - wing opposition came back to haunt Wilson a few days before the end of the war , when his Democrats lost heavily in the midterm elections , handing control of Congress to the Republicans .
Even some true believers thought Wilson was to blame .
“ All the radical or liberal friends of your policy were either silenced or intimidated , ” George Creel chided the president .
“ There was no voice left to argue for your sort of peace . ”
Now , any treaty Wilson signed would have to be ratified by a Republican Congress .
As Creel pointed out , Wilson had jeopardized his dream through his conduct of the war at home .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian : George Creel says essentially to Wilson that you destroyed yourself .
You were elected by progressives and liberals and then when those progressives and liberals spoke out against the war , you silenced them , you attacked them and now when you need them , there ’s no one left to stand up for you .
Narrator : Many Americans hoped that Wilson would quickly dismantle the tools of repression and heal the nation ’s wounds .
Instead , the tide of repression quickened .
Shortly before the end of the war the nation ’s most famous socialist , Eugene Debs , was sentenced to ten years in prison for having spoken out against the draft a few months earlier .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian : Debs becomes a symbol for the war ’s repression and he also becomes the motivation for movements to pardon him .
Not only him , but also other political prisoners , conscientious objectors and others who were still in jail after the Armistice .
And Wilson had drawn his line in the sand , that he would not pardon Debs .
Narrator : Among the thousands of anti-war activists in jail were several hundred conscientious objectors , including Josef Hofer and his two brothers .
The Hofers were Hutterites ; their faith forbade them from helping the war effort in any way , from even wearing a uniform .
They had been taken from their South Dakota community in May , and suffered months of abuse at the hands of the authorities .
One week after the Armistice they were taken by train to Leavenworth , Kansas , and marched through the streets of the town and into the courtyard of the Military Prison .
It was almost midnight ; weak and exhausted , they were ordered to strip and were left standing for hours as the temperature dropped to 17 degrees .
When they were finally taken inside , they were suspended from the bars of their cells so that their feet barely touched the floor .
They were kept in that position for nine hours a day , and fed only bread and water .
Even in the freezing cold , the men chose to remain almost naked rather than wear the military uniforms that were left in their cells .
Michael Kazin , Historian :
It ’s really torture ; I think it has to be called that .
Even the Secretary of War said that he was uncomfortable with the way they were treated ; nevertheless , he was n’t going to step in and change it .
Narrator : After two weeks , David Hofer was allowed to wire home , with news that his brothers Michael and Josef were dying .
By the time Josef ’s wife Maria arrived at Leavenworth , he was barely able to talk .
Josef Hofer died at 8:30 the following morning .
To Maria ’s horror she saw that the prison guards had dressed Josef ’s corpse in the army uniform he had so staunchly refused to wear in life .
Versailles
Narrator :
On the 14th of December 1918 , just one month after the Armistice , Woodrow Wilson arrived in Paris to negotiate a peace treaty and end the Great War .
A. Scott Berg , Writer : Paris then had a population of about a million people .
Over two million people lined the parade route , just the few miles that Woodrow Wilson traveled as he wove through the streets .
Just by the sheer numbers it was quite simply the greatest march of triumph in the history of man .
I ’m not forgetting Caesar .
I ’m not forgetting Alexander the Great .
This was the arrival of the Messiah , this was the Second Coming .
What kind of peace was he bringing ?
The whole world wanted to see .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian :
He was carrying a burden of expectations which no human being can have carried .
There was this feeling that he ’s going to set it all right .
But what setting it all right meant was very different things for different people .
Narrator : The Armistice was just a truce ; a treaty was needed to satisfy the competing claims of the victors , on terms that the Germans could accept .
For the first time , Wilson met French Prime Minister Georges Clémenceau , and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George , along with delegates from more than thirty countries .
These were the nameless statesmen whom Wilson had denounced in his speeches .
Some of them were less enamored of the American president than the crowds that mobbed his processions .
And many of them held ambitions that clashed sharply with Wilson’s .
A. Scott Berg , Writer : Wilson was the only one there fighting for a principle .
He was fighting for mankind ; that was basically his constituency here .
And what he came up against were especially Lloyd George of Great Britain and Clemenceau of France who genuinely wanted revenge on Germany .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian : Wilson makes it very clear that the United States is not coming in to gain anything for itself at the peace conference .
They are coming in to build a better world .
Well , he can say that because the United States has n’t lost territory , it has n’t lost huge numbers of men , it has n’t spent huge amounts of money .
Britain and France have spent themselves almost to bankruptcy and lost men in the hundreds of thousands .
Narrator : Wilson came to the negotiations , as a British diplomat observed , “ armed with power such as no man in history had possessed . ”
The Allies had to take Wilson ’s wishes into account .
That meant , above all , creating a League of Nations .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian : Wilson felt there was no point the United States having come into the war if a better world order was n’t going to come out .
And so the League of Nations is the idea that there will be attempts to settle disputes among nations without war , that there will be an effort made to bring about disarmament , that peoples will not be handed around the world without their consent .
All that is there in the covenant of the League of Nations .
Narrator : Many found Wilson to be stubborn , but the president felt bound by a moral imperative .
At the end of May , he tried to articulate that commitment , when he dedicated a cemetery for American servicemen outside Paris .
From a small platform in the middle of the graveyard , Wilson looked out at a crowd of veterans , many of them bearing scars , missing limbs , disabled , disfigured .
“ I beg you to realize , ” he told them , “ the compulsion that I am under .
I sent these lads over here to die .
Can I ever speak even a word which is inconsistent with the assurances I gave them ? ”
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
He took personal responsibility for every one of those deaths .
And he said , I owe it to these soldiers to go back and fight for the things they fought for .
Narrator :
At the end of June 1919 , after six months of negotiations , the Allies and Germany finally came to terms .
The Treaty of Versailles consisted of 440 articles that drew new borders for Germany , hobbled its military and imposed staggering reparation payments .
It also effectively carved the Middle East into French and British spheres of influence , and divided German colonies among the victors .
The Treaty was a series of compromises satisfactory to no one .
But Wilson had achieved something truly remarkable : the very first article in the Treaty was the Covenant of a League of Nations .
From the ashes of the most destructive war in history , Woodrow Wilson had created what he believed would be the framework of an age of peace .
At the beginning of July he sailed for home .
One last hurdle remained : shepherding the treaty through the United States Senate .
Red Summer
Narrator : Saturday July 19th was hot and humid even by Washington standards .
Theaters , brothels , and saloons were packed with soldiers and sailors on leave .
The city was on edge over reports that two black men had harassed a white woman .
At dusk , hundreds of servicemen began roaming the streets , looking for revenge .
“ Before the very gates of the White House ” a reporter noted , “ Negroes were dragged from streetcars and beaten up while crowds of soldiers , sailors and marines dashed down Pennsylvania Avenue , in pursuit of any who tried to flee . ”
Adriane Lentz - Smith , Historian : Wilson is newly returned from France where he ’s been articulating this vision for justice on a world scale , and where he ’s been hailed by masses as this messianic figure .
And then he comes back to a Washington that is like burning .
He ’s so wrapped in his connection with the abstract masses that his own citizens who need him get nothing from him .
Narrator : Wilson felt that black soldiers posed a threat to the United States .
In the wake of the Russian Revolution he worried about Communism creeping into America , and “ the most likely vessel for that , ” he told a friend , was “ the American Negro returning from abroad . ”
Now , all over the country , returning black veterans were being abused , attacked , lynched , and burned alive .
Adriane Lentz - Smith , Historian :
There ’s an expectation on the part of African American soldiers that they ’ve earned the right to vote , to participate , to be respected , to map their fates .
But it ’s met with a similar resolve on the part of white supremacists to make sure that nothing comes , nothing lasting would come of that military service .
Narrator : Time and again tensions over black rights led to rioting .
Twenty - five cities were torn apart ; hundreds were killed .
Chad Williams , Historian :
The assertiveness of African Americans was threatening to white southerners who were determined to make sure that African Americans remained in their place , but also to many white northerners who were resistant to African Americans encroaching in the labor market .
And in the summer of 1919 the United States experienced a wave of racial violence , which was unparalleled in American history .
James Weldon Johnson described it as the “ Red Summer . ”
It was a horrific statement about how the aspirations of African Americans were going to be met with violent resistance from white people , both North and South .
Narrator : The White House received thousands of appeals from black citizens , begging for protection .
If the victims received any response at all , it was a form letter advising them that the federal government had no say in these matters .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
In Wilson ’s defense he was still in Paris for the first month and a half of the riots .
On the other hand , when he came back it could have been a game - changer , I think , to have stepped up and said , these soldiers , these African Americans fought in the same war you white soldiers did and we must now embrace the African Americans in American society .
And he said nothing on the subject .
Narrator : In October , Philips County , Arkansas exploded into the deadliest racial violence in the country ’s history .
Tensions had been building since black sharecroppers , led by a returning veteran , formed a union to demand a fair price for their cotton .
When a white man was killed in a firefight , local authorities spread the word that an insurrection was underway .
Although Wilson ’s White House had always refused to allow the Army to protect black citizens , hundreds of soldiers were sent in to assist posses of white men in putting down the so - called rebellion .
As they roamed the countryside , killing hundreds of black people , a train pulled into the station .
A crowd rushed aboard and dragged out four unsuspecting black men .
They were Leroy Johnston and his three brothers .
Johnston , the young man who had traveled to New York to join the Harlem Hellfighters , had returned home in July .
He ’d spent nine months in French hospitals recovering from the wounds he ’d received at the Meuse - Argonne .
The mob accused him of “ distributing ammunition to the insurrectionists , ” then shoved the four brothers into the back of a car with an armed guard .
By most accounts one grabbed the guard ’s gun and managed to kill him .
In the next instant the mob shot the Johnston brothers to pieces .
Leroy Johnston had survived some of the hardest fighting of the Great War .
He had n’t survived his homecoming .
Adriane Lentz - Smith , Historian :
That betrayal , the “ Red Summer ” of 1919 , was crushing .
For a lot of people , it destroys them .
But there are a number of people who find ways to channel that fury , and they turn it into activist power .
Jeffrey Sammons , Historian : World War I has emboldened them , has actually told them just how threatening they might be to whites .
All that happened after , even into the civil rights movement , was a result of the change in attitude which itself was a result of what they saw they were capable of doing in World War I .
The Death of the League
Narrator :
At the beginning of October 1919 , as the survivors in Arkansas were burying their dead , Woodrow Wilson disappeared from public view .
Senators , cabinet members , even Wilson ’s own Secretary of State , were all being denied access to the President .
The story had begun three months earlier , after Wilson ’s return from Europe .
A. Scott Berg , Writer : Wilson gets home , he spends the next several weeks making his pitches to the Senate , why this is a wonderful treaty , why they must embrace it .
He realizes almost from the beginning that he ’s going to face some opposition , but he does n’t realize how great the opposition actually would be .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian : Wilson has outlined a vision of American world leadership that involves it permanently in the maintenance of world peace .
Woodrow Wilson assumes that Americans support this new idea of internationalism .
But when the war is over and people really start getting in to the nitty - gritty , he finds that there ’s a lot of doubt .
People really are n’t so sure .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
Over the next few weeks he realizes he has one real nemesis and that is Henry Cabot Lodge , who is leading the charge against the Treaty .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian : Wilson
I think made a big strategic mistake and that was that when he went to Paris , he did n’t make it a bipartisan thing , he did n’t bring any Republicans .
If he ’d had the sense he should have brought Henry Cabot Lodge .
You know , these were stupid things to do .
Narrator : After Senator Lodge held the Treaty up in committee through much of the summer , Wilson decided to take his case directly to the people .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian :
This is always the great Wilson saying , I ’m going to speak to the people , cause no one else can .
Just this sort of arrogance , even though he was a great orator .
Narrator :
For three weeks Wilson traveled around the western United States , making four or five stops a day , speaking to huge crowds in the late summer heat , without air conditioning or amplification .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
It built a lot of momentum .
He was really winning the argument .
Unfortunately , while Wilson is building great energy and good will talking to the people , on the inside physically he ’s falling apart .
His gait is getting slower , he ’s tripping on words .
It ’s just harder and harder for him to deliver a speech .
Narrator : On September 25th Wilson dragged himself through an appearance in Pueblo Colorado , even as he was blinded by a migraine , his left arm and leg numb , his face twitching uncontrollably .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
As the evening wears on , Wilson ’s headaches are so severe he simply cannot deal with it .
And his doctor and Mrs. Wilson say , this tour has got to end , because your life is about to end .
And Wilson just refuses to budge .
He wo n’t do it , no , I just need a little sleep .
Of course he can’t sleep , the pain is so severe .
And a few hours later even he now realizes he can not go on .
And the doctor gives the order , “ that ’s it ; just get the President back to Washington D.C. ”
Wilson is truly a broken man .
Narrator :
Three days after his return to the White House , Wilson suffered a stroke so severe that his wife Edith thought he should resign the presidency .
But Wilson ’s inner circle believed his abdication would kill any remaining hope of ratifying the treaty .
Mrs. Wilson and a handful of advisors decided to keep the President ’s condition a secret .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
For the last year and a half of the Wilson presidency , a handful of people in the White House , I believe , engaged in the greatest conspiracy in American history .
Some have argued that for all intents and purposes , Edith Bolling Galt Wilson became the first female president of the United States .
Certainly there is no question that the executive branch of government was functioning through Mrs. Wilson .
Narrator : With Wilson hidden away , treaty negotiations took an unexpected turn .
At the last minute , Republicans proposed a list of amendments that would have given Wilson almost everything he wanted , including the League of Nations .
The author of the amendments was Henry Cabot Lodge .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian : Lodge was not against the League of Nations as a whole , he just was worried about the shape .
He wanted to talk about it .
Wilson would n’t do it .
He was n’t prepared to admit that Lodge had any reasonable reservations about the treaty .
A. Scott Berg , Writer : Lodge himself knew , “ if I offer anything , Woodrow Wilson has such contempt for me he will not accept it . ”
And indeed Lodge was correct .
Narrator :
There were more than enough votes to ratify the treaty with Lodge ’s amendments .
But Wilson ordered Democratic senators to kill his own treaty .
On March 19 , 1920 , they did just that .
A. Scott Berg , Writer :
In essence , Woodrow Wilson stabbed himself , stabbed the treaty in the back , or more to the point , in the heart .
Because that was really the end for Woodrow Wilson .
Jay Winter , Historian :
There comes a time I suppose when bitterness overtakes shrewdness .
And at the end of his life he was a very bitter man .
I do n’t know anyone who can tell me why it was that Wilson did n’t compromise one way or the other .
And as a result he loses it all .
He loses everything .
Margaret MacMillan , Historian :
We ca n’t help asking what if .
I mean what if the United States had joined the League ?
What if the United States had been in the League when Mussolini rose in Italy ?
What if the United States had been in the League when Hitler rose in Germany ?
Just what if .
Epilogue
Dan Carlin , Podcast Producer :
We go into this war as the 17th most powerful military in the world , a debtor nation and we come out of it a global superpower , you never go back to the way things were .
The modern version of the United States is born out of this war .
Nancy K. Bristow , Historian :
Though we won the war , it had great costs .
Not only in a loss of life .
That war was won but it was won by way of behaviors , policies , even laws that contradicted the very values for which the country was fighting .
Adriane Lentz - Smith , Historian : The Great War changes people ’s imagination .
This language of a war for democracy , this idea that some principles are worth fighting for , those are now ideas that you hear over and over again .
Jennifer D. Keene , Historian : America now had a new idea of the role it could play in the world .
It could be the diplomat .
It could be the peacemaker .
It could be the humanitarian .
Those ideals continue to animate our foreign policy ; they continue to be the goals we strive to achieve .
Christopher Capozzola , Historian :
The images that come to us are sort of distant figures in black and white .
But I think it ’s important to remember how contemporary the war was .
It ’s important to look back and understand the experiences of Americans who lived through it and who tried to generate something better , who really did hope to end all wars .
It ’s part of what we owe to that generation .
There are n't many MMO expansions that change a game wholesale when it 's over five years old .
There are n't many that introduce entire new methods of interaction , environment types , mini-games and meta - games , graphics and more .
There certainly are n't many that offer all that as a free update to subscribers .
That 's what Walking In Stations , the update that will bring interiors and avatars to EVE Online for the first time , proposes to do .
It 's a no- brainer , you 'd think .
Senior producer Torfi Frans
Olafsson admits that players were asking if they'd be able to walk around and socialise inside space stations before the famously complex science - fiction MMO was even released ; it 's simple , natural wish - fulfilment , a limb the game has always been missing .
Nevertheless , it carries with it serious risks .
EVE
Online may be an incomprehensible formula to many , but it's a successful one : with almost a quarter of a million subscribers , it 's a solid performer that 's still steadily growing in popularity five years after release , something almost unheard of in MMOs .
As the producers of Star Wars Galaxies will tell you , a radical change to an established game can easily destabilise it , and alienate its audience .
If it ai n't broke , why fix it ?
Olafsson claims that they always wanted to do this , but that PC graphics simply were n't advanced enough in 2003 to portray characters in the serious , hard - sci - fi mode - comparable to film and TV - that they wanted .
Disingenuous that may be , but the first live demonstration of the game proves it was worth the wait .
As far as realistic human avatars ( and their clothing ) goes , Walking in Stations is right up there with Quantic Dream 's Heavy Rain .
There 's still a certain plasticity to faces , and you can expect the rather stiff animations to improve , but in anatomy , shadowing , lighting - even light reflections on PVC and leather clothing - these characters are second - to - none .
This is the only official avatar screenshot that exists at the moment .
We 're chasing CCP for more .
If you 're particularly attached to your current 2D visage , you 'll have to do your best to create it from scratch .
" Rather than write a hugely complex non-linear algorithm that would translate your existing avatar , we decided that the best such filter that exists is the human brain , " Olafsson says .
Character customisation was n't shown at the EVE Fanfest .
Film visuals are constantly referenced as a benchmark .
The initial costumes created by artists " were very gamey - although they were cool , we felt that you would n't see this in a science - fiction film " .
Out they went , replaced by a costume designers ' work that could actually be made in fabric , accurate down to the stitching .
Similarly , the environment designs created by " level artists from popular FPS games " were scrapped for the work of architects and industrial designers , since stations would n't be used for combat , but shopping and social interaction - the things real - world buildings are used for .
Film animation studios are creating assets for Walking In Stations , Olafsson boasts .
( Visit Fanfest , and you quickly learn that CCP , while a very friendly company , is also an obsessive elitist like no other .
It prizes measurable performance and bragging rights above all else .
Just check out yesterday 's insanely detailed presentations on graphics and server performance , if you do n't believe us . )
Walking in Stations will also make EVE the first game to take advantage of a new lighting technology called Enlighten from Cambridge 's Geomerics .
In technical terms this means real - time radiosity - the bouncing of light from surfaces to other surfaces .
In practical terms , it 's supposed to allow games to take advantage of the kind of dynamic mood lighting of film , and especially film noir .
A Geomerics representative showed clips of Alien and Blade Runner as well as a deeply impressive tech demo .
Enlighten was n't built into the demo shown , but regardless , there were some stunningly subtle lighting and shadowing effects on display already - ambient occlusion ( softer darkening of obscured areas , as opposed to hard shadows ) was spectacular .
This is actually a hangar , but gives you some idea of the scale and aesthetic of stations .
When you dock your ship , you can choose to exit your pod to your captain 's quarters .
Your large , organic pilot 's pod leads to a dressing room for choosing costume options , and a generically curvy and antiseptic space - lounge with open - plan kitchen ( and a box of " protein delicacies " ) and animated news screen .
An elevator takes you down to the station itself .
These fairly standardised digs will allow some limited customisation - sofas , tables , pictures on the wall , " frozen corpse display cabinets " - but they 're mostly there as a default showcase for your avatar , and somewhere any player can immediately call home .
Appropriately enough for this rapaciously capitalist game , your real investment in Walking In Stations wo n't be as a home - maker , but as a shop - keeper .
CCP is taking its own idiosyncratic approach to content in Walking In Stations .
Instead of designing lavish environments and writing hours of NPC dialogue for players to enjoy , the game 's space stations will largely be blank canvasses : promenade rows of empty sockets for players to plug their own businesses into , and even write their own content .

The only UK winners were former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney , who was named ultimate legend in his home town , and 1980s star Rick Astley .
Astley was named best act ever after an online campaign to orchestrate votes .
Hip - hop star Kanye
West won best urban , Pink took best song for So What and Katy Perry picked up best newcomer .
The pop starlet also hosted the show in front of thousands of screaming fans at Liverpool 's Echo Arena .
British acts Duffy , Leona Lewis and Coldplay went home empty - handed , despite being nominated in three categories each .

Sir Paul McCartney Europe's Favourite Act
Emre Aydin ( Turkey ) Leona Lewis was named UK 's favourite act , a preliminary prize that meant she went forward to contend the award for Europe 's favourite act .
But she lost out to Turkey 's Emre Aydin .
The only other European winners were German teen rockers Tokio Hotel , who won the headliner award for best live act .
MTV staged a visually stunning show , with stand - out performances from The Killers , Pink , Take That and Kanye West , who helped whip up a fevered atmosphere .
The Ting Tings , Beyonce , Kid Rock and Duffy were among the other performers .
One fan , Phoebe Surtees - Smith , 23 , picked out Beyonce and The Killers as the top performances , and said Katy Perry pulled it off as hostess .
" I love her , she 's so sweet , " she said .
" I 've got a sore throat because I screamed so much . "
She added it was " fantastic " to have the event in Liverpool .
" It makes a change does n't it ? " she said .
" I feel like we 've been owed it for so long .
I loved it , it was brilliant . "
Emma Rowland , also 23 , said Pink and Kanye West were the highlights of an " amazing " night for the city .
" It was in Liverpool and you were in the same room as all them people you 'd never get tickets to see in a million years because they sell out that quick , " she said .
" It 's the best ever .
We 're always looked at as horrible Liverpool . "
Immortal work Sir Paul was greeted by rapturous applause from his home crowd on being presented with the one - off lifetime achievement award by U2 frontman Bono .
" These MTV awards are great and glamorous occasions , but on behalf of all the artists in this room , I will tell you something , " he said .
" I think we all suspect someday when all of us are gone and this great hall is no longer here , we sense , we fear our names will be forgotten .
" There is one person in this hall tonight whose songs we know will be here now and forever .
" There is one person in this hall tonight whose work is immortal .
Perry opened the show with her hit I Kissed A Girl " There is only one Paul McCartney . "
After picking up his honour , Sir Paul said bashfully : " I do n't know what to do after an introduction like that . "
The star settled for thanking friends , family and " my mates Ringo , George and John " .
" Many years ago , four little boys were born here in Liverpool and we went on to do quite well , " he added .
" So thanks , as I say , to all my family , to all of you for coming along , everyone in Liverpool , everyone in Britain , everyone in America - for voting in Mr Obama .
I love you ! "
The show contained numerous references to Barack Obama , most notably when Kanye West and Estelle finished their hit American Boy with the US President - elect 's face projected onto a giant screen behind them .
Jared Leto , from 30 Seconds to Mars , wearing an Obama T - shirt , also asked the crowd to stand in honour of the Democratic senator .
Amid cheers , he said : " Liverpool , lets hear it for Barack Obama . "
Host Katy Perry remarked : " Maybe Europe will love us again now . "
The US singer was a high - spirited presenter , and managed 12 costumes changes during the show .
She opened proceedings by straddling a gigantic cherry chapstick - a reference to the lyrics of her number one hit I Kissed A Girl .
The singer also picked up the best new act prize during the show .
Video speech Britney Spears won best act of 2008 and album of the year for Blackout .
But she did not turn up to the event , instead sending acceptance speeches by video .
Beyonce performing her single , If I Were A Boy
In Pictures : MTV Awards arrivals Rick Astley was also absent from the event after beating acts like U2 , Britney Spears and Green Day to the award for best act ever .
There was no video message and gossip blogger Perez Hilton collected the prize on his behalf .
Pink accepted the most addictive track award by paraphrasing a line from the winning song : " I guess I should thank my husband , but I do n't know where he went . "
30 Seconds To Mars , who co-hosted the ceremony , took home best rock act and best video star .
Former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona , who presented the latter award , was loudly booed as she took to the stage .

Biometric enrollment fees for passports and ID cards will cost applicants £ 20 - £ 40 on top of the basic price , estimates released by the Home Office revealed yesterday .
In a prospectus soliciting private sector partners for enrollment , the Identity & Passport Service said that the total market for these services is worth " between £ 120 million and £ 280 million per year . "
Passport fees are currently set at £ 72 while ID cards are intended to cost £ 30 , and if IPS had persisted with the earlier plan of collecting biometrics at its own national network of interview centres , that would have been the end of it .
But the switch to the private sector , announced earlier this year , allows the bulk of enrollment costs to be removed from the scheme cost , and charged back to the customers via private sector partners in " a competitive open market . "
But given that the customers ( 6 million passport renewals a year , 1 million non-EEA citizens requiring ID cards ) do n't have a lot of choice about buying the product , any " competitive open market " will depend on there being more than one service provider per region or sector .
Which could well be a challenge .
The system is intended to run from 2012 , but as both the major opposition parties have promised to pull the plugs on ID cards , the revenue stream is only going to be there if Labour wins the next election .
In addition , IPS ' wishlist for its partners is challenging .
Biometric data will need to be " supervised one - to - one by a trained operator .
They will need to have undergone security checks and be employed by an accredited organisation " , and organisations " will need to demonstrate their capability in securing applicants ' data appropriately . "
Facilities will need to be located in " areas with good transport links and existing customer footfall , such as high streets or large shopping centres providing easy and convenient access for customers " , while service providers will need to have a strong brand that customers know and trust .
If your customers knew and trusted you , would you think fingerprinting them would be a useful exercise in brand - building ?
The service providers will also need space to accommodate the equipment , to have " a demonstrated ability to record and transmit customer data securely " , well - trained experienced staff and a low level of staff turnover , an existing national or regional network and " the ability to implement and manage a reliable IT infrastructure " .
All this does sound like it has the makings of a very short shortlist .
But there are benefits for any well - known and respected chain that is imbecilic enough ready to step up to the plate .
You get " a new revenue stream ; increased footfall ; access to new customer segments " and - we kid you not - " association with respected and trusted brand " and " goodwill generated by providing a valuable public service . "
Do n't all rush at once . ®
Not enough green to tackle green ?
Adopting environmentally friendly practices and technology is often presented as an expensive proposition .
Fears of added costs almost derailed European climate regulation , as countries feared that the current financial crisis has created circumstances in which any additional expenditures were simply not viable .
But companies that presented at the recent EPA Climate Leaders meeting suggest the situation is more complex ; many efficiency efforts are big financial wins , but that renewable power generation may have to take a back seat while Wall Street cleans up its mess .
Efficiency pays for itself
Speaker after speaker emphasized how well efficiency was working for their company on a financial basis .
Perhaps the most compelling version of it came from Michael Mollnar of Cummins , which manufactures heavy equipment .
Describing efficiency efforts , he said , " it 's almost embarrassing what some of these returns are , because we never looked at these things " — he then went on to name returns in the area of 300 percent for some projects .
Referring to the frequent description of efficiency projects as " low hanging fruit , " he described the inefficiencies at Cummins as , " fruit that 's sitting on the floor , that you 're stepping on . "
He was n't alone in being excited about the returns .
Over the past eight years , Intel has invested $ 24 million in conservation projects ; the annual return from that work is now up to over $ 44 million .
Even small efforts can help when magnified by the sheer size of a large company .
John Fojut of Kohl 's department stores described how a store manager suggested turning off the stores ' wall lights during the first hour of business , when few people shopped anyway .
Rolled out in a thousand stores , this simple method now saves the company $ 500,000 a year .
A representative of Exelon , a power generating company , estimated that targeting LEED green building certification added less than five percent to construction costs , and would pay for itself quickly .
Aside from having fantastic returns , the efforts do n't seem to require creating a new bureaucracy .
Fojut said Kohls added a single staff member for high - level planning like LED lighting rollouts , and otherwise simply encouraged its staff to consider energy efficiency part of its job ; many of its ideas came up from the ranks , who were much better placed to identify inefficiencies .
Cummins added a total of three engineers with energy backgrounds to its staff and used them to devise an evaluation procedure that helps the company identify those projects that will have the highest return at a reasonable cost .
Many of the inefficiencies identified were pure losses .
Owens - Corning hired an outside contractor to scan its manufacturing facilities in infrared , which allowed them to identify a number of natural gas leaks .
In generating its carbon footprint , Cisco found weird numbers coming out of its Ankara sales office .
Its electric meter turned out to be broken , and they were being billed for power they 'd never used .
Outside of efficiency , green efforts are a harder sell
The efficiency efforts may cost money , but for now , the returns are high enough that , if anything , tough financial times make them even more appealing .
The same does n't necessarily hold for other climate initiatives .
Intel described how changing their manufacturing process to use fewer chlorofluorocarbons made business sense only in that it , " avoided potentially painful regulations . "
Corning faced a similar dilemma in regards to CFCs in its process .
Ultimately , they had to retool the entire process and buy new equipment to roll it out , which they 're doing only slowly .
They hope to make cash by licensing the technique .
The situation was also mixed when it came to companies getting their own renewable power in place .
Corning has placed photovoltaic systems on two of its facilities , but in most cases , the companies are preferring to outsource the risk .
Two companies talked about using natural gas generated at landfills in their facilities , but in both cases , a specialized company actually handled the harvesting and processing of the gas at the landfill .
Large , flat roofs offer opportunities
Kohl's , having a lot of roof space available at its retail outlets , is going for photovoltaic installations .
But they 're essentially leasing their roof space to a company that owns and runs the panels in return for having a guaranteed ( and low ) rate on the electricity they produce .
Aspects of this make sense from the business perspective — these are n't power companies , and there 's no reason for them to go into fields outside of the business they 're in .
But it does suggest there are significant worries that renewable power sources are n't quite there economically , and fluctuations in fossil fuel prices continue to change the equation far too often .
Volkswagen Scirocco has become a popular model among tuners and the latest proposal comes from the tuning of the MCCHIP .
German tuner has prepared a “ medium ” package for Scirocco 2.0 TSI which contains a new software and an exhaust system , turbo engine of 2.0 liters now arriving at 246 horsepower and 346 Nm .
MCCHIP not stopped here and the German model equipped with a suspension H & R and OZ rims of 19 - inch Michelin tires of PS - Cup 235/35 - 19 .
For those interested , Volkswagen Scirocco by MCCHIP can be admired at the Essen Motor Show ( November 29 to December 7 ) .

The State Canvassing Board has begun the tedious process of reviewing the challenged ballots from the Minnesota Senate Recount .
The proceedings can be watched at the Minnesota House of Representatives Website ( as shown below ) or at TheUpTake.org .
[ The first session has ended , but a replay is available : Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 ]
The exact number of challenges , by either campaign , remains somewhat uncertain .
Each campaign has released three phases of withdrawals , roughly halving their initial number of challenges .
The most recent withdrawal statement came from the Franken campaign last Friday :
The Franken campaign today announced that it would withdraw another 750 ballot challenges , bringing the total number it has withdrawn to over 1800 .
Source : Al Franken for Senate
Based upon each candidate 's withdrawals and the Secretary of State 's data , the challenge count stands as depicted below :
Current Withdrawn Franken : 1,470 1,808 Coleman : 2,027 1,350 Total : 3,497 3,158 Margin : 557 458
Norm Coleman and Al Franken each issued further statements regarding potential withdrawals .
We 'll start with Norm Coleman 's statement issued on Sunday , December 14th at 5:41 PM CT :
With that in mind , it is our intent to reduce our challenges to somewhere south of 1,000 ballot challenges by the time the board meets on Tuesday .
It is our hope that prior to the Canvassing Board meeting the board and the Secretary of State will have a credible process that is both uniform and consistent for reviewing challenged ballots .
Source : Norm Coleman for Senate
Franken released a similar statement yesterday , December 15th at 7:52 PM CT :
Two days after members of the state canvassing board issued an urgent plea for campaigns to withdraw additional challenges in order to allow them to finish their work in a timely fashion , the Franken campaign today announced that it would have fewer than 500 challenges remaining by the time the board meets on Tuesday .
Source : Al Franken for Senate
Depending on who you believe , or which count you use , a plethora of challenges , by both campaigns , still must be reviewed by the five member canvassing board .
The review process started at 12:00 PM CT today , after a delay , and intends to conclude on Friday the 19th .
The recount results from each of Minnesota 's 4130 Precincts were semi-finalized last Friday , the 12th of December .
The results are depicted below ; challenge conclusions are not included :
It appears as the the board as begun by reviewing only challenges made by Al Franken , at least so far .
[ 2:27 PM CT ]
Current Challenge Resolution Count :
2:06 PM CT : Coleman + 25 , Franken +5
2:10 PM CT : Coleman + 27 , Franken +5

The Canvassing Board has concluded reviewing ballots , for today .
After the final ballot was reviewed they went on to talk about the need for each campaign to further reduce the number of challenges brought to the board .
The board reviewed 159 challenges put forth by the Franken campaign , and a single challenge by the Coleman campaign which was mistakenly in the wrong pile .
Coleman 's challenge was overruled and the vote went to Franken .
Hamid Gul tells CNN that neo-cons , zionists were behind terror attacks

Monday , December 8 , 2008
General Hamid Gul , the former head of the Pakistani ISI , told CNN yesterday that both the Mumbai attacks and 9/11 were “ inside jobs , ” much to the chagrin of host and CFR luminary Fareed Zakaria , who told viewers that Gul ’s opinions were “ absolutely wrong and thoroughly discredited ” .
“ When you look at the full spectrum of possibilities , who could have done it , then one knows that Samjhauta Express was a similar case , in which Pakistan ISI was accused .
But it turned out that it was the militant Hindus themselves who had killed 68 passengers in that train , and that it was an inside job , ” said Gul .
“ Now Colonel Srikant Purohit , who is a serving army officer , he has been caught in this particular case .
And the whole thing has turned around . ”
“ So , obviously , there is an inside job . ”
The revelation that Mukhtar Ahmed , a “ counterinsurgency police officer who may have been on an undercover mission ” working for Indian authorities was arrested for illegally buying mobile phone cards used by the Mumbai gunmen , allied with the numerous intelligence warnings proving that the method , arrival and targets of attack were all known well in advance , proves Gul right in his assertion that the terrorists could not have achieved such carnage without help from people on the inside .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Asked by Zakaria , “ What is your hunch as to who did – who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks ? , ” Gul responded , “ Well , I have been on record , and I said it is the Zionists or the neocons .
They have done it .
It was an inside job . ”
“ And they wanted to go on the world conquerors .
They were looking upon it as an opportunity window , when the Muslim world was lying prostrate .
Russia was nowhere in sight .
China was still not an economic giant that is has turned out to be . ”
“ And they thought that this was a good time to go and fill those strategic areas , which are still lying without any American presence .
And , of course , to control the energy tap of the world . ”
“ Presently , it is the Middle East , and in future it is going to be Central Asia , ” added Gul .
Gul told Zakaria that the evidence for 9/11 being planned by Osama Bin Laden and executed by Al - Qaeda has not emerged and that the events are still “ shrouded in mystery ” .
“ A lot of people have a lot of misgivings about that .
And it ’s not only me .
I think a lot of people in America would be thinking the same way .
There are scientists , there are scholars , who have written articles on it , ” added Gul , calling for President elect Barack Obama to set up a new commission to investigate the attacks .
Gul said the attacks were planned inside America by people with a dangerous agenda who have “ turned the world upside - down ” .
Returning from a commercial break , Zakaria , editor of Newsweek , Council on Foreign Relations kingpin and also a Trilateral Commission board member , told his viewers , “ Some of General Gul ’s views are simply false .
There is a mountain of evidence about 9/11 that refutes his assertions , ” but Zakaria failed to cite any of it .
Zakaria was then joined by counter - insurgency expert David Kilcullen who said that the Mumbai attacks bore all the hallmarks of a “ clandestine operation or a covert operation style activity , ” but when pressed he refused to directly implicate Pakistan in the attack .

Fermi's Paradox ( i.e. Where are They ? )
So what Fermi immediately realized was that the aliens have had more than enough time to pepper the Galaxy with their presence .
But looking around , he did n't see any clear indication that they 're out and about .
This prompted Fermi to ask what was ( to him ) an obvious question : " where is everybody ? "
This sounds a bit silly at first .
The fact that aliens do n't seem to be walking our planet apparently implies that there are no extraterrestrials anywhere among the vast tracts of the Galaxy .
Many researchers consider this to be a radical conclusion to draw from such a simple observation .
Surely there is a straightforward explanation for what has become known as the Fermi Paradox .
There must be some way to account for our apparent loneliness in a galaxy that we assume is filled with other clever beings .
Solutions to Fermi's Paradox
They Are Here
They Were Here and They Left Evidence
UFO's , Ancient Astronauts , Alien Artifacts : all fall under the heading of proposals that aliens are here now ( and they call themselves Republicans ) or have been here in the recent past .
Problem : evidence for aliens is non-existent .
They Are Us
Humans are the descendents of ancient alien civilizations .
Problem : where are the original aliens ?
Where are all the other alien civilizations
Zoo / Interdict Scenario
The aliens are here , and they are keeping us in a well designed zoo ( cut off from all contact ) or there is an interdiction treaty to prevent contact with young races ( us ) .
Problem : scenario lacks the ability to be tested .
Takes only one ET to break embargo .
They Exist But Have Not Yet Communicated
They Have Not Had Time To Reach Us
Speed of light slows communication levels , relativity makes space travel long .
ET 's message may not have reached us yet .
Problem : Galaxy has been around for billions of years , even if one ET civilization formed a few million years before us , the Galaxy would be filled with Bracewell - von Neumann probes .
They Are Signaling , But We Do Not Know How To Listen
EM radiation , gravity waves , exotic particles are all examples of methods to signal .
Problem : they may use methods we have not learned yet , but if there are many civilizations someone would use EM methods .
Berserkers
The Galaxy is filled with killer robots looking for signals .
ET is keeping low .
Problem : where are the berserkers coming after us ?
They Have No Desire To Communicate
ET has no interest in conversing with lesser beings .
Problem : with millions of possible civilizations , someone would have some curiosity .
They Develop Different Mathematics
Mathematics is the universal language .
But humankind may have a unique system of mathematics that ET cannot understand .
Problem : then where are their incomprehensible signals ?
Catastrophes
Civilizations only have a limited lifetime , They are all dead .
Overpopulation
Nanobots -> Gray Goo Problem
Dangerous Particle Physics
They Do Not Exist
We are the First , Life is New to the Galaxy
Life is new to the Galaxy , evolution takes time , we are the first civilization .
Problem :
Sun is average star , if other stars formed a million years ahead of us , then They would be a million years ahead of us in technology .
Planets With the Right Conditions are Rare
Planetary systems are rare
Habitable zones , proper distance from star for liquid water , are narrow
Galaxy is a dangerous place ( gamma - ray bursters , asteroid impacts , etc )
Earth / Moon system is unique ( large tides needed for molecular evolution )
Life Is Rare
Life 's Genesis is rare
Intelligence / Tool - Making is rare
Language is unique to humans
Technology / Science is not inevitable
In general , solutions to Fermi's paradox come down to either 1 ) life is difficult to start and evolve ( either hard for the process or hard to find the right conditions ) or 2 ) advanced civilizations destroy themselves on short timescales .
In other words , this is an important problem to solve in the hope that it is 1 and not 2 .
The Big Picture
Very little experimental evidence for our current view of the structure of the Universe , so we depend on our sense of beauty .
Where beauty here does not imply aesthetics , but rather conciseness , economy of concepts , brevity of mathematical expression , breadth of application .
Central to the beauty of our theories of how the Universe works is symmetry as expressed by Neother 's theorem , a statement that for every continuous symmetry there exists a conservation law .
Invariance of the laws of Nature to spatial translation , temporal translation and rotation means conservation of energy , mass and angular momentum .
One symmetry that is * not* conserved is mirror symmetry .
CP violation shows us that the Universe is chiral , a fancy word that means parity or handy - ness .
So the Universe does distinguish between left and right handed interactions , Nature looks different in a mirror .
Finding symmetries in a theory is important .
By finding symmetries that a theory does not possess , a broken symmetry , is even more important .
When dealing with particles and their interactions , global symmetry makes no sense ( why should the behavior of particles here on Earth have any effect on observations of particles on distant stars ) .
Instead we restore symmetry through the use of a gauge field , a field that carries the information of symmetry around the Universe .
For example , by demanding that electromagnetism obey local gauge symmetry we are forced to accept the existence of electromagnetic fields and the massless gauge boson is the photon .
Similar requirements on all quantum fields produces quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) .
Objects in uniform motion or acceleration must also obey the laws of Nature , thus imposing local symmetry on motion forces a new field , the gravitational field described by general relativity , to appear .
The Standard Model is incomplete as it does not specify the values of fundamental constants nor does it combine with gravity .
Two possible avenues for extensions of the Standard Model are grand unified theories ( GUTs ) and supersymmetry ( SUSY ) .
To unify weak and electromagnetism we simply write down a theory with enough gauge symmetry to accommodate the four mediators bosons ( photon , W+ , W - and Z o ) .
Through the use of the Higgs mechanism ( where a general field fills the Universe in which particles can interact to acquire mass ) , we break the symmetry to get three massive bosons ( W+ , W- , Z o ) and one massless boson ( the photon ) .
To unify gluons with the other sub-atomic force carriers we need a new , larger gauge symmetry to bring everyone together .
A new symmetry would make the distinction between quarks and leptons go away ( at least until the symmetry break , until then we have GUT matter ) .
One consequence of quark / lepton symmetry is that protons , once thought to be stable , must decay under GUT .
However , this is a problem for GUT as current experiments have not been able to detect proton decay and its half - life must be greater than 1032 years .
We are also unable to experiment at the GUT level as we would need to force quarks within a radius of 10 - 31 meters in order to exchange a GUT boson .
This would require energies on the order of 1015 GeV which is 1013 times greater than our current technology .
But , ultimately , GUT fails due to the gauge hierarchy problem , the fact that the difference between the electroweak and GUT symmetry breaking points implies two difference masses for the Higgs boson ( 102 GeV vs. 1015 GeV ) means the GUT is insufficient .
To have a complete set of all possible spacetime symmetries , one symmetry is missing in the Standard Model .
This would be the ability to transform particles into different particles , ones with different spin .
This symmetry , called supersymmetry , transforms fermions into bosons and vice versa .
Thus , the distinction between particles of matter ( fermions ) and particles of force ( bosons ) would blur .
Evidence of supersymmetry would show us that Nature has utilized all mathematically consistent spacetime symmetries .
Supersymmetry ( SUSY ) has the initial advantage of solving the gauge hierarchy problem under SUSY GUT through the introduction of a whole set of supersymmetric partners to each known particle .
Requiring a local symmetry for supersymmetry forces two gauge fields , one that communicates information about transformations and a second that communicates information about translation in spacetime using massless spin - 2 particles .
A massless spin - 2 particle is one that carries a long - range force that is only attractive , i.e. gravity and the particle is the graviton .
So supersymmetry automatically contains a gravitational field theory .
Thus , local supersymmetry is called supergravity since general relativity appears naturally when SUSY is made local .
When supergravity breaks , what is left is a low energy supersymmetric grand unified theory ( GUT ) .
The first attempt to explore other dimensions beyond the four of spacetime was Kaluza - Klein theory , a description of spacetime using five dimensions .
From a 5D theory , 4D forms of both electromagnetism and general relativity appear naturally .
The extra dimension is associated with the sub-atomic world in order to explain `where ' this dimension is .
The original formulation of the Kaluza - Klein theory had the 5th dimension as circular , so that we need four coordinates to describe a normal event ( three spatial and one of time ) plus an additional coordinate to specify a position on the circle .
So imagine a garden hose , from a distance it looks like a line , but close up we could see an ant moving backwards and forward on the hose plus around the hose .
If this additional dimension is smaller than the radius of an atom , then we would not detect or measure its presence .
The small size on this extra dimension is explained by inflation , the 4D universe inflated leaving behind the 5th dimension to compact into very small scale size .
Kaluza - Klein theory fails to resolve several problems , especially in the quantum realm , but the idea of using extra dimensions is revisited in the early 1980's .
The new twist is instead of considering a single extra dimension , modern theory supposes that at each point in spacetime there is a compact space with many dimensions , a manifold at each point .
The minimum number of dimensions that at compact manifold could possess , and still maintain symmetry , is seven , making the minimum of dimensions for spacetime to be 11 .
Interestingly enough , the maximum number of dimensions one can write down for a consistent supergravity theory is also 11 .
Unfortunately , 11D supergravity does not quite work .
While it may be an effective theory that works at low energies , it can not be the final theory of everything , mostly because of a problem with infinities .
Quantum field theory treats objects like quarks and leptons as point - like .
But calculations dealing with gravitons eventually encounter infinities , which is a sign that the theory is flawed .
One approach to resolve this dilemma is to abandon point - like particles and consider 1D strings .
Strings come in two types , open ( like a line segment ) and closed ( like a loop ) .
An open string moving through spacetime traces out a sheet .
A closed string will trace out a tube .
Combining string theory with supersymmetry produced superstring theory which was a 10D spacetime ( one short of supergravity ) .
Superstring must be embedded inside a larger theory , called M - theory .
M- theory contains objects called branes which do not correspond to oscillation states of strings .
Branes can come in any number of dimensions , a 2D brane would be a sheet or membrane .
The energy of a brane is concentrated on its surface , its energy density is its tension .
Under this view , branes form the structure of the Universe and all the Standard Model fields are restrict to the brane , but closed strings ( like gravity ) are free to travel between branes .
The collection of branes would form a bulk of many brane walls .
So the final version of the structure of the Universe is a series of branes , each containing the 4D macroscopic world and a compactified 6D manifold that the Standard Model operates in the microscopic world .
The collection of branes forms a bulk in 11D spacetime , only gravitons can travel between the branes ( explaining why it is so weak as a force as it is `spread ' over the bulk ) .
Thus , in a real sense , there are many parallel Universes nearby in the bulk on other branes .
When branes collides you can have a realize of energy ( i.e. the Big Bang ) and inflation to form many multiverses in a brane .

Guess what ?
We still need you to submit good articles about software you like !
Do you want to help out the Debian ( or Ubuntu ) project with some mirror bandwidth but do n’t know how ?
Do you want to contribute somehow to Debian ’s infrastructure , but you ’re not a coder ?
Tired of getting slow download speeds when the mirrors are overloaded after a new release ?
Then Apt - P2P is for you .
After installing the apt - p2 p package and making some minor changes to apt ’s sources , all the files you download with apt ( or aptitude , synaptic , gnome - apt , etc… ) will be shared with other users , and any files you download will use other users ( peers ) to download from .
However , if no other users have the file you want there ’s no need to worry , Apt - P2P will happily fall back to downloading directly from the mirror so your download will not fail .
How it works
Apt -P2P is a daemon that runs in the background , responding to any requests from apt for files to download , and sharing any downloaded files with other users .
The sharing is all done using HTTP , so it operates as both a server for the requests from apt and other peers , and as a client to download from other peers and mirrors .
Also , if you go to http://localhost:9977/ in your browser on the machine Apt - P2P is running on , you will get a nice statistical display of what it is doing .
The main operation of Apt - P2P is the maintenance of a Distributed Hash Table ( DHT ) used to find and store peers to download from for each file .
Whenever you download a file , apt - 2 p will first lookup the SHA1 hash of the file in the DHT .
If it is found and has peers listed , then the downloading will occur from the peers ( if there are only 1 or 2 peers , the mirror is used as well to speed up the download ) .
If it is not found then the file is requested directly from the mirror .
Once the download is complete , a new value is added to the DHT using the SHA1 hash of the file as the key , and including your contact info , so that other peers can then find you to download the file from .
That ’s just a brief overview , but there are many hidden details that make things go smoother .
For example , for larger files the SHA1 hashes of pieces of the file are stored in the DHT as well , which allows downloaders to break up large files among several peers to get better download speeds ( similar to BitTorrent ) .
For more information , you can go to the Apt - P2P home page : http://www.camrdale.org/apt-p2p/.
Comparison with other P2P programs
Other than DebTorrent , there are n’t any other peer - to - peer downloaders available for apt .
There was apt - torrent , but it was never packaged in Debian , and now seems to be dead ( no updates in 18 months ) .
Comparing Apt - P2P with DebTorrent , Apt - P2P :
Is faster at downloading from mirrors .
Uses much less memory and a little less CPU .
Can download almost all files ( source files , Packages.bz2 , etc… ) from peers , not just .deb packages .
, etc… ) from peers , not just packages .
Works with only the information apt has , no need for other files .
Does n’t require a new apt transport for communicating with apt .
Is more modular and easier to understand as it is based on existing technologies ( e.g. twisted ) .
Setup
Apt -P2P is available in testing ( lenny ) and unstable ( sid ) , and will be available in Intrepid for Ubuntu .
It can be installed by aptitude install apt - p2 p .
First , it is VERY important to set up port forwarding if your machine is behind a firewall or router / NAT .
The default port you need to forward is 9977 , both UDP and TCP .
More information on how to determine if you are reachable can be found here .
Setting up apt to use Apt - P2P as a proxy is easy , especially if you have used other proxy software ( e.g. apt - proxy , apt - cacher , approx ) in the past .
The configuration change is the same , simply adding a localhost :9977 / to the front of the entries in your /etc/apt/ sources .
list file .
For example , if you previously had this :
# Official deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free deb-src
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free # Security Updates deb http://security.debian.org/
etch /updates main contrib non-free deb-src
http://security.debian.org/
etch /updates main contrib non-free # Unofficial deb
http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted deb-src
http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted # Backports deb
http://www.backports.org/debian etch - backports main contrib non-free deb-src
http://www.backports.org/debian etch - backports main contrib non-free
Then , if you only want to share the official and backported packages , you would change it to this :
# Official deb http://localhost:9977/ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free deb-src
http://localhost:9977/ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free # Security Updates deb http://security.debian.org/
etch /updates main contrib non-free deb-src
http://security.debian.org/
etch /updates main contrib non-free # Unofficial deb
http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted deb-src
http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted # Backports deb
http://localhost:9977/www.backports.org/debian etch - backports main contrib non-free deb-src
http://localhost:9977/www.backports.org/debian etch - backports main contrib non-free
Then , run an apt - get update and start installing packages .
The apt - p2 p package is fairly new , so it ’s available only in the testing and unstable distributions of Debian , and in the just released Intrepid Ibex , from Ubuntu .
It ’s not often that new user interface conventions are born – or popularized .
Even less so within the realm of web development .
I ’d argue that Sparklines and Lightbox are two of the best examples of UI conventions that were popularized on the web .
Recently Maxime Haineault announced a simple jQuery plugin for inputting a new time of day called jQuery.timepickr.js .
Its principles are very similar to jQuery itself :
Get users to input the time as simply as possible with as little input as possible .
To achieve this he made a “ two click ” time picker .
The first click is within the time field .
This activates the display and allows the user to choose the time – all of which is done by moving the mouse over the times that you desire .
The final click is anywhere – filling in the time that was chosen .
It ’s hard to explain , you simply have to try it .
One thing that you ’ll notice using it is that it ’s fast .
Very fast .
I ’d argue much faster than clicking into the input area , moving to the keyboard for entering the time , typing the time , then moving back to mouse .
But not only is it faster , but it ’s also quite intuitive – which is rather rare for something that utilizes a completely new user interface convention .
A nice extra point is that the input is completely styled using the jQuery UI style conventions – which means that you ’ll be able to customize it completely with the jQuery UI Themeroller .
I love the Themeroller and use it all the time to customize UI controls .
It beats the pants off of any other UI customization tool that I ’ve seen .
Definitely give it a whirl .
Consistently styling JavaScript user interface components can be incredibly annoying , but the Themeroller helps to make it sane – which is just perfect .
Attendees can get some pretty cool swag at big conventions , but I have yet to see a product as functionally hysterical as this sperm - shaped USB drive handed out at the American Society For Reproductive Medicine 's ( ASRM ) 2008 conference .
I 'll tell you what — whipping this thing out at while using your laptop at Starbucks should prove interesting .

While campaigning in Iowa this week , John McCain offered a glimmer of new support for the ethanol industry that he has long been opposed to .
In general it is thought that rural America feels more closely aligned with the Republican Party ’s conservative social views .
However , right now it ’s the Democrats who support the ethanol and subsidy policies that help so many farmers in the middle of the country to stay afloat .
Corn growers from across the nation are heading to the polls next week , and many are still feeling confused .
John Wallbrown owns a 2,800 - acre farm in Portage County , Ohio .
He said that he has heard from peers who are upset with the Republican Party , and though he still plans to cast his ballot for McCain , he told the Beacon Journal in Ohio that : ” McCain will probably lose some votes this year . ”
Historically McCain and Obama have not agreed on the issue of farm subsidies .
Subsidies offer a financial safety net for farmers across the nation , whose livelihoods are very tied to the whims of nature .
McCain has been opposed to them , while Obama has offered support .
[ social_buttons ]
This week , however , McCain softened his stance on ethanol , while campaigning in Iowa .
Mr. McCain ’s views on ethanol have not helped him to gain support in Iowa , a state where he trails behind Barack Obama in the double digits .
Speaking to an audience at the University of Northern Iowa , McCain said , “ We ’ll invest in all energy alternatives : nuclear , wind , tide , solar , ethanol , biofuels . ”
Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , also brought up ethanol while campaigning in Iowa , calling for “ harnessing alternative sources like the wind , and the solar and the biomass and the geothermal and the ethanol . ”
Of course McCain did not outwardly state that he wants to support the tariffs and multi-billion dollar government subsidies that allow the American corn ethanol industry to continue .
But , as Larry Rohter of the New York Times points out : “ … the economic logic contained in the position he stated here points almost inevitably in that direction . ”

Music 's Top 5 Lip - Sync Scandals After " SNL , " Kanye
West is the latest artist accused of faking it on stage .
Dec. 16 , 2008  --
No one ever said it would be easy , Yeezy .
Kanye
West added himself to the roster of music 's most infamous on - stage mishaps Saturday when he failed to nail his performance of " Love Lockdown " on " Saturday Night Live . "
To be fair , West 's greatest strengths lie in rapping and producing .
" Love Lockdown " and the album from which it hails , " 808's and Heartbreak , " is West 's first foray into singing .
But whether by fault of his own or because of his audio equipment , his attempt to serenade " SNL's " audience came off as feeble at best , fueling rumors that he requires a little help in the vocals department .
Ashlee Simpson , Britney Spears , Madonna and Milli Vanilli -- to greater and lesser degrees , they 've all been accused of the same thing .
Check out the performances that stirred scandal , and the verdict on whether or not each artist committed what many fans regard as the greatest on - stage sin of all : lip -syncing .
Kanye West
From the moment
West got on the mic at " SNL , " it was clear something was n't right .
Rob Levine , executive editor of Billboard magazine , speculated West 's weak voice had to do with a glitch in the autotune feature many artists use to stay on pitch while recording in the studio and rocking out live .
" Autotune allows you to hit every note perfectly .
You 're not going to be sharp or flat , " Levine said .
" I think the effect was n't fully realized , [ the autotune ] might have been set up wrong .
But it 's foolish to suggest he was lip-syncing .
If he were lip - syncing , it would 've sounded exactly the way he wanted it to . "
But even if West did n't lip-sync , Tyler Gray , Blender magazine 's senior editor , is n't letting him off the hook .
" He was cheating .
At the end of the day , did he make up for that lackluster element of his performance with something that balanced it out ?
I do n't really think so .
It was neat visuals , but the music was n't quite up to par , " said Gray .
" In the beginning , he got an A for effort because he was trying to break the mold , " Gray said , referring to West 's branching out from typical hip - hop techniques .
" But the effort grade only goes so far .
Now he actually has to sound good .
And he did n't .
He sounded like a bad talent show . "
Britney Spears
With pop stars like Britney Spears , it 's all but expected that lip - syncing will go hand in hand with a live performance .
Levine called it an open secret in the music industry , the product of audiences expecting artists to sound the same on albums and on stage .
Do Fans Come to Hear Britney or See Britney ?
" Traditionally , jazz and opera had singers who were technically great singers , whereas in rock you had singers .
But if they were a little sharp or a little flat , but no one really cared because they were n't expected to be perfect , " he said .
" As pop music becomes more artificially perfect , kids who grew up on that aesthetic want that perfection .
When you 're used to everything being on pitch , you do n't want to hear anything else . "
As a result , stars like Spears often perform with backup tracks to ensure they sound as perky and on pitch on stage as they do on their albums , after producers spend hours fine - tuning their voices .
Spears ' November performance of " Womanizer " on the U.K. TV show " The X Factor " was panned by critics because she reportedly lip - synced although " X Factor " judge Simon Cowell did n't seem to mind .
The " American Idol " mainstay gave the rebounding pop icon a standing ovation after her gig .
Levine thinks fans should stop expecting everything from Spears and her ilk .
" No one is going to go see Britney because she 's a great musician , " he said .
" She 's a good singer , but she 's a personality .
She 's a phenomenon .
She 's not an artist , she 's a pop star . " .
But Tyler argued that Spears could up the ante , saying her " dancing is pretty physical but it's not so grueling that she should n't be able to sing as well . "
Madonna
Unlike Spears , Madonna 's routine on her Sticky & Sweet world jaunt and on tours past is more suited to marathon runners than musicians .
The 50 - year - old queen of pop performs high kicks and running jumps as she bounds across stage , yet never seems to struggle for breath .
It 's a tell - tale sign she 's probably performing with a backup voice track .
" If you look at the way pop stars perform , the way they 're twirling , running , being carried , dancing on the stripper pole upside down -- they can't possibly be singing every word of every verse , " said Levine .
" A lot of times it 's blended , they might be singing with a safety net .
Any pop singer putting on a full dancing show is not singing every word in those songs .
The fact that they 're not breathing hard should be enough to clue you in . "
At London 's annual Q Awards show in 2004 , Elton John bashed the pop star for not performing up to par on her Re-Invention tour , saying " Madonna , best f-- live act ?
F-- off .
Since when has lip - syncing been live ?
Anyone who lip - syncs in public on stage when you pay [ about $ 169 per ticket ] to see them should be shot . "
Madonna Denies Lip - Syncing
Liz Rosenberg , the Material Girl 's publicist , shot back , " Madonna does not lip - sync , nor does she spend her time trashing other artists .
She sang every note of her Re-Invention tour live and is not ashamed that she was paid well for her hard work . "
The debate did n't stop there .
In an attempt to help out his pop star friend , actor Rupert Everett added fuel to the fire , telling the British press , " Madonna sings everything she can sing .
...
But , if she goes into a dance routine , she 's got to dance .
You can't breathe and dance and sing at the same time . "
Ashlee Simpson
Some stars could n't cry libel or count on their celeb friends for defense when it comes to lip - syncing accusations .
Ashlee Simpson , the pop-punk younger sister of Jessica Simpson , learned that after her headline - making October 2004 blunder on " Saturday Night Live . "
Attempting to perform " Autobiography , " her second song of the night , Simpson found herself singing along to the music and lead vocals of her first song " Pieces of Me . "
She held the microphone at her side as her canned voice boomed across the studio , danced an awkward jig and then ran off the stage as the vocal recording was shut off and NBC cut away to a commercial .
At the end of the show , " SNL " host of the night Jude Law quipped , " What can I say ?
Live TV . "
Simpson , standing next to him , blamed the mishap on her musicians .
" My band started playing the wrong song , " she said .
" I did n't know what to do so I thought I 'd do a hoedown . "
A statement issued by Geffen Records , Simpson 's label , claimed there was " a computer glitch , " while a representative for the show said that the song that came up was a backing track .
The following Monday , Simpson called into MTV's " Total Request Live " and explained that because of complications arising from " severe " acid reflux she had lost her voice and that her doctor had advised her not to sing .
But the incident tarnished Simpson 's rep for months .
In January 2005 , Simpson performed " La La " during the halftime show for the Orange Bowl in Miami and got boos from the crowd of more than 70,000 spectators .
Simpson attempted to build credibility in '05 with a U.S. - Canada tour that she described to reporters as " stripped down , " without effects like pyrotechnics , just " me and my band getting out there and having fun . "
Milli Vanilli
Then there are the lip -sync scandals that taint an act for life .
In 1989 , the dreadlocked duo from Deutschland were performing their hit " Girl You Know It 's True " during an MTV - recorded show in Bristol , Conn. , when their vocal track began to skip .
While fans at the concert did n't seem to care , critics took note and began questioning the merits of Milli Vanilli members Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan .
Lip - Syncing No Longer Shocking
A year later , in November 1990 , press scrutiny led the group 's manager to reveal that Milli Vanilli did n't actually sing on their Grammy and American Music Award - winning records .
Four days later , the band 's 1990 best new artist Grammy was withdrawn .
Arista Records dropped the duo from its roster and deleted their album from their catalog , taking " Girl You Know It 's True " out of print .
Despite subsequent albums and attempts at a comeback , Milli Vanilli never shed their status as one of pop music 's most legendary cautionary tales , an example never to be repeated by reputable artists .
Though , Levine emphasizes , nearly two decades after the Milli Vanilli debacle , lip - syncing is still going strong .
" Years ago , when it was revealed that Milli Vanilli was lip - syncing , it was practically a scandal .
People were honest to God shocked , " he said .
" These days , anyone who 's the least bit surprised by this is really naive . "
After settling the long - time disputes with the UFC , Captain America Randy Couture stepped inside the octagon one more time for his second heavyweight title defense against the former WWE superstar Brock Lesnar .
The size difference of the two was obvious .
When the two stepped inside the octagon , it looked like a Ford pickup parked in front of a Honda Civic .
The fight ended in the second round with Brock ’s powerful straight right catching Randy in the left temple , followed by many hammer - fists from hell .
Despite his old age , the large size difference , and not fighting for more than a year , Randy Couture , classy as always , made no excuses about his loss and congratulated the new UFC heavyweight champion .
Next time , Brock will be facing the winner of Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira ( The UFC Interim heavyweight champion and an MMA legend who had only lost to the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world – Fedor Emelianenko ) and Frank Mir ( The former UFC heavyweight champion who submitted Brock Lesnar during his first fight in the UFC ) .

( UWIRE ) --
More than 3,000 educators nationwide , including six Brown University professors , have signed a statement supporting William Ayers -- the man Republican presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain called a " washed - up terrorist " at the third presidential debate .
In recent months , the McCain campaign has criticized Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama for his connection to Ayers .
McCain and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin , have accused Obama of being " friends " with Ayers and claimed Obama has hidden the extent of their relationship .
Both residents of the Chicago , Illinois , area , Ayers and Obama first met in 1995 when they served on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , a school reform initiative .
They also were board members of the Woods Fund , a Chicago charity , from 2000 to 2002 .
Ayers , now a distinguished professor of education and senior university scholar at the University of Illinois at Chicago , was a co-founding member of the radical activist group the Weather Underground in 1969 .
The group 's extreme tactics to end the Vietnam War included planting bombs in the Pentagon and the United States Capitol .
In response to the McCain campaign 's focus on Ayers ' radical acts of the 1960s and 1970s , " Friends and supporters of Bill Ayers " are circulating a statement online to vouch for the professor he has become .
" I think he 's doing a lot of positive , progressive , constructive work right now , " said Brown University English professor William Keach , the first member of the university 's faculty to sign the statement of support .
Keach was referring to Ayers 's work in the field of education .
As a professor , Ayers has written more than a dozen books on his holistic approach to learning that downplays the boundaries between teacher and student .
Ayers was one of the original proponents of " free schools , " where students call teachers by their first names and do n't receive grades on assignments .

Constance Crawford , an adjunct lecturer in theater , speech and dance , was educated in free schools and said she disagrees with the concept , favoring a more traditional approach .
But she signed the statement supporting Ayers , and said his ideas " should be combated with clarity , not with personal demonization and vilification . "
Keach voiced a similar opinion regarding Ayers 's involvement with the Weather Underground , saying he " disagree (s ) with Ayers 's tactics , " but he signed the statement " without any hesitation . "
Keach also protested the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s , and said he wanted to show " solidarity " with Ayers .
He said he wished Obama could have done the same when Ayers came up during the third debate .
" He 's being unnecessarily cautious , " Keach said .
Ayers entered the debate in the context of a question about both sides ' negative campaigning .
Ayers hosted a coffee event for Obama 's first office run in 1995 , prompting McCain to say to Obama , " You launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers ' living room . "
Obama responded , saying , " Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign .
He has never been involved in this campaign .
And he will not advise me in the White House . "
Keach thinks " it 's disturbing that he had to take such a dismissive approach . "
He added Obama could have " brought up the positive things about the person ( Ayers ) has become . "
Crawford signed the statement supporting Ayers because she thinks it is necessary to appreciate the man 's accomplishments , not just what she calls the mistakes of his past .
" It 's easy to paint someone with a broad brush , " she said .
" It 's easy to vilify , but it 's harder to consider . "

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) has released its year - end list of the “ top ” 10 ethics scandals of 2008 .
Why is n’t the recent criminal complaint against Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich on the list ?
Well , for one , it ’s not a Washington - centered problem .
But Melanie Sloan , CREW ’s executive director , adds that while the Blagojevich case may be the flavor of the week right now , she thinks the scandals on her administration ’s list will have more of an impact in the long run .
Here they are :
1. “ Unchecked Congressional Ethics ” : CREW wants Congress to have a high - powered ethics office with subpoena power .
MoJo Blog covered the vote on this earlier this year ; we looked at this issue last year , too .
2. “ No Guarantee that Bush Administration Records will be Properly Archived ” : We ’ve been keeping you up to date on the ongoing missing White House emails problem .
3. “ Speech or Debate Clause ” : Lots of politicians who are charged with crimes seek to have their indictments dismissed under the “ Speech and Debate ” clause of the Constitution , which they claim protects anything in their congressional office from being used against them in court on the grounds that its “ legislative material . ”
Sloan says that this may be the biggest of the ten scandals her organization highlighted .
If Blagocevich had been a member of congress , Sloan says , he would have been protected from much of US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald ’s investigation .
Law enforcement would not have been able to tap his office phone or include anything he did in the course of his legislative work as part of an indictment , Sloan says .
And both Democrats and Republicans are protecting this hard - line interpretation of the speech and debate clause .
“ This is a bipartisan issue of protecting members accused of corruption from investigation and prosecution , ” Sloan says .
Mother Jones covered this problem as early as 2006 , with the raid on the offices of now ex-Louisiana Democratic Rep. William Jefferson .
4. “ The Pay - to - Play Congress ” :
You ’ve heard about this from John McCain and Barack Obama , who both talked about the power of earmarks to corrupt the legislative process .
Every year , CREW notes the most egregious instances of earmark abuse , when campaign donors get earmarks from the politicians who they support .
We wrote about corruption expert Lawrence Lessig ’s Change Congress effort and will have more with Lessig next week .
5. “ Enriching Family with Campaign Cash ” : CREW has released two reports on this problem , “ Family Affair – House ” and “ Family Affair – Senate . ”
We noted the most recent offender , Charlie Rangel .
6. “ Controversial Presidential Pardons ” :
The president ’s pardon power is essentially unlimited , and that has CREW worried about what President Bush will do with it before he leaves office .
Elizabeth Gettelman wrote about the hypocrisy of commuting Scooter Libby ’s sentence but ignoring Marion Jones .
And Bruce Falconer asked if pardoning “ all those involved in the application of what [ the Bush ] administration called ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ' ” would be wise .
7. “ VA Officials Intentionally Misdiagnosing PTSD ” : CREW broke a story earlier this year about VA officials being pressed to misdiagnose Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder as a cost - cutting measure .
In September , Bruce Falconer wrote a story for the print magazine about whether the Bush administration had “ maxed out the military . ”
8. “ Bailout Oversight ” :
The government spent $ 700 billion and all you got was a few bank failures .
We ’ve covered the hearings and brought you the latest .
Most recently , we looked at the Fannie / Freddie bailout and asked about Treasury ’s blank check .
9. “ Political Calculations Dictate Border Fence Placement ” : Ray L.
Hunt has land that falls on both sides of the border fence , but CREW says he ’s getting special treatment because he ’s a Bush “ pioneer . ”
That kind of suction would n’t be unusual for Hunt : in July , Laura Rozen wrote about how Hunt seems to have almost unlimited access to the White House ( and , in this case , to Kurdish oil . )
10 . “ A Politicized Bush Justice Department ” :
To prevent the abuse of the courts for political ends , the DOJ was traditionally the least - politicized of all the executive branch departments .
That all changed when Bush took office .
In 2007 , Daniel Schulman was among the first to document how the conservative Federalist society may have influenced personnel decisions at the DOJ .
Stephanie Mencimer covered another interesting aspect of this story in May when she examined the Justice Department ’s reluctance to release documents from the 2002 GOP phone - jamming in New Hampshire .
And Stephanie was also there for the most unsurprising moment of the DOJ politicization saga : Karl Rove ’s failure to show up for a hearing on the subject in July .
It seems unlikely that the first year of the Obama administration will match up to the last year of the Bush administration in terms of ethics - scandal - potential .
But we ’ll be here , keeping an eye on everyone , Barack Obama included .
Stick with us .

Video : Next Prop 8 ad = Children 's book fear - mongering
by Jeremy Hooper
Those who wish to use majority tyranny to roll back the constitutional equality of a minority / suspect class will today put out a new ad featuring Robb and Robin Wirthlin , a Massachusetts couple who have parlayed their personal fight to keep gay - inclusive children 's books out of the classroom into a " warning sign " of the " ills " that gay marriage will bring to society .
The ad itself has yet to be released ; however , the " yes on 8 " folks have released a longer video wherein the Wirthlins tell their martyr status - seeking story :
Oh , per your closing comments , Robin :
We do n't tolerate bigotry .
Never .
Not ever .
Not gonna happen .
Sorry .
No , wait a minute -- we 're actually not sorry .
In fact , we 're pretty unapologetic about and proud of our non-support for bias .
We stand against discriminatory mindsets because they are wrong .
And nasty .
And cruel .
And against everything for which we as a society should be striving .
" Tolerating " your blatant non-acceptance of our benign right to exist ( which you 've fully highlighted in another video , which readers can find below ) is not intolerance -- it is refusing to allow short - sighted , narrow - minded , myopic world views to set the agenda for society .
The only endgame is for you to STOP TRYING TO FOIST YOUR PERSONAL BIASES ONTO SOCIETY .
You can hold them in your heart and mind , and you can convey them to your friends , family , and loved ones until you are blue in the face .
But when you try and shape public policy on the basis of your own negative learned behavior , we are going to stand up in FIRM opposition !
Thanks for the understanding .
Now go and enjoy your big TV debut day .
Future producers of the 2028 documentary , " An Acceptable Bias : How So Many Otherwise Decent People Supported Such Cruel Discrimination " are certainly glad that you 've committed your non-inclusive views to archival video .
Robb and Robin Wirthlin's Story [ YouTube ]
** Here 's an earlier Wirthlin video ( wherein , peculiarly , the Wirthlins are wearing the almost exact same clothing ) .
Be sure to note that in this video , Robin Wirthlin specifically comes out and says that her family is against homosexuality and that they want to teach their children that such is not " correct behavior " :
My children -- MY CHILDREN ! -- were encouraged to [ : : fights back tears ::] accept others [ G - A - Y ]
** Here 's a still from the yet - to - be - released ad .
It seems that the above video will serve as the basis :
** UPDATE : Here 's the video [ G - A - Y ]

So ... they do n't want their children to learn about the reality of gay marriage .
Hmm ...
Does that mean that they do n't want them to learn that the earth is over 4 billion years old in science class ?
Where will it end ???
Posted by : Bill Ware | Oct 20 , 2008 12:21:58 PM
I think I 'm on to something .
The Ed Randolph guy doing the intro looks just like the head alien in The Invaders .
I 'm surprised that the Wirthlins can move their little fingers .
They must be the newer deluxe model .

I just wanted to say that this is a sad example of parents exaggerating the effects of books with " controversial " topics on their kids .
Parents need to give their kids more credit in what they can understand and not jump to the conclusion that it will warp their children 's minds .
I would also like to point out that if these parents approached these subjects with an open - mind and respect , they might find it easier to communicate with their kids .
This is total panic at it 's worse !
I run http://childrens-bookclub.com/
and we will be discussing this topic in my next post .
I hope you check it out .

What 's up with that lighting in the to - be - released video ?
Are they attempting to brainwash with quasi-sepia ?

I 'm confused .
I 'm trying to think of how I chose to be a heterosexual because of what I learned in math , but nothing 's coming to mind .
Was it that sexy rhombus ?

Ok everyone .
we have one couple since 2003 who 's child had a teacher who told them about gay marriage ( maybe true - maybe not )
The teacher if so trying to be honest about the reality of love for everyone and expresses to the children ..
But it is the teachers choice and in no way does the system make teachers verbalize or teach this to our kids as the commercial says ..
I am hopeful that all parents all over the world take responsiblity on their own and teach their own children about gay marriage , civil rights and the love for you family , friends , partners and all people everywhere .
I can't believe I am living in a society whos people are trying to take away the rights of us and our children and are so blind ..
Kind of like living in the days of old ..
I am so ashamed of these people and can't stand to think that my kids have to grow up with people such as this ..

Background
The loss of a normal airway is devastating .
Attempts to replace large airways have met with serious problems .
Prerequisites for a tissue - engineered replacement are a suitable matrix , cells , ideal mechanical properties , and the absence of antigenicity .
We aimed to bioengineer tubular tracheal matrices , using a tissue - engineering protocol , and to assess the application of this technology in a patient with end - stage airway disease .
Methods
We removed cells and MHC antigens from a human donor trachea , which was then readily colonised by epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem - cell - derived chondrocytes that had been cultured from cells taken from the recipient ( a 30 - year old woman with end - stage bronchomalacia ) .
This graft was then used to replace the recipient 's left main bronchus .
Findings
The graft immediately provided the recipient with a functional airway , improved her quality of life , and had a normal appearance and mechanical properties at 4 months .
The patient had no anti-donor antibodies and was not on immunosuppressive drugs .
Interpretation
The results show that we can produce a cellular , tissue - engineered airway with mechanical properties that allow normal functioning , and which is free from the risks of rejection .
The findings suggest that autologous cells combined with appropriate biomaterials might provide successful treatment for patients with serious clinical disorders .
Funding
Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo , Instituto de Salud Carlos III , Fondo de Investigación Sanitaria , Spain ; Charles Courtenay - Cowlin Fund , University of Bristol ; UK Arthritis Research Campaign ; and the James Tudor Foundation .
Results for Guilford County , where Sarah Palin made her remarks about real Americans in pro-America parts of the country :
McCain / Palin 40.44 % Obama / Biden 58.75%McCain/Palin 40.44 %
Obama 's margin in NC is now 11,690 , up from 11,246 when the first unofficial results were announced in the wee hours of this morning ; the total vote has moved up to 4,248,285 .
UPDATE : Obama 's margin now 13,746 ; total count now 4,272,531 .
Starting to look like a landslide .
Still AWOL .
No explanation .
Not even a gesture , which suggests to me that some in the McCain camp realize they 'd rather release nothing than be implicated in anything that might hurt them after the election .
Only ABC News ' Kate Snow seems to care .
Only this blog has really pursued this story for two long months .
For the record , I find the idea that a vice - presidential candidate refuses to either give a press conference or release full medial records as a dreadful precedent for transparency .
Obama and Biden and McCain have been pathetic as well .
But no one has been as secretive as Palin and no one else has similar strangeness in her medical history .
Presumably the records are there and could have been released easily two months ago .
Unless there really was no vetting at all and the McCain camp is now covering up its own incompetence as well as preparing to throw her under the bus in a few days ' time .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

BRISBANE , Australia , Nov. 29 ( UPI ) -- Australian golfer Don " Dasher " Asher says he got along fine with his chums at a Brisbane golf club until he showed up in a dress .
Asher , 52 , of Redland City was booted from the Wynnum Golf Club men's team after members got upset when they found out he was taking hormones in preparation for a sex - change procedure , The ( Brisbane ) Courier - Mail reported Saturday .

It took an emergency meeting at the club but Asher was given permission to play for the ladies team , a move that 's just fine by him , the newspaper said .
" It feels as though everything is right at last , " said Dasher , whose wife and 27 - year - old son are standing by him .
" It was hard when certain male members were trying to kick me out of the club , but the women have been absolutely lovely . "
He 's already refigured his handicap playing from the women 's tees .
Still , some members wo n't play while he is on the course .
And then there 's the issue off his using the women 's toilet and shower facilities since his transformation to female is n't yet complete .

Impeachable offenses ?
Bruce Fein
Have President Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney committed impeachable offenses for which the duumvirate should be convicted and removed from office by duping then - House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey into supporting legislation authorizing war against Iraq with twin lies — that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had personal ties to Osama bin Laden ’s terrorist network ; and that Saddam had miniaturized nuclear weapons , which could be unleashed by employing al Qaeda as a delivery system ?
The facts – uncontradicted by either Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney – are chronicled in Barton Gellman ’s new book “ Angler . ”
In late September 2002 , Majority Leader Armey met the vice president in H -208 in the Capitol Building .
Mr. Armey was no liberal or RINO ( Republican In Name Only ) .
He adamantly opposed taxes and earned a stellar 97 percent rating from the American Conservative Union during his long years in Congress .
But Mr. Armey initially opposed an Iraqi war authorization because Saddam was no menace to the security of the United States .
If Mr. Armey voted no , he would give political cover to any Democrat or Republican Doubting Thomas to vote likewise and probably foil an Iraqi war resolution .
Mr. Cheney ’s mission was to flip Mr. Armey .
He succeeded by stooping to lies that bettered the instruction of President Clinton ’s perjury in Monicagate that occasioned Mr. Clinton ’s impeachment .
According to Mr. Armey , Mr. Cheney sounded the tocsin that Iraq ’s “ ability to miniaturize weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear , ” had been “ substantially refined since the first Gulf war . ”
They were “ miniaturizing weapons , developing packages that could be moved even by ground personnel . ”
Not a crumb of intelligence supported these falsehoods .
Without any supporting evidence , Mr. Cheney also maintained that al Qaeda was “ working with Saddam Hussein and members of his family . ”
He falsely added that “ we now know [ Iraq ] ha* the ability to develop these [ nuclear ] weapons in a very portable fashion , and they have a delivery system in their relationship with organizations such as al Qaeda . ”
The vice president ’s lies convinced Mr. Armey to vote in favor of the Iraqi war resolution .
Relying on the deceit , the majority leader explained his flip - flop on the floor of Congress : “ If you ’re going to conduct a war on terrorism , then you must stop that person who is most likely and most able to arm the terrorists with those things that will frighten us most . ”
After discovering the truth , Mr. Armey lamented he could probably have prevented the Iraqi war debacle : “ Had I known or believed then what I believe I know now , I would have publicly opposed the resolution right to the bitter end , and I believe I might have stopped it from happening , and I believe I would have done a better service to my country had I done so . ”
Indeed , the war in Iraq has diverted hundreds of billions of dollars that could have been better spent upgrading defenses at home ; strengthened Iran , arch - enemy of the United States ; caused vastly more American deaths and injuries than did the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ; and made the United States less safe by creating new enemies in Iraq by flouting its sovereignty and killing innocent civilians in pursuing genuine insurgents or terrorists .
Under the law of impeachment , Mr. Bush is responsible for the misdeeds of his agents in the executive branch , including the vice president .
James Madison , father of the Constitution , amplified in the House of Representatives that the president would be subject to impeachment , “ if he suffers [ his subordinates ] to perpetrate with impunity high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States , or neglects to superintend their conduct , so as to check their excesses . ”
Vice President Cheney , in contrast to other executive branch officials , does not serve at the pleasure of the president .
But in approaching Mr. Armey in support of Mr. Bush ’s legislative initiative authorizing war against Iraq , Mr. Cheney was acting as Mr. Bush ’s agent for whom the president was accountable .
Article II , section 4 of the Constitution declares the , “ president [ and ] vice president … shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of … high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 65 that impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors are “ political ” offenses because “ they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to society itself . ”
James Iredell , later appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Washington , made explicit at the North Carolina ratification convention that presidential duplicity with Congress over war or comparable matters of great national moment would be an impeachable offense .
Although his statement specifically addressed lies to the Senate , its rationale applies equally to deceit of the House of Representatives to obtain an authorization for war :
“ The president must certainly be punishable for giving false information to the Senate . …
If it should appear that he has not given them full information , but has concealed important intelligence which he ought to have communicated , and by that means induced them to enter into measures injurious to their country , and which they would not have consented to had the true nature of things been disclosed to them – in this case , I ask whether , upon an impeachment for a misdemeanor upon such an account , the Senate would probably favor him . ”
Mr. Armey should be summoned to testify under oath before the House Judiciary Committee about his statements in “ Angler ” implicating Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in lies to dupe the House of Representatives over war in Iraq .
The president and vice president should be given an opportunity to respond under oath but subject to cross-examination .
If the totality of evidence corroborates Mr. Armey ’s recollection , should n’t the House immediately vote to impeach Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney and send their cases for trials in the Senate ?
Would n’t that action honor the original intent of the Founding Fathers that the Bush administration professes to cherish ?

The world 's biggest economies have been hit by the credit crunch
The US economy is still facing " sharp downside risks " to growth , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) .
The Paris - based organisation warns that the credit squeeze has been spreading to other forms of lending , and other financial firms could become insolvent .
It says that another fiscal stimulus could be needed if things get worse .
But it warns that longer term problems , including health care reform and the US budget deficit , must be tackled .
Obama 's challenge
The OECD paints a grim picture of the challenges facing the incoming Obama administration , which takes office on 20 January .
It says that " the US economy is going through an exceptionally difficult period " and despite major policy interventions , it is likely that " activity will get worse before it gets better " .
The OECD suggests that the weakness will continue well into 2010 .
It also warns that " house prices appear to have further to fall , and foreclosures are widely expected to rise . "
The real economy is predicted to decline through 2010
The decline in household wealth of about 20 % , due to falls in the stock and housing markets , is likely to affect spending and household consumption .
The OECD broadly endorses the need for a further stimulus plan , saying that " macroeconomic policy should stand ready to provide a renewed stimulus " .
But it warns that , " given the underlying fiscal situation , the package should aim to be strictly temporary , timely and targeted " - an approach that appears to differ from the plan for big infrastructure projects that President - elect Obama has talked about .
And it adds that in the longer term , " the ageing of the population and other trends put the Federal budget on an unsustainable course " and says that increased tax revenue and controls on spending will be needed .
Financial disruption
The OECD says that " resolving the financial crisis could be a long drawn - out process " , which could require substantial government spending just as in previous banking crises .
It says that the " full effects of the forceful easing of monetary policy will only be felt after financial market conditions normalise " .
So it argues that big rate cuts by the US central bank , the Fed , " appear to be roughly appropriate in light of the adverse effect on real activity " of the credit squeeze , and says that " monetary policy should remain highly accommodative for quite some time to support the economy and the financial system " .
However , it warns that in the long run , the regulatory system needs to be fundamentally reformed , or else the rescue of troubled financial institutions " could inadvertently serve to encourage imprudent behaviour " in the future .
" A major overhaul of regulatory and supervisory policy is necessary to remedy the deficiencies in oversight that the crisis revealed , " the report says .
It also calls for reform of the supervision of mortgage brokers , underwriters and credit agencies to protect borrowers and investors .
And it says , more controversially , that in the long - term " it would be preferable to leave the securitisation of mortgages to the private sector , " eliminating or reducing the role of the big government - sponsored agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which were effectively nationalised by the government earlier this year .
Health care reform
The OECD report has a special chapter highlighting the problems of the US health care system , which was much debated during the recent election campaign .
It points out that , despite spending 15 % of GDP , " the health status of the US population does not appear to fare well by international comparison " .
The OECD endorses the goal of the Obama administration in making progress towards providing health care insurance for all Americans .
However , it appears to give support to the plan proposed by his electoral rival , John McCain , to replace tax subsidies to employers with subsidies to individuals to choose their own health plans that would not be tied to their jobs .
It says the current system is regressive and encourages people to buy expensive plans , as well as reducing job mobility .
But it also suggests that reforms suggested by president - elect Obama , such as a requirement to have health insurance , and regulating insurance companies more tightly so they must accept all applicants , " are likely to be necessary to expand coverage substantially " .
And it warns that the government will have to take tough measures to control costs in state - run Medicare system of health insurance for older people .

Last year it was announced that the New York State Division of Tourism was looking to spend a pretty penny on their campaign which included a revitalization of the classic 31 - year - old " I ♥ New York " logo .
Enter Saatchi & Saatchi , the ad agency that received part of the $ 17 million bucks to get the job done .
And what did they do ?
They added a squirrel , a butterfly and some snow .
How inspired !
The Tribble Agency says the city should invest in a high school kid with access to Microsoft Paint next time .
The UK will soon see the new logo on brochures , and the Times Online explains the aim was allegedly " To show us that New York is a state , not just a city , with 500 campsites , 150 vineyards , 400 golf courses , 45 ski resorts . "
But they ponder how much a little squirrel would get this message across and who would actually buy the new design on a t - shirt , over the classic one .
Wonder what Milton Glaser thinks of all this ... and if he 'll get any kickback .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber killed four people near the U.S. embassy in Kabul Thursday , underscoring Afghanistan ’s deteriorating security , but a U.N. Security Council delegation said the situation was not out of control .
Violence in Afghanistan has reached its worst level this year since U.S. soldiers and their Afghan allies toppled the Taliban in 2001 , raising doubts about international efforts to bring stability despite an increasing number of foreign troops .
The suicide car - bomber blew himself up as military convoy was passing on a road about 150 meters ( yards ) from a traffic junction with access to the U.S. embassy and the Health Ministry .
The presidential palace said four civilians were killed .
Twenty people , all civilians , were wounded , a Health Ministry doctor said .
No one from the U.S. embassy was hurt , an embassy spokesman said .
Most staff were off work for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday .
Later , wrapping up a three - day visit , a delegation of U.N. Security Council ambassadors and envoys said while Afghanistan was going through a sensitive period , there were new grounds for “ cautious optimism . ”
“ Afghanistan is facing a difficult security situation , but not a security crisis .
We should avoid any inclination to disillusionment and frustration , ” said Ambassador Giulio Terzi of Italy .
Terzi listed improving ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan , a recent Afghan cabinet reshuffle and significant drop in opium cultivation as the grounds for optimism .
The delegation met President Hamid Karzai and military commanders of NATO and U.S. - led forces in Afghanistan .
It is expected to publish its findings in coming days .
“ POSITION OF STRENGT H ”
Terzi said the delegation ’s discussions had included the military situation in Afghanistan , where the al Qaeda - backed Taliban have made a come back since 2005 , civilian casualties caused by foreign troops hunting militants , and human rights .
Other issues discussed were regional cooperation and the government ’s reconciliation efforts with the Taliban , he said .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
With the spread of Taliban insurgency more than seven years since their overthrow and no sight of an end to the conflict , the possibility of talks with the insurgents is being considered by the government and its Western allies .
A tentative first step toward talks was taken in September when pro-government Afghan officials and former Taliban met in Saudi Arabia .
The Taliban derided the talks and have said repeatedly they would not enter negotiations as long as foreign troops remained .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Nevertheless , the September meeting offered a glimmer of hope .
Terzi said any dialogue with the insurgents should be made from a position of strength and it should not ruin the democratic gains Afghanistan has achieved since 2001 .
At the same time , he said Afghanistan ’s problems could not be won militarily and there was need for political engagement and a focus on reconstruction efforts .
In another incident Thursday , an Australian special forces soldier was killed by a roadside bomb and two were wounded during an operation against insurgents , the Australian government said .
An alliance official in Kabul said the blast was in the southern province of Uruzgan .
Australia has about 1,000 soldiers in Afghanistan , most in Uruzgan .

Leo used the modus operandi of sharemarket registry bottom feeders , such as David Tweed , and identified a shareholder with a small holding , in this instance a single share in a listed Australian company .
Unlike Mr Tweed , who offers well below market value , Leo paid a generous $ 20 for one Downer EDI share that was trading at $ 4.70 at the time .
After the owner provided an SRN , the Downer EDI share was transferred off - market into the name Bud Gerigar .
" It 's that simple - fill in an off - market transfer form and lodge it with the share registry free of charge , " Leo said .
" No one ever checks it .
They 're just processed and put through . "
To manage its share registry , Downer EDI uses Melbourne - based Computershare , the world 's largest share registry service .
Computershare holds at least 100 million shareholder accounts for more than 14,000 corporations around the world , and manages the share registries of 65 % of the companies listed on the ASX .
Computershare transferred the Downer EDI share to Bud Gerigar even though the new name was a fake .
In order to meet the " L+3 " provisions governing the transfer of shares - which stipulate the transfer must be completed within three days of lodgement of paperwork - ownership was transferred within 48 hours .
Paperwork and a new SRN arrived in the post four days later .
By using an off - market transfer the share changed hands free of stamp duty charges or brokerage - yet another incentive for crime figures to use the unregulated transfer mechanism .
The only hurdle for the transaction was the mandatory use of a black pen - not blue or red .
It seems transferring shares to a budgie is fine with the bureaucracy , as long as it's done in the correct colour ink .
Computershare 's group regional manager for Australia , Mark Davis , said his company was aware of the loopholes in the off - market transfer laws .
Under current regulations , registries such as Computershare are unable to take steps to establish the identity of the transferee .
Mr Davis said the company was aware the loophole could be used to hide shares from the Tax Office .
The company has lobbied for more than a year for the Government , Treasury and regulators to have more stringent regulations introduced .
" Computershare has been aware of deficiencies in the off - market transfer space and has actively raised the issues that it is concerned about with the relevant regulators and has been encouraged by the response that it has received , " Mr Davis said .
" We are very hopeful that the appropriate regulatory changes , in particular to the corporations regulations , will be made in the near term . "
According to Leo , thousands of shareholdings in Australian companies are held in false names .
" I know of one person who had shares held in the name of his dog , " he said .
Another stockbroker , with leading firm Patersons , told BusinessDay : " There was an instance a few years back when it appeared that a listed Australian company had a cat as among its top - 20 shareholders for a time . "
Those who manipulate gaps in the law and flaws in the checks and balances of share registry companies such as Computershare can create a paper trail of false identities that would take years to unravel .
It is now possible for BusinessDay to transfer Bud Gerigar 's share into other false names , pretty much on a weekly basis .
" The point of it all is , in this case it 's one Downer EDI share , " said Leo .
" It could easily be 20,000 BHP or 10,000 Commonwealth Bank shares held in a false name .
Most likely it 's a couple of million options that have been granted in some penny dreadful mining explorer . "
According to Leo , even the cashing of dividend cheques for Bud Gerigar is not a problem - all that needs to be done is for a trust to be set up , which costs as little as $ 400 .
" You could set up the Bud Gerigar trust , establish a bank account in that name , and any cheques to Bud Gerigar can be presented , " said Leo .
" The point is , crooks do n't use such stupid names .
They use common ones , and the rort has been going for so many years there are bank accounts held in names of people who just do n't exist . "
The technique can also be used for more sinister purposes .
For an initial public offering of a company to be successful , it is a listing requirement that a spread of 400 different shareholders exist on the initial register .
Some companies struggle to meet this requirement .
Others have to issue more stock than they would otherwise like to smaller shareholders .
To get around this , companies have been known to issue shares in false names .
" The whole IPO spread requirement is the easiest to get around and to rort , " Leo said .
" If a company is short of 400 names , a sophisticated investor may well approach them and offer to take a parcel of shares , and will agree agree to provide 100 or so different names for that holding to be split among . "
The use of trusts with false names linked to them can also be used to circumvent Australia 's T+3 settlement rule - that payment for shares purchased must be completed within three days .
" You simply transfer the holding using an off - market form with the registry every three days , " Leo said .
" Using this technique , a shareholding can be controlled and held , but not settled , for months on end .
I have seen stockbrokers use this if the share price of a company they have bought collapses .
They just keep spinning the shares through off - market transfers until the share price climbs again .
I had 600,000 shares in one listed company unsettled for months .
I could vote them , but I had n't actually paid my own money for them . "
ASX spokesman Matthew Gibbs conceded that a gap in Australia 's regulations seemed to exist .
" Shares in false names is not as issue that has been raised with ASX , " Mr Gibbs said .
" We do not validate the details of shareholders .
" It 's probably something the companies do .
The requirements for keeping registers are prescribed in the corporations law .
" There are now explicit ASX rules covering this , and it might be an area in the broker - client relationship that is covered by the Corporations Act . "
In August , the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law , Nick Sherry , visited the US to announce a mutual recognition arrangement between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Australia .
It allows Australians to buy US shares and vice versa .
At the time , Senator Sherry said Australia was selected by the US " on the basis of the quality of our regulation " .
" They ( the SEC ) have recognised that Australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the US will recognise Australia 's robustness and regulatory oversight , " he said .
A spokeswoman for Senator Sherry said : " Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter - Terrorism Financing Act 2006 , it is an offence to provide false or misleading information to a reporting entity .
" In regards to the avoidance of tax , this would only occur if the shareholder illegally decides not to declare any gains . "
What is the minister 's response to news that a budgie can own shares on the Australian sharemarket ?
Does the minister believe there are problems in the regulations governing off - market transfer of shares ?
Is the minister aware that off - market transfers of shares can be used to avoid paying tax ?
Is the minister aware that the off - market transfer of shares can be used to circumvent the T+3 settlement requirement on share purchases ?
Is the minister aware that Treasury was advised of these flaws in off - market transfer regulations by Computershare more than a year ago ?
Will the minister commit to amending the regulations ?

From some wonderful students at Princeton :
CAMPAIGN TO REMOVE FRESHMEN FROM SIDEWALKS IN SECOND SUCCESSFUL WEEK
11/24/08 –Princeton , NJ
A group of students at Princeton University would like to eliminate the right of freshmen to walk on campus sidewalks .
Stating that they would like to “ preserve traditional sidewalk values ” that define a sidewalk as a “ pathway for sophomores , juniors , seniors , graduate students , faculty , staff , and other members of the university community , ” the group , which is acting in support of a measure termed “ Princeton Proposition 8 , ” is now entering its second successful week of demonstration .
The students emphasize that they are not “ froshophobic ” and that some of their best friends are freshmen , but they maintain that freshmen on the sidewalk degrade the sacred institution of sidewalks , and jeopardize the validity of upperclassmen ’s own perambulation .
It also makes some of them uncomfortable .
They are very excited that California ’s Proposition 8 has set a clear precedent for a majority to eliminate a minority group ’s civil rights , and they see it as a perfect opportunity to utilize this development for their own gain .
The demonstration , which has featured signs , chants , and original music , has collected almost 500 signatures for a petition in support of Princeton Proposition 8 , including those of many professors and even University President Shirley M. Tilghman .
A video report of the protest produced by the University ’s ‘ Daily Princetonian ’ has received 21,000 views on YouTube in just two days .
It has also been featured on dozens of regional and national blogs including Campus Progress Action ’s Pushback , DailyKos , and Andrew Sullivan ’s Daily Dish .
The organizers of the demonstration have also begun outreach to other universities .
The demonstration will continue at the plaza in front of Firestone Library on the Princeton campus between 9:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Monday 11/24 and Tuesday 11/25 .
The Princeton Proposition 8 campaign aims to secure the definition of Princeton University sidewalks as a means of pedestrian transit for sophomores , juniors , seniors , graduate students , faculty , staff , and other members of the university community , but supports the elimination of the right of freshmen to walk on sidewalks .
Only walking on sidewalks by sophomores , juniors , and senior students is valid or recognized at Princeton .

Illegal tax scheme gives $ 140 billion to biggest US banks
By Bill Van Auken
13 November 2008
An extra-legal measure quietly enacted by the Treasury Department in the shadow of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout package will hand the country 's biggest banks another $ 140 billion windfall , the Washington Post reported this week .
In a five - sentence memo issued on September 30 , on the eve of the first House vote on the bailout bill , the Treasury Department unilaterally overturned a two - decade - old tax law passed by Congress .
The measure denied profitable companies the ability to shield their profits from taxation by buying up bankrupt firms as shell companies and using their losses as a tax dodge .
The law , section 382 of the tax code , was enacted by Congress in 1986 .
It was aimed at curtailing what was seen as an egregious corporate scamming of the tax system .
The Republican right and corporate lobbyists have been pushing for the measure 's repeal or amendment ever since .
Treasury Department spokesman Andrew DeSouza defended the action , telling the Post that the administration had the power to overturn a law passed by Congress as part of its mandate to interpret the tax code .
He further insisted that the action was a necessary means of rescuing the banks from the financial meltdown .
" This is part of our overall effort to provide relief , " he said .
The Post reported in its November 10 article : " More than a dozen tax lawyers interviewed for this story - including several representing banks that stand to reap billions from the change - said the Treasury had no authority to issue the notice . "
" Did the Treasury Department have the authority to do this ?
I think almost every tax expert would agree that the answer is no , " George K. Yin , the former chief of staff of Congress 's Joint Committee on Taxation , told the Post .
" They basically repealed a 22 - year - old law that Congress passed as a backdoor way of providing aid to banks . "
The action by the Treasury Department has been dubbed the " Wells Fargo Ruling , " as it apparently provided direct aid to the successful bid by Wells Fargo to buy up the failing Wachovia bank .
According to sources cited by the Post , the tax change will net Wells Fargo $ 25 billion from the deal .
In other similar takeovers , PNC bank , enjoyed a windfall of $ 5.1 billion in its takeover of National City as a result of the scrapping of the tax law , while the Spanish Banco Santander gained another $ 2 billion because of the change when it gobbled up Sovereign Bancorp .
The clear aim of the tax measure was to steer the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been injected into the biggest private banks into the profitable buying up of their weaker competitors , thereby facilitating the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few giant banks , allowing them to exercise monopoly control over the financial system .
The cost of the measure will be paid by American working people , who will be faced with the slashing of funds for health care , education and other vital social programs in order to make up for the tax giveaway to the banks .
The most revealing aspect of the Post article is its depiction of the reaction of the Democratic leadership in the US Congress to the Treasury Department 's usurpation of power through the unilateral repeal of a law by executive fiat .
As the article makes clear , neither Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson nor anyone else in the department bothered to inform Congress of the action .
While leading legislators were described as " outraged " when they discovered the action days later , they acted deliberately to keep it from being revealed to the American people .
" Lawmakers worried about discussing their concerns publicly , " the Post reported .
When a conference call was organized between Treasury and Capitol Hill staff members , the staff of Senator Max Baucus ( Democrat - Montana ) , the chairman of the Finance Committee , " asked that the entire conference call be kept secret , " the Post reported .
The newspaper quoted one congressional aide as saying : " We 're all nervous about saying that this was illegal because of our fears about the marketplace .
To the extent we want to try to publicly stop this , we 're going to be gumming up some important deals . "
Another aide told the Post , " None of us wants to be blamed for ruining these mergers and creating a new Great Depression . "
The newspaper cited legal experts who compared the Democrats ' spinelessness in their secret protests over the extra-legal measures by the Treasury Department to similar objections made before the Democratic leadership passed the measure granting the Bush administration unrestricted power to wage a war of aggression against Iraq .
This extraordinary episode has exposed the complete subservience of the Democratic Party to the interests of Wall Street and the willingness of its leadership to submit to an effective dictatorship exercised by finance capital in violation of the law and the US Constitution .
Reader Heidi tipped us off that nearly half the page is dedicated to the civil rights battle of gay and lesbian Americans .
Not too shabby .
Of course , our job is to hold him to his commitments , blah blah blah , and that ’s true .
But coming out of the box with a strong commitment to all of civil rights is a very good thing .
He includes a great quote :
“ While we have come a long way since the Stonewall riots in 1969 , we still have a lot of work to do .
Too often , the issue of LGBT rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us .
But at its core , this issue is about who we are as Americans .
It ’s about whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect . ”

Oscar winner Russell Crowe leads an all - star cast in a blistering thriller about a rising congressman and an investigative journalist embroiled in an case of seemingly unrelated , brutal murders .
Crowe plays D.C. reporter Cal McCaffrey , whose street smarts lead him to untangle a mystery of murder and collusion among some of the nation 's most promising political and corporate figures in State of Play , from acclaimed director Kevin Macdonald .
Handsome , unflappable U.S. Congressman Stephen Collins ( Ben Affleck ) is the future of his political party : an honorable appointee who serves as the chairman of a committee overseeing defense spending .
All eyes are upon the rising star to be his party 's contender for the upcoming presidential race .
Until his research assistant / mistress is brutally murdered and buried secrets come tumbling out .
McCaffrey has the dubious fortune of both an old friendship with Collins and a ruthless editor , Cameron ( Oscar winner Helen Mirren ) , who has assigned him to investigate .
As he and partner Della ( Rachel McAdams ) try to uncover the killer 's identity , McCaffrey steps into a cover - up that threatens to shake the nation 's power structures .
And in a town of spin-doctors and wealthy politicos , he will discover one truth : when billions are at stake , no one 's integrity , love or life is ever safe .
Distributed computing is a valuable tool for scientists with data to analyse A joint project between IBM and Harvard University is tapping into thousands of computers , in an attempt to discover new solar and energy storage materials .
The Clean Energy Project uses distributed computing to number - crunch molecular equations .
Users volunteer the processing power of their computers , with a grid server assigning tasks .
The project is part of IBM's World Community Grid , which assists research projects that " benefit humanity " .
Other efforts include researching new cancer - fighting drugs , improving the nutritional content of rice by examining new protein structures , and trying to prevent the onset of AIDS by blocking HIV protease , the enzyme that makes HIV infectious .
The Clean Energy Project has two goals : finding new organic photovoltaics to provide inexpensive solar cells , and then researching possible polymers for the membranes used in fuel cells .
Heavy in light Traditional solar cells , made with silicon , are usually heavy and inflexible .
Organic solar cells have the potential to be much cheaper , flexible , and lightweight .
However they are not as efficient when compared to traditional cells , and their working life is shorter .
The lead researcher behind the project - Professor Aspuru - Guzik - said that currently solar cells using organic molecules have an efficiency of between 5 and 6 % , but that an efficiency of 15 % was required to make them commercially viable .
The task is to perform chemical calculations on tens of thousands of organic molecules to determine which show the most promise , utilising the CHARMM molecular mechanics package developed by the Karplus group at Harvard University .
Other grid projects include unravelling and identifying human protein chains " It would take us about 100 days of computational time to screen each of the thousands of compounds for electronic properties without the power of World Community Grid , " he said .
By distributing the computations among thousands of volunteered PCs , the project could be completed in two years .
By contrast , a traditional supercomputer approach would take more than 20 years .
Distribute and conquer Modern home computers can perform billions of calculations a second .
Most of the time , that 's far more power than the average user needs - so even though you 're working hard , your computer is just ticking over .
Distributed computing projects make use of this spare computer potential .
Distributed computing is a particularly valuable tool for scientists who have large amounts of data to analyse , or who are modelling very complex systems .
For example , the Folding at Home project , which aims to unravel molecular protein chains is now in its eighth year , and there are now more than 3 m computer users working on the SETI@home project looking for signs of contact from alien life .
IBM hope that their World Community Grid can attract a similar number of users .

Australia is supposed to be a secular society , but the Atheist Foundation of Australia says the nation 's biggest outdoor advertising company has refused to run its advertisements .
One of the humorous messages the foundation hoped to put on the back of buses was , " Sleep in on Sunday mornings " .
But the foundation says Australia 's biggest outdoor advertising company , APN Outdoor , had a problem with it .
Atheist Foundation president David Nicholls told the Religion Report on ABC Radio National that the contentious slogan was one of a number which had been proposed for the $ 16,000 advertising campaign .
" We started off with ' Atheism - because there is no credible evidence ' , we put that to the bus companies , they did n't like that and they said the wording was n't to their acceptance , " he said .
" And then we changed that to ' Celebrate reason ' and thought we'd make it a bit comical - ' Sleep in on Sunday mornings ' .
But they refused that also .
" The end conversation I had was I asked why we were refused and my answer to that was , ' well we have to refer this to our legal department ' , and chappie hung up , " he said .
" Nearly immediately after that he rang back with a message saying listen this is all finished , we 're not putting the signs on . "
" I 'm disappointed but not overly surprised .
Religion has a very great hold on societies , even democratic societies , and in fact it has too great a hold in democratic societies . "
Advertising abroad
Atheists overseas have had more success .
In the United States for example there is a cheeky advertisement on Washington buses : " Why believe in a God ?
Just be good for goodness ' sake . "
" In Australia , religion started off having a lot of breaks way back when we were starting our society , and those breaks have continued throughout , " Mr Nicholls said .
" Religions are tax exempt , they receive council breaks , they 're responsible for a $ 100 million chaplaincy program , tax payers are paying for religious schools , and ' celebrate reason ' is a very appropriate message to be putting forward today . "
The World Today sought comment from APN Outdoor 's marketing general manager Paul McBeth .
But he has not returned our calls .
Mr Nicholls suggests it is a bit much to knock back a slogan questioning God , when a group which does believe in God has been allowed to run its advertising .
" In Adelaide I believe , in the recent past , the APN buses had all across the back of a bus , or some buses , the message ' John 3:16 ' , which is the most famous biblical passage , that God so loved the world that he gave his only son da da da , " he said .
" Now atheists find that offensive , and there 's lots of atheism in Australia , but we would n't prohibit its displaying . "
Greg Clarke , the director of the Centre for Public Christianity , says freedom of expression should be favoured as often as possible .
" As long as it's done with a level of civility that means we actually do engage with the issues , rather than just fighting with each other , " he said .
Mr Clarke says he is surprised the atheist advertising campaign has been knocked back in a secular society like Australia .
" It probably does indicate that religion and God are a really hot topic at the moment , and so you 've got to be careful , " he said .
" I actually think that they should be a hot topic , and if you can stop and contemplate God while a bus rushes past then your days all the better for it . "

There ’s been a lot of chat recently about user levels having been deleted or moderated from the LittleBigPlanet servers .
Well , according to Sam over at the LittleBigPlanet Workshop , less than 200 levels have been moderated , making up less than 0.5 % of all the levels published .
He tells us that the majority of these were because they contained obscenities , fair enough , and the rest for copyright reasons .
He says , by way of an example : “ Oasis is the name both of a band and of a soft drink ( at least in Europe ) , however any level using the title ‘ Oasis ’ would be absolutely fine right now unless it included music by Oasis the band , or the likeness of the drinks bottle . ”
There ’s been a lot of talk recently about the moderation , and Sam is confident that a lot of this is “ exaggeration ” .
“ No level is moderated unless it has been reported using the Good Grief tool , ” he says , “ at which point it will only be blocked from online play if it is in violation of the EULA .
Secondly , even if a level is moderated you will still be able to access it offline on your moon , and make changes if you know where the problem was , before republishing . ”
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
“ Finally , if your level is moderated you will receive a message informing you that it has happened – if you do n’t receive a message , it has n’t been moderated .
Try searching for your PSN ID to find all the levels you ’ve published .
There is work to be done on improving the communication of why levels have been moderated , and this is underway , however this is not as widespread as you may have been led to believe , and it does not affect levels you have locally . ”
What are your thoughts on this ?
Have you had a level moderated or deleted without notice , and what was the content that you think caused this ?
We ’d like to hear from you , either in the comments below or via [ email protected ] .
Stolen and misplaced laptops can leave companies susceptible to costly data breaches , even more so if a notebook goes missing while the operating system is fully loaded , but Lenovo believes it has come up with a solution for that problem .
The company , in conjunction with Phoenix Technologies , will begin adding a feature to Lenovo notebooks that allows them to be “ remotely killed ” via a text message sent from a cell phone .
The new Constant Secure Remote Disable feature will come embedded within certain 3G - enabled ThinkPads ’ BIOS and can be activated with a simple text message command such as “ Turn off PC ” from a specified cell phone number .
The lockdown will happen immediately if the notebook is turned on or the next time the system signs on to a cellular network and from there the self - encrypting hard drive should take over to protect the computer ’s data .
To reactivate the disabled PC , a user needs to enter a preset pass code after the notebook is restarted .
The service will be available in the first quarter of 2009 on select ThinkPad notebooks at no additional charge and will be supported worldwide wherever cellular phone systems support text message transmission .
If the computer is out of cellular range , though , you ’re out of luck .

The economic crisis currently facing the nation has caused a flurry of political action .
From McCain “ suspending ” his campaign to massive bailouts , the response has been immediate and serious .
Even though the $ 700 billion bailout for Wall Street was rejected by the House of Representatives , which would have been the largest US government financial market intervention in history , I ca n’t help but wonder what a $ 700 billion bailout would do for the environment .
What if the US government had responded to the twenty years of dire warnings by James Hansen in the same manner as the current economic crisis ?
Such an aggressive response may have stopped climate change and saved our economy through green jobs and technology .

Why Van Jones should be Obama ’s Secretary of Prosperity
Government scientists , like James Hansen , have been muzzled for warning us that the Earth “ is nearing … a tipping point beyond which it will be impossible to avoid climate change with far - ranging undesirable consequences . ”
Sounds like the sky is falling to me , but when Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says it , the government takes note .
As Bruce Marks , founder and CEO of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America ( NACA ) explains :
Paulson says the sky is falling , we have to bail out Bear Stearns , $ 30 billion ; the sky is falling , we have to bail out Fannie and Freddie , $ 200 billion ; the sky is falling , we have to bail out AIG , $ 85 billion .
I ca n’t fathom $ 700,000,000,000 .
Jon Stewart told us $ 700 billion is equal to around 2,000 McDonald ’s apple pies per individual American .
The investment could turn our economy green on a larger scale rather than fatten us up on apple pies .
As Van Jones explains :
It ’s time to stop borrowing and start building .
America ’s No. 1 resource is not oil or mortgages .
Our No. 1 resource is our people .
Let ’s put people back to work — retrofitting and repowering America . …
You ca n’t base a national economy on credit cards .
But you can base it on solar panels , wind turbines , smart biofuels and a massive program to weatherize every building and home in America .
Former presidential candidate John Edwards and the NRDC proposed the April 2008 $ 100 billion stimulus package be spent on green infrastructure investments , such as “ retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency , expanding mass transit and freight rail , constructing ‘ smart ’ electrical grid transmission systems , wind power , solar power , and next - generation biofuels . ”
The program was even proposed to be paid for by auctions of carbon permits and would have created two million jobs !
What could 700 billion do for the environment if invested in a green economy ?
The economic crisis is real , and I do n’t know the solution , but climate change is also real .
I just wonder when the environment will get its bailout .

The powers of Presidents are often over - exaggerated .
They are not , as many people seem to believe , king of the country .
Our 3 branch separation of powers places firm limits on what the President can unilaterally do or change .
This means that even if a President wants to change something , he may not have the “ political capital ” – that is , the support of those in Congress – to get it done alone .
Still , we rightly look to the President as the most powerful person on Earth and at least hope he will try to change things for the better .
In that vein , here are 25 things that President - elect Barack Obama should at least try to change .
1 . Get us out of Iraq
Though many Democrats have overstated the necessesity to end the Iraq war , it does need to end .
What began as a noble quest to depose a terrible and potentially dangerous dictator has metastasized into an open - ended sinkhole of American lives , time , and money .
Unlike past legitimate wars like World Wars 1 & 2 ( or even Desert Storm ) there appears to be no clear goal or end - game in Iraq .
No one knows what we are waiting for to declare victory or defeat .
President Obama should either define such a goal and promptly meet it , or begin withdrawing our troops .
If Republican pundits want to call that “ cutting and running ” , so be it .
As John T. Reed writes , “ adults do not make life - and - death policy based on whether “ one of the other kids ” will call them chicken .
2. Jump start the economy following the financial meltdown
Obama spent the latter part of his campaign stating that the current 2008 financial meltdown is the worst economic problem since the Great Depression .
Maybe .
Regardless , the onus is clearly on President - elect Obama to help jump start the economy and rebuild consumer confidence .
One of his plans for doing this is offering tax cuts for “ working families ” , which Obama defines as the 95 % of Americans earning under $ 250,000 per year .
His “ Making Work Pay ” tax credit would give $ 500 in tax relief to singles or $ 1,000 to married couples filing jointly .
Most economists agree that tax cuts do indeed boost economic activity , so hopefully , these will become law .
3. Eliminate capital gains taxes ( at least for small businesses )
Another specific proposal for jump starting the economy is eliminating capital gains taxes , which are levied on investment income .
While Obama dislikes rich people and big businesses ( and so will most likely not eliminate capital gains taxes for them ) , he has promised to eliminate capital gains taxes for “ startup and small businesses to encourage innovation and job creation . ”
Singling out one economic class for a significant tax cut while still subjecting another class to it is seemingly a class warfare tactic to curry favor with voters , but any elimination of capital gains tax will do the economy good .
Hopefully this will get done !
4 . Ease the burden on low - income seniors
The last thing low - income seniors need in a time of economic turmoil is a crushing tax burden .
Accordingly , Obama has pledged to eliminate all income taxation of seniors who earn less than $ 50,000 per year .
According to his campaign website , this would end income tax for some 7 million senior citizens , good for an average savings of $ 1,400 per year , per senior .
In all , the website claims , 27 million American seniors would not even need to file an income tax return .
5. Simplify the tax code for all Americans
Another major headache we all face is complying with the maddeningly complex tax code every April .
With the government ’s never - ending maze of tax credits , incentives , loopholes , deductions and exemptions , it ’s almost impossible to do your taxes without specialized software or professional help .
Obama , according to his campaign website , will end this difficulty by “ ensuring that the IRS uses the information it already gets from banks and employers to give taxpayers the option of pre-filled tax forms to verify , sign and return . ”
Experts believe that this would save Americans some 200 million hours of tax preparation work and as much as $ 2 billion in fees each year .
6 . Ease the transition of dislocated manufacturing and service workers
Globalization is an inescapable reality in twenty - first century America , and it ’s not going away anytime soon .
That said , the government arguably has a responsibility to assist workers in industries that are being outsourced .
President - elect Obama has promised to help displaced workers adapt by creating “ flexible education accounts ” and offering retraining assistance .
This would help the displaced workers develop new skills that will allow them to find new , similarly - compensated jobs and ease the turmoil from losing their prior job .
7. Incentivize companies to create American jobs
While outsourcing is not the paragon of evil , capitalist greed that leftists claim , it still does n’t hurt to encourage companies to create more US jobs .
One of Obama ’s plans ( which he already introduced legislation for as a Senator ) is to offer tax credits to companies hat maintain or increase the number of full - time workers in America relative to those overseas , keep their corporate headquarters here , provide health insurance , help workers prepare for retirement , and otherwise support their American employees .
8. Encourage continued research , development , and innovation
The above mentioned challenges of globalization ( as well as the energy crisis ) demand that we continue innovating .
In recognition of this , Obama has promised to make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent .
This will send a clear message to startups and existing businesses that the tax credit is there , can be depended on , and will not be phased out before they launch their next blockbuster product .
Such strategies are exactly what are needed to encourage innovation , and this should , hopefully , pass through Congress with ease .
9 . Invest in clean cars
One of Obama ’s more ambitious promises was to put a million plug - in Hybrid cars ( which can get up to 150MPG ) on America ’s roads by the year 2015 .
Additionally , Obama has pledged that these million cars will be produced here in America , which appears to be part of his campaign promise to create 5 million “ green jobs ” in the quest to lighten our load on the environment .
By this point , few sane people doubt the importance of switching to more eco-friendly vehicles .
This simply must get done .
10 .
Increase the percentage of renewable , domestically - generated energy
Sadly , we are still relying overwhelmingly on oil for our electric and heating needs .
President - elect Obama plans on changing that , promising that 10 percent of our overall electricity comes from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and upping that percentage to 25 by 2025 .
It is commonly though that wind and solar will accomplish this , but these are actually not as cost - effective yet as many people think .
An excellent interim solution would be to use nuclear power , which France is happily and cheaply using to power their entire country .
11 . Restore America ’s tarnished reputation in the eyes of the world
No matter how you feel about the current President and his administration , it ’s tough to deny that America has taken a beating in the public eye .
Much of that can be blamed on the blunder of the Iraq war and how it was carried out , but that is over and done with .
What President Obama must now do ( and says he will do ) is engage in diplomacy with world leaders about terrorist threats and other issues .
We must re-establish the habit of talking before fighting .
12 . Ensure that Iran does not develop or use a nuclear weapon
One of the major , specific goals of engaging in diplomacy must be ensuring that Iran does not become a threat to us .
Whether Obama opts to use direct talks , multi-party talks , sanctions , or a combination of the above , the goal of pacifying Iran is an absolute must .
Despite the public ’s lack of support for President Bush or the Iraq war , Obama has an unquestionable mandate from the American people to ensure our safety in the face of that dangerous regime .
13 . Offer aid and support to Africa
Recent years have shifted our attention to the suffering and atrocities taking place in Africa , from the genocides in Darfur to the widespread disease and poverty that characterizes the continent in general .
Obama can and must make this a priority .
Fortunately , he has pledged to double our annual investment in foreign aid from $ 25 billion to $ 50 billion by the end of his first time .
He also wants to make the Millenium Development Goals ( cutting extreme poverty in half by the year 2015 ) into American goals .
Many Americans support this type of aid .
14 . Promote free trade throughout the world
Economists rarely agree on anything , but virtually all of them agree that we are better off with 100 % free trade with all the world ’s nations .
Buy whatever you want from whomever you want , in any country .
Obama has made some promises toward achieving this vision , preferring to support “ fair trade ” of excluding countries who tarrif our goods and such .
He should abandon fair trade and support completely free trade instead .
This alone will do more to ease the financial burden on Americans than 100 government giveaway programs and tax credits combined .
Let supply and demand function !
15 .
Help ensure that all Americans have health insurance
An overwhelming number of people in America support a universal healthcare system .
While this is questionable from an economic standpoint , the government can certainly make it easier and cheaper to purchase health insurance .
One way of doing that is offering a tax credit that lets Americans write off health expenses like doctor visits and prescription drugs .
Obama has also proposed creating a second tier of the healthcare system that lets people stay in private healthcare plans or , optionally , purchase it at a lower subsidised cost via the government .
Some combination of these plans will no doubt make health care more affordable .
16 . Allow us to import safe generic drugs from other nations
It is currently quite difficult to import safe , generic drugs from developed nations like Canada .
President - elect Obama has correctly pointed out that this is an outrage , something being done to protect American drug companies from foreign competition .
Obama has sworn to make it easier for us to import generics from other nations , thereby lowering the prices we all pay for prescription drugs and lightening the healthcare burden ever more .
17 . Improve the appalling state of healthcare our veterans receive
Most of us are , by now , familiar with the Walter Reed scandal of atrocious healthcare that our veterans were recieving at that facility .
As Obama has noted , this is an outrage and a monstrous injustice to the brave men and women who have devoted their lives to the cause of American freedom .
To fix the situation , Obama has committed to strengthening VA care and upping federal funding for the treatment and comfort of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans .
All but the most heartless would agree that this is urgently necessary .
18 . Clean up the culture of corruption in Washington
A comical e-mail has made the rounds in recent years asking something along the lines of “ there are 200 + men , many of whom are convicted felons , drug abusers , wife beaters , child porn addicts , and repeat criminals .
Are we talking about a pro football team ?
No – we are talking about the US Congress ! ”
While the e-mail was intended as as joke , it is anything but funny .
Since Obama ran on a campaign of change and a pledge to clean up the culture of corruption in Washington , he must do just that .
One excellent proposal of his is creating an Internet database of lobbyist reports , ethics records , and campaign finance filings allowing us to keep tabs on our leaders .
19 .
End excessive corporate welfare
In light of the recent financial bailout , everyday Americans are up in arms about “ corporate welfare ” , the practice of giving huge , immensely profitable corporations tax breaks , interest - free loans , and outright cash gifts for nothing but their own private gain .
Obama has stated that he will end or reduce this practice by exposing special tax breaks to greater scrutiny , questioning the value of putting taxpayer dollars to work for private gain and ensuring the government gets what it pays for from its “ investments . ”
20 .
Prevent the Constitution from being amended to ban gay marriage
The far right has long been itching to impose moral code into the Constitution .
This is not the purpose of the Constitution and would distort its purpose in a fundamental way .
Additionally , this would be an unconstitutional outrage if it came to pass .
It would arguably violate the 14th amendment ’s equal protection clause , not to mention the ever - important separation of Church and State .
Ultimately , under our form of government , this is an issue that should be decided at the state level .
21 . Invest In A New , Redundant and Robust Flex - Grid
One of the biggest issues with alternative energy is transmission .
Getting energy to the places that need it most .
It turns out that the best sources of alternative energy tend to be in places with lower population , not in high - population centers where the energy is needed most .
It is time for a fundamental restructuring of our country ’s energy grid to improve long - distance transmission and also enable a sophisticated , redundant and robust network of energy users and providers , similar in structure to today ’s Internet .
There is no reason that our regional energy grid ’s should be so vulnerable .
It is a national security issue .
22 . Allow the free , uninterrupted progress of science and stem cell research
Another religious crusade that conservatives refuse to give up is trying to get stem cell research banned .
While many simply oppose federal funding of stem cell , others oppose it alltogether and wish to ban the practice of it .
Clearly this is unjust , and to his credit , Barack Obama realizes it .
His plan supports not only allowing stem cell research to develop at a scientific ( as opposed to a political ) pace , but calls for increasing its funding .
Since we are discussing technology with the potential to cure vast suffering , this is most admirable .
23 . Restore the ideal of “ government by the people , of the people , and for the people ”
As a charismatic populist , Obama should encourage the return of the “ government by the people , of the people , and for the people ” ideal .
One way he has suggested doing this is to hold “ 21st Century Fireside Chats ” in which he and his cabinet will hold periodic , nationally - broadcasted town hall meetings to discuss issues , plans , and approaches to the challenges we all face .
The chats would be broadcast both over television and high - speed broadband connections via the Web .
24 . Allow citizens to hold government spending accountable
In 2008 , there is no excuse for us not to be able to track government the way we track news , sports , and finance .
To bring government into the twenty - first century , Obama should ( and has promised to ) create a “ Google - like search engine to allow regular people to approximately track federal grants , contracts , earmarks , and loans online . ”
This comes at a perfect time , coming off an election where 90 % of the public participated and interest in government seems to be enjoying a resurgence .
25 . Strengthen the education system
Last but not least , Obama should focus on cleaning up the disastrous after - effects of President Bush ’s No Child Left Behind Act .
The education system is in shambles , which cannot continue if America hopes to stay competitive in the global economy .
Luckily , Obama has said that he will fix the school system , hire better teachers , pay them more money , and make it easier for students of all income levels to attend college if they want to .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson heads to China on Tuesday for his final round of economic talks , with one of his main goals more elusive than ever : Persuading Beijing to allow Wall Street greater access to the Chinese market .
With U.S. markets battered by risky mortgage - backed securities , and the U.S. economy in recession , Mr. Paulson faces stiffened Chinese resistance to his argument that Western investment banks , insurance companies and other financial firms will bring economic growth .
Instead , the two - day talks in Beijing this week will likely focus on less - heated areas , including cooperation on energy and the environment , and complementary responses to the global financial turmoil .
Just seven weeks before President - elect Barack Obama takes office , one of Mr. Paulson 's top concerns appears to be ensuring that the semiannual U.S. - China Strategic Economic Dialogue itself continues to be an American priority .
" They were looking at their teacher , and the problems we 've had in our capital markets have certainly not been a good example to them as to why they should proceed with more reform , " Mr. Paulson said in an interview Monday .
He said he plans , nonetheless , to press China " to avoid the mistakes we 've made but to continue with reform . "
When Mr. Paulson took the helm at Treasury in 2006 , President George W. Bush touted his experience in China , which the former Goldman Sachs Group chief executive had visited more than 70 times .
At Mr. Paulson 's behest , Mr. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao that year launched a twice - yearly gathering of cabinet - level officials to explore long - term issues while delivering some immediate results .

Marine scientists in Scotland are set to initiate a £ 5 million study which could transform seaweeds and marine plant algae into major sources of low emission automobile fuel in Britain .
The scientists are calling them the mari-fuels and they hope that fuels produced from the seaweeds and algae would in part replace the controversial biofuels produced from food crops .
[ social_buttons ]
The study , which will be funded in part by The European Union , would look to formalize the best possible way of exploiting the vast reserves of the seaweeds which are found in great abundance along the British coastline .
The study holds great importance for Britain as it could help it achieve the emissions targets set by the EU .
British government would be keening waiting for the outcome of the study as it sees fuels from plants an instrument to reduce or at least neutralize its carbon emissions .
Britain wants 2.5 percent of all petrol and diesel to be produced from renewable sources like plants .
The biggest advantage of exploiting biofuels from marine plant algae is that it ’s a completely natural process which requires almost no anthropogenic activity .
They grow at a much greater rate as compared to the food crops , no environment degrading fertilizers are required and no deforestation .
The seaweeds derive energy from ammonia produced as waste from farms of salmon fish .
So it ’s actually fuel from waste .
Britain has been a leader in adopting biofuels as a replacement for the conventional polluting automobile fuels but as a report noted more than 80 percent of the do not fulfill the quality requirements or address the sustainability issues satisfactorily .
It could not be verified if a major portion of the biofuels imported were produced without harming the environment .
Producing biofuels locally would not only help address the pollution and sustainaibility issues but would also help Britain achieve the renewable energy and emissions reduction goals set by EU .
Since ammonia is a common by - product of many industrial processes it could be possible to transform effluent treatment plants into mini biofuel factories .
By seeding the treatment tanks with plant algae the waste products can be used in the production of biofuels .
The possibility makes good economic sense too – the biofuel produced could be sold in the British market or exported plus the treatment plants could also sell carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism .
The story of biofuels has had many ups and downs but they cannot be ruled out as a possible replacement to the highly polluting petrol & diesel .
Biofuels can be seen as a bridge between the high emission producing conventional auto fuels and the zero-emission fuels of the future .
But the key is to improvise and use simple but creative ideas to tap the resources we have .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 9 ( Xinhua ) -- Hubble Space Telescope has discovered carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another star , the U.S. space agency NASA reported on Tuesday .
This breakthrough is an important step toward finding chemical biotracers of extraterrestrial life , said NASA .
The Jupiter - sized planet , called HD 189733 b , lies 63 light - years away .
It is too hot for life , but the Hubble observations are a proof - of - concept demonstration that the basic chemistry for life can be measured on planets orbiting other stars .
Organic compounds also can be a by - product of life processes and their detection on an Earthlike planet someday may provide the first evidence of life beyond our planet .
Previous observations of HD 189733 b by Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope found water vapor .
Earlier this year , Hubble found methane in the planet 's atmosphere .
" These atmospheric studies will begin to determine the compositions and chemical processes operating on distant worlds orbiting other stars .
The future for this newly opened frontier of science is extremely promising as we expect to discover many more molecules in exoplanet atmospheres , " said Eric Smith , Hubble program scientist at NASA .

British actor Christian Bale signs autographs before a photocall for ' The Dark Knight ' film in Barcelona , in this file photo from July 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Albert Gea
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The Warner Bros studio said on Wednesday it has canceled plans to release its blockbuster Batman movie “ The Dark Knight ” in China , citing “ cultural sensitivities ” surrounding the film .
The studio , a unit of Time Warner Inc , did not specify what Chinese audiences or censors might find objectionable about the movie .
“ Based on a number of pre-release conditions that are being attached to ‘ The Dark Knight , ’ as well as cultural sensitivities to some elements of the film , we have opted to forego a theatrical release of the film in China , ” Warner Bros said in a statement .
The film includes a sequence in which Batman , the movie ’s comic book superhero played by Christian Bale , penetrates a criminal mastermind ’s skyscraper redoubt in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong .
“ The Dark Knight , ” which was released in July , is the top - grossing film of the year with more than $ 996 million in worldwide ticket sales , including over $ 7.5 million in Hong Kong , according to the website Box Office Mojo .
The film also has earned the late Australian actor Heath Ledger a Golden Globe nomination for his final role as Batman ’s maniacally evil foe , the Joker .
Tragedy at Christmas show as actress plunges 25 ft to her death in front of horrified audience
Tragic : Keri Shryock , 23 , died in hospital
An actress in a Christmas pageant who was suspended 25 feet in the air by an overhead rope fell headfirst onto a concrete church floor and died .
Keri Shryock , 23 , and two other performers were playing wise men on their way to Bethlehem before about 2,000 spectators during Wednesday night 's opening performance at Crossroads Community Church , in Cincinnati .
The three were approaching a star when Shryock fell into an aisle in the audience portion of the theater , witnesses told The Cincinnati Enquirer .
' Toward the ending of the song she came loose , ' Daniel Doepke , 55 , of Middletown , told the newspaper .
' I can't describe how heart - wrenching it was , her fall to a hard concrete surface . '
Shryock was taken to University Hospital , where she died yesterday morning .
There was no immediate explanation of how the accident occurred , or if there was an equipment failure .
' Our prayers and heartfelt sympathies go out to her family during this incredibly difficult time , ' the church said in a statement .
' We are shocked and deeply grieved by this tragic accident . '
Shryock , from Sylvania , Ohio , near Toledo , graduated from a university this year and had been participating in gymnastics for the past two years , friends said .
The church characterized the program as a contemporary Nativity story , said church spokesman Matt Chandler .
' It was a figurative and artistic version of the Christmas story found in the book of Luke , ' he said .
Ten remaining performances of the show ' Awaited ' were canceled .
The non-denominational church held an evening of prayer , reflection and worship last night .
About 1,100 people attended the prayer session , said church spokeswoman Natalie Hastings .
The mega-church was founded in 1996 and has grown to a membership of about 10,000 , Chandler said .
It is known for dramatic and musical presentations at weekend services .
The church 's Web site said ' Awaited ' was seen by more than 20,000 people when it first was presented last year .
Under fire for his role in the near - collapse of Citigroup Inc. , Robert Rubin said its problems were due to the buckling financial system , not its own mistakes , and that his role was peripheral to the bank 's main operations even though he was one of its highest - paid officials .
" Nobody was prepared for this , " Mr. Rubin said in an interview .
He cited former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as another example of someone whose reputation has been unfairly damaged by the crisis .

A black couple from Missouri seek amends from clothing store Journeys after their son was given a receipt that said " dumb N - word " in capital letters .
Linda Slater said she 's both saddened and angry that it happened and " to know that racism is still alive . "
On Friday , her son Keith Slater , 22 , bought a pair of loafer - style shoes from the Journeys at the Oak Park Mall in Overland Park , Kan. , about a 30 - minute drive from their home in Kansas City , Mo .
When he found a less expensive pair of similar shoes at a different store a short while later , however , he returned the first pair to Journeys the next day .
The clerk , whom Linda Slater described as a 20 - something white woman , asked why he was returning the shoes and Keith Slater told her about the less expensive shoes he had bought .
It was n't until the family got home that he glanced at his receipt and saw the insult printed next to the line marked " Cust " for customer .
" Then I was like , ' Nah , no way .
It ca n't say that , " Keith Slater , a junior at Missouri State University in Springfield , told ABCNews.com today .
" I was shocked , ' cause I did n't do anything for that to happen . "
Keith Slater , who is studying business and finance , said he had never been directly called the racial epithet before and his mother said she had n't either .
When they returned to Journeys the next day , the same clerk showed the Slaters that she simply had entered a code into the computer and that 's what came up .
The clerk 's intentions are unclear but Linda Slater said the woman indicated she knew that was in the system and told the family that the employee who put it there had been terminated .
Keith Slater said he 's partially gotten the resolution that he wants in that the word has gotten out and people know " this can still happen . "
But he also wants to know why the phrase was allowed in the system in the first place .
A statement issued by Nashville , Tenn. - based Genesco , which owns the clothing store aimed at young shoppers , said the company was continuing to investigate the incident .
The statement also said that the employee who added the language to the system had been terminated but the company would not say whether the termination occurred before or after the Slater incident .
" Needless to say , such an act was not authorized by Journeys and will not be tolerated , " the statement read .
" At Journeys , we pride ourselves on valuing and respecting every customer .
We are shocked and sickened that a former associate could be responsible for an act so out of keeping with our culture and our values . "
The line marked " Cust " is reserved for the customer 's name .
There are 813 Journeys stores nationwide .
As for Keith Slater 's mom , she 'd like to see compensation from the company .
Linda Slater said they have gotten apologies from both the store 's company and the mall managers .
She also said that she knew of no other similar incidents but that she believes that most people never look at their receipts .
The family , she said , is a Christian one and does n't believe in making a huge scene or going to court .
" You have to be better than that person who said that , " she said today .
But she 'd still like to see the company do something for her son .
" I could see that my son was hurt , " she said .
" He just kind of stood there and hung his head down . "
Richard McIntire , national spokesman for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said that this and other incidents that happen daily prove that America still has n't come to terms with its race issues and that 's something that 's going to be relevant as the country heads into an election where a black man is leading in polls .
McIntire , who had n't heard about the receipt , said Keith Slater was blessed to have made it 22 years without the N - word being lobbed in his direction .
" It 's something that needs to be removed from America 's vocabulary , " he said .
Dock Ellis , the former major league pitcher best remembered for his flamboyance and social activism as a member of the great Pittsburgh Pirates teams of the 1970s , died Friday of a liver ailment in California , his former agent , Tom Reich , confirmed .
Ellis was 63 .

Ellis spent 12 years in the majors with Pittsburgh , the New York Yankees , Oakland , Texas and the New York Mets .
He retired in 1979 with a record of 138 - 119 , but was best known for several colorful incidents on and off the field .
His wife , Hjordis , told The Assocaited Press he died at the USC Medical Center in Los Angeles .
" It 's a tremendous loss to the family , " she said .
" He 's been struggling for about a year with the end stages of liver disease . "
In his autobiography , " Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball , '' Ellis revealed that he threw a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres in June 1970 while under the influence of LSD .
In May 1974 -- in an effort to inspire a lifeless Pittsburgh team -- Ellis drilled Pete Rose , Joe Morgan and Dan Driessen in the top of the first inning .
After walking Tony Perez , Ellis threw a pitch near Johnny Bench 's head and was lifted from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh .
Ellis also gave up Reggie Jackson 's memorable home run off the Tiger Stadium light tower in the 1971 All - Star Game in Detroit .
Off the field , Ellis spoke freely about racial issues , once telling reporters that he would n't start against Oakland 's Vida Blue in the All - Star Game because Major League Baseball would never start " two soul brothers ' ' against each other .
Ellis went 19 - 9 in 1971 for the Pirates , who beat the Orioles in the World Series .

" Dock Ellis was my first client in baseball , and he gave me as much joy as anybody outside of my family , " Reich said .
" He was so unique .
He was viewed by some people as an outlaw , but he was far from that .
He was so ahead of his time .
He was so intuitive and smart and talented and independent .
And he was n't about to roll over for the incredible prejudices that existed at the time .
" He was a very special person and he had an absolute army of fans and friends .
He was at the cutting edge of so many issues , and he never backed down .
I was proud to be his friend and stand with him . "
Ellis suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was placed on a list to receive a liver transplant in May .
The Los Angeles Times wrote that Ellis had no health insurance , but received help paying his medical bills from friends in baseball .
Bill Scaringe , an agent who represented Ellis after he retired , said Ellis worked for years in the California department of corrections helping inmates transition from prison back to the community .
He also ran a drug counseling center in Los Angeles .
" It 's very disheartening , " Scaringe said .
" Dock was such a likeable person -- very gregarious , very outgoing .
I would set up personal appearances for him , and after like 30 seconds , people were like relatives or neighbors .
Dock was very easy to talk to .
He was just a pleasure to be around . "

The shuttle Atlantis ( foreground ) sits on Launch Pad A and Endeavour on Launch Pad B at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
For the first time since July 2001 , two shuttles are on the pads at the same time .
Endeavour will stand by in the unlikely event that a rescue mission is necessary during Atlantis ' upcoming mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , targeted to launch Oct. 10 , 2008 .
Thisstory was updated at 7:52 a.m. EDT .
As NASA ? s50th anniversary approaches , the agency finds itself at a crossroads betweenthe waning era of the U.S. space shuttle and serious hurdles ahead to build areplacement spaceship while still keeping American astronauts flying .
The U.S. spaceagency turns 50 years old on Oct. 1 with the last flight of its three agingshuttles already set for May 31 , 2010 aboard the orbiter Atlantis .
NASAofficials in charge of the developing the shuttle ?s replacement - the OrionCrew Exploration Vehicles and their Ares I boosters - hope to have thespaceship ready for manned flights by 2014 , though unless Congress steps insoon American astronauts will likely be grounded beginning in 2012 due torestrictions on NASA ?s ability to buy seats aboard Russian spacecraft .
Meanwhile , the agency is simultaneously taking an academic look at what ? sneeded to extend shuttle missions through 2015 to be ready for any questions fromthe new administration after November ?s presidential election .
? It ?s kindof a unique juncture of history that we are engaged in at this point in timewith so many issues , and the tasks are pretty large and quite daunting , ?
saidRoger Launius , a former NASA historian and senior curator with the Division of Space History at the Smithsonian Institution ? s National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. ?
It ?s time to move on .?
Shuttleto Orion
NASA ?s hasplanned to retire its three shuttle fleet since 2004 under the Vision for SpaceExploration , which includes bringing Orion and Ares I online by 2015 andsending astronauts back to the moon by 2020 .
The plan calls for Ares I rocketsto launch Orion capsules to orbit on flights to the International Space Stationor to link up with a lunar transfer stage and Altair moon lander loftedseparately atop a planned Ares V heavy - lift booster .
Budgetshortfalls and recent shuttle flight delays prompted NASA ?s Constellationprogram to push back internal targets for test flying Ares and Orion crewvehicles , though officials hit a milestone earlier this month when anengineering panel signed off on the preliminary design for Ares I rockets .
? You ?realways going to find out that there are things you don? t know , which can befixed .
So figuring out and fixing them is what we do , ?
NASA Administrator MikeGriffin said in a televised agency - wide update on Sept. 12 . ?
Ares and Orion aregoing very well for development projects on a scale that the agency has nottackled for decades .?
The agencyhad hoped to launch the first Ares I test - dubbed Ares I - X - from the KennedySpace Center in Florida by April 15 , 2009 , under a plan to begin manned flighttests as early as 2013 .
But delays to the next shuttle flight - Atlantis ?
STS - 125 mission to overhaul the Hubble Space Telescope - pushed the AresI - X test flight to no earlier than next June because NASA must hold the Arespad in reserve for a second shuttle , which is serving as a rescue ship in caseof an emergency .
The Hubbleflight is slated to lift off Oct. 10 , after being pushed from an earlier Augustlaunch date due to fuel tank delays .
Fundingconstraints , meanwhile , have hindered design review plans for the Orion CrewExploration Vehicle .
NASA is currently spending about $ 3 billion per yearthrough 2010 on Orion and Ares I , but could have been farther along ifadditional funds were available , program managers said .
? We neededabout $ 1 billion for each of the next two years to really put us on the glidepath to make that a high confidence plan , ? said John Hanley , manager of NASA ?
sConstellation program overseeing Ares and Orion development , of the 2013 targetin a Sept. 10 briefing .
?
When that didn?t materialize , we of course had to adjustour schedule in order to allow the work to fit the money , and that ?s what we ? vedone .?
Newspaceship hurdles
Challengesin developing any new human spaceflight system are to be expected , and NASA ?
sOrion and Ares have their fairshare .
? I thinkthey ?re obviously making progress toward fielding a new vehicle , but they dohave enormous technical challenges , ?
Launius said of NASA , adding that the U.S.has not designed a manned spacecraft from scratch since the birth of theshuttle fleet in the early 1970s .
?
We basically do this once a generation andwe ?re now at that point where we ?re doing it .?
The currentAres I design , a two - stage rocket that uses a five - segment version of the spaceshuttle ?s solid rocket booster as a first stage , shakes too much .
Engineershave come up with a novel shock absorber plan to mitigate the excessivevibration .
Designteams have also been dogged by the Orion capsule ?s weight , which they have beenworking to slim down for extra launch margin since the spacecraft will be usedfor rides to the International Space Station and planned long duration treks tothe moon .
The design review process for that component has been delayed to sometime next year .
Early workis underway to modify the Ares I rocket ?s launch pad at the Kennedy SpaceCenter to ward off lightning and other hazards .
Meanwhile , Ares I engineers aretackling time - consuming , but not insurmountable problems like smoothing out therocket ?s stage separation and deciding to safeguard the booster to fly throughrain , hail or direct lightning strikes , said Ares project manager Steve Cook .
?
We ? vecertainly got design challenges ahead , but if we did n?t have challenges wewould n?t need engineers , ?
he added .
Americanaccess to orbit
Whileengineers tackle plans for Orion and Ares , NASA has already set the lastflights for each of its three remaining space shuttles - Atlantis , Discoveryand Endeavour .
Under thecurrent schedule , Atlantis would launch its last flight , STS - 131 , to the spacestation on Feb. 11 , 2010 .
Discovery and Endeavour would follow , lifting off onApril 8 and May 31 of that year , respectively .
NASA hadhoped to rely on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to launch American and partnerastronauts to the International Space Station between the shuttles ?
retirementthe first manned Orion flights .
But unlessCongress extends the agency ?s exemption from part of the Iran - North Korea - SyriaNon - proliferation Act ( INKSNA ) by year ?s end , American and NASA partnerastronauts will miss at least one of the space station crew rotation flights in2012 .
Russia ?s recent military conflict with neighboring state Georgia in early August has cast a pall over the waiver talks .
? I?ve beenputting every bit of political capital that I might have or can borrow behindsecuring an extension of that wavier until we can get Ares and Orion flying , ?
Griffin said last week .
?
But it ?s tough and the Hill is not of one mind on thatsubject .?
Somesupporters include Sen. Bill Nelson ( D. - Fla. ) , who has been advocating awaiver extension for astronaut seats , but has urged NASA to commit to U.S.commercial launch services for station cargo .
Others , like Rep. Dave Weldon ( R - Fla. ) , believe relying solely on Russia for U.S. access to space to be agrave misstep .
? Laying offthousands of experienced space program workers and relying on Russia to get theU.S. into space was a bad idea then , and it is even a worse idea now , ?
Weldonsaid in a Sept. 12 statement .
?
By granting the Russians a waiver , as he nowadvocates , we will guarantee thousands of pink slips to workers at KSC .
Russiacontinues to sell dangerous technologies directly related to weapons of massdestruction to Iran , defies sovereign rights in Georgia , and threatens Polandwith intervention .?
Shuttlefutures
Alsoclouding the issue is the upcoming presidential election , which has promptedNASA to take a second look at what steps would be required to extend itsspace shuttle flights through 2015 in order to answer any questions fromthe new administration .
Last month , Republican presidential candidate John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and other senators senta letter to President George W. Bush beseeching his administration from institutingany policies that would prevent U.S. shuttles from flying beyond 2010 .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , too , has pledged tocontinue the Constellation program and has said in the past that extra spaceshuttle flights might be an option .
Griffin hassaid that the odds of a loss of vehicle or crew failure during shuttle missionwill increase dramatically if the program is extended to fill the gap betweenorbiter retirement and Orion operations in 2015 .
Adding two shuttle flights peryear would shift the odds from a 1 - in - 80 chance of a failure to 1 - in - 8 flights .
? That ?s thefacts .
That ?s where we are , ?
Griffin said this month .
?
I?d rather work towardspending our money toward building a safer system .?
And whileNASA has begun terminating some of its contracts that support space shuttlemissions , there is some flexibility as to what it might be able to do ifdirected by the new administration .
John Shannon , NASA ?s space shuttle programmanager , said earlier this month that while extending shuttle flightsthrough 2015 may not delay plans for Ares I launches , it would likely delayAres V rocket development that would support new manned missions to the moon .
? We have been aggressively retiringthing that we do not need for the space shuttle program , ?
Shannon said .
?
But wehaven ?t reached the point of no return .?
The upcoming stage in the development of the next iteration of Firefox is blocked by a consistent volume of bugs , Mozilla revealed .
No less than 17 blockers are stopping Firefox 3.1 from moving onward to Beta 2 .
On November 10 , the conclusion was that the Firefox 3.1 , codename Shiretoko , Beta 2 was not ready for build because of the large number of issues affecting the development milestone of the open source browser .
“ Despite a lot of hard work , we 're still a little bit away from being ready to hand the code for Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 over to the build team at this time .
As of this writing , there are 17 bugs ( marked blocking with the appropriate TM ) that need to be resolved before we can ship , ” revealed Mike Beltzner , Mozilla 's User Experience lead .
Beltzner indicated that no less than ten bugs impact Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 , while another seven affect the underlying Gecko 1.9.1 Beta 2 rendering engine .
The release of Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 continues to be planned for mid-November 2008 ; however , considering the number of blockers still unresolved , availability might slip toward the end of the month .
On October 14 , 2008 , Mozilla offered Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 for download .
Version 3.1 supersedes Firefox 3.0 , released earlier this year .
Going forward , Firefox 3.1 will have to go against Internet Explorer 8 , which is currently in Beta 2 phase , with the RTW ( release to web ) reportedly planned by the end of this month .
“ The tree spent most of Monday closed due to recurring test failures which we have as yet been unable to conclusively link to any single checkin .
As a result some , but not a lot , of progress was made on the outstanding bugs for Beta 2 .
Patches are ready to land , we just need a tree that can take them , ” Beltzner added .
For the time being , Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 is available for download here .
I mentioned this in an earlier post , when I noted that the main reason the GOP appears to have spiked the auto bailout is because Sen .
Corker thinks UAW workers make too much money , but this comment makes me think that we need to bring it up again to drive the point home :
Also , is n’t it ODD to have US Senators negotiating wage and benefit levels with the employees of private companies ?
These Southern Senators were actually NEGOTIATING WAGE LEVELS with the UAW leadership in a back room while they were filibustering the bill .
Is that outrageous ?
Unheard of ?
What .
The .
Fuck ?
Still , autoworkers remain angry with the senators who tried to negotiate wage and benefit concessions from the union , then scuttled the House - passed bill that would have granted the loans and set up a “ car czar ” to oversee the nearly insolvent companies and get concessions from the union and creditors .
Their top targets were Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) ; Senator Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) , who led negotiations on a compromise ; and Senator Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , who has been a vocal critic of the loans .
Angry United Auto Workers members lash out at Southern senators Just think about that for a minute .
That kind of interference is on the level of Terry Schiavo interference .
US Senators from “ right to work ” states with foreign auto plants trying to NEGOTIATE WAGE AND BENEFIT LEVELS with workers of private companies doing business IN OTHER STATES .
That totally blows me away .
US Senators are openly colluding with foreign auto companies to drive down the wages of American workers .
Something to think about the next time you hear “ You ’re either with us or against us . ”
And as a side note , as someone who has never really cared much for unions , I am as shocked as anyone to see myself defending the UAW this vigorously .
I guess I am just taken aback by how brazen the efforts are to blame this on the workers and to let the economy explode just to destroy unions .
It is pretty mind - boggling , and that is even after a pretty amazingly awful eight years of suck .
*** Update ***
Also , well - known pink commie Ben Stein was really in rare form last night on Larry King :
BEN STEIN , ECONOMIST : Well I think what happened was that the Republicans were sick of the bailout and they were also sick of the idea that the autoworkers had voted Democrat so many times and turned Michigan into an entirely Democratic state and they ’re also a little envious on behalf of the constituents of the way — the imaginary super wage benefit legacy cause .
But I think they made a terrible and unpatriotic mistake .
We ’re teetering on the brink of a depression .
We can ship money to Iraqi warlords and giant cargo planes .
We ship money all over the world .
We ca n’t ship it to help our own people ?
We can ship it to Goldman Sachs and rescue people that get $ 100 million a year but we ca n’t rescue an autoworker and his family ?
That ’s crazy .
*** STEIN : But it is going to do a lot to deal with the onrushing depression business .
That ’s the problem .
The problem is n’t the about business model of GM has failed .
We know its failed .
The business model of Goldman Sachs has failed .
We ’ve got a lot of failed business models .
What we are having is an onrushing depression .
We have got to stop it now .
We have got to have a government contra-cyclical action that stops it .
If we fall off a cliff into depression , it will be so much worse than any of the bailout costs .
You can not imagine it .
You do not want to let this go into Great Depression .
*** STEIN : I absolutely agree , absolutely right .
The government shoved tens of billions of dollars down the throats of banks who said , we do n’t even want it .
Now Detroit and the workers there who are decent Americans are begging for it .
For gosh sake , let ’s do the right thing .
You really need to read the entire thing .
However wrong Ben Stein might be on any number of issues , he at least appears to working from a reality based environment on this .
for the life of me , I do n’t understand how people think if these companies all fail the only fall - out will be a few union workers wo n’t be living high on the hog .
For christ ’s sake , even Toyota is worried .
*** Update # 2 ***
I rather like this :
“ I do n’t know what Sen .
Vitter has against GM or the United Auto Workers or the entire domestic auto industry ; whatever it is , whatever he thinks we ’ve done , it ’s time for him to forgive us , just like Sen .
Vitter has asked the citizens of Louisiana to forgive him , ” said Johnson , president of Local 2166 .
Otherwise , Johnson said of Vitter , it would appear , “ He ’d rather pay a prostitute than pay auto workers . ”
That ought to wrinkle Vitter ’s diaper .
The transplant of a lab - grown trachea was widely hailed as a major breakthrough in the science of stem - cell technology this week .
But it almost never happened .
Yesterday it emerged that the mad dash to get the stem cells from Bristol – where they had been grown – to Barcelona , was delayed by obstinate airline staff .
With a 16 - hour window to transport the cells , the international medical team had to get to Barcelona as soon as they could .
But despite the significance of the operation on Claudio Castillo , 30 , they opted to fly easyJet to save money .
Yesterday , senior members of the team claimed check - in staff nearly jeopardised the entire operation by refusing to allow the stem cells on the plane , having initially agreed to the carriage .
As a result , according to the doctors , the team was forced to charter a private jet for £ 14,000 .
Professor Martin Birchall , a lead researcher on the project , said he had several conversations with the airline hours before the flight , and was given repeated reassurance it would be fine to take the cells on board .
But when they arrived at the airport , the airline refused , said Professor Anthony Hollander , another scientist involved : " Check - in staff said they could n't take the material on board , because it could be dangerous .
" After significant debate , we concluded that it was n't going to happen . "
" The clock was ticking , " added Professor Birchall , " We had taken the cells out of their culture an hour before .
We thought about driving to Barcelona , but that would have taken too long . "
In the end , the last - ditch scramble to transport the cells was only made possible by the ingenuity and quick - thinking of a German student on the trip , Philip Jungerbluth .
" Philip knew a German surgeon who he said used to fly .
We had a couple of conversations , and within two hours the surgeon was in Bristol – with his private jet " .
EasyJet denies it initially agreed to carry the cells .
Andrew McConnell , a spokesman for the airline , said calls for cell and organ transport are usually taken by the company 's call centre in Poznan , Poland – but no such call was received on this occasion .
" We do deal with human organs and would make an exception for a tight schedule , but there is no record of a passenger request to carry medical materials on board the flight , " he said .

Bush administration delays release of prisoner abuse photos Nick Juliano
Published : Friday November 7 , 2008
Print This Email This
The Bush administration is doing everything it can to delay compliance with a court 's order that the Pentagon turn over pictures of prisoners abused in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to a new court filing .
A three - judge appeals court panel in September ordered the administration to turn over 87 photographs depicting abuses at Abu Ghraib prison and other sites .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the photos in 2005 .
On Thursday , the administration requested a review of that decision by all 12 appeals court judges .
The ACLU expected the move , a lawyer for the group said previously , but it was nonetheless a frustration for those attempting to uncover the full extent of abuse that accompanied the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" This petition is a transparent attempt to delay accountability for the widespread abuse of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad by keeping the public in the dark , " Amrit Singh , and ACLU staff attorney , said in a news release Friday .
" These photographs demonstrate that the abuse of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad was not aberrational and not confined to Abu Ghraib , but the result of policies adopted by the highest - ranking officials in the administration .
The immediate release of these photos is critical to bringing an end to the Bush administration 's torture policies and for preventing prisoner abuse in the future . "
The ACLU 's ongoing FOIA lawsuits have compelled the release of more than 100,000 pages of documents , including memos authorizing CIA torture .
At issue are 87 photographs the ACLU believed were taken by members of the military at facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan , including the Abu Ghraib prison that became synonymous with US abuses after humiliating photos from there first appeared in the New Yorker in early 2004 .
Although the government stopped trying to fight the full release of Abu Ghraib photos after they all were independently published in 2006 , the ACLU says the Pentagon continues to keep hidden 29 additional images from at least seven different locations in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The appeals panel went on to overturn the government 's attempt to use FOIA as " an all - purpose damper on global controversy " in finding that the exemptions to the public records law the administration had claimed were not valid .
Some photos of abuses at Abu Ghraib can be seen here .

As per tradition , it 's time for the annual Screen Burn Awards , which , as is also tradition , I 'm having to type through a feverish cloud of cold germs which are sending pure liquid apathy coursing through my veins .
Boo hoo for me .
Still , let 's kick sickness to the curb and concentrate on handing out gong number one : the Award For Hilariously Annoying The Middle Classes , which goes to Delia Smith for her BBC2 series Delia .
The show largely consisted of her tipping tinned mince and frozen mash into bubbling cauldrons , ostensibly in an attempt to teach viewers how to " cheat " at cooking , but largely , I suspect , to deliberately put the wind up the army of self - righteous food snobs who 've come to dominate the broadsheets over the past decade .
Given their horrified reactions - one even claimed to have burned all their Delia books in protest - you 'd have been forgiven for thinking she 'd been shitting in saucepans .
Even funnier is the fact that , what with the collapse of the economic system , the self - same huffers will probably have to spend the whole of 2009 eating out of cans anyway .
Next , the award for Worst Decision - Making In A Reality Show , which goes to Sir Alan Sugar for his apparently random dismissal policy in this year 's helping of The Apprentice .
He kept Jenny in long past the point where it had become apparent she was a nasty piece of work , sacked Raef and Simon even though they 'd done nothing wrong , and picked a well - meaning but patently idiotic whooping Gruffalo as his ultimate victor .
Next year they might as well pull a name from his arse at the end of each show .
I reckon they could keep the tension going as he fumbles around under the desk .
The Oh Christ , You Again award goes to Sky 's revival of Gladiators .
During the pre-publicity , they did their level best to make out that the entire audience had been rolling around in agony on its carpets for years , begging for a much - loved show 's return .
Really ?
That 's like hoping for a present - day resurgence of rickets .
The gong for Glaring Omission Of Background Information goes to Channel 4's religious makeover show Make Me A Christian , which stubbornly failed to mention that their lead " Christian mentor " was an extreme political activist who once campaigned to have the Welsh dragon removed from flags on the grounds that it was " Satanic " .
Anyone tuning in to discover what Christianity was all about would have been confronted with a warped , unrepresentative cartoon : I 'm an atheist , but it actually left me feeling incredibly sorry for yer average Church of England follower .
Who knows ?
Maybe that was the point .

And , in the blue corner : the BBC's Bonekickers , which desperately attempted to make the world of archeology - yes , archeology - interesting and exciting by crossing it with storylines so preposterous they'd be laughed out of the room as too far - fetched at a SpongeBob SquarePants writers ' conference .
Biggest Bellend is another double - header award .
One half of the trophy goes to Robert Kilroy - Silk for his pompous barracking of Timmy Mallett during I'm A Celebrity , who'd had the temerity to laugh when Kilroy , as part of a trial , was pedalling an exercise bike hooked up to a maggot - and - shit flinging machine hurling all manner of grossness into his face .
The other half goes to Rex from Big Brother , on account of his bizarre hairstyle , which made him look like a croissant .
And his half of the award is sawn in half again , with the remaining quarter going to Dennis , the pug - nosed horror who spat in a fellow housemate 's face .
The WTF ?
prize goes BBC1's Hole In The Wall , the least dignified , most unashamedly imbecilic gameshow in living memory .
Apparently conceived by a three - year - old , it consisted of K - list celebrities in spandex contorting themselves into puzzle shapes in order to avoid being dunked in a pool of water .
They failed 95 % of the time , but the show carried on and on regardless , like a Super Mario cutscene stuck in a loop .
The Most Stomach - Churning Wholesale Disregard For Basic Human Dignity was flaunted by the DFS commercials , in which blameless out - of - work actors were forced to mime along to Nickelback 's Rockstar - the musical equivalent of the last hot drips of salty diarrhoea to drip from your arse during a particularly violent bout of food poisoning .
I 've seen news footage of atrocities that managed to be less upsetting .
Years from now , the participants will still be in therapy .
Funniest Moment Of The Year was the sight of Derek Ogilvie , Channel 5's truly horrid " Baby Mind Reader " , bursting into self - pitying tears during The Million Dollar Psychic , when his powers were tested by scientists and found to be non-existent .
This was quickly followed by the Most Depressing Moment Of The Year when the programme makers saw fit to round off the show by introducing him to a Dr Gerald Gluck , who stuck some EEG widgets on his head and concluded that his brain was doing something funny , which Derek naturally took as a confirmation of his abilities .
Dr Gluck , incidentally , lists " energy healing " as one of his services , which makes him about as plausible a scientist as the average glove puppet .
It just keeps on giving .
As recriminations start to fly in the Republican Party about the election loss , new details on Sarah Palin ’s knowledge have started to emerge , and there ’s some serious humdingers .
According to the following report from Fox News , Palin did n’t know which countries are in the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , but better still , did n’t know Africa was a continent and thought it was a country !
Even Republicans would have to start to agree now : thank god she ’s no where near the red button .
UPDATE : Google has a cached copy of the ( since removed ) response by Executive Recycling to the 60 Minutes piece below and the GAO report mentioned in the 60 Minutes piece .
Here ’s the Google cached page ( for as long as it stays cached , anyway ) , and page 25 ( pdf page 29 ) of this GAO report has the exact reference used in 60 Minutes .
It ’s possible that the 60 Minutes story got some of their facts wrong – the GAO report does n’t mention Executive Recycling by name , so another source to make that connection would be required – and so the EPA should investigate this and , if appropriate , bring all 43 companies that the GAO “ stung ” up on charges .
This GAO report says the EPA is investigating .
It ’s illegal to dump electronic waste on developing nations .
But it still happens .
And sometimes it turns out to be a hometown company that ’s “ recycling ” lead - filled TV tubes and printed circuit boards in China , probably against the law .
60 Minutes ran this story on Executive Recycling ( ER ) , of Englewood , Colorado , and the company that my hometown uses for e-waste recycling twice a year .

Interestingly enough , ER had a response to the 60 Minutes piece for a while , but it ’s vanished from off the ER website .
If anyone has an archived copy of the page , or could point me to where I can find one , I ’d love to post it or link to it .
Use “ Contact Us ” above .
A year ago , I recycled an old , busted television .
I hope it was recycled properly , not shipped overseas to a town where a gang is willing to kill kids with lead poisoning for a few yuan .
I hope the feds charge Executive Recycling with export violations and , if ER ’s guilty , the company gets shut down and the executives responsible for this get locked up for a long time .
I ’d prefer that they be forced to endure the conditions that the “ recyclers ” do in China , but that would probably qualify as “ cruel and unusual punishment ” .

Activision 's DJ Hero Confirmed
" Activision 's doing a DJ Hero game , and I can't comment on what we 're doing [ at Neversoft ] , " Guitar Hero World Tour project director Brian Bright told Joystiq .
Neversoft , a fully - owned subsidiary of Activision , has been tasked with the Guitar Hero series since creator Harmonix was bought by MTV , leading to the rival series Rock Band .
Prior to Guitar Hero , Neversoft was known for its work on the Tony Hawk series .
" We 're working on the future and next - gen , " Bright said of the studio's future , though he was unable to offer specifics .
" If I was n't excited about it I would n't be there . "
DJ Hero has reportedly been a " licensing nightmare , " with rumors claiming that the effort will launch next summer with a turntable controller and a mash - up tracklist .
Development is supposedly occurring at the Activision - owned FreeStyleGames .

Lazy evaluation is a very novel aspect of Haskell .
Turns out that it ’s not that difficult to think about .
A very common example of lazy - ish evaluation is ‘ && ’ operators used in lots of languages ( using C# ) :
if ( ( obj != null ) && ( obj.someMethod ( ) == somethingElse ) ) { // do something }
_obj.someMethod_ is n’t evaluated unless _obj != null_ .
So _&&_ , a C# function / operator everyone knows and loves , is strict in its first parameter and lazy in its second .
The previous code might act a little like the following :
if ( obj != null ) { if ( obj.someMethod ( ) == somethingElse ) ) { // do something } }
If _&&_ were strict in both parameters , then it ’d throw errors when the second parameter was unconditionally evaluated ( e.g. _null.someMethod ( ) ) .
If _&&_ were n’t lazy , it might act something like :
condition1 = ( obj != null ) ; condition2 = ( obj.someMethod ( ) == somethingElse ) ; if ( condition1 && condition2 ) { // do something } }
Clearly , _condition2_ would throw an Exception when _obj_ was null , so the _if_ statement must not be evaluating the second parameter .
It ’s as if it were lazy …
Here ’s the ( slightly revised for clarity ) definition of _&&_ from Haskell :
( && ) :: Bool -> Bool ->
Bool ( && ) True x = x ( && ) False _ = False
Just as with C# , the first parameter ( _x_ ) must be evaluated , but the second parameter is only evaluated if the first parameter is True .
_&&_ is * strict * in the first parameter and * lazy * in the second .
### And That ’s All There Is to Laziness ?
Nope .
It ’s “ turtles all the way down ” .
Laziness is a defining feature of Haskell and a feature that separates Haskell from the vast majority of languages .
Lazy evaluation is n’t confined to a few operators in Haskell ; lazy evaluation starts at the first function / expression in your program and continues all the way down .
For more reading , check out here , here , here and here .
### But I Do n’t Want To Be Lazy
[ Example fixed . ]
Then force evaluation of your parameters .
How ?
One way is to use the _$ !_ function to force the evaluation of parameters .
f a b c = (( someFunction $ ! a ) $ ! b ) $ ! c

Maybe they ’ll be useful for you , too .
Want to be just like sitcom star Bob Cummings ?
We do n't remember who he is , either , but Marilyn Felling does .
She wanted an Aerocar just like his , got one — and now she 's trying to unload it for $ 3.5 million .
The Aerocar symbolizes the heady dreams of the future that seduced America during the post - war era like nothing else , and this particular example may be the most original you 'll find anywhere .
The Moller Autovolantor or the Pentagon 's flying Darpa-car ?
Pfft. Vaporware , my friend .
They are n't even prototypes yet .
Yeah , maybe in a few years you 'll be able to pick up a Terrafugia , but it wo n't have the same kitschy 1950s charm of an Aerocar .
Just six Aerocars were ever built , and they did fly when they were built .
Marilyn Felling bought Aerocar No. 2 more than 25 years ago , but never restored it .
She insists it has been examined by a mechanic and could be made airworthy in a few hours .
Of course , N103D has n't flown since the Ford Administration , so that may be optimistic .
Still — how cool would it be to own a flying car that 'll do 60 mph on the highway and 110 in the air ?
Just think of the joy you 'd feel .
And if you can't think of enough good reasons to own it , the folks at aerocarforsale.com have spelled them out for you .
You can pick one up " for inclusion in your private collection . "
Or if you 're feeling philanthropic , buy one " for a donation to your favorite museum . "
Maybe your kids or grandkids would appreciate it " as a legacy for the heirs of your estate .
" Our favorite is the promise of " a 1031 property exchange , " though we have no idea what that means .
Despite all those perfectly rational benefits , after two years the Aerocar still has n't attracted a buyer and Mrs. Felling turned to eBay .
We know gas is getting cheaper , but we 're not so sure about her decision to keep the " Buy it now " option at her original price of $ 3.5
million .
There 's a " Best offer " option , but as of Monday morning , no one had made one .
The Aerocar was the brainchild of engineer Moulton " Molt " Taylor , who reportedly lined up hundreds of potential buyers but only built six before production folded faster than Aerocar 's wings in 1956 .
General Aviation News says Marilyn and Carl Felling bought the Aerocar in 1981 with the idea of restoring and flying it , but they did n't want to risk damaging the rare vehicle .
" We realized that it was just too valuable to fly it around because we might ding it , " Carl Felling told the magazine .
And so it is that everything about N103D is original , down to the repairs made to the wings after a minor crash that involved
Raul Castro and a cow back in the '50s .
Somewhere along the line it was picked up by a radio station in Oregon that used it to do traffic reports during the 1960s .
N103D last flew in 1977 and went up for sale in 1981 as part of a divorce settlement .
Felling tried to sell it two years ago but found no takers .
Now , it 's for sale again – snap it up , before you lose your piece of fantastical history .
By the way , the AeroCar really worked .
You can see an old newsreel of the car driving and flying here .

Housing in California is years away from a bottom .
Let me make that clear and if you have any doubts , after reading this essay you will have a better understanding as to how I arrived at that conclusion .
This article is longer since it will try to answer many of the arguments from those calling for a real estate bottom here in California .
After looking at multiple sources of information like income , demographics , sales , psychology , and the economy there is no logical evidence for a housing bottom in California .
It is well worth the read and certainly provides more information than a 1 minute sound bite .
Recently I have noticed a resurgence of bottom talk coming from professionals in the field but also through e-mail questions .
My assessment is this renewed energy has come from two primary culprits .
The first is of course the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 that provides $ 300 billion in loan refinances and also bails out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In addition , there are many provisions in the bill to juice the market all of which will have very little impact on California .
Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announce earnings this week and the news is n’t going to be good .
Freddie Mac lost $ 821 million in the second quarter and announced that they will be slashing their dividend from 25 cents to 5 cents to conserve capital .
This would n’t be such a big deal except the U.S. taxpayer is now on the hook and a loss for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac leads us one step closer to a bailout .
The second reason for the upsurge in bottom talk at least for California is the massive price drop we ’ve seen this past year .
A drop in the median sales price statewide by 38.38 % is bound to get the attention of anyone .
Yet simply because prices have fallen steeply in one year does not signal that now is a good time to buy .
In fact , I will give you 10 solid reasons in this article why we are years away from any bottom in California .
We really are living in a once in a lifetime bubble .
It is highly probable that none of us will see a real estate and credit bubble of this size ever again .
There will be minor jumps and dips in the future but nothing on this level .
I think the best way to conceptualize this extremely large fiasco is to think of someone who is massively in debt .
Everyone knows of a friend or family member that spends way beyond his or her means and is usually in major debt .
They have nine credit cards , a $ 700 car payment , a $ 4,000 mortgage , and yet seem to shuffle debt around like musical chairs .
At a certain point , this game ends and some accept the reality and confront the issue head on and others live in denial .
Those that confront the reality sometimes meet with a financial professional or a debt counselor usually with advice to cut up the credit cards and develop a sustainable budget .
A prudent plan .
If you are serious about correcting negative cash flow situations , you really have to create a budget that takes into account how much money is coming in and going out .
In the case of our country , it has gone into debt counseling , was told to cut up the credit cards but is refusing to do so and is actually applying for more credit cards !
What you will not hear from bottom talkers is any mention of incomes from the vast majority of people .
Sure they will use random examples of those in Bel Air , Brentwood , Laguna Beach , or Newport Coast but that is a tiny fraction of the population .
They can not use income as a measure of support because it will demolish their bottom theory .
Let us now move on to the 10 reasons why California is years away from a housing bottom .
Reason # 1 – REO and Foreclosure Phony Numbers
Here are some stunning figures :
Q2 of 2008 Notice of Defaults for California : 121,341
Q2 of 2008 Foreclosures in California : 53,943
Yet when we look at the overall inventory on the market and sales , it looks like overall inventory is decreasing .
How can this be ?
First , there are shady things going on .
Can we prove this ?
Not with a definite yes but using multiple sources of data we can see something is not matching up .
It was hard to “ prove ” massive fraud in the subprime markets as it was going on but we knew it was there .
First let , us look at statewide sales for the past few years :
* Source : C.A.R .
This chart is very important because it covers the entire yearly sales for California .
Sales have been falling steadily since 2005 , long before the mainstream media echoed any sentiment about a bubble in California .
So this number is clear .
We will use the sales figures for 2007 since those have already been recorded .
Now , let us take a look at the raw sales numbers for Los Angeles County for 2007 :
Total Sales for Los Angeles County in 2007 : 74,722
Total California Sales in 2007 : 352,800
So Los Angeles County made up 21.1 percent of all sales for California in 2007 .
The point of this is that in a county with 10,000,000 people and 88 cities can be looked at as a microcosm of the entire state with low , middle , and high income neighborhoods .
Let us now look at the latest data for Los Angeles County :
Los Angeles County second quarter NODs : 21,632
Los Angeles County second quarter foreclosures : 9,609
Current Inventory August 2008 : 51,315
LA Sales in June of 2008 : 5,678
Months of Inventory : 9 months
These numbers should be pointing to the fact that we have not reached a bottom .
The June data for sales is normally the highest month for sales in California for many counties .
So far for the first six months in Los Angeles County we have seen this many sales :
First 6 Months Los Angeles County Sales : 27,268
We are including the highest sales month in this data so we can easily see that we are nowhere close to approaching the 74,722 homes sold in 2007 .
Keep in mind the fall is a slow selling season and summer is almost over .
We can safely assume that sales for Los Angeles County for 2008 will be approximately 50,000 to 56,000 when the year is said and done .
Take a look at the NOD and foreclosure numbers for the second quarter .
The fact that nearly 8 out of 10 homes that receive a notice of default in California turn into foreclosures should tell you that we are on the verge of seeing an onslaught of inventory hitting the market in the next few months .
If sales are falling and foreclosures are growing , how can months of inventory be declining ?
First , those that do not need to sell are probably thinking twice about selling their home thus artificially lowering the overall inventory numbers .
Second , we have lenders who are overwhelmed and simply choose on purpose or for whatever reason not to add the foreclosure as an REO and sometimes these homes do not appear in the MLS thus keeping certain homes off inventory lists .
You can do the math .
This is no bottom .
In June only 35,202 homes sold statewide .
For the peak month of data , this is a pathetic number .
Reason # 2 – The Walkaway Pay Option ARM Test
It seems like the mainstream media is finally catching on that Pay Option ARM mortgages are a disaster waiting to happen .
The state of California is waiting to see who will blink first .
I ’ve been sounding the Pay Option ARM alarm for a very long time because I really do think that this is the next major crisis .
To a certain extent , the $ 300 billion bailout given the current guidelines is something many can swallow bitterly because it would force lenders to writedown mortgages and also the borrower will have to share future appreciation with the government .
Not exactly ideal but given our government it is probably the best that we can come up with .
There is literally no way to justify the Pay Option ARM mortgage debacle that we will head into .
These loans turned thousands of Californians into futures traders by making their mortgage into an options contract .
How so ?
First , these loans allowed borrowers with a few flavors of payments .
You had your 30 year fixed vanilla payment .
Your 15 year accelerated payment .
Your interest only option .
Or the most popular and most widely used , the negative amortization option .
Many borrowers elected to make the minimum payment because why make the full payment if you were going to the flip the place in a few years ?
These loans also offered longer recast dates masking the problems for years .
5 to 7 year “ anniversaries ” were common where a loan payment had the potential to double once the recast date hit .
The only thing keeping this gig up was massive appreciation .
The lenders got to book the deferred interest as income and the borrower kept making the lowest payment .
This game was good until prices started to fall .
Now , many of these lenders barely recovering from the subprime mess are anxiously waiting to see how borrowers are going to respond to their recast anniversaries .
I can assure you that borrowers are going to let that option expire worthless .
This of course is easily explained .
Why would a borrower keep making a payment on a $ 500,000 mortgage when the home is now worth $ 300,000 ?
If they went zero down , the only incentive for them to keep making their payment is their credit history .
In many cases as we are going to find out people flat out lied and never qualified for the loan in the first place .
There will be no bailout for these people and this means :
( a) Lenders are going to take some massive losses and will do some serious balance sheet rebalancing .
( b) There is pent up demand alright .
Pent up demand to get rid of these toxic mortgages .
Many lenders are going to implode under the wait of their horrible mortgage underwriting .
We are going to find out how pervasive and extensive this fraud network is .
To paraphrase Warren Buffet , the tide is going out and we are going to see who is swimming naked .
Most of these loans fall under the Alt - A category and many lenders are deluded thinking these are much better than subprime loans .
They are not .
How many of these loans are out in California ?
Total Alt - A loans as of June 2008 : 688,975
Average Balance as of June 2008 : $ 419,790
Number with a prepayment penalty : 302,909
Number with a second lien at origination : 206,216 ( these are most likely worth zero )
Number with interest only payment : 252,329
Number with negative amortization : 198,385
Percent with at least one late payment in last 12 months : 27 %
Percent ARM loans : 70 %
* Source : New York Fed
Think about those numbers for a second .
This one point is enough to quell any bottom talk .
Take a look at WaMu ’s Option ARM portfolio , half of which is in California and you ’ll realize that we have n’t even seen the start of this mess :
What is the actual notational value of the Alt - A junk floating out in the state ?
How about $ 289,224,815,250 as of June 2008 .
Those of you wondering where that $ 300 billion figure comes from , there you go .
Reason # 3 – Free Rent ?
It is hard to believe that we are even in this situation but we are going to see unintended consequences galore .
First , lenders are going to realize that buyers are not going to stay current on their mortgages because :
(a) The economy
( b) Recast / payment shock
( c) Psychology
And when we say walkaway you need to realize that this is going to take on a new meaning here in California .
The foreclosure process here in the state is incredibly slow .
It can be anywhere from 250 to 300 days from the first sign of a problem until the sheriff comes to your door .
The idea most have of walking away is that someone is going to send their keys to the lender and are going to vacate the home soon after .
That is not the case .
Most people are going to walkaway psychologically first , then they ’ll give the keys only until the very last moment .
Many borrowers already know that the market in California is in the tank .
It is not coming back .
Many are now realizing that come the anniversary date , they are simply unable to cover the payment .
With lenders being inundated with late payments , the process is going to be delayed .
If anything , borrowers have a few months maybe even a year of “ free rent ” as some articles are pointing out .
What will this do to the market ?
Well , lenders are going to get reamed because of this .
First , some of the bottom callers wo n’t see these numbers reflected as inventory but those that actually look at the data realize this is only pent up supply that will be unleashed in the next 1 to 2 years .
These people are on borrowed time and so are the lenders .
Instead of speeding up the process , there is even talks about making it longer !
In fact , Freddie Mac only a few days ago announced that in 21 states it would extend its foreclosure timeline to 300 days from the first missed payment and 150 days from the initiation of the foreclosure process .
Is it any wonder the free rent meme is now spreading ?
Reason # 4 – The State of California is in Recession
Many of those calling a bottom forget one simple thing .
The state of California is in a recession !
We are seeing a unique two hit housing collapse here .
In the past housing bust here in California , the economy first declined then housing followed .
In this bust , we see housing declining first , the economy following , and then housing getting hit a second time .
This is the lull I feel we are in .
We are simply on a plateau until we start seeing prices start falling again because of the economy .
The bottom callers tend to gravitate toward economist and politicians that still technically feel we are not in a recession .
The California Governor came out with a strong hand laying off 10,000 + part time state workers , calling for hiring freezes , spending cuts , and is now in a battle trying to bring 200,000 state employees down to the federal minimum wage because of the budget impasse .
Oh yeah , we have a $ 15 billion budget deficit here in the state and the budget is now weeks over due .
Does that really look like a sign of a good economy .
Plus , we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country :
The fact that 10,000 + people were just let go , you can rest assured that the next month of data is going to put us squarely over 7 % for the unemployment rate .
Somehow those calling a bottom forget that you also need a healthy sustainable economy for people to jump back into the market to purchase homes .
Reason # 5 – Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury Smoke and Mirrors
The Federal Reserve , who in large part was fundamental in creating the easy credit that fueled this entire mess in the first place , does n’t care about the U.S. Dollar .
In fact , the U.S. Treasury does n’t care about the dollar either .
How so ?
First , they do their charade every so often by beating on their chest that they support a strong dollar yet do actions that actually harm the dollar .
For example , recently they have started talking about their “ concern ” about inflation .
There is a simple solution to that .
All they need to do is hike the Fed Funds rate .
Yet what do they do ?
Nothing .
The U.S. Treasury instead of punishing the egregious lending that went on for a decade decides to push the largest housing bailout in history on a weekend and extend credit to the two largest mortgage entities to purchase crap mortgages from the tiny mortgage entities !
As we saw with Freddie Mac , the U.S. taxpayer is going to take it in the shorts and in the end , it is n’t going to do a damn thing for the overall economy .
Freddie Mac is already bleeding red and this program does n’t go into full effect until October 1 , 2008 !
It will help a few people purchase some nice golden parachutes but the average citizen is going to quickly realize that stimulus gimmicks and bailouts do cost something in the end .
How does this apply to California ?
This is going to be the ultimate shock .
The bailout package wo n’t do a thing to help that $ 300 billion Option ARM tsunami just waiting on the balance sheets of many lenders .
Some borrowers are going to want to cement that minimum payment as their 30 year fixed payment .
Bwahaha !
That ca n’t happen .
Try calling your credit card company and telling them , “ yeah , I ’m only going to give you $ 20 a month even though I owe $ 10,000 because that is all I can afford . ”
Do you really think they are going to say , “ okay , we ’ll writedown your balance to $ 5,000 just cause we like you . ”
Each writedown is a major loss that needs to be reported and we have nearly 700,000 of these loans in the state alone .
Reason # 6 – It ’s the Income Stupid !
Another major point that tells us we are years from a bottom is incomes still do not reflect the median price of homes in the state .
In California the median household income is $ 53,770 if we look at the three - year average from the latest data at the Census Bureau .
The median price for a home statewide is $ 368,250 .
That gives us a ratio of 6.8 which is still too high .
It makes you shake your head when the peak price in April of 2007 was reached at $ 597,640 giving us a ratio of 11.11 !
Freaking unbelievable .
So from a relative perspective , yeah that 6.8 ratio does n’t seem so bad but anything seems better then the ratio of 11.11 .
Let us use the hypothetical numbers of this median income family buying the median priced home with a conventional 30 year fixed mortgage :
Median Income : $ 53,770
Median Price for a California Home ( June 2008 ) : $ 368,250
30 year fixed mortgage with 5 % down
Down payment : $ 18,412
PITI : $ 2,594
Net Take Home Pay : $ 3,607 ( filing as a married person with 2 exemptions )
At this rate , 71.9 % of the household net monthly income is being taken up by the house payment .
Even if we use gross monthly income , this person would not qualify for the underwriting in government - backed loans .
Now that income does matter and income is a direct reflection of the health of the economy , we are going to enter the next phase of the housing market .
The first phase was the bubble bursting creating the economic decline and prices falling , the second phase is going to be the uncovering of the fraud and toxic loans while recasts hit at the most inopportune time .
Reason # 7 – Renting is Hot
Renting or leasing a place is going to look a lot more attractive .
In fact , in Los Angeles County the majority of people actually rent .
Take a look at some of the rental rates for certain counties :
Households that Rent ( per county ) :
San Francisco : 65 %
Los Angeles : 52.1 %
San Diego : 44.6 %
Fresno County : 43.5 %
Orange County : 38.6 %
Riverside County : 31.1 %
As you can see , the amount of homeownership in a county is not indicative of a healthy market .
One of the most battered counties Riverside has a high home ownership rate at 68.9 % .
San Francisco which is one of the last areas to fall and has held up stronger than most California counties only has a 35 % homeownership rate .
What this should tell you is that renting in many places has already been a solid alternative .
In places like San Francisco and Los Angeles the majority of households do rent .
This is because even before the boom these were very high cost areas and after the boom they simply went into wonderland territory thus keeping the renting numbers high or stable .
Many people who would have qualified under the “ fog a mirror ” guidelines during the past decade will now have a hard time landing a loan .
Given the overall median income of the state the buyer pool just shrunk on a massive scale .
Another argument I have been seeing looks simply at the supply side assuming everything will once again play out simply because the inventory count is decreasing .
So what .
Look at the phantom shady REOs and the pent up supply that will hit the market shortly .
Take that plus the market demanding more stringent loan requirements and you just took away a large portion of your market .
The only way to get the housing market in California roaring again is to bring back the shady mortgage loan network and the complicit Wall Street backers hungry for loans to sell off to unsuspecting foreign buyers .
Do all foreigners think all Californians live in Beverly Hills ?
Apparently , Wall Street wanted them to believe this because stuff rated as AAA in areas with Real Homes of Genius makes no logical sense .
Now renting does n’t seem like such a bad idea and many of those that will lose their homes will become renters .
Many others simply do not want to buy given the current market prices .
Reason # 8 – Demographics
California has 36,457,000 people .
That is approximately 12 % of the U.S. population .
The argument is a simple one for many bottom callers because the raw number of people is growing in the state of California .
Yet given our overall economics this will not help the housing market .
First , much of the demographic growth is not with people who earn high incomes .
Most growth is in lower to middle income households .
Yes , these households do require housing but they are n’t going to be paying $ 400,000 for a shack .
They are either going to do two things which they already are :
( a ) rent or lease a home ( see Reason # 7 )
( b ) purchase a lower priced home
There is demand but for Affordable Housing in California and the unseen benefit is that this market correction is starting to do what politicians and builders could n’t do .
That is , create a surge of affordable housing through the real estate crash .
You really have to love how the politicians scream and stomp their feet about affordable housing yet when prices start coming down hard they do everything they can to sign in legislation to keep prices unaffordable !
This backward logic is the reason our President and Congress have ratings that are tanking faster than housing prices .
The idea that the sheer number of people coming into California is going to keep prices sky high is an absurd argument .
If that were the case , China with 1.3 billion people would have $ 1 million dollar homes in every single corner .
In addition , the fact that our budget is so poor we are most likely going to see higher taxes which will impact businesses further and additional state cuts creating more job losses .
From most recent reports we have actually seen a net migration of middle income earners from the state .
Reason # 9 – The Real Estate Feedback Loop
It was n’t uncommon to hear during the bubble days of California loan officers making $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 a month with a high school diploma .
That made the lender happy but also made the state happy when they collected their income .
The agents that were selling those median priced $ 597,640 homes were happy when they got their 6 % cut .
The appraiser , escrow officers , title companies , and sellers all had smiles on their faces in the mania which was the California housing market .
Much of this income was a once in a lifetime opportunity .
Wall Street through their sophisticated gambling racket of mortgage backed securities and all the synthetic derivatives based off these loans figured out a way to fool the world into believing the rate of growth in real estate was somehow sustainable .
Just to give you an idea of how many people jumped onto this ship , take a look at the number of broker and salespersons licenses given out by the Department of Real Estate here in California :
There are currently 542,267 broker and salespersons licensed in the state .
This for a state that saw only 35,202 sales in June of 2008 !
In June of 1998 there were only 297,359 licenses in the state .
So basically the number of people jumping into real estate doubled this decade while the population went up slightly :
1998 : 32,987,675
2008 : 36,457,000 ( an increase of 10.5 % )
So our economy suddenly turned into one fueled by real estate .
The government was happy because it was collecting beaucoup tax receipts from the decade long spending orgy .
Incomes kept going up as the Ponzi housing scheme kept growing .
That is the predicament we now find ourselves in .
A state so dependent on real estate for everything is now facing a market that is collapsing .
We did n’t diversify and we are now paying the price .
Jobs connected to real estate that are now going away include :
Construction
Agents
Brokers
Banks
Home Repair
Insurance
Finance
These were good high paying jobs .
Not only do these people face the pain of seeing their income fall sharply but they also do not spend hurting our “ consumer ” economy .
These were the people buying luxury cars , clothes , and eating at expensive restaurants .
The ripple effects will be felt throughout the country .
Those cars made in Detroit will no longer be purchased here in California at the same level because people simply cannot spend money they do not have .
The fact that fuel has surged has only accelerated the decline .
Fuel is ticking lower slowly and this is good because it will bring attention back to the number one issue , which is the housing and credit crisis .
This is the feedback loop we are now in and will be in for many years .
As you can see from the chart above the real estate economy here in California took a decade to build and will not dissolve into the economy over night .
Where do the bottom callers think these people will find jobs ?
The few sectors that do show growth , those of healthcare , leisure and government have their own nuisances :
( a ) healthcare – requires advanced training
( b ) leisure – much lower paying jobs typically in the service sector
( c ) government – Arnold said a hiring freeze so no luck there
I ’m not sure we are looking at the same data .
Many of those seeing a bottom also thought the subprime mortgage mess would be contained .
There is nothing contained about this multi- front onslaught of credit and wealth destruction .
Reason # 10 – Consumer Psychology : Why Buy Today when Tomorrow it will be Cheaper
I talked about certain trends that are emerging .
The idea of the “ all hat and no cattle ” mentality is something I talked about at great length in a previous article .
To blame only one sector is unfair because this was a collective spending orgy .
There was the powerful line that agents used of “ national prices have never fallen ” that is , until they did fall .
This was the first time that we have ever seen a national median decline in price since the Great Depression .
In fact , this decline in sharpness and strength is actually hitting at a quicker speed then that of the Great Depression .
So that mantra is no longer true .
In states like California , how do you explain a median price drop of 38 % in one year ?
I love the new argument that goes like this , “ well the few sales that are occurring are distressed properties and do n’t accurately reflect the overall market . ”
Newsflash .
The entire state is distressed .
Unless you are selling prime property in the Hollywood Hills get accustomed to distressed sales .
The number one issue on the minds of Americans is the economy .
The vast majority do n’t feel like buying homes when the economy is in the gutter .
Also , let us assume this is the bottom .
What in the world will cause prices to jump up in the next year ?
If anything you can rest assured that prices are going to stay the same for a few years .
I would argue that prices in California wo n’t bottom until May of 2011 and those that are betting with their money in the futures market are in the same boat as I am .
After looking at the above reasons , you can rest assured that many of those buyers sitting on the fence are aware of some of the 10 reasons .
One reason may be enough to keep them from buying .
10 reasons are enough to keep you from jumping into a bubble that still has plenty of air to release .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush announced $ 17.4 billion in emergency loans to faltering U.S. carmakers on Friday in a dramatic step to guard the industry from imminent collapse and save hundreds of thousands of jobs from falling victim to a deep recession .
Bush , seeking to bolster his legacy and bucking some fellow Republicans who would prefer the car industry work out its problems without government aid , said it would be irresponsible in a time of economic crisis to let carmakers die .
The government will offer up to $ 17.4 billion in loans to the ailing U.S. automakers and expects General Motors and Chrysler LLC to access the money immediately , a senior administration official said .
Ford Motor
Co , the other firm in Detroit ’s storied Big Three , said its liquidity is adequate for now and it did not need a loan at this point .
“ If we were to allow the free market to take its course now , it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers , ” Bush said , warning that to do nothing would deepen and prolong the U.S. recession .
U.S. stocks rose on the news of the lifeline to the sector , with GM shares jumping 16 percent .
Some $ 13.4 billion of the total package will be made available in December and January from a $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout fund that was originally designed to rescue struggling financial institutions .
Democratic President - elect Barack Obama , who takes over from Bush on January 20 , supported the move , calling it a “ necessary step . ”
A transition official said Obama was not part of the administration ’s decision to grant the firms a lifeline .
But Obama has been calling for short - term loans to the sector conditioned on steps toward long - term viability .
‘ BARREL OF A GUN ’
“ Thank God !
From an economic perspective , we were looking down the barrel of a gun .
So I am happy that someone has the good sense to duck , ” said Erich Merkle , an analyst with Crowe Horwath in Michigan , of the news .
“ It ’s a lifeline , but it does n’t get them completely out of the woods .
It takes them ( GM and Chrysler ) forward until March .
Basically the next administration has to deal with it . ”
The White House moved on its own after Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress were unable to reach agreement after weeks of negotiations that included desperate pleas on Capitol Hill from the auto chiefs .
Bush attached a string of conditions .
He set a deadline of March 31 for the companies to prove they can restructure sufficiently to ensure their survival or else the loans will be called back .
The three - year loans would require limits on executive compensation .
Auto companies must demonstrate how they would become viable .
They must pay back all their loans to the government , and show that their firms can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth .
The automakers would also have to provide warrants for non-voting stocks .
GM ’s CEO , Rick Wagoner , said the company would now focus on fully implementing its restructuring plan and was confident of meeting the government ’s requirements .
Chrysler announced fresh cost - cutting measures .
Michigan Democratic Rep. John Dingell , whose state is the heart of the U.S. auto industry , expressed concern at the prospect of concessions by auto workers .
And some Republicans were dismayed over another move by the Bush administration -- which has presided over massive bailouts to the financial industry -- to buck market forces .
“ It is deeply disappointing that the administration has chosen to use taxpayer dollars to delay the inevitable need to fundamentally restructure these companies , ” said Rep. Tom Price , a Georgia Republican .

GM , CHRYSLER WOES
Bush announced the loan program just weeks before leaving office with low popularity ratings , an economy in recession and the country fighting two wars .
The collapse of the auto industry and its knock - on effect on the economy would have been another blow to his troubled legacy before he hands over to Obama .
Both GM and Chrysler have said a bankruptcy filing is not an option they would chose because of the risk that it would drive more consumers away from their brands .
Both companies have been forced to idle plants and lay off thousands of workers across North America .
The automakers have warned that a bankruptcy filing by one could topple suppliers and endanger the remaining two companies because of the overlap in their key parts suppliers .

The Treasury said the move to help the automakers had effectively exhausted the initial $ 350 billion of the Wall Street bailout funds approved by Congress and that it now needs to access the rest of the $ 700 billion .
The remaining $ 4 billion in autos aid is contingent on the administration seeking access to the second half of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , an administration official said .
The loans would carry an interest rate of at least 5 pct but could rise to 10 pct if the carmakers default , Treasury said .
GLOBAL SLUMP
No automakers have been spared in the brutal global sales slump .
Following the U.S. government plan , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was set to announce an aid package for his country ’s auto industry on Saturday .
That aid could amount to several billion dollars .
Japan ’s Toyota Motor Corp could report its first annual parent - only operating loss in 71 years in the year to end - March , and may issue a profit warning at a scheduled year - end news conference on Monday , Japanese media reported .
Toyota , which declined to comment on the reports , last posted an operating loss in its first year of operation in 1937 / 38 .
Automakers everywhere are under huge pressure to cut costs as a global recession and tight credit strangle demand , and Japanese carmakers are feeling the extra pinch from a strong yen .
In perhaps the strongest protest since the dollar soared to a 13 - year high recently , Honda Motor Co CEO Takeo Fukui warned a strong yen would cripple Japanese industry and trigger mass layoffs , forcing the automaker to shift production offshore if it persisted .
Chrysler is widely considered the weakest of the big three U.S. automakers .
Cerberus Capital Management , the private equity firm that bought 80 percent of Chrysler from Daimler AG , has retained advisors to study a range of options for the No. 3 U.S. automaker , including selling off its most valuable assets , including its Jeep brand and its minivan line .
Have you ever gone to the phone to call a friend only to have your friend ring you first ?
What are the odds of that ?
Not high , to be sure , but the sum of all probabilities equals one .
Given enough opportunities , outlier anomalies — even seeming miracles — will occasionally happen .
Let us define a miracle as an event with million - to - one odds of occurring ( intuitively , that seems rare enough to earn the moniker ) .
Let us also assign a number of one bit per second to the data that flow into our senses as we go about our day and assume that we are awake for 12 hours a day .
We get 43,200 bits of data a day , or 1.296 million a month .
Even assuming that 99.999 percent of these bits are totally meaningless ( and so we filter them out or forget them entirely ) , that still leaves 1.3 “ miracles ” a month , or 15.5 miracles a year .
Thanks to our confirmation bias , in which we look for and find confirmatory evidence for what we already believe and ignore or discount contradictory evidence , we will remember only those few astonishing coincidences and forget the vast sea of meaningless data .
We can employ a similar back - of - the - envelope calculation to explain death premonition dreams .
The average person has about five dreams a night , or 1,825 dreams a year .
If we remember only a tenth of our dreams , then we recall 182.5 dreams a year .
There are 300 million Americans , who thus produce 54.7 billion remembered dreams a year .
Sociologists tell us that each of us knows about 150 people fairly well , thus producing a social - network grid of 45 billion personal relationship connections .
With an annual death rate of 2.4 million Americans , it is inevitable that some of those 54.7 billion remembered dreams will be about some of these 2.4 million deaths among the 300 million Americans and their 45 billion relationship connections .
In fact , it would be a miracle if some death premonition dreams did not happen to come true !
These examples show the power of probabilistic thinking to override our intuitive sense of numbers , or what I call “ folk numeracy , ” in parallel with my previous columns on “ folk science ” ( August 2006 ) and “ folk medicine ” ( August 2008 ) and with my book on “ folk economics ” ( The Mind of the Market ) .
Folk numeracy is our natural tendency to misperceive and miscalculate probabilities , to think anecdotally instead of statistically , and to focus on and remember short - term trends and small - number runs .
We notice a short stretch of cool days and ignore the long - term global - warming trend .
We note with consternation the recent downturn in the housing and stock markets , forgetting the half - century upward - pointing trend line .
Sawtooth data trend lines , in fact , are exemplary of folk numeracy : our senses are geared to focus on each tooth ’s up or down angle , whereas the overall direction of the blade is nearly invisible to us .
The reason that our folk intuitions so often get it wrong is that we evolved in what evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins calls “ Middle World ” — a land midway between short and long , small and large , slow and fast , young and old .
Out of personal preference , I call it “ Middle Land . ”
In the Middle Land of space , our senses evolved for perceiving objects of middling size — between , say , grains of sand and mountain ranges .
We are not equipped to perceive atoms and germs , on one end of the scale , or galaxies and expanding universes , on the other end .
In the Middle Land of speed , we can detect objects moving at a walking or running pace , but the glacially slow movement of continents ( and glaciers ) and the mind - bogglingly fast speed of light are imperceptible .
Our Middle Land timescales range from the psychological “ now ” of three seconds in duration ( according to Harvard University psychologist Stephen Pinker ) to the few decades of a human lifetime , far too short to witness evolution , continental drift or long - term environmental changes .
Our Middle Land folk numeracy leads us to pay attention to and remember short - term trends , meaningful coincidences and personal anecdotes .
Next month , in Part 2 , we will consider how randomness rules our lives through the metaphor of “ the drunkard ’s walk , ” well elucidated by physicist Leonard Mlodinow of the California Institute of Technology in his new book of the same title .

Visitors to London sometimes complain that Londoners are unfriendly , or at best reserved .
To them I have an answer : get a dog .
Borrow one for the duration of your stay .
Last autumn , I walked George , a two - month - old cocker spaniel , for a friend while she was away .
I had help from my good friend John ; in fact we took it in turns .
It rained every other day , so , like the little old man and woman of the mantelpiece barometer , I walked the dog on sunny days and John did duty on rainy days .
This did not go unnoticed .
London is a different world when you have a dog , especially a puppy .
Instead of scuttling or shuffling past , avoiding eye contact , Londoners young and old stop to talk to you and make a fuss of your little friend .
Surly teenagers in hoods , studs in sunglasses melted at the sight of George , petting him and picking him up — and sounding distinctly uncool .
One of George ’s admirers was a girl of about seven .
A plain , awkward child , she played by herself in the park .
On seeing the puppy , her face lit up and the plainness vanished .
Every day — or rather every other day — she rushed up to me , falling over herself to hold him and cuddle him .
Naturally we fell into conversation .
An intelligent child , perhaps rather lonely , she was curious to know all about the dog , its owner — and my strangely silent friend John , who appeared on rainy days .
“ Why does n’t your friend talk to me ? ” she asked , hurt .
I was surprised at the question and , thinking that John was being churlish or impatient , resolved to tackle him about it that evening .
“ What , are you crazy ? ” he asked .
“ I ca n’t go talking to little girls in parks .
I ’ll get arrested . ”
I remonstrated with him , but had to acknowledge that he had a point .
George ’s canine charms had failed to break down one of Britain ’s great barriers : the barrier between adults and children .
It is acceptable — just — for a woman to talk to someone else ’s child in a public place , but a man who does the same thing must be a pervert .
Has it come to this ?
How many perverts are there , for goodness sake ?
London Mayor Boris Johnson asked the same question in the Telegraph a couple of years ago , when a British Airways stewardess asked him to change seats because he was sitting next to some children : “ We have very strict rules . ” Johnson wrote :
To all those who worry about the pedophile plague , I would say that they not only have a very imperfect understanding of probability , but also that they fail to understand the terrible damage that is done by this system of presuming guilt in the entire male population just because of the tendencies of a tiny minority .
There are all sorts of reasons why the numbers of male school teachers are down 50 percent in the period 1981 to 2001 , and why the ratio of female to male teachers in primary schools is now seven to one .
…
But it is surely a huge deterrent to any public - spirited man contemplating a career in education that society apparently regards all adult male contact with young people as being potentially a bit dodgy , a bit rum , a bit you know . …
It is insane , and the problem is the general collapse of trust .
Almost every human relationship that was sensibly regulated by trust is now governed by law , with cripplingly expensive consequences .
The cost is not just financial .
Starved of robust , normal contact with adults — particularly men — outside the family , children remain infantilized .
Driven to school in cars , continually supervised , they live in a bubble , failing to develop common sense and judgment about which strangers and situations are benign and which are dangerous .
And it is a lonely bubble , in which adults seem not to care .
Tonight , a British current affairs program , recently did an experiment in a shopping mall , in which a child pretended ( very convincingly ) to be lost and distressed .
It took a long time before any passersby — certainly male ones — stopped to help her .
A kindly adult outside the family can act as confidant , mentor , and safety valve , as Esther Rantzen , founder of Childline , explained in a Daily Mail article denouncing hysteria about child abuse :
Last week , I met one of Europe ’s most successful architects .
He told me his parents were extremely poor , and that because his mother had a serious mental illness , his father left the family home .
But they had a neighbor — a man with no children of his own — who noticed his talent when he was young and gave him art classes .
Suppose the neighbor had been a pervert ?
Well , it ’s possible , but is it likely ?
Here are some statistics on perpetrators of child abuse .
As this is an American website , I will take them from a U.S. report , Child Maltreatment :
In FFY 2005 , more than three - quarters of perpetrators of child maltreatment ( 79.4 % ) were parents , and another 6.8 percent were other relatives of the victim .
Unrelated caregivers ( foster parents , residential facility staff , child daycare providers , and legal guardians ) accounted for less than 10.1 percent of perpetrators .
Women comprised a larger percentage of all perpetrators than men , 57.8 percent compared to 42.2 percent .
More than three - fourths of all perpetrators were younger than age 40 .
Seemingly , the “ dirty old man ” in the park is the least of a child ’s worries .
As the statistics show , most abuse , sexual or otherwise , takes place within the family .
A particular problem in the UK ’s Muslim community is that of forced marriages , and in Islam , a girl is deemed marriageable at just nine years of age .
In an article for the London Times on the connection between pedophilia and terrorism , Stefano Dambruoso , Italy ’s anti-terror magistrate , is quoted as saying :
The most you can attribute to them is a relationship between men and women different from that of us Westerners , in which — as in many parts of the Arab world — wives are often very young girls of 11 , 12 , or 13 who because of family negotiations are given in marriage to men much older than them .
But that is not pedophilia ; it is a question of Arab culture .
Really ?
One thing ’s for sure : a girl of “ Arab culture ” would not be allowed to play in the park by herself , and so would be safe from the dishonor wrought by an encounter with my friend John and an eight - week - old puppy .
This has to stop .
Adults should talk to children in public , whether to joke , teach , comfort , or if need be to admonish .
Normal adults , that is .
Or are we prepared to leave the field clear for perverts and psychopaths ?
Newswise — Interpretations of a now defunct form of Spanish writing , in combination with a joint U.S. - Cuban archaeological effort , are granting researchers insight into the Cuban people who Christopher Columbus encountered on his first voyage to the " New World . "
During the two previous summers , an archaeological effort in eastern Cuba has recovered several thousand pottery and stone artifacts from the site of a former large native village , El Chorro de Maita .
The effort is co-led by The University of Alabama and the Central - Eastern Department of Archaeology of the science ministry of Cuba and sponsored by the National Geographic Society .
Roberto Valcarcel led the Cuban contingent .
Dr. Jim Knight , a UA professor of anthropology who set up and is advising the project , said the artifacts from the site , in combination with the research of documents archived in Spain , are shedding light on the early history of the Indians of Cuba .
" We should be able to put together a map of who was where " where the different towns and tribes were and which Spaniards were where and what they were up to , " Knight said .
Handwritten documents originally produced by the early Spanish colonizers of Cuba recorded , as it were , some of the 16th - century " news of the day , " Knight said .
On at least one occasion , a detailed inventory of the possessions of an early Spanish colonizer provides insight into 16th - century life .
The researchers ' insight , however , does n't come without effort .
" It 's handwritten in a script that is barely recognizable as Spanish , even to a native speaker , " Knight said .
Dr. John Worth , an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of West Florida who is trained in interpreting the period 's writings , traveled to Spain to review the material and ordered relevant copies for further study .
" Our hope is to correlate the documents with what we 're finding at the site , " Knight said .
The people Columbus encountered during his first voyage to northeastern Cuba in 1492 are known as Arawakan Indians .
There is no concrete evidence , Knight said , that Columbus visited El Chorro de Maita , but this large village was occupied by Arawakans .
There has been speculation since the 1940s , Knight said , that Columbus did visit the site .
" That 's never been proven , but it's in the right area , " he said .
The Arawakans of that day were of a similar level of sophistication , although quite different culturally , as the Mississippian Indians , their contemporaries , who lived at Moundville , some 13 miles south of Tuscaloosa and which Knight has studied for more than 30 years .
" They were chiefdoms , as were the inhabitants of Moundville , " Knight said .
" And they were agriculturalists , but they primarily grew root crops instead of corn . "
Chiefdom is the name given to societies of the period that were headed by a chief , who would have unusual ritual , political or entrepreneurial skills .
The societies were very hierarchical , with power concentrated within other kin leaders , who would then redistribute the resources to the others .
Artifacts recovered from the site , including evidence of the manufacturing of " idolillos , " or little idols , at portions of the site is among the evidence that the society had both elite and non-elite members , Knight said .
The elite members of the group would have produced and worn these small , human - shaped figurines as part of a necklace .
" They probably represent a god - figure , but we do n't know which god , " Knight said .
Working alongside the Cuban and U. S. professional archaeologists during the excavations were students from Syracuse and Penn State , and three students from The University of Alabama .
The project is a part of the UA Cuba Initiative , which provides opportunities for UA students to pursue their education under a special academic license granted by the U.S. government .
Since 2002 , UA has received academic travel licenses from the U.S. Department of the Treasury which permits travel to Cuba for specific academic activities .
Last month we reported how seven major Hollywood studios teamed up to sue iiNet , Australia ’s third largest ISP .
The studios monitored iiNet 's customers using BitTorrent - including a ' copyright infringing ' subscriber they planted there themselves - and on whose shoulders the case appears balanced .
The claim of the Hollywood studios goes like this – they accuse Australian ISP iiNet of “ failing to take reasonable steps , including enforcing its own terms and conditions , to prevent known unauthorized use of copies of the companies ’ films and TV programs by iiNet ’s customers via its network . ”
The studios want iiNet to disconnect alleged infringers , but the ISP has refused to do so .
Adrianne Pecotic , Executive Director of the Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft said that the studios were forced to sue , since iiNet failed to take action against its customers .
The case returns to the federal court shortly , but the lead up to this action proves interesting .
With the approval of AFACT , the Hollywood studios started a secret investigation back in June this year .
After employing investigator Aaron Herps ( and getting him to join up as an iiNet customer ) and Copenhagen - based anti-piracy firm DtecNet for its software resources , they went online from 2 July to 30 October .
Herps then actively shared copyright works via BitTorrent in a quest to gather evidence to prove that iiNet authorized the copyright - infringing activities of its own subscribers .
But how would they prove this ?
After the 18 week investigative period , the studios had collected the IP addresses of many thousands of iiNet subscribers , which were handed over to iiNet boss , Michael Malone , who later commented , “ They send us a list of IP addresses and say ‘ this IP address was involved in a breach on this date ’ .
We look at that and say ‘ well what do you want us to do with this ?
We ca n’t release the person ’s details to you on the basis of an allegation and we ca n’t go and kick the customer off on the basis of an allegation from someone else . ”
Crucially , the studios felt they had an ace up their sleeve in the shape of their investigator and now iiNet customer , Aaron Herp.
Herps ’ own ‘ infringements ’ were reported to iiNet along with everyone else ’s , but of course , iiNet took no action against him , bolstering the claims that the ISP knew about piracy , but did nothing about it .
Interestingly , as Herps was actually authorized to share the movies and TV shows by the studios , he committed no copyright infringement , so if iiNet had disconnected him , they would have been acting incorrectly .
It ’s unclear what bearing this will have on the case .
Instead of taking direct action itself , iiNet handed all the evidence provided by the studios directly to the police .
“ So we say ‘ You are alleging the person has broken the law ; we ’re passing it to the police .
Let them deal with it ’ , ” said Malone .
Ultimately it will be for the court to decide if iiNet ‘ authorized ’ the infringements , but the claims center around a number of assertions – that iiNet knew that its users were infringing copyright and that it took no action against them ( i.e warnings , disconnection ) , that the ISP did not enforce its own terms of service ( no sharing of copyright works ) and that this liberal environment encouraged iiNet ’s users to share more files .
According to Business Spectator , a hearing will take place tomorrow which will decide a date by which iiNet will have to file a defense , a defense they have promised to mount , vigorously .
Similar to elements of the DMCA , the ISP has a defense under Copyright Act 1968 – Sect 112E : A person ( including a carrier or carriage service provider ) who provides facilities for making , or facilitating the making of , a communication is not taken to have authorized any infringement of copyright in an audio / visual item merely because another person uses the facilities so provided to do something the right to do which is included in the copyright .
However , the Copyright Act 1968 – Sect 116AH states , “ The carriage service provider must adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides for termination , in appropriate circumstances , of the accounts of repeat infringers . ”
However , proving that someone is an infringer takes more than a simple allegation , and it could hardly be considered ‘ appropriate ’ to disconnect someone on this basis .
Time for Justice Dennis Cowdroy to decide .
According to EIA data , gasoline inventories the week that Hurricane Gustav hit were the lowest that they had been since 2000 , amounting to 187.9 million barrels , or about 21 days supply .
Quite a bit of this inventory is needed just to keep the pipelines filled .
EIA does not publish information as to how far inventories need to drop before we start seeing outages , but it is clear that we have now reached the point where shortages are developing .
Where is our gasoline and diesel supply headed ?
Even before
Ike hit , quite a few areas of the US were starting to see gasoline shortages .
The impact of Ike can only make shortages worse .
Most likely , it will take refineries at least a week or two to get production back to normal levels after a storm of this type , considering the impacts of electrical outages and flooding .
In this article , I will examine some of the issues that seem to be involved .
Based on my analysis , fuel supply shortages are likely to last well into October , and are likely to get considerably worse before they get better .
Even though Hurricane Gustav hit on September 1 , its impact on petroleum product supplies were not felt immediately , because some inventories were still available , and because it takes a while for shortages to work their way through the pipeline .
Gasoline traveling by pipeline from Texas to New Jersey takes an average of 18.5 days to make the trip , so it should n't be surprising that it took 11 days ( from September 1 to September 12 ) for the Hurricane Gustav shortage to start to be felt .
Insight 3 . Since Hurricane Gustav hit , there has been a drop in refinery output of 1 to 3 million barrels a day .
The Department of Energy releases daily reports showing the amount of refinery capacity in the hurricane area that is shut in and the amount subject to reduced runs .
Figure 2 . Amount of Refinery Production Off Line , and Affected by Reduced Runs , Based on DOE Data .
We cannot know to what extent runs are reduced .
For the purpose of Figure 2 , I have estimated that reduced runs have the impact of reducing production by one - third .
The amount shown in the graph is a rough estimate of the amount by which refinery production will decrease .
It is not exact because :
(1) We do n't know the extent to which production was reduced under reduced runs .
(2) I have n't adjusted for expected refinery utilization rates , without the hurricane .
(3) The data is only for the hurricane area .
It is likely that the hurricanes have changed refinery production elsewhere - some increases ( greater use to offset shutdowns ) and some decreases ( because of unavailable crude ) .
Insight 4 .
It is likely that we will have product shortages for at least the next three to four weeks , because of shut in refinery capacity and reduced refinery runs .
I have said that it is likely to take a week or two to get refinery production up to pre-Ike levels .
Suppose it takes 10 days .
Adding 10 days to the date of the hurricane ( September 12 ) brings us to September 22 .
If it takes an average of 18.5 days to get product from Texas to New Jersey by pipeline , it will take until approximately October 10 before supplies are back to normal .
It could be a little shorter than this , or quite a bit longer .
Insight 5 . One of the biggest refined product pipelines , Colonial Pipeline , is now reported to be shut down , because of lack of refined product input .
Colonial pipeline is one of the largest pipelines , with a capacity of 2.4 million barrels a day .
It serves the Southeast and the East Coast .
Figure 3 . Colonial Pipeline Route
Until Colonial pipeline is back to carrying full capacity of gasoline , diesel , and other refined products , there are likely to be shortages along the gulf coast and the Southeast .
The Northeast may also begin to see shortages .
Other major outages have also been reported .
Explorer pipeline , carrying 700,000 barrels a day of petroleum products from Texas / LA to Indiana , is completely shut down .
Plantation pipeline , carrying 600,000 barrels a day of petroleum products from Louisiana to Virginia , is operating at reduced rates .
Insight 6 .
The lack of refined product ( gasoline , diesel , jet fuel ) is what is driving pipeline outages .
Until there is enough refined product , some of the pipelines will be short of products to ship .
In the immediate aftermath of Ike , lack of electricity may also interefere with the operation of some pipelines , but it is too soon to have information about these disruptions .
Insight 7 .
Areas with pipeline disruptions are likely to experience shortages of all refined products , not just gasoline .
While gasoline is the product that is in short supply most quickly because of lower inventories than some other products , eventually diesel and jet fuel can expect shortages as well .
Insight 8 . Regardless of whether price or some other type of rationing is used , someone , somewhere will need to go without refined product , if it is not available .
If there is not enough diesel to go around , some trucks will not be able to make deliveries or some road making equipment will not be able to operate .
If there is not enough jet fuel for all of the airplanes , some flights will have to be cancelled .
Some auto trips will have to be eliminated .
Insight 9 .
If 5 million barrels of refinery production is taken off - line , this is equivalent to a little over 25 % of US refined product usage .
We would hope that the amount of refinery production off - line would drop fairly quickly , but it could be several days before it drops from the current 5 million barrels off - line .
It will be impossibile to make up this huge shortage with imports of refined products from overseas , or the use of winter grade gasoline in summer .
Edit :
See reference table at the end of this article to see EIA data to compare to these amounts .
Because shortages are likely to vary by part of the country , depending on pipeline service to the area , it is quite likely some areas will experience shortages of 25 % for several days , even if loss in refined product declines to " only " a shortfall of 2 million barrels a day , which equates to 10 % of current usage .
At 10 % of current product usage , there would be a shortfall of gasoline of about 900,000 barrels a day .
Insight 10 .
Because some areas are likely to be very short of supply , it is likely that gasoline prices would need to rise to $ 10 a gallon or more in those areas , to cut back demand sufficiently .
In some areas , there may be temporary shortfalls of 25 % of more of gasoline supply .
To allocate such short supplies would take a very high price .
Government officials are not likely to let this happen .
Instead , we are likely to see many stations that are completely out of gasoline , and other stations with long lines , selling at most 10 gallons per customer .
Insight 11 .
The lack of diesel , gasoline , and jet fuel is likely to cause feedbacks to the rest of the economy .
If people are forced to cut back on gasoline use , they are likely to cut back considerably on trips to restaurants and other discretionary trips .
Restaurants that were doing poorly before will find their business much worse .
Restaurants on the brink of bankruptcy may be forced over the edge .
Some people will suddenly find their incomes lower ( for example , gasoline station owners who have no fuel to sell ; waitresses in restaurants ; truck drivers whose trips are reduced ) .
These people will find it more difficult to pay their bills than previously .
Some may default on mortgages and credit card debt .
Insight 12 .
We will all get to see first - hand a little of what the impact of peak oil is likely to be .
When there are shortages of fuel , people can be expected to hoard supplies .
This may cause shortages to be worse than they would otherwise be .
Co-operation could go quite a way to solving day - to - day problems .
We will get to see to what extent this actually comes into play .
Allocation by price has long been advocated as the American way .
We will get to see how long this lasts when there is clearly not enough supply at prices voters consider " acceptable " .

Jennings ’s decision , driven by circumstance and opportunity , is challenging the custom that an elite player must attend college before he pursues his dream of playing in the N.B.A .
Playing professionally in Europe suits Jennings ’s basketball goals and is far more lucrative than a college scholarship .
He was an all - American at Oak Hill Academy in Virginia and was considered the nation ’s top point guard .
No one knows the effect that a parade of elite players taking Jennings ’s path would have on the college game , and the flow of players to Europe is expected to be a trickle rather than a flood .
The N.C.A.A. tournament has thrived even though a generation of stars like Kevin Garnett , Kobe Bryant and LeBron James skipped college for the N.B.A .
“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen in terms of other people , ” Myles Brand , the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association , said in a recent interview .
“ But I would hope and expect that most would want to go to college , not just to play basketball but to get an education . ”
David Stern , the N.B.A. commissioner , is an advocate for having high school players wait a year to enter the league .
He said that Jennings would probably have a better basketball experience in Europe than in college .
N.B.A. teams have sophisticated scouting systems abroad , Stern said , and 74 international players began last season on league rosters .
“ I actually think it ’s a pretty cool thing for a kid to do what he ’s doing , ” Stern said .
“ There ’s a big world out there .
If you want to play for Rome as opposed to Arizona , go ahead and do what you think is best .
It ’s a positive development for kids and for the N.B.A. scouts . ”
At lunch near the Pantheon , Jennings spun fettuccine Alfredo on his fork and referred to playing college basketball several times as “ the easy road . ”
Jennings said he regretted that he did not declare his intentions to play in Europe before he left high school .
He said he would have received a bigger contract and shoe deal if there had been more hype .
Instead , Jennings , an admittedly apathetic student , signed a letter of intent to attend Arizona and planned to stay there only one season .
But he struggled to reach a standardized test score to meet the N.C.A.A. minimum for a scholarship .
( He and his mother , Alice Knox , said that his last SAT score was questioned by the testing service and that they still had not received it . )
Transcript :
Tom the Dancing Bug by Ruben Bolling Investigation Into Anti-American Elements In U.S. Government Anti-American Activity : Barack Obama 's proposal to raise the tax rate on the top income bracket from 35 ¢ to 39 ¢ -- a shamelessly Socialist redistribution of wealth .
Summary of Results : Shockingly , we found that many commies , pinkos and subversives with ideas far more radical even than Obama 's had already infiltrated the highest reaches of American government and political philosophy .
Adam Smith
Wrote that it 's reasonable for the wealthy to pay taxes at a higher rate than the poor .
We were very surprised to find out that the FOUNDER OF CAPITALISM , who died 28 years before Karl Marx was born , was a dirty , stinking commie .
Bill " Hammer and Sickle " Clinton Under Clinton 's evil anti-American reign , the tax rate on the top bracket was the same 39 % Obama is proposing , and America suffered through the longest economic expansion in its history .
Dwight " Bolshevik " Eisenhower Makes Obama look like Gordan Gekko .
Under his presidency ( with a Republican congress ) , the U.S. had a 91 % top tax rate .
Welcome to the collective , Ike. Richard " The Red " Nixon Top tax bracket under Nixon 's spread - the - wealth regime : 70 % .
There was a certain commie hunter congressman from California in the 1950s who would have liked to have gotten his hands on this pinko .
John McCain
In 2001 , voted AGAINST lowering the top tax rate from 39 % to Bush 's proposed 35 $ .
" Comrade " McCain defended the progressive tax system , denying that it 's Socialism : " When you reach a certain level of comfort , there 's nothing wrong with paying somewhat more . "
CONCLUSION : Suspect many more Americans believe in this commie so - called " progressive tax system . "
RECOMMENDATION : Domestic spying , enhanced interrogations , purges , re-education gulags -- to root out such radicals and undesirables .
These measures must be taken to ensure pro-American values in the motherland .
The Bush administration today issued a sweeping new regulation that protects a broad range of health - care workers -- from doctors to janitors -- who refuse to participate in providing services that they believe violate their personal , moral or religious beliefs .
The controversial rule empowers federal health officials to cut off federal funding for any state or local government , hospital , clinic , health plan , doctor 's office or other entity if it does not accommodate employees who exercise their " right of conscience . "
It would apply to more than 584,000 health - care facilities .
… Women 's health advocates , family planning proponents , abortion rights activists , members of Congress and others condemned the regulation , saying it would create major obstacles to a variety of health services , including abortion , family planning , end - of - life care and possibly a wide range of scientific research .
The HHS Rule Change that puts women 's access to basic healthcare in jeopardy by allowing providers , based on their personal biases , to withhold both services and information women need to make fully informed decisions about their healthcare , has officially been made by the Bush administration , as of today , and will go into effect in 30 days .
The rule itself is so broad that it opens the door for a whole range of terrifying possibilities : EMTs who refuse to treat gay and transgender people , entire hospitals that refuse to dispense emergency contraception , emergency room staff who refuse to save the life of drunk drivers …
It 's a clusterfucktastrophe .
It 's also eight billion lawsuits waiting to happen — but many of them will arise because people have died after being denied treatment .
As previously mentioned , Senators Clinton and Murray had introduced legislation to try to stop the rule change , which presumably will now be altered to try to undo the rule change .
I do n't know what else to say .
I 'm utterly heartsick .

Linux users are not an easy bunch to profile or to count .
Many Linux users download the operating system for free and never perform any kind of systems registration to enumerate their hardware .
That 's where Smolt may be able to help fill the gap .
Smolt is an open source hardware profiling technology that is already being used by Red Hat 's Fedora and is set for inclusion in the upcoming Novell OpenSUSE 11.1 release .
Ubuntu is currently considering Smolt as well .
With Smolt Linux distribution might be able to get a better grip of what users are running and how many users they have .
" Smolt is fairly accurate for where it is used , which is to say , at least today , primarily Fedora users , " Ted Ts'o , Linux Foundation Fellow and chief platform strategist , told InternetNews.com .
" There are plenty of enterprise Linux users that wo n't use Smolt today , simply because it is not there , and if it was shipped with an enterprise Linux distribution , many enterprise Linux servers are behind firewalls , and thus would not be counted for Smolt , " Ts'o added .
The Smolt effort began at Fedora back just prior to the Fedora 7 release as an opt - in profiling tool that lets Fedora know what hardware users have in addition to knowing the installed base number .
At the time , then - Fedora Project Leader Max Spevack noted that he had been in discussions with Novell about Smolt being included with OpenSUSE .
Those discussions have now led to Smolt being part of the upcoming OpenSUSE 11.1 release .
" I just did an OpenSUSE beta 4 install today and sent my hardware profile up using smoltGui , " Joe ' Zonker ' Brockmeier openSUSE Community Manager told InternetNews.com .
Novell 's OpenSUSE is n't the only one that is looking at Smolt .
Ubuntu Chief Technology Officer Matt Zimmerman told InternetNews.com that his developers have been in contact with Smolt developers .
" We 're exploring ways we can collaborate to our mutual benefit , " Zimmerman said .
" We are not currently shipping Smolt in Ubuntu . "
Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth , however , noted that Ubuntu has a tool that pre-dates Smolt and has been included in Ubuntu for some time .
Shuttleworth claimed that Ubuntu already has a database of user hardware platforms running Ubuntu .
The idea of a large multi-distribution effort to improve hardware compatibility is one that is appealing to Red Hat 's current Fedora Project Leader , Paul Frields .
" It 's absolutely a good thing whenever distributions work together to improve the overall coverage of hardware in Linux , " Frields told InternetNews.com .
" I 'm glad to hear Ubuntu is considering it as well , because Smolt is completely free and open source software , and offers an excellent way for Linux distros to see what hardware their users employ . "
Smolt could also potentially be a tool for counting the total number of users for a given platform , though that 's not its ideal use case .
The Linux Foundation 's
Ts'o noted that Smolt probably wound not be that great for counting Linux users as a whole .
Fedora 's Frields agreed , noting that Smolt is probably not as good for counting users as it is for counting proportional use of hardware across the user base .
" We prefer to count users with other methods , which we document on our wiki openly and transparently , " Frields said .
One of the methods used by Fedora for counting users is by tracking IP addresses that hit it update servers .
It 's a method that is n't entirely accurate either for a number of reasons .
One reason is that users could be behind firewalls and without unique IP addresses .
" This is one of the major challenges for Linux distros -- trying to estimate exactly how many people are using the distros , " OpenSUSE 's Brockmeier said .
" You can get a sense of the user base , but actual hard numbers are not easy to come by . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The troubles at E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O have worsened and now hinge on whether it can secure U.S. government funds that would bring some relief to its book of bad mortgage loans .
A sign is seen outside the E*Trade offices in New York November 12 , 2007 .

Shares of the discount brokerage tumbled below $ 1 to its lowest price ever this week , indicating that investors think chances are slim it will secure the $ 800 million it applied for under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) rescue program .
Competitors , including Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp AMTD.O , have said they are loath to bid for the smaller and now very cheap company , but have made no secret they covet E*Trade 's brokerage business , which has kept it afloat despite the drag of its mortgage business .
Roger Freeman , a Barclays Capital analyst attending a business update hosted by Schwab this week , said E*Trade ’s existence “ depends on whether it gets the TARP . ”
E*Trade ’s survival probably hinges more on whether its customers continue to drive growth , according to analysts .
But after a string of quarterly losses , the TARP funding is vital for the near term .
But there are serious doubts the company will qualify alongside larger banks whose collapse could further shake a weakened U.S. economy .
“ The way the stock is trading now , it appears as though a lot of investors do n’t expect them to get the TARP funding , ” said one analyst , who did not want to be named due to E* Trade ’s delicate situation .
E*Trade Bank offers credit cards , savings and checking accounts , and mortgage and home equity loans and hash about $ 28 billion in deposits .
About 5 percent , or $ 1.4 billion , of the customer deposits are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , according to the company .
The purpose of the government ’s TARP program is to capitalize struggling financial institutions so they can resume lending .
Some analysts said it is unlikely that E*Trade , in crisis mode , will be able to lend .
“ Inherently , it seems to go against the spirit of the TARP program , ” the analyst said of E*Trade ’s application .
The company ’s argument for public funds focuses on the fact that TARP is partly intended to support those institutions that facilitate liquidity in the market .
E*Trade has said it is confident it will secure the funding and expects to make an announcement later this month .
The company has $ 665 million in cash available to increase the capital of its banking arm if necessary .
Last month , E* Trade ’s daily trading and new client accounts both jumped from September , due largely to the volatile market selloff .
“ Customers have been consistently supportive of our business , ” said company spokeswoman Pam Erickson .
WORST - CASE SCENARIO
Overall , discount brokers are enjoying a spike in trading revenues , but they face the worst - case prospect of a lengthy bear market during which individual investors could exit in droves .
“ Despite the reasonably healthy trends in the core brokerage franchise , we believe continued credit headwinds , a lack of earnings visibility and a limited capital cushion for common shareholders gives us no reason to become more constructive on E*Trade shares at current levels , ” Credit Suisse analyst Howard Chen wrote to clients this week .
The analyst added that because few details on the TARP application have been provided , he has not factored that into earnings estimates .
Shares fell 7 cents to 87 cents on Nasdaq on Friday .
The company spokeswoman declined to comment on the stock price .
E*Trade has absorbed a series of price and ratings downgrades since the last quarterly update , when it boosted its provision for loan losses by 62 percent and warned that charges in its home equity portfolio would be higher than expected .
The company had $ 26.4 billion in total loans -- including consumer , mortgages and home equity -- on its books at the end of September , with about 3 percent , or about $ 792 million , considered “ nonperforming ” .
TELEBANC ACQUISITION
E*Trade , a high flyer in the 1990s technology boom , entered the mortgage business with its 2000 acquisition of Internet bank Telebanc .
The deal helped E*Trade weather the tech - market crash that followed , but also hurt when the mortgage market started to crack last year .
As recently as July , 2007 , E* Trade shares were worth more than the stock of both Schwab and Ameritrade .
But they plunged as the mortgage portfolio soured , and now the larger rivals are eyeing the healthy segments of E*Trade ’s business .
If E*Trade fails , some 4.4 million retail accounts would be exposed , opening the door to a possible government - sponsored takeover intended to protect clients , analysts said .
“ We have an interest in the brokerage accounts of any of our competitors in the brokerage business , ” Schwab Chief Executive Walter Bettinger said this week .
But he added : “ We do not have any interest in taking on a complex balance sheet issue , a complex set of loans or securities that will require ... massive work - outs , writedowns and impairments . ”
E*Trade had $ 119.4 billion in total assets at the end of October , of which $ 16.4 billion was brokerage - related cash .
E*Trade has " a very good brokerage operation , " Toronto - Dominion Bank TD.TO CEO Ed Clark -- who also sits on Ameritrade 's board -- said in an interview this week .
“ But they are associated with very bad assets , and so we ’re not interested to take asset risk in order to buy E*Trade . ”
When your laptop battery is about to give up the ghost , you are probably thinking of the typical three alternatives .
The most obvious , of course , is " wow , what a great justification for buying a new laptop " .
With laptop prices falling and no such luck with battery prices , this almost makes sense .
But , most of us will probably just bite the bullet and buy a new battery .
The third alternative would be to replace the cells in the battery you already have .
This article is about the third alternative .
If you are not fairly skilled in working on electronics , this is not necessarily a good alternative .
But , it is possible .
Personally , I was inspired to do this the first time because the small ( 3 - cell ) battery for my ASUS laptop was very ill and I could n't find a replacement .
Financially , it also looked like a good choice .
The out of stock new battery cost $ 129 .
I found the cells for a bit over $ 5 each .
So , I ordered the cells and , expecting to have a success , ordered six more for a sick battery for one of my T23 ThinkPads .
The first trick is to open the old battery without destroying the plastic or anything important inside .
What you need to do is find where the two parts are glued together and work on the glue line with something sharp until you can open the battery .
In the case of ThinkPad batteries , there are labels over parts of the glue line .
So , first cut through the labels with a sharp knife .
I then chose to use a wood chisel to first find parts of the plastic that will flex because there is open space behind them and then start opening in these areas .
You may have better luck with a utility knife .
Once you get the opening process started , a utility knife works best in some parts , the wood chisel in others .
Just be careful not to cut too deep or you could damage circuitry or wiring inside .
Also , remember that the goal is to be able to glue the battery case back together and have it fit in the laptop so cutting out a little plastic ( possibly with a fine saw ) may be better than an attempt to just open it up with the result of warping or breaking the plastic .
Once you have the battery pack open , it is analysis time .
The most common battery packs contain three , six or nine Li-ion cells of size 18650 .
Typically they are in strings of three in series ( that gives you about 11V ) and then each string is paralleled .
But , that may not be the case .
Do a bit of analysis before you start cutting wires .
Note that the cell size is not something that indicates that there are at least 18,649 other choices .
It is actually the diameter of the cell in millimeters ( 18 ) followed by the length in millimeters ( 650 ) .
The big advantage with this system is that if the cell is n't marked with a size , a metric ruler can help you out .
As Li-ion batteries need special " care and feeding " , you will find a circuit board within the battery pack , Wires will go from the circuit board to each cell junction so that the voltages can be monitored .
Also , there will be a thermistor and a thermal circuit breaker within the pack .
There are lots of places that sell replacement Li-ion cells .
One is Battery Junction .
On their site you will find all the common battery sizes .
They also have both PC boards to protect sets of cells and a special 18650 cell with a built - in protection circuit .
Assuming you are replacing cells in an existing pack , you just need to buy regular cells .
One thing you do need to watch for , however , is tabs .
Typically you can ask to have solder tabs spot welded to the cells .
This is the right way to go rather than trying to solder directly to the cell which could easily damage the seals .
Once you have all the pieces , it is time to actually build the new battery pack .
I cannot empathize enough that an error here can be dangerous .
First , you are dealing with batteries that if abused , can explode or burn .
Additionally , the monitor circuit is always active so you are working on operating electronics .
Consider yourself warned .
I have found the best way to build the new pack is first take all the cells , the circuit board and the connector out of the plastic case .
Figure out how things are wired .
That is , which cells are in parallel , which are in series and , most important , which is the positive and which is the negative end of each cell .
There is also usually a thermistor ( it looks like a little lump on the end of two wires ) and a thermal breaker attached to the batteries .
Figure this out and , better still , take a picture of it .
In the T2x series ThinkPad batteries , things are quite well organized .
The black wire goes to the negative end of the cell string .
The red and orange together ( one is the thermal breaker ) go to the most positive .
White goes to the 3.7V tap and yellow to the 7.4V tap .
You are most likely going to have to solder the battery tabs together or connect them with short pieces of wire .
Try to make the connections as compact as possible .
While everything may appear fine , when you try to put the top on the battery pack you may discover you need to re-solder connections and / or file down any lumps .
I start building the new pack within one half of the battery pack case .
Double - stick tape will hold the cells in place as you work on the battery .
Hot glue can be used to stick cells together and hold down the thermal breaker and thermistor .
When you get all the cells in place , start soldering the wires from the circuit board .
Once again , remember that the circuit is live so touching a wire to the wrong battery terminal can mean so long circuit .
Once all the connections are made , it is a good idea to check the voltages to see if they make sense .
Starting at the negative end , each cell or set of parallel cells should add about 3.7 volts to the total .
The exact voltage will depend , of course , on the state of charge of the cells but a fairly fresh cell should read 3.5 volts or more with no load .
If everything checks out , put the top on the battery case .
If it does n't fit , file , adjust , re-solder and such until it does .
It is then a good idea to test the battery in the laptop .
A bit of tape can be used to hold the battery together for testing .
If all goes well , you need to glue the two battery halves back together .
While model cement can be used , I prefer a hot glue gun .
Work slowly , preparing one side or part of a side , holding it together and let the glue set .
Then move along until the entire battery is sealed .
Then , with a knife , cut off any glue that extends beyond the seams .
That 's it .
You just proved you could save $ 100 by spending half a day playing with hand tools and glue .
New guest blogger Matt Wood heads up the Production Software team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , where he builds tools and processes to manage tens of terabytes of data per day in support of genomic research .
Matt will be exploring the intersection of data , computer technology , and science on Radar .
The original Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 , after a 13 - year worldwide effort and a billion dollar budget .
The quest to sequence all three billion letters of the human genome , which encodes a wide range of human characteristics including the risk of disease , has provided the foundation for modern biomedical research .
Through research built around the human genome , the scientific community aims to learn more about the interplay of genes , and the role of biologically active regions of the genome in maintaining health or causing disease .
Since such active areas are often well conserved between species , and given the huge costs involved in sequencing a human genome , scientists have worked hard to sequence a wide range of organisms that span evolutionary history .
This has resulted in the publication of around 40 different species ’ genomes , ranging from C. elegans to the Chimpanzee , from the Opossum to the Orangutan .
These genomic sequences have helped progress the state of the art of human genomic research , in part , by helping to identify biologically important genes .
Whilst there is great value in comparing genomes between species , the answers to key questions of an individual ’s genetic makeup can only be found by looking at individuals within the same species .
Until recently , this has been prohibitively expensive .
We needed a quantum leap in cost - effective , timely individual genome sequencing , a leap delivered by a new wave of technologies from companies such as Illumina , Roche and Applied Biosystems .
In the last 18 months , new horizons in genomic research have opened up , along with a number of new projects looking to make a big impact ( the 1000 Genomes Project and International Cancer Genome Consortium to name but two ) .
Despite the huge potential , these new technologies bring with them some tough challenges for modern biological research .

For the first time , biology has become truly data driven .
New short - read sequencing technologies offer orders of magnitude greater resolution when sequencing DNA , sufficient to detect the single - letter changes that could indicate an increased risk of disease .
The cost of this enhanced resolution comes in the form of substantial data throughput requirements , with a single sequencing instrument generating terabytes of data a week–more than all biological protocols to date .
The methods by which data of this scale can be efficiently moved , analyzed , and made available to scientific collaborators ( not least the challenge of backing it up ) , are cause for intense activity and discussion in biomedical research institutes around the globe .
Very rapid change
Scientific research has always been a relatively dynamic realm to work in , but the novel requirements of these new technologies bring with them unprecedented levels of flux .
Software tools built around these technologies are required to bend and flex with the same agility as the frequently updated and refined underlying laboratory protocols and analysis techniques .
A new breed of development approaches , techniques and technologies are needed to help biological researches add value to this data .
In a very short space of time the biological sciences have caught up with the data and analysis requirements of other large scale domains , such as high energy physics and astronomy .
It is an exciting and challenging time to work in areas with such large scale requirements , and I look forward to discussing the role distribution , architecture and the networked future of science here on Radar .
Young people are engaging in a " new culture of intoxication " that even has its own buzzwords – " pre-drinking " or " pre-gaming . "
If you 're a confused parent looking for a simple definition , just click on YouTube , or on urbandictionary.com , where it 's described as the " act of drinking alcohol before you go out to the club to maximize your fun at the club while spending the least amount on extremely overpriced alcoholic beverages . "
This new form of binge drinking goes far beyond a warm - up to a night out with friends , says a new report by Centre for Addiction and Mental Health researcher Samantha Wells and two colleagues at the University of Toronto and University of Western Ontario .
It 's an " intense , ritualized and unsupervised " drinkfest , in many cases perfectly timed so that the booze hits the bloodstream within minutes of stepping inside the bar , Wells said in a telephone interview from London , Ont .
" Heavy drinking before going out has emerged as a common and celebrated practice among young adults around the world , " says the study , published online this week in the January issue of Addiction .
While the extent of this " extremely dangerous style of drinking " may be " central to the language " of many young people today , the report says the reasons behind it are age - old : To " enhance and extend " a fun night out , cut costs and " reduce social anxiety or enhance male group bonding . "
But that 's not to say two can't play at this game .
Research has shown that women are more than capable of keeping up with the guys , said Wells , which makes their behaviour even more dangerous given the speed at which the alcohol is entering their relatively smaller bodies .
The report suggests that well - intended efforts , such as wiping out cheap - drink Happy Hours at bars , may have inadvertently contributed to this drive to drink beforehand , largely among people 18 to 25 , in some cases to the point where they pass out before leaving the house , Wells said .
These private parties remove a safety net of sorts , given that bar staff and bouncers are generally well trained to spot , and stop serving , those who 've already had too much , the researcher noted .
Another contributing factor is the " huge gap " between the cost of booze at liquor stores and in bars , said Wells .
It might be time for a debate on whether the two need to be more in line , despite the obvious economic problem that would pose for bar owners , especially in already tough economic times , she said .
Bouncers are already proving to be a first line of defence , said one bar manager .
" I do n't think there 's a bar in the city where , on a Friday and Saturday night , people are n't drinking at home before they go out , " said Jim McCardle , manager of The Madison Avenue Pub .
" If it 's excessive drinking , it 's always caught at the door because you can smell it on people when they 're coming in .
There 's the occasional one that might slip by , but I would n't consider it a serious problem . "
Wells said studies have shown that pre-drinking is quite common in the U.K. , where 55 per cent of men and 60 per cent of women acknowledged pre-drinking that in some cases can be so severe it leads to injuries , accidents and brawls .
The numbers are about the same in the United States , she said .
Florence Kellner , a senior researcher at the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse , has studied drinking among undergrads in Ottawa and said there 's no reason to think the problem is any less severe in Canada .
" They seem to feel that a night of drinking , without being high , just is n't worth it .
Some of them seem to have a real fear that they 're going to lose the buzz before they get to the club . "

Most young people seem to have gotten the message that drinking and driving is unacceptable , but now public education may be needed around the dangers of pre-drinking , said Wells .
" One of the problems is the view that this kind of heavy drinking is normal , that it 's mainstream .
There needs to be a broader message to pace yourself , that you do n't have to race .
That this can be dangerous behaviour . "

Left - Wing Anti-Feminism : A Revisionist Disorder
Proletarian Anti-Feminism : The Material Basis for the Conflict of Interest Between Men and Women in the Proletariat
Historically , anti-feminism in the proletariat took the form of attempts to restrict female participation in the labor force .
Proletarian anti-feminism was not the result of stubborn sexism alone ; it was principally due to the lower wages paid women and the resulting competition between men and women in the labor market .
The fundamental cause of the undervalued wages of women is the overall subjugation of women in society in which : 1 ) women ’s share in poorly paid jobs is much greater than that of men ( due to institutionalized discrimination ) and 2 ) wages of married women ( which are held to be no more than a contribution to their husbands ’ earning power ) are the most severely undervalued .
The undervalued wages of married women put pressure on the wages of unmarried women as well .
These factors mean that women ’s wages come to have a depressing effect on men ’s wages .
Consequently , the female proletariat is caught in a massive contradiction .
Women are driven to work by economic necessity , by the operation of capital itself .
However , one of the ways for proletarian women to escape the tutelage inherent in the nuclear family is by being drawn into waged labor .
Yet , the more women are driven into the labor force , the more their depressed wages put pressure on male wages .
The resulting antagonism from male workers manifests itself in demands for the restriction of female labor which replace the earlier demands for the abolition of female labor in the production process .
It is basically the same mechanism of depressed wages and the same conflict of material interests which account for the antagonism between white workers and national minority workers .
Historically , then , proletarian women have been defeated by the contradictory nature of their position , by the twofold nature of women ’s emancipation under capitalism .
While women could emancipate themselves by going out to work , competition at the same time imposed limits on this , emancipation .
The historical limits have meant that in ! , , , ’ , periods of prosperity proletarian women ’s movements have fought for higher wages and better jobs ; in periods of economic crisis women have had to fight to retain the right to work .
The super - exploitation of female labor power by capital can only be countered , in terms of reform , by union organizing and protective legislation .
However , historically , the principal opposition to basic reforms ( equal pay for equal work and a f air wage f or a f air day ’s work ) has come from the trade unions themselves and from the bourgeois women ’s movement .
While demands for the right to work , suffrage and other .
democratic rights have been common to both the bourgeois , and proletarian women ’s movements , protective legislation , , ” is another story .
Bourgeois women want completely free competition with men because their main enemy is patriarchalism , which must be negated before they can claim an equal share of their class privileges .
Bourgeois women can. , ” afford to oppose protective legislation because , on the one hand , they are usually provided with means of support beyond their own wages or salaries ; while on the other hand , the best of existing women ’s jobs go to the women of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie who have “ care , cleanliness , taste , even art , and above all , initiative . ”
In short , they can afford depressed wages and have a competitive advantage because they are better educated .
Bourgeois and proletarian women confront each other in the labor market , and bourgeois women are one of the instruments used to undercut the wages of proletarian women .
This struggle , this basic class conflict , is repeated today ( just as it was fought out in Clara Zetkin ’s day ) in the campaign for the pernicious “ Equal Rights Amendment ” carried on by the National Organization for Women and supported by the class collaborationist labor bureaucrats .
Where the bourgeois woman seeks only to establish juridical equality and to escape the confines of the home , the proletarian woman bears in addition all the burdens of her class exploitation and oppression .
This is why , for the proletarian woman , there can be no genuine female emancipation under capitalism .
It also makes clear why proletarian women have put aside their own emancipation for generations , to submerge it in class struggle .
However , as we shall see , “ submerging ” ( or liquidating ) the women ’s struggle into class struggle is not a requirement of revolutionary struggle - it is a product of left - wing sexism and the bourgeois morality in Marxism and , above all , a consequence of revisionism .
Whose class interests ( excepting those of the bourgeoisie ) are served by advocating the desirability of contractual marriage and the consequent perpetuation of the subjugation of women ?
If we look at its material basis , we find that proletarian anti-feminism is most characteristic of those strata of the proletariat whose wages are sufficient to maintain a family at an average working - class standard of living .
In such strata , where wages are adequate , a woman whose labor power is privately appropriated is a real bargain , for the same services , if waged , would be totally out of reach of the men .
Proletarian anti-feminism represents the particular material interests of highly paid , unionized male workers vis -à - vis women .
The subjugation of women serves as a “ natural ” restriction upon the employment of female labor , and thus partially controls competition in the labor force .
It keeps women unorganized and powerless in labor organizations .
It secures male workers the benefits that accrue to them through their right to privately appropriate female labor power as well as the psychological “ benefit ” of always having a woman inferior to serve as a waitress , lover and servant , securely dependent and , at least theoretically , humbly grateful .
No matter how low a man might fall , his wife is lower yet ; no matter how powerless a man may truly be , his home is his castle and his subjects his wife and children .
However , wage levels and employment patterns for the lower strata of the white working class and especially of racial and national minorities show that , for these strata , men ’s wages are not sufficient to support a family .
Wife and children are not a bargain , but a crushing economic liability .
The disintegration of families , the rates of desertion , the rise of second - generation welfare families - all testify to the growing masses of men who cannot sell their labor power at a price which covers the expense of a family , much less of a non-working wife .
Neither the bourgeois morality nor proletarian anti-feminism serves the interests of the lower paid strata of the proletariat , since the nuclear family does not materially benefit the husband , while depressed female wages enormously increase the suffering of families .
Furthermore , proletarian anti-feminism does not serve the overall interests of the proletariat .
In its espousal of the joys of the nuclear family and the virtues of the bourgeois morality , it objectively supports the ideological foundation for the devalued wages of women by refusing to recognize the material basis for the conflict between men and women in the proletariat .
The division between men and women is based upon competition for jobs , part of the mechanism for the super - exploitation of women .
There will never be unity between men and women until the material basis of the competition and hostility are correctly understood and eventually abolished .
No reformist program for “ equal wages ” or “ democratic rights ” has ever been or will ever be able to touch the roots of the subjugation of women ; nor will women ever be mobilized to fight for “ deferred ” emancipation – women have learned that waiting until “ after the revolution ” means waiting “ forever . ”
For women , as for all other oppressed people , the fight for their own emancipation begins today or it does not begin at all .
So long as a rigid , dogmatic class analysis is the basis for strategy , so long as early Marxist formulations of revolutionary strategy remain dogma ( even in the face of the fact that since 1917 it has been precisely the most oppressed peoples of the world who have successfully accomplished revolution ) , just so long will revisionism and the liquidation of the woman “ question ’ ’ into mate class struggle remain .
Left - Wing Sexism and Marxism
The absence of an adequate Marxian analysis of the position of women is the result of the unchallenged tenets of the bourgeois morality in Marxism itself , .
In the Critique of the Gotha Programme , Marx wrote :
The standardization of the working day must include the restriction of female labor , insofar as it relates to the duration , intermissions , etc. of the working day ; otherwise it could only mean the exclusion of female labor from branches of industry that are especially unhealthy for the female body or objectionable morally for the female sex .
( Emphasis added . ) [ 1 ]
About this passage Werner Thonnessen comments :
Both the concept of “ morally detrimental ” in the ( original ) Gotha Programme and of “ objectionable morally ” in Marx ’s Critique show that the socialists were letting their standard of morality be prescribed by the ruling attitudes of the bourgeoisie .
This is all the more amazing , as Marx had pointed out in the Communist Manifesto that all moral relations in the proletariat flew in the face of bourgeois morals . [ 2 ]
Female labor in general is incompatible with the bourgeois .ideal of the family and most particularly incompatible with bourgeois ideals of “ femininity . ”
The attitudes were unchallenged by the socialists of Marx ’s day .
About “ unfeminine labor ” Bebel wrote :
It is truly not a lovely sight to see women , even with child , vying with men in wheeling heavily laden barrows on railway construction sites ; or to observe them mixing lime and cement , or carrying heavy loads , or stones , as laborers on building sites , or to see them working at washing coal or ironstone .
The women there are stripped of all that is feminine and their femininity is trampled under foot , just as our men , in many different types of employment , are bereft of anything manly . [ 3 ]
The loss of “ femininity ” in heavy or dirty labor provoked only mild indignation by contrast with the outrage and moral indignation aroused by female occupations which sinned against the bourgeois ideals of purity and chastity .
Bebel again :
Finally , younger and especially prettier women are used more and more , with the greatest damage to their whole personality , in all manner of public haunts as service personnel , singers , dancers , and so on , for the enticement of the pleasure - hungry male world .
This area is governed by the most loathsome abuses and the white slave - owners here celebrate their wildest orgies . [ 4 ]
It is very clear that the socialists thoroughly shared the repressive sexual morality of the bourgeoisie .
Bebel ’s zeal , in denouncing the “ immorality ” of the bourgeoisie resulted in a “ proletarian ” ideal of purity and chastity which was the very same morality to which bourgeois patriarchalism paid homage and under which lay the subjugation of women .
The liquidationist error ( liquidating the superexploitation of women by submerging it into the class struggle ) goes back to the earliest days of Marxism , to Marx himself , to the Second International ; it was then carried through Lenin and reached a peak of backwardness under Stalin .
In this instance , sexism and male supremacy hide themselves under “ proletarian morality ” and a concern for the precious “ femininity ” and “ tender virtue ” of the female sex .
It was only when Marx was concerned with concrete analysis that he could glimpse over his own blinders :
However terrible and disgusting the dissolution under the capitalist system , of the old family ties may appear , nevertheless , modern industry , by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production , outside the domestic sphere , to women , to young persons , and to children of both sexes , creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes .
It is , of course , just as absurd to hold the Teutonic - Christian form of the family to be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the ancient Roman , ancient Greek or Eastern forms , which , moreover , taken together form a series in historic development .
Moreover , it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages , must necessarily , under suitable conditions , become a source of humane development ; although in its spontaneously developed , brutal , capitalistic form , where the laborer exists for the process of production , and not the process of production for the laborer , that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery . [ 5 ]
The objective consequences of Marxists ’ uncritical acceptance of the bourgeois morality concerning women and concerning sexuality have been to justify and perpetuate the subjugation of women in general and of women in the proletariat in particular and thus perpetuate the material bases for the real conflict of interest between husbands and wives , men workers and women workers .
Early Marxism , as a consequence of its own sexist bias , left proletarian antifeminism , rooted in the customary division of labor between the sexes , the traditional ideals of the family , and “ woman ’s place ” at home rearing children unchallenged .
The workers ’ anti-feminism was based upon capital ’s super - exploitation of women and the resulting competition between men and women on the labor market .
Marxists ’ anti-feminism was based upon unquestioned male supremacy .
It seemed to male workers that the problem of wages and competition could most easily be solved by keeping women out of the labor market .
Proletarian anti-feminism was fundamentally a result of the working man ’s lack of understanding that the utilization of female labor power by capital was an inevitable consequence of machine industry and the drive for cheap labor .
Male socialists of the day did nothing to enlighten the working class or to challenge male workers ’ prejudice against women .
The objective consequence of proletarian anti-feminism was to play into the hands of capital by keeping men and women workers divided against each other instead of united against capital and keeping women ’s wages undervalued .
The sexist bias in Marxism , beginning with Marx , was to perpetuate the oppression of women within the socialist movement and to strengthen the forces of revisionism within the Second International .
Proletarian Anti-Feminism and Revisionism
In the history of German Social Democracy , workers who thought in trade union terms always strictly opposed female labor .
In this they were hardly challenged by orthodox male Marxists .
The beginning of revisionism was in the predominance of trade unionism in the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , with its contempt for Marxist theory as “ idealism ” and its Lassallean concentration on reforms , to be gained through strikes and ballots , with the emphasis upon ballots .
An indication of the reactionary turn in the SPD was evident in its attempts to neutralize the socialist women ’s movement and destroy the SPD Women ’s Association , because the real basis for genuine radicalism within the SPD was the women and their female Marxist leaders , Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin .
Indeed , Lenin ’s only real allies within the Second International were Luxemburg and Zetkin !
From the earliest days of German Social Democracy the bellwether of revisionism was the position of the two tendencies – Marxism vs. Lassalleanism – on the position of women , for it was to be the women who sided with Lenin in the great debates on revisionism within the Second International .
It was the Lassalleans who , from the first , transformed the super - exploitation , oppression and subjugation of women into a “ question . ”
It certainly was not a “ question ” to the 190,000 women who were members of trade unions , the 140,000 women who were members of the SPD and the 112,000 women who read its women ’s newspaper .
( This momentous task of organizing was achieved largely through the untiring efforts of Clara Zetkin , against the constant interference and hostile machinations of the Party ’s revisionist leadership . )
The subjugation of women was a “ question ” only to the male reactionaries in the leadership of the trade unions and the Party .
We therefore conclude that it is no accident in 1977 , even as in 1863 , 1878 , 1890 , 1914 and 1920 , that the subjugation of women remains , to certain men , a “ question . ”
As early as 1866 the Lassallean position was clear : before women can be emancipated , the ( male ) workers must be fully emancipated .
Until then , it was “ sufficient for the man to work ” and “ woman ’s place ” was to hold “ domestic sway . ”
For example , take the discussion document from the German Section of the First International produced in 1866 :
Bring about a situation in which every adult man can take a wife and start a family whose existence is assured through his work , and then there will be no more of those poor creatures who , in their isolation , become the victims of despair , sin against themselves and nature and put a blot on “ civilization ” by their prostitution and their trade in living human flesh ....
The rightful work of women and mothers is in the home and family , caring for , supervising , and providing the first education of children ....
Alongside the solemn duties of the man and the father in public life and the family , the woman and mother should stand for the cosiness and poetry of domestic life , bring grace and beauty to social relations , and be an ennobling influence in the increase of humanity ’s enjoyment of life . [ 6 ]
France was not to be outdone :
The woman ’s place is at the domestic hearth , in the midst of her children , watching over them and instilling into them their first principles .
A woman ’s vocation is great , if she is awarded her rightful place . [ 7 ]
The general triumph of revisionism , the transformation of Social Democracy into a state supportive reform party , was manifested in its treatment of women .
It is worth quoting Thonnessen at length , for nothing has changed , and the treatment of women in the SPD will be cruelly familiar to all of us who have matriculated through the civil rights movement , the anti-war movement , Students for a Democratic Society and the new Communist movement :
The great theoretical decisiveness and rhetorical sting employed by Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin in combatting the revisionist tendency in the Party frequently induced Party leaders who were attacked to discriminate against women by means of malicious witticisms ( they would accuse the women of being organizationally weak – after all , what were 140,000 women worth ) while stating , on the other hand , that things could not be too bad as regards the oppression of the female sex if it could find spokesmen of such quality .
Symptomatic of this inherently contradictory defensive ploy on the part of men were the comments of Ignaz Auer ...
“ The trouble is that there are too few women comrades in the Party .
I wish there were many more .
The few who have to do all the work are overloaded and thus prone to become bad - tempered .
So it comes about that they sometimes make life miserable for us , even though we are not to blame . ”
By the use of deliberate wit , which , as the minutes record , always evoked the sought - for “ merriment ” of the audience , the women were put in their place ....
The discrimination which was deliberately practiced against women in the Party , and of which Mrs. Kahler gave examples at the Gotha Party Conference in 1896 , was in this way glossed over , while the existing antagonisms concerning the theory and tactics of the Party as a whole were obscured by accusing the women of griping and not achieving anything ....
Auer replied to Clara Zetkin ’s strong attack on the Party executive in the same tone when , amidst laughter from the audience , he said : “ If that is the oppressed sex , then what on earth will happen when they are free and enjoy equal rights . ”
The merriment which the Party executive aroused through its countercriticism served diversionary ends , by which dissatisfaction at the ruling state of affairs in the Party was ridiculed ...
The fact that this criticism was made to look ridiculous also meant a break with revolutionary theory ; the break with this theory , in turn , affected the leading representatives of the women ’s movement ... ( Mrs. Kahler asked ) .
“ Many comrades make such a joke of the woman question that we really have to ask ourselves :
Are those really Party comrades who advocate equal rights ? ”
Such joking proved an effective means for discriminating against women ’s demands .
It was an expansion of the patriarchism of the men and blunted the women ’s criticism of the Party ’s reformist practice ... [ 8 ]
It is not common knowledge that Rosa Luxemburg was not alone in combatting revisionism within the Second International and acting as the ally of Lenin – so also did Clara Zetkin and the whole Women ’s Association :
... there is no doubt that the swing of women to the left , after their leadership , resulted from the discrepancy between the Party ’s feminist theory and its discrimination against women in political practice . [ 9 ]
Thus women found themselves in the difficult position of being attacked on two fronts : that of revisionism and that of proletarian anti-feminism .
The men of the Party had their revenge in the end .
They stripped Clara Zetkin of all power , destroyed her Women ’s Association and so slandered her reputation that her work is virtually unknown and her name remains a bad joke .
Rosa Luxemburg had stayed clear of the Women ’s Association in order to be able to work as a theoretician of the Party ’s anti-revisionist left .
During her life she was denied the benefits of Party leadership and served as the butt of “ witticisms . ”
Yet , in the end , it was Rosa they feared .
And it was Rosa they murdered .
The ultimate beneficiary of German revisionism , Adolph Hitler , took the revisionist position on the woman “ question ” to its logical conclusion and established it as the State Policy of German National Socialism , proposing the final solution to the woman question : another thousand years of subjugation , another thousand years of “ the woman and mother ... stand ( ing ) for the cosiness and poetry of domestic life , bring ( ing ) grace and beauty to social relations , and be( ing ) an ennobling influence on the - increase of humanity ’s enjoyment of life . ” [ 10 ]
The long - term result of left - wing anti-feminism has been a century of struggle in which the fundamental position of women has improved as a result of overall improvements in the standard of living of the working class , but in which women ’s super - exploitation and subjugation have remained exactly where they were in 1863 .
Anti-Feminism in the New Communist Movement :
A Revisionist Disorder
The so - called analysis of the subjugation , oppression and super - exploitation of women , tagged with the insulting and sexist misnomer the “ woman question , ” and the resulting programs advocated by the majority of pre-party and party formations claiming to be Marxist - Leninist in North America today , can be described as versions of the German Social Democratic revisionist position .
Indeed , their positions on the “ woman question ” have not progressed beyond August Bebel ’s program of 1878 , were they even its equal !
Most , implicitly or explicitly , advocate marriage and the traditional female role while calling for “ democratic rights ” ( usually not different from the reformist equal rights demands of the bourgeois feminist movement ) .
Several are so opportunist as to support bourgeois campaigns that attack protective legislation for proletarian women .
When they take notice of working women ’s union struggles they do so opportunistically , without any consideration of the central issues affecting the general emancipation of the female proletariat .
Of the known formations , most condemn homosexuality as “ bourgeois decadence ” by making appeals to bourgeois morality , which they are able to do only by hiding behind the bourgeois morality ’s manifestations in the proletariat .
Such carryings - on are more clearly exposed when , in complete obliviousness to the material bases of the conflict between men and women , they suggest individual solutions through individual struggle , struggle in the bedroom , as the answer to what is a massive contradiction of capitalism in the advanced countries .
The question must be asked : whose interests are served by revisionist , anti-feminist positions in Marxist - Leninist organizations ?
One answer is readily obvious : the interests of the bourgeoisie and the class - collaborationist labor bureaucrats .
Proletarian anti-feminism has been historically linked to trade union consciousness in the proletariat and revisionism in the party .
The major pre-party and party formations in the United States seem to be following the same path trod by the Lassalleans .
It is not possible to ignore another factor with respect to the party and pre-party formations in North America : the material and social bases within the formations themselves for the perpetuation of the subjugation of women .
The advantages that accrue to the men of the labor aristocracy also accrue to the men who claim they are Communists ( and who are , in most cases , men of the petty bourgeoisie where anti-feminism is supremely the order of the day ) .
The hegemony of male leadership in the formation is safeguarded by practicing and advocating monogamous contractual marriage since it assures the continued control of party “ wives , ” and all is justified in terms of “ proletarian morality . ”
In fact , as should be clear , what is being invoked is proletarian anti-feminism and all the narrow prejudices and repressive sexuality of bourgeois morality .
From the time of Marx to the present , male hegemony and male supremacy in revolutionary organizations themselves have gone practically untouched , if not unchallenged .
The brutality of the treatment of Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin ; the sneers , snickers , jokes , aspersions ; the accusations of being ugly , nasty , domineering and unfeminine ; the hypocritical forms of discrimination - all are as prevalent today as they were in German Social Democracy .
The so - called “ woman question ” is like a searchlight cast upon these movements , revealing that they preserve bourgeois ideology and bourgeois class interests within the proletariat , however much their revisionism is hidden behind quotations from Peking Review .
Any real strategy and program for the emancipation of women must attack the bourgeois institutions of contractual marriage , private appropriation of female labor power and female reproductive power , male tutelage over women and male hegemony over women in public and organizational life .
Furthermore , the masses of women not employed for wages cannot be defined into invisibility because the institution of the nuclear family is held to be sacrosanct , or because trade union reformism is seen as the only mode of struggle in pre-revolutionary periods .
None of the requirements for the emancipation of women are reformist demands because none can be met by reforms .
Women do require a new and revolutionary society – but it must be a revolution and a new society in which women have an equal hand .

SPRINGFIELD - Investigators believe a 2 - month - old kitten found wandering in Hungry Hill with serious burns was intentionally set on fire , said a spokeswoman with the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
The kitten was found in the roadway by a passerby and taken to the MSPCA on Union Street at about 4:30 p.m. , said Candy Lash .
She said the kitten had serious burns to its ears and fur , its whiskers were singed off , and it had a laceration on its tongue .
Investigators believe the kitten was burned shortly before it was found in the road .
Its fur still smelled smoky , she said .
Lash declined to specify where in Hungry Hill the kitten was found , saying that information forms part of the investigation .
The kitten also appeared to be emaciated .
It weighs two pounds and " fits in your hand , " she said .
Lash said the injuries are serious but the kitten is expected to survive .
Once it recovers sufficiently , it will be available for adoption .
Kitten expected to recover
Staff have taken to calling the brown , short - hair tabby Nicholas , after St. Nicholas , Lash said .
" It fits the spirit of the season , " she said .
Animal police assigned to the MSPCA are investigating the case as an intentional burning .
It is not considered an accident , she said .
The MSPCA Law Enforcement Division is offering a $ 500 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible , she said .
Anyone with information is asked to call ( 413 ) 750-7661 or ( 800 ) 628-5808 .
It is the same odd realisation that overwhelms you at the great ruins of Central America or ancient Europe , the pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico or the labyrinthine streets of Ephesus in Turkey – the sense that a bustling civilisation , a hive of industry , need not even be destroyed to fall into ruin .
It can just be abandoned .
Crunching across the shattered glass of so many windows , over the dust and the detritus under foot and through the weeds and even trees that have burst through the broken concrete , you find little reminders of what this place once was : the plant where the Packard motor company spat out its luxury cars to a world obsessed with the automobile and in love with the high technology coming out of Detroit , the motor city where more than three - quarters of the world 's vehicles were produced .
It was abandoned 50 years ago , and yet it still stands , 35 acres of decaying history , accumulating a new layer of graffiti and a smattering of new oddities mysteriously dumped here .

A boat ?

A few letters stuck to the windows of the offices on the first floor , too few to make a guess as to its old occupant .
Toilet seats on the floor of what used to be the ladies .
The metal grid that once held the ceiling tiles has rusted and broken up and now dangles like stalactites .
The copper wiring has long been stripped out of the walls by scavengers .
Outside , the piles of rubble in what was once the main yard are covered by a thin layer of snow .
It is cold in Detroit .
The Packard plant – once grandiloquently called Motor City Industrial Park , now more decrepitly " Mo or City In u tr Park " – is five minutes from downtown Detroit , if not exactly the heart of the city then as close as .
These modern - day ruins have fascinated for two generations , as wave after wave of lay - offs and corporate collapses has reduced the size of the Detroit auto industry , and as the city itself has been abandoned by more than half the residents who lived here in its heyday in the Fifties .
From a peak population of 1.85 million , Detroit is down to 917,000 , and there is simply no need to tear down the structures of the past .
There are no crowds , only vacant lots every few blocks , from the heart of the city centre out into the suburbs , up to and beyond the famed 8 Mile Road that used to divide the city , racially and economically .
Even the famous music label Motown Records , created in 1959 , left the city in the Seventies .
The Packard plant is haunted by the ghost of crises past , no doubt – but perhaps also by the ghost of crises yet to come .
Because Detroit is a city under siege again , from the impersonal , unforgiving forces of the global credit crisis , and – the locals say – from the rest of the nation , which has soaked up the grim images coming out of the city for many decades and no longer has the heart to help when that is what is most needed .
The bosses of the three big automakers that are at the core of the Detroit economy were on Capitol Hill yesterday , pleading for money .
General Motors , Ford and Chrysler have already shed tens of thousands of jobs this decade , the latest phase of a relentless downsizing of the industry that gave Detroit its name , Motor City , and its soul .
The job cuts have continued through factory automation and through increased competition – as foreign makers first learnt to make cars , then learnt to make better cars than Detroit – accelerated each time by a new recession , or in the past couple of years by the high petrol prices that have reduced demand for the gas - guzzlers that gave the Big Three most of their profits .
Now , though , is something even worse .
The credit crisis has cut off loans that potential buyers need to fork out for new wheels , meaning that sales at the Big Three are down by between a 33 and 45 per cent in a year .
Even a healthy industry would struggle to adjust to that .
The car makers are now losing so much money they cannot even afford to write the redundancy cheques that might get them down to the right size .
With credit markets frozen , they can not get the loans to bridge the gap either .
" I 've lived in Detroit for 30 years , and this is the worst that it has felt in all that time , " says Robert Mutean .
" We feel abandoned a bit .
The country 's loyalty is not where it should be . "
He is browsing listlessly in the gift store at Ford Field , home of the local American football team owned by Bill Ford Jnr , the chairman of the car company .
The Detroit Lions are halfway through the season and , without a win , are becoming a pitiful metaphor for the city .
Mr Mutean , 36 , is not one of the 240,000 people employed by the Big Three , but he is one of the hundreds of thousands whose livelihoods depend on them , since he works for a shipping company that moves cars out of their factories and supplies in .
As many as three million jobs could be lost if all three firms go bust as the effects ripple through the US and cause a convulsion in the economies that rely heavily on auto industry jobs , according to a recent study by the Centre for Automotive Research .

In a nail salon across from GM 's glittering headquarters – the six - skyscraper Renaissance Centre it has been trying in vain to mortgage to stave off bankruptcy for a few more weeks – Christine Passerini is worried .
One way or the other , she says , a majority of her clients are connected to the industry – and she is bitter about the environmentalists on the West Coast who oppose bailing out Detroit .
" In California they are saying they want us dead .
Dead .
But we keep that state going , too , through the auto industry , " she says , adding that supplier and dealer jobs are spread across the US .
" And they have just put on the Los Angeles motor show . "
In the Ford Field store , Mr Mutean says : " I blame American companies for shipping jobs overseas .
The people that the automakers have let go are the people who would otherwise have had the money to buy their product – and it is an endless cycle downward now .
What do you expect when you lay off 30 or 40 per cent of your workforce ? "
Ford 's rise to pre-eminence came when the self - reinforcing spiral was upwards , after Henry Ford , its legendary founder , doubled his employees ' pay in 1914 to an unprecedented $ 5 an hour , attracting skilled workers from around the country to Detroit and putting the mass - produced Model T within reach of the ordinary consumer .
It was in Highland Park , the city - within - a - city four miles from downtown Detroit , that Mr Ford transformed the industry with the world 's first car assembly line .
That pioneering factory is long closed now , as is the old Chrysler headquarters that used to be round the corner and its Arsenal of Democracy sign that stood before the gates when the industry retooled for the war effort .
Instead , Highland Park is struggling on as a shadow of its former self , in fact winning some new businesses to the area but still blighted by unemployment rates that are above 30 per cent .
The deleterious effects across Detroit of abandoned and burnt - out homes has been greatly exacerbated by the sub - prime mortgage debacle , which first lured tens of thousands of people into loans they could not afford and then spat them out of their homes through foreclosures .
For the few residents who braved the cold on Monday night , a local council meeting in Highland Park was headlined by concerns about crime .
Mayor Hubert Yopp 's warnings included to call ahead before getting home so someone in the house could meet you , and to move your car repeatedly while shopping .
Crime is the most serious of numerous afflictions for a neighbourhood that has already suffered the decline that many more areas have experienced .
" When an area loses 5,000 people , that is $ 6 m in property taxes and water purification revenue that is just gone , " says Chris Woodard , a councilman .
" Clearing the weeds , shovelling the snow off the sidewalk , it takes money .
This city is in a financial emergency . "
How much more of Detroit , how many of the still - vibrant neighbourhoods close to the remaining car plants and supplier factories , will soon experience the struggles of Highland Park ?
On Capitol Hill yesterday , as in an online video posted on YouTube and in other lobbying efforts , the Big Three are arguing that they are just as integral to the functioning of the US economy and the employment of American people as the banks of Wall Street that have been bailed out so far .
Certainly the closure of one plant , the bankruptcy of one automaker is not the end of it .
Across the road from Packard , another abandoned building carries the sign : Arlan 's Discount Store .
And another : USA Food Center .
Beyond , another vacant lot with the ghosts of who knows what other stores , or bars , or diners that used to service the thousands of workers here .
Motor City : A legend in cars and music
* Detroit , the state capital of Michigan , was founded as a fur trading post in 1701 by the Frenchman Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac .
* Henry Ford started his automotive factory in the city in 1903 and invented the assembly line in 1913 .
The Big Three – General Motors , Ford and Chrysler – made Detroit their headquarters and Motor City became an industrial powerhouse .
In 1955 four out of every five cars sold globally was US made , half of them by GM .
* Detroit is the 11th most populated city in the US , with 900,000 inhabitants , but that is only half what it was in the 1950s boom days .
* Detroit was for much of the 1960s the music capital of America , famous for a style of soul music known as the Motown Sound .
This was characterised by the use of tambourine , strings , horn and " call and response " gospel - style vocals .
Motown Records , the label founded by Berry Gordy in 1959 launched the careers of Diana Ross , The Four Tops , Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder .
The label left town in the 1970s and the empty former headquarters of Tamla - Motown was demolished in 2006 for a car park .

As shell - shocked central bankers and finance ministers gather in Washington to confront the world ’s financial meltdown this weekend , that grinding noise in the background is the sound of the global balance of power shifting .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In sharp contrast to past crises — from the Latin American debt problems of the 1980s to the Asian and Russian currency collapses of the 1990s — the emerging markets of the developing world boast the strong balance sheets and deep financial pockets while the United States and Western Europe lurch from crisis to crisis .
Associated Press ‘ INTERCONNECTED ’: President Bush met with ( from left ) Jean - Claude Juncker of Eurogroup , Shoichi Nakagawa of Japan , Condoleezza Rice , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , Christine Lagarde of France and James M. Flaherty of Canada .
“ In a very bizarre way , roles have been reversed in the global economy , ” said Alex Patelis , head of international economics at Merrill Lynch .
“ The typical troublemakers of the global economy , the emerging markets , are actually now the world ’s creditors .
“ We do need a new world financial order , and we will probably get one as a side effect of this crisis , ” he said .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. gave a clear signal of the new pecking order last week on the sidelines of the annual Washington meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
With world financial markets reeling , Mr. Paulson said , he was following up an emergency meeting Friday of finance ministers from the traditional Group of Seven industrial powers — Britain , France , Canada , Germany , Japan , Italy and the United States — with a larger gathering Saturday of the so - called Group of 20 , which includes China , India , Russia and Brazil .

What he has found so far has impressed many .
Two burned olive pits found at the site have been tested for carbon - 14 at Oxford University and were found to date from between 1050 and 970 B.C. , exactly when most chronologies place David as king .
Two more pits are still to be tested .
A specialist in ancient Semitic languages at Hebrew University , Haggai Misgav , says the writing , on pottery using charcoal and animal fat for ink , is in so - called proto -Canaanite script and appears to be a letter or document in Hebrew , suggesting that literacy may have been more widespread than is generally assumed .
That could play a role in the larger dispute over the Bible , since if more writing turns up it suggests a means by which events could have been recorded and passed down several centuries before the Bible was likely to have been written .
Another reason this site holds such promise is that it was in use for only a short period , perhaps 20 years , and then destroyed  Mr. Garfinkel speculates in a battle with the Philistines  and abandoned for centuries , sealing the finds in Pompeii - like uniformity .
Most sites are made up of layers of periods and , inevitably , there is blending , making it hard to date remains accurately .
For example , several years ago the archaeologist Eilat Mazar uncovered in East Jerusalem a major public building from around the 10th century B.C. that she attributes to David ’s time and was perhaps even , she believes , his palace .
While she found pottery , it was in a fill , not sealed , making it hard to know how to relate the pottery to the structure .
Still , how this new site relates to King David and the Israelites is far from clear .
Mr. Garfinkel suggests that the Hebrew writing and location  a fortified settlement a two - day walk from Jerusalem  add weight to the idea that his capital was sufficiently important to require such a forward position , especially because it was between the huge Philistine city of Gath and Jerusalem .
“ The fortification required 200,000 tons of stone and probably 10 years to build , ” he said as he walked around the site one recent morning .
“ There were 500 people inside .
This was the main road to Jerusalem , the key strategic site to protect the kingdom of Jerusalem .
If they built a fortification here , it was a real kingdom , pointing to urban cities and a centralized authority in Judah in the 10th century B.C. ”
Now , with that background , read ( as we did ) all of what Tokyo , on November 30 , told its Ambassador in Berlin to say to Hitler and Ribbentrop : “ Say to them that lately England and the United States have taken a provocative attitude , both of them .
Say that they are planning to move military forces into various places in East Asia and that we will inevitably have to counter by also moving troops .
Say very secretly to them that there is extreme danger that war may suddenly break out between the Anglo - Saxon nations and Japan through some clash of arms , and add that the time of the breaking out of this war may come quicker than anyone dreams . ”
Projected on the background of the idea of American occupation of the Dutch islands , which apparently Tokyo had accepted , this famous clue takes on quite a different complexion .
It is certainly hard to read into it a warning of so premeditated an attack , on Japanese initiative , as that which had , in fact , already been launched on the high seas .
“ Magic ” has since been read , in the light of what subsequently happened , as a clear indication that Japan intended to involve us in her war from the outset .
But that reading also requires a high degree of selectivity in “ Operation Hindsight . ”
“ Magic ” said the Japanese would push us out of China — of course they would if and when they were at war with us .
They had already made a good start on it , without war .
“ Magic ” warned the Japanese ambassadors not to break off the negotiations or arouse our suspicions ; all of which tied in with whatever “ automatic ” military preparations they wished to complete , whoever their chosen victim might be , before they showed their hand in Washington .
“ Magic ” spoke often of the “ brink of chaos , ” “ chaotic conditions , ” and the “ tremendous crisis ” that would follow the rupture of the Washington conference .
It frequently coupled us , at least eventually , with Great Britain in the war they foresaw .
Tokyo told Berlin that we classed Japan with Germany and Italy ( with which we were not at war ) as enemies .
All this , however , was nothing more than we ourselves well knew — that we could not long maintain neutrality if the war spread to the Far East .
As late as November 15 Nomura was suggesting to Tokyo that , if the conference broke down and Japan pursued an unrestricted course , the most probable immediate results would be the rupture of diplomatic relations with us , or at least a partial rupture such as we then had with Germany .
And Tokyo did not say him nay .
Only just before Pearl Harbor did “ magic , ” that prolific source of information and misinformation , indicate with any clarity Japanese intention of involving us in war from the outset .
The plain fact is that the war warnings sent out by the highest military authorities nine days and more before Pearl Harbor were far more authoritative and more definitive of what the Hawaiian commands might expect , and what was expected of them , than any information or interpretations from “ magic ” that Military or Naval Intelligence could possibly have sent .
Complete reliance was placed on the effect those warnings should have had — and did have everywhere except in Hawaii .
But Tokyo apparently believed that the incredible might happen and Hawaii be surprised : Washington did not .
6
If the last few days before the Pearl Harbor attack much has been said and written , but to little profit .
The die had been cast .
The Muse of Tragedy then had the plot well in hand .
She saw to it that no circumstance occurred to ruffle the complacency in Hawaii , or to shatter the confidence of Washington in Hawaii 's full alert .
The Japanese fleet sailed silently through that “ vacant sea ” which Hawaiian defense studies had marked down as a likely line of approach .
The movement was covered by effective smoke screens — Japanese activities in the South China Sea and shilly - shally business at the Washington conference .
Charity Anderson
Mobile , Alabama
Interviewed by Ila B. Prine
Federal Writers ' Project , Dist .2 .
April 16 , 1937 .
A unt Charity Anderson who claims to be one hundred and one years old , ( 101 ) was born at Belle 's Landing , Monroe County , Alabama .
Her white " Marster " was Mr. Leslie Johnson who kept a public wood yard at Belle 's Landing on the Alabama River .
Aunt Charity now lives on St. Stephens Road , about one mile and a half north of Toulminville , a suburb of Mobile , Ala .
She lives with a niece , in a very comfortable and modern four - room house .
Although her sight is impaired , and she is a little hard of hearing , her mind seems to be clear and her memory good .
She is not able to leave the house , but with the aid of a stick , she manages to hobble around in the house .
She quite often falls and recently had two severe falls , which left her with a scar on her forhead ; otherwise she is a very nice old Mulotta darky .
Fair of complexion and snow - white hair , which was neatly combed and braided at the back of her head .
Having lost all teeth , she cannot eat solid food , but still is a tall , well proportioned woman .
Aunt Charity loves company and is delighted when any one comes to visit her , as she spends the day alone while her niece is away working .
When asked if she did not get tired of staying alone in the house ?
She replied : " I has so much tr'uble gittin ' up and down de steps , and tr'uble gittin ' ober de groun ' , I Jes makes myse'f happy her , cause thank de Lord I'se on Zion 's March " .

As I have written elsewhere :
One especially useful service that the state can render the corporate elite is cartel enforcement .
Price - fixing agreements are unstable on a free market , since while all parties to the agreement have a collective interest in seeing the agreement generally hold , each has an individual interest in breaking the agreement by underselling the other parties in order to win away their customers ; and even if the cartel manages to maintain discipline over its own membership , the oligopolistic prices tend to attract new competitors into the market .
Hence the advantage to business of state - enforced cartelisation .
Often this is done directly , but there are indirect ways too , such as imposing uniform quality standards that relieve firms from having to compete in quality .
( And when the quality standards are high , lower - quality but cheaper competitors are priced out of the market . )
The ability of colossal firms to exploit economies of scale is also limited in a free market , since beyond a certain point the benefits of size ( e.g. , reduced transaction costs ) get outweighed by diseconomies of scale ( e.g. , calculational chaos stemming from absence of price feedback ) — unless the state enables them to socialise these costs by immunising them from competition – e.g. , by imposing fees , licensure requirements , capitalisation requirements , and other regulatory burdens that disproportionately impact newer , poorer entrants as opposed to richer , more established firms .
Nor does the list end there .
Tax breaks to favored corporations represent yet another non-obvious form of government intervention .
There is of course nothing anti-market about tax breaks per se ; quite the contrary .
But when a firm is exempted from taxes to which its competitors are subject , it becomes the beneficiary of state coercion directed against others , and to that extent owes its success to government intervention rather than market forces .
Intellectual property laws also function to bolster the power of big business .
net impact
In a free market , firms would be smaller and less hierarchical , more local and more numerous ( and many would probably be employee - owned ) ; prices would be lower and wages higher ; and corporate power would be in shambles .
Part I. Roderick Long vs. Peter Klein
As Roderick rightly points out , in the mixed economy large corporations are among the prime beneficiaries of government largess , such that a wholesale defense of " big business " is silly and counterproductive for libertarians .
However , Roderick spoils ( for me , anyway ) an otherwise excellent summary by jumping to the unwarranted conclusion that today 's corporations are , on average , larger , more hierarchical , and more diffusely owned than the firms that would emerge under laissez faire ....
The problem is that [ Long 's and Carson 's ] argument cuts both ways .
Certainly large firms benefit from the state .
But so do small firms .
Corporations are under stricter antitrust and regulatory scrutiny , are more likely to be the victims of political rent extraction ( in Fred McChesney 's sense ) , and are subject to stricter disclosure requirements ( SOX being only the most visible , recent example ) than their smaller competitors .
Small firms benefit from state - funded incubators , SBIR awards , regional development grants , and a host of other interventions designed to foster " entrepreneurship . "
Trade barriers , war , state control of education , and a host of other interventions retard the international division of labor , reduce stocks of human capital , and lower the marginal product of labor , all of which reduce the scale and scope economies that favor large - scale production .
Which set of effects outweighs the other ?
It is impossible to say , ex ante .
The firm on the purely free market could be larger , more vertically integrated , and more hierarchical than the typical corporation under the mixed economy .
Moreover , the worker - owned cooperative , the partnership and proprietorship , the decentralized " open- production " system , all suffer from serious incentive , information , and governance problems , almost none of which are mentioned in the anti-corporation libertarian literature .
I suspect this literature 's preference for small - scale production is based primarily on aesthetic , rather than scientific , grounds .
Long is taking some haymakers right on the chin .
I do n't see how he makes an effective rebuttal .
He should throw in the towel .
Klein 's response is what I was waiting for .
A truly devastating dissection of Roderick 's argument , which now lies in shambles ....
I give him credit for kickstarting a very welcome conversation on the corporation .
Caplan is right -- this conversation has been ridiculously lively .
But as the conversation continues , Long 's contribution is getting more and more demolished .
That 's not surprising .
Long 's anti-corporate view relies heavily on Carson , and many of Carson 's positions can't stand up to serious scholarly scrutiny .
When Long presided over a symposium issue of JLS on Carson 's work , it was obvious that he sympathizes with it , but he played it safe by criticizing a relatively minor mistake by Carson .
Now that he has openly defended one of Carson 's more central claims , he is getting the same pummelling that Carson would take if his scholarship ever received more mainstream attention .

This affects the competitiveness of mega - firms with large firms .
It has no bearing on the competitiveness of smaller firms with these .
The Triumph of Conservatism
In Restraint of Trade
I found this claim puzzling , since “ vaguely defined property rights ” are notoriously a problem that plagues the corporate form .
It is unclear who owns the corporation , given that there is no identifiable group whose relationship to the corporation involves the usual characteristics of ownership such as unlimited liability ( in tort ) .
Note that I ’m not claiming that shareholders ought to have unlimited liability ; at any rate , I see the point of the argument that their separation from direct day - to - day control makes their exemption from liability reasonable .
( I ’m undecided as to whether I agree or disagree with that argument , but at any rate I do n’t automatically dismiss it . )
But the case against regarding them as fully liable seems like an equally good case against regarding them as full owners ; it turns them into something more like clients of the corporation , leaving it unclear where the real ownership lies .
Perhaps some division of ownership between shareholders and managers can be achieved contractually in a way that mirrors current corporate structure , but even so , corporate ownership will then be neither more nor less “ vague ” than in non-corporate forms of enterprise .
one facet
owners do not share the gains from increases in the capital value of the firm , and have reduced incentives to pursue long - term objectives .

... to borrow Bastiat ’s phraseology , the small firms that benefit from government assistance are those that are seen ; the ones that are most harmed by government action are those that are unseen because they are prevented from coming into business in the first place .
In the absence of licensure , zoning , and other regulations , how many people would start a restaurant today if all they needed was their living room and their kitchen ?
How many people would start a beauty salon today if all they needed was a chair and some scissors , combs , gels , and so on ?
How many people would start a taxi service today if all they needed was a car and a cell phone ?
How many people would start a day care service today if a bunch of working parents could simply get together and pool their resources to pay a few of their number to take care of the children of the rest ?
These are not the sorts of small businesses that receive SBIR awards ; they are the sorts of small businesses that get hammered down by the full strength of the state whenever they dare to make an appearance without threading the lengthy and costly maze of the state ’s permission process .
The assistance that small firms receive comes largely at the expense , not of larger firms , but of still smaller firms — or of those who would start such smaller firms if they could .
As Jesse Walker has observed :
Removing occupational licensing laws alone would unleash such a flood of tiny enterprises — many of them one - man or one - woman shows , sometimes run part - time — that I doubt the elimination of antitrust law and small - business setasides would offset it .
Especially when large businesses have proven so adept at using antitrust and setasides for their own purposes .
A genuine freed market , then , might well see what Sam Konkin described as the dissolution of the proletariat in the entrepeneuriat .
But the same argument applies to large firms .
We see those that benefit from government action , but we do n't see those that are harmed -- the small firms that would have become large , the large firms that would have become larger or more diversified or more hierarchical or whatever , were it not for the predator state .
Imagine the large , highly efficient firms we might see in a truly free market !

Part II .
Roderick Long vs. J.H. Huebert and Walter Block
... when the primary subsidy is the national and local automobile - centric transportation infrastucture , I can’t really see the point in picking on a company that makes consumers better off by making the most of the tax - funded infrastructure everyone uses .
it 's not clear why government roads give Wal - Mart an advantage over local businesses .
Perhaps Long is arguing that Wal - Mart would n't be able to deliver goods to its stores but for the roads , and then local businesses ( selling locally produced goods ? ) would remain in business ....
We hate to commit the tu quoque fallacy , but do not Roderick Long and his leftist confreres also use these vehicular thoroughfares ?
If so , this charge of his against Wal - Mart comes with particular ill grace from that source .
And while there might be a hermit or a Rip Van Winkle who does not utilize statist streets and roadways , virtually everyone is " guilty " of this behavior – and the market for everyone ’s products ( even philosophy lectures ) is distorted by the roads ’ presence .
the fact that everyone uses the tax - funded highway system does n’t mean that everyone benefits from it equally ; firms with wider distribution , and so higher shipping costs , benefit more from public highways than their competitors , and to this extent public funding of highways constitutes a net redistribution from local firms to nationwide firms .
But there is no reason to think that Wal - Mart – or some other big business – would n't find other ways of delivering goods over long distances in a free market .
Indeed , but for government intervention in the market for roads and transportation generally , it is entirely possible that there would be better , cheaper means for Wal - Mart to get goods to its stores .
Huebert and Block speculate that , but for state intervention , Wal - Mart might have at its disposal some even cheaper means of distribution .
No doubt it would .
But surely what ’s at issue is not Wal - Mart ’s absolute cost level , but whether , thanks to government intervention , its costs are artificially lower than those faced by its competitors .
Long writes that " Corporate power depends crucially on government intervention in the marketplace . "
But what does he mean by " corporate power " ?
A corporation is merely a group of individuals who have entered into a particular type of business relationship .
The corporate form allows them to be known collectively by their business 's name instead of their own names .
And it allows them to enter into contracts under which they limit their own liability – something which is perfectly legitimate under libertarianism .
( Objectivist historian Robert Hessen has made this point well in his book , In Defense of the Corporation ....)
The corporation , therefore , has no power to speak of .
Instead , only the state has power .
There is a kernel of truth in Long ’s viewpoint – some larger firms do use the apparatus of the state to steal an advantage over smaller competitors .
As a matter of history , things work out this way more often than in the opposite direction .
But Long appears to assume that big firms should always gain at the expense of their smaller rivals .
We both agree that there are governmental benefits and governmental burdens flying in all directions ; the question is whether there 's any perceptible systematicity as to the direction of benefits and burdens .
primary
disproportionate
Incidentally , in speaking of corporate power I am simply following the example of Murray Rothbard — a theorist of whom Huebert and Block , Rothbardians both , ordinarily think quite favorably .
Rothbard had no problem referring to the “ corporate power elite ” ( here ) , or describing political favoritism as a case where “ government confers this power on a particular business ” ( here ) , or labeling our current political system a “ corporate state ” ( here ) .
Moreover , Rothbard defined the “ ruling elite ” ( here ) as consisting not only of the “ kings , politicians , and bureaucrats who man and operate the State , ” but also those “ groups who have maneuvered to gain privileges , subsidies , and benefices from the State . ”
Of course Huebert ’s and Block ’s status as Rothbardians does not mean that they must agree with Rothbard about everything ; and perhaps this is an area where they think Rothbard went astray .
But in that case , if , as they say , my “ importance as a libertarian philosopher ” makes my comments “ all the more alarming , ” Huebert and Block must presumably be still more alarmed at the potentially malign influence of such similar comments coming from Rothbard , a far more prominent and influential libertarian thinker than myself .
Or if they are n’t , why are n’t they ?
... in the contemporary world of total neo-mercantilism and what is essentially a neo - fascist “ corporate state , ” bigness is a priori highly suspect , because Big Business most likely got that way through an intricate and decisive network of subsidies , privileges , and direct and indirect grants of monopoly protection .

From the fact , however , that tiny grocery stores exist cheek by jowl with large corporations in this industry , we can deduce that there cannot be advantages for the latter that are so strong as to drive into bankruptcy the former , even in our mixed economy .
Similarly , there are small restaurants that continue to serve the public , in the face of gigantic chains and franchises such as McDonalds , Wendy ’s , Burger King , etc .
Long gives us no compelling reasons why McDonald ’s would go away but local hamburger stands would thrive if the state were to disappear .

Moreover , it costs $ 250,000 to start a McDonalds franchise ; would such franchises really be competitive with small local firms if the cost of starting the latter were not set artificially high by licensure , zoning , quality standardization , and other regulatory requirement ?

But of course I never said it was wrong to accept selective tax breaks .
If a neighborhood thug breaks everyone ’s leg but mine , because he likes me , I ’m not obligated to demand that he break mine too .
My point was just that if I then win all the footraces against my neighbors , I probably owe my success to the thug ’s intervention – perhaps innocently so , assuming I did nothing to encourage the thug ’s policy , but innocent or not , I still ca n’t say it was simply through my own talents and effort that I succeeded .
Apparently Long is blaming Wal - Mart for profiting from selling goods that were transported over government roads that already existed and were not built for Wal - Mart 's benefit .
It is not at all clear what Wal - Mart could do to avoid criticism for this .
What method of transporting goods is n't subsidized ?
do
But whether or not Wal - Mart is to blame for highway subsidies , the fact remains that it does benefit from them more than its local competitors do , and to this extent its success is not a product of the market and so is not a reliable predictor of what we might expect to see if the market were freed .
Long also laments that our hampered free market does n't give unions enough power .
He writes : " Legal restrictions on labor organizing also make it harder for such workers to organize collectively on their own behalf . "
Given that the law allows some workers to not only organize themselves but also coercively organize others , it 's not clear what Long is talking about .
To support his claim , he cites a blog post which laments that U.S. labor laws do not go far enough .
We should support current labor laws , says Long 's source , but ideally we will return to the days of more " militant " unions .
You remember " militant " unions – the kind that used to ( and , well , still do ) beat and kill workers who do not cooperate with them .
Long and his " comrade , " of course , make no mention of the unions ' bloody history .
... Huebert and Block duly clicked on the link ; but evidently they read Johnson ’s piece with even more haste than they read mine , for they produce a truly bizarre summary of it : according to Huebert and Block , Johnson “ laments that U.S. labor laws do not go far enough .
We should support current labor laws . . . but ideally we will return to the days of more ‘ militant ’ unions . ”
In fact Johnson ’s article calls for the repeal of all labor legislation ad its replacement by an unregulated labor market ....
Unions are like a tapeworm on the economy , sucking sustenance out of businesses .
The entire rust belt is a result of unions demanding wages higher than worker productivity .
The present problems of the Detroit Three ( Ford , Chrysler , General Motors ) are mainly dues to their foolishness in not withstanding the unwarranted demands of the United Auto Workers .
Are you implying that sellers ought only passively accept or decline deals and never assertively negotiate with a potential buyer , merely so long as more than one potential buyer exists ?...
1 ) If so , do you apply that dictum universally , or just in the case of labor deals ?
2 ) If so , AND if you limit that view solely to the labor market , then I must ask what ( in economic terms ) is so special about labor ?
If so , AND if you apply it universally , then I must say you 're really doing yourself a disservice when it comes to selling a home or car ....
That statement [ that there is no way to sell anything for a higher price than the highest bidder is willing to pay ] sort of misses the point -- namely , that rhetorical efforts to systematically discourage assertive negotiation by one subset of transaction participants ( under color of economic thought ) are a misguided effort to cripple the market 's own discovery process for determining what " the highest bidder is willing to pay .

Roderick Long vs. Stephan Kinsella
the surreal insanity that actually characterises the daily work experience in large businesses - - " Dilbert " is popular because it 's so depressingly accurate .
It 's a lot to swallow to suppose that that situation owes little or nothing to governmental distortions .
The Dilbertish portrayal of the " daily work experience " as depressing has a Marxian whiff about it , does n't it ?
And it lacks a sense of perspective - - cubicle life seems far preferable to working in the coal mines , which itself must have seemed preferable to a pre-industrial hand - to - mouth subsistence existence .
And it is indeed true that criticisms of corporate power are usually anti-market ideology , and should be dismissed as such .
Critics of corporations are in the grip of anti-market ideology , as Roderick notes .
When left - wingers complain about corporate libertarians , they are confused .
They are not responding sincerely or honestly to a genine tendency .
The notion of " bargaining power " is leftist to the core .

... I 'm afraid Rod overlooks much more important beneficiaries of government privilege than corporations : Lower - skilled workers in the First World .
Lower - skilled workers in places like the U.S. earn several times as much as equally - qualified people in the Third World .
The reason is clearly immigration restrictions -- with modern transportation and credit markets , there 's no way that price differentials of that size could long persist ....
My point is that compared to immigration restrictions , government privileges to corporations are barely worth mentioning - and yes , that includes the unprecedented bailouts of 2008 .*
[* Consider :
If the only effect of immigration restrictions were to double the earnings of 70,000,000 Americans from $ 10,000 per year to $ 20,000 per year , the annual effect of immigration restrictions would equal the cost of the notorious $ 700 billion bailout ! ]

Immigration has enabled millions to live vastly better lives with no long - run effect on average wages .
But does this really make sense ?
Suppose , for example , that the government made corporations tax - exempt .
Would this actually benefit corporations ?
In the short - run , yes .
But these short - run profits would encourage the formation of more corporations - and the dissolution of non-corporations .
This process would continue until corporations earned only a normal rate of return .
Even with favorable tax treatment , corporations based on " insane directives " would still go bankrupt .
This does n't mean that differential tax treatment is harmless .
When you encourage less efficient forms of business , you reduce production , and the world gets poorer .
But the primary victims of these inefficiencies are n't small businesses ; they 're consumers - the ultimate inelastic resource .
shuts smaller , more efficient competitors out
control output and prices
restrict market entry
matters less than it used to , but the U.S. federal government still gets 15 % of its revenue from it .
That 's about $ 375 B .
Except for the year of the bail - out , it would be very hard for all corporate welfare combined to approach this figure .
Of course , if I 'm right about tax incidence , the main effect of the double taxation of corporate income is n't that corporations suffer .
The main effect , rather , is that we discourage corporations when they are more efficient than other forms of organization .
between
Roderick Long created quite a stir with his recent article in Cato Unbound , " Corporations versus the Market ; or , Whip Conflation Now .
" He attracted some criticism for his list of the ways that government intervention benefits big business , specifically , against its smaller competitors and against the general public :
But what ignited the real controversy was his claim that theof government intervention promotes larger firm size than would prevail in a free market :
The first and most important negative reaction came from Peter Klein Klein listed a number of specific objections to Long 's argument , based on past arguments with both Long and me .
Further , Klein challenged Long on his failure to address the large body of literature on the organizational weaknesses of worker cooperatives .
He cited arguments in an earlier blog post of his at Organizations and Markets on the agency and incentive problems entailed in " Vaguely Defined Property Rights " in alternative organizational models ( i.e. , stakeholder ownership as an alternative to traditional residual claimancy by shareholders ) .
In such organizations , he argues , free rider problems result from property rights not being adequately defined to ensure that actors " bear the full costs or receive the full benefits of their actions . "
Agency problems result , as well , from property rights being " non-tradable , insecure , or unassigned . "
Cooperatives and stakeholder organizations also have a problem with short time horizons among their members .
An anonymous email correspondent of Stephan Kinsella 's ( surely not Mary Rosh ! ) , remarking on Klein 's critique , wroteWell , golly !
As unprepared as I am to deal with criticisms byand all , I 'll give it my best shot .
From my perspective way out here in the outer reaches of crankdom , anyway , Klein 's arguments do n't seem all that " devastating . "
His examples of antitrust law and protectionism are n't even relevant to the point at issue .
Antitrust law , in the handful of occasions where it has been used to significant effect , has affected the balance of power - - not between large and small firms -- but between gigantic firms and absolutely gargantuan firms ( i.e. , between oligopoly firms and monopoly firms ) .
And protectionism benefits mainly national industrial giants at the expense of transnational firms ( when Long 's argument concerns the role of state intervention in enabling those giant national firms to come into existence in the first place ) .
As P.M. Lawrence pointed out in the comments to Klein 's critique , Long responded , along similar lines , that trade barriers " insulate large firms from foreign competition , " which means " they must be divided between the two sides .
" Antitrust law , in particular , is a poor choice of example .
The Clayton Act was showcased by Gabriel Kolko inas an example of Progressive Era legislation passed at the behest of big business to restrain competition .
Its practical effect , through restraints on " unfair competition , " was to bolster attempts by trade associations to restrict price cutting .
It thereby permitted , for the first time , stable oligopoly markets under the control of a handful of firms .
As Butler Shaffer elaborated , in , the " unfair practices " subsequently defined by FTC regulation included " selling of goods below cost or below published list of prices for purpose of injuring competitor ....
" As for Klein 's arguments on the agency problems resulting from vaguely defined property rights in cooperatives , this strikes me as almost a mirror - image description of the agency problems in the conventional , allegedly shareholder - owned corporation .
As Long responded Klein , in his rejoinder , fixated mainly on Long 's reference to limited liability , arguing against holding shareholders stritly liable for the corporation 's actions and debts .
But this is a bit like Lincoln 's Jesuit who , accused of killing ten men and a dog , triumphantly produced the dog in court .
From reading the paragraph above , it should be clear that Long mentioned limited liability asof a broader problem : the vagueness of ownership rights in the corporation , given the ambiguous division of control between management and shareholders .
Klein failed to address the broader issue at all .
Klein 's rejoinder also included a restatement of the agency problems resulting from a lack of tradable ownership claims , which mean that There is , in fact , a considerable body of literature on the agency problems resulting from vaguely defined property rights in the conventional corporation .
The problems , briefly stated : that tradeable instruments do not constitute ownership claims in any real sense ; that internal stakeholders like human capital have no property rights in the equity they create ( and hence no incentive to increase productivity ) ; and that management not only self - deals from capital it did not contribute , but also appropriates the productivity gains created by others ' efforts , and therefore has the time horizons of a Turkish tax farmer .
Corporate mangement -- standing in as " owner " to risk capital that involves no personal loss , and assigning transfer prices to goods for which there is no outside market -- resembles nothing so much as the management of state enterprises under Lange 's market socialism , " playing at market " in Mises ' memorable phrase .
Shareholders have few or no genuinely enforceable ownership rights now , for which reason management has " reduced incentives to pursue long - term objectives . "
There is also a wide body of literature on the short time horizons of corporate management : their gutting of human capital , stripping of assets , and hollowing out of long - term productive capability in order to maximize short - term paper returns and game their own bonuses and stock options .
Robert Jackall ) uses the terms " starving " and " milking . "
If anything , corporate management 's tendency toward such behaviors has been grossly exacerbated by the ostensible resurgence of " shareholder capitalism " and the " entrepreneurial firm " since the 1980s .
Luigi Zingales , for example , argues ( " In Search of New Foundations , " , August 2000 ) that a major problem is that much if not most of the value of the ostensibly shareholder - owned corporation results from the human capital contributed by internal stakeholders , but that this value is not reflected in formal ownership rights .
The result is that much of the value created by internal stakeholders is expropriated by management , thus undermining the incentives of human capital to invest its efforts in the organization .
The root of all these problems is the very pretense that management represents shareholders or that the latter are the owners in any real sense , which is as transparently false a legitimizing ideology as the claim of Soviet industrial management to represent the workers or the workers ' state .
Corporate management , in fact , is a self - perpetuating oligarchy in control of a free - floating mass of unowned capital .
It uses its purported representation of shareholders as a legitimizing ideology to insulate it from accountability to internal stakeholders , and is free to expropriate the latter 's efforts because of More generally , hierarchy and the separation of labor from residual claimancy are inherently prone to incentive and agency problems , because conflict of interest is the primary result of the authority relationship .
Authority is a means for externalizing costs on subordinates and appropriating the fruit of their efforts .
Worker cooperatives require far less front - line supervision precisely because the work force has residual claimancy and internalizes the results of its ownership .
In addition , the cooperative avoids many of the Hayekian information problems involved in the centrally planned corporation because those in possession of distributed or idiosyncratic knowledge about production are in control of the work process .
I have found that the most useful contributions of radical organization theory are often derived from the insights of mainstream organization theory , logically implicit in mainstream theory but never developed to its obvious conclusion in mainstream work .
Zingales ' argument , for example , is based on a classic article by Sanford Grossman and Oliver Hart ( " The Costs and Benefits of Ownership , " 94:4 , 1986 ) on the way assignment of property rights in the firm affects incentives ; parties without residual claimancy , they argue , will be less likely to invest in the productivity of the firm because of the lack of ownership rights in their share of the increase .
It 's also a commonplace of organization theory that residual claimancy should normally be vested in the owner of the hardest to monitor factor or the factor with the highest agency costs , in order to economize on monitoring costs .
As I argue in Chapter Nine of my forthcoming book , labor ( as a result of the problems inherent in incomplete contracting and endogenous enforcement ) is almost always the factor hardest to monitor .
Residual claimancy by workers is so rare , despite being the most efficient solution to the agency problems involved in hierarchy and the separation of labor from ownership , because it conflicts with the structural presuppositions of actually existing capitalism .
The conventional firm presupposes hierarchy and the divorce of labor from ownership , and then tries to find a mechanism to elicit effort from those who have no rational interest in maximizing productivity .
All the management fads of the week , from the 1990s on , are reminiscent of the old anarchist joke about the cook who tries serving poison mushrooms with white sauce , poison mushrooms with brown sauce , grilled poison mushrooms , etc. , and wonders why he can't find a recipe that does n't give him the bellyache .
All the management theory experiments with hierarchy - plus - this and hierarchy - plus - that are attempts to find , against all odds , an efficient way of organizing business enterprise based on inherently irrational principles .
In his response to Klein , Long also addressed the example of government aid to small businesses .
The effect , he said , was not to promote small business at the expense of large , but to promote small business at the expense of smaller .
Klein , in his rejoinder , responds to this with his own argument from " the unseen " :
The problem with this argument is the discrepancy between the room for growth at the low and high ends of the size spectrum , respectively .
At the lower end , the ability of individuals to form small businesses with almost no capitalization outlays , relying mainly on the spare capacity of the household capital they already own ( starting a neighborhood bakery with one 's ordinary kitchen oven , starting a cab service with a car and cell phone , etc. ) , would likely result inan order of magnitude increase in the number of small businesses .
What corresponding room for expansion is there at the high end of the spectrum ?
The gap between the largest firms that exist now and the largest conceivable firm is n't all that great ; compared to the explosion of self - employment in the household and informal economy , and the proliferation of small ad hoc businesses outside of current local licensing and " safety " regimes , what significant difference is there between an industry controlled by three or four oligopoly firms engaged in slightly unstable administered pricing , and an industry controlled by a single monopoly firm engaged in perfect administered pricing ?
At the high end of the spectrum , as both Long and P.M. Lawrence pointed out , the alternative is between enormous and gargantuan .
At the small end , it 's a choice almost between two different worlds .
What I find especially astonishing is that Klein ignores the high - end limits to growth implied by , the classic " Economic Calculation and the Limits of Organization . "
By the line of argument set out in that article , the predominant oligopoly firms in the existing manufacturing sector aredemonstrably above Rothbard 's threshold of calculational chaos .
Rothbard argued , specifically , that rational calculation becomes impossible whenever no external market exists for angood .
Since , in fact , the majority of intermediate goods used by the typical manufacturing corporation are firm - specific , their transfer prices must be assigned internally rather than based on outside markets .
Will Wilkinson objected to Long 's emphasis on transportation subsidies as a centralizing force ( favoring Wal - Mart 's " warehouses on wheels " business model , in particular ) .
J.H. Huebert and Walter Block make a similar argument .
This argument , that everyone benefits from infrastructure , is a common one .
But as Long pointed out
It should be self - evident that when the state subsidizes particular inputs , it amounts to a shift in competitive advantage toward firms whose business model relies most heavily on those inputs , and away from those whose business model does not .
Huebert and Block continue on the same issue , recycling the familiar argument that the free market might make long distance transportation cheaper :
The free market might very well provide cheaper roads , in the sense of their total net cost .
But the problem is not so much their net cost from the standpoint of society as a whole , as the portion of net cost that is borne by those who impose that cost .
As Long argues
As for the rest of the Huebert - Block critique , it does n't just tend toward incoherence .
It 's already there .
In making their criticisms they display the most superficial awareness , not only of the actual content of the articles by Long and by Charles Johnson that they 're criticizing , not only of the Rothbardian tradition which they ostensibly espouse , but of what they 've written elsewhere in the same article .
For example , their objection to Long 's use of the term " corporate power " : But as Long points out , Huebert and Block go on to write , scarcely twelve lines later :
After essentially restating Long 's argument , Huebert and Block compensate by putting a different argument in Long 's mouth : Huh ?
As Long explicitly stated ( in a comment under Klein 's initial critique ) :
His argument , from the beginning , has been not that government benefits big business alone , but that " theandbeneficiaries of government privilege tend to be corporations , particularly large corporations .
" And Long provides a number of citations to no less an authority than the Big Dawg himself , one Murray Newton Rothbard , on the existence of corporate power .
Consider also this Rothbard quote , courtesy of Peter Klein In addition , this argument from Huebert and Block has a couple of other weaknesses .
First , Hessen argued , not that the corporation is currently a contractual means by which investors agree to limit liability , but that that benefitbe achieved by free contractthe current statutory regime of general incorporation .
And in any case , the argument misses the point : that by making the process automatic and providing a ready - made procedure for it , rather than requiring investors to negotiate it with other parties from scratch , the state privileges the corporate form against other alternatives and weakens the bargaining power of those who would prefer not to deal with it .
I mean , doesn ' tjust recognize an entity thatbe formed entirely by contract ?
And second , their emphasis on the corporation - state dichotomy ignores the issue of the corporation 's role as a component of the state , or of the coalition of ruling class forces in control of the state .
Murray Rothbard himself was quite friendly toward the Power Elite analysis of C. Wright Mills and G. William Domhoff , which stressed the rotating pool of personnel between the top political appointees of the state and the senior management and boards of directors of the corporation .
Or as Brad Spangler put it , the guy holding the bag is as much a robber as the guy holding the gun .
Huebert and Block also make the rather astonishing argument that the very existence of any small business at all alongside big business proves something ( I 'm not sure what , exactly ) about the relative privileging of big against small :
If this argument means anything -- and to be charitable I suppose we must assume it does -- it means that the state 's privilege to bigness is n't sufficient to drive small business off the field altogether .
I 'm not aware of anyone who would argue differently , because obviously it would be an extremely difficult argument to sustain on empirical grounds .
The disagreement , rather , concerns the extent to whichcould survive alongside small local restaurants in a freed market .
In his response , Long not only cited McDonald 's reliance on subsidized transportation for its business model and its benefiting from the USDA Market Promotion Program ( a benefit unavailable to mom and pop burger joints ) .
He also reiterates his argument from " the unseen , " used against Klein above : Huebert and Block also object to Long 's treatment of differential tax breaks as benefiting some businesses against others , drawing on the old Austrian argument that tax loopholes are entirely different from subsidies .
They are , indeed , entirely different -- at least technically .
But as I have argued elsewhere , they have the sameas subsidies .
The effect of offering tax loopholes to those firms engaged in favored business models ( e.g. accelerated depreciation , the R&D credit , the deduction of interest on debt , exemption of stock transactions involved in mergers from capital gains ) has , mathematically , as would obtain from starting with a tax rate of zero and then imposing punitive taxes on theof those following such business models .
Long himself has been careful to avoid any generalizations about culpability for such tax benefits .
Nevertheless , he argues , they clearly benefit some businesses at the expense of others , and make some business models artificially competitive .
Along the same lines , Huebert and Block write , But to repeat , the point is not that Wal - Mart is culpable for benefiting from such subsidies -- merely that theybenefit , and that their business model requires such subsidies .
Once again , quoting Long : Perhaps the most egregious misreading Huebert and Block make is of Charles Johnson 's blog post on labor unions , and Long 's use of it in his own article .
It 's hard to find a charitable explanation , short of dyslexia , for H & B's mischaracterization of Johnson 's argument as a lament that " U.S. labor laws do not go far enough . "
As Long points out , As for the rest of it , since Johnson 's entire post was an extended analysis of the specific ways in which the law restricts the freedom to organize collectively , Long 's rejoinder recapitulated the argument ( no doubt thanklessly ) for H & B's benefit , and Johnson followed it up with a rejoinder of his own , I refer you to them .
Suffice it to say here that essentially every characterization made by H & B is nearly a 180 degree reversal of Long 's and Johnson 's actual argument .
H & B continue , on the same subject : Replace " unions " and " wages " with " CEOs " and " salaries , " and you get a pretty accurate assessment of the situation .
The present problems of the Detroit Three , in fact , are mainly due to the mismanagement and pathological management accounting system described by William Waddell and Norman Bodek : valuing inventory as an asset , absorbing overhead by " selling it to inventory " instead of addressing it directly , and treating management as a fixed cost , while treating human capital as a variable cost .
One of the coauthors expressing this outrage over union greed , by the way , is also a well - known defender of price - gougers as heroes of the free market .
But as I 've said elsewhere , any time you see libertarians attacking a specific example of behavior they normally defend in principle , you can guess the principle in this specific case is being used to the benefit of workers .
As Brad Spangler once challenged the author of an anti-union diatribe at Mises .
Org , Some of Long 's critics focused , not so much on the argument itself , as what it " sounds like . "
Stephan Kinsella , in comment under Klein 's first post at Mises Blog , objected to Long 's reference to His response :
In a subsequent comment , he wrote : This is not the first occasion on which Kinsella has dismissed arguments on such " sounds like " grounds .
For example , in an argument over whether the state , by reducing the transaction costs of establishing the corporate form , shifted bargaining power toward those who prefer the corporate form , responded :
In that case , Murray Rothbard must have been " leftist to the core , " since he repeatedly remarked on the effect of state policies in making some factors artificially scarce in relation to others , and thus artificially inflating their returns .
Such an approach is ironic , given Kinsella 's vulnerability to a similar line of attack .
For example , criticisms of " intellectual property " -- one of his own pet issues -- areusually associated with " anti-market ideology . "
In fact , I personally encountered a Randroid who refused to hear any arguments against IP law as a monopoly because it " reminded him of " what he constantly heard from the " commies . "
This is the same line of " reasoning " used by neocons ' who dismiss Justin Raimondo as a " librull " because anti-war arguments these days are conventionally associated with the Left .
Bryan Caplan raises a series of objections to Long 's assessment of the prevailing effect of government intervention .
First , immigration
The most glaring problem with Caplan 's argument is the fundamental self - contradiction involved in his statement of it .
At one point , he reassures us , " I 'm the first person to point out that immigration hurts lower - skilled Americans less than most people think . "
Now surely , if unrestricted immigration could in fact result in the wages of 70 million people being halved , that 's probablyless of a hurt to lower - skilled Americans than " most people think . "
But the contradiction deepens .
As evidence of his reassurance on the relative harmlessness of immigration , he links to an earlier post of his in which he cited George Borjas ' estimate that immigration has reduced the wages high school dropouts by 8 % .
Caplan , in that post , argues that the long - term effect of immigration on dropout 's wages is only half that , and the effect onwages isSo which is it ?
Will immigration hurt lower - skilled Americans more or less than most people think ?
Will it cut the wages of seventy million people in half , by 8 % , by 4 % , or by zero ?
On a less fundamental level , there are problems with the way Caplan frames the issue .
First , he neglects the extent to which state policy has shaped the overall economic structure within which labor is hired in the first place .
The state 's policies of subsidizing technical education , R&D , capital accumulation and firm size have promoted a business model based on capital substitution and deskilling , and led to a two - tier labor force .
In an American economy based on the integration of small - scale electrical machinery into local craft production ( in other words , an economy on the model of Emilia - Romagna rather than Sloan and Chandler ) , there probably would n't be nearly as many unsilled workers in the first place .
Second , he neglects the extent to which the existence of large , low - wage labor forces in the Third World , seeking employment in the West , is the product of neoliberalism -- an economic model in whose development the state has played a central role .
If a few hundred million less peasants had been evicted from their land over the past several decades , in a modern - day reenactment of the Enclosures , the pool of people willing to accept wage labor on whatever terms offer would likely be diminished .
If neoliberal and Washington Consensus policies had not promoted a model of economic " development " based on extractive industries , cash crop farming , and the supply of sweatshop labor to foreign capital , rather than small - scale industrialization for local markets , likewise , the available supply of immigrant labor would probably be diminished .
In short , Caplan accepts as " normal " the current structure of the state capitalist economy , the current balance between skilled an unskilled labor in the American economy , and the current wage levels and desire for foreign work in the Third World at face value .
Then he examines how a change in a single factor , holding all the other factors in the mercantilist - corporate economy constant , would affect labor .
This is what C. Wright Mills called " crackpot realism . "
A good example of crackpot realism is Ralph Kramden , speculating on the outcome of one of his get - rich - quick schemes : " Norton , when I 'm a rich man , I 'll have a phone put in here on the fire escape , so I can make my big business deals when I have to sleep out here in the summer .
" Caplan 's argument also begs the question of just how effective current immigration restrictions actually are .
Arguably , the neither - fish - nor - fowl regime currently in place has little effect in terms of constraining employers ' access to illegal immigrant labor , if they actually want it badly enough .
As often as not , the state looks aside with a wink and a nudge as employers hire illegal aliens .
The main effect of their formal illegal status is to increase their dependence on keeping the employer 's favor for their continued stay here , and thus reduces their bargaining power .
For this reason , employers relying heavily on an illegal workforce are most prone to modern - day slavery and other abhorrent practices .
And arguably , the present regime is the worst of all possible worlds from the standpoint of the bargaining power of native labor .
If borders were genuinely and completely closed , of course , the bargaining position of native workers would be improved .
But if immigration were completely unrestricted , it 's plausible that absolute levels of immigration would increase modestly at most , while immigrant workers would be much more likely to organize openly against their employers and protest unacceptable working conditions .
At present , employers have access to about as much illegal help as they want , despite the laws on paper , but can use the technical " illegal " status to reinforce workers ' reliance on the as patron and prevent them standing up for their rights .
Caplan 's second objection is that government aid cannot ultimately benefit corporations .
Against Long 's argument , which he restates as " government support for corporations allows them to survive despite blatant inefficiency , " Caplan writes :
Huh ?
Caplan seems to be taking the factor of differential tax benefits to corporations in isolation , holding constant all other factors like ease of market entry and restraints on competition within an industry , and then arguing that aid to corporations would cause them to outbreed their habitat like deer and suffer a large - scale die - off .
But the argument is not simply that government policy favors the existence of something that 's called a " corporation . "
It 's that the government skews the market toward fewer , larger firms and toward a stable oligopoly structure that .
The whole point , from the standpoint of big business , is for the handful of incumbent firms toandin order to prevent competition from lowering the rate of profit .
Third , Caplan argues that double taxation of corporate income , under the corporate income tax , discourages corporations " when they are more efficient than other forms of organization . "
The corporate income tax , Caplan writes , Now , this may occur at the small end of the scale , when a sole proprietor considers incorporating to shield his income from liability ; if his income is taxed twice , he may decide the benefits of the corporate form are not worth it .
But again , the debate does not concern the magical virtues of everything with an " LLC " after its name .
The corporate form is important primarily to the extent that it affects the main dynamic under question : the balance of power between large and small firms .
For the question actually being debated -- the contribution of government policy to the predominance of big business -- Caplan 's is a singularly unfortunate choice of examples .
The real " main effect " of the corporate income tax is to encourage retention of earnings rather than the payout of dividends that might be reinvested by shareholders in other portfolio items ( e.g. , smaller , more efficient startup firms ) .
The overwhelming majority of new capital investment in the large corporation is financed by retained earnings .
And as Martin Hellwig argues , in most cases this does not mean that large corporations must carefully prioritize in order to ration new capital investment within the strictures of retained earnings .
It means that the capital available from retained earnings exceeds the opportunities for sensible investment .
The effect is that the big keep getting bigger , and experience a glut of capital ; capital tends to pool inside the large organizations , while small startup firms are stunted from lack of circulation .
This effect is reinforced , by the way , by SEC security registration regulations which restrict the investment opportunities available to ordinary small investors largely to large , established national firms .
Only " accredited " investors , who tend to fall in the top two percent of income , can buy stock in small , local firms .
All this is in addition to other effects of the corporate income tax .
For example , Caplan mistakenly compares the total incidence of corporate income tax liabilities with " corporate welfare , " as if the relevant comparison were between the liabilities and benefits to " corporations " as a whole .
But the debate concerns the relative competitive advantage conferred on big business as against small .
And the relevant information for such an assessment is not the total scale of " corporate welfare , " in the sense of direct government expenditures .
It is the differential application of the corporate income taxlarge and small corporations .
The corporate income tax is an ideal cartelizing device , heightening the difference in privilege between favored and nonfavored firms .
And the firms favored by differential tax exemptions are , overwhelmingly , those described by Thomas Ferguson as the centerpiece of FDR 's big business coalition ( large , export - oriented , capital - intensive , and high tech ) .
They are , essentially , the commanding heights of the corporate economy : primarily Galbraith's " technostructure " and the large group of firms that received the majority of their R&D funding from the state during WWII and the decades immediately following .
When the cumulative effect of the R&D credit , the exemption of interest , and the depreciation allowance are taken into account , firms that hit the trifecta ( capital - and tech - intensive firms that engage most heavily in mergers in acquisitions ) often pay little or no corporate income tax .
The difference in privilege is heightened by the fact that what income tax does fall on the largest , most favored corporations can be passed on through administered pricing , whereas the share that falls on smaller firms in the competitive sector cannot .
Suffice it to say that any enemy of big business should have , among his top priorities , the abolition of the corporate income tax -- or at the very least , closing all tax loopholes and then lowering the tax rate to revenue - neutral levels .
As CEO , Easter has led NeboWeb to explosive growth , attracting Fortune 500 clients and driving strategic partnerships which have fueled NeboWeb ’s expansion .
He is well - known in the interactive marketing industry and frequently speaks about capturing the power and potential of online marketing .
The holiday season always fuels B2C growth , and while this season may be a bit slower , the ability to make an impact may be more important than ever .
From the famous Coca - Cola holiday soda can , to the ribbon on top of a new Lexus , the holiday season is a marketing and advertising nirvana with ripe opportunities and rewards for those who can standout .
As the Web continues to expand , we are seeing companies push their traditional offline marketing strategies online and generate viral marketing campaigns that reach millions .
A good viral marketing campaign must encompass the following to be truly successful :
1 . The user ’s reality .
The user must be able to relate to the marketing content .
Viral marketing comes alive during the holiday season because everyone experiences the holidays together and it hits close to home .
Current events are another example of a way to cover this aspect of a strong viral marketing campaign ( It would be great to see an online game focused on throwing shoes at President Bush ) .
2. Creative content : A viral marketing campaign must be creative and well thought out .
If you do not have a different spin on the subject , then your campaign will never gain the traction it needs to build the brand .
3. Viral ability : Perhaps the hardest to employ successfully , a good viral marketing campaign must encourage the user to spread the word .
This is often accomplished through personalization techniques , such as allowing the user to incorporate their pictures or content into the campaign and to share it with their friends .
A site website or online tool that does not have viral ability can still become viral if it has great creative content .
We ’ve identified five excellent holiday viral marketing campaigns that we would like to spotlight :
5. The Buddy Group ’s Naughty Mrs. Claus
The Buddy Group has taken a new approach to holiday fun by providing a naughty Mrs. Claus site at http://spankmrsclaus.com/ .
Users can choose either a “ naughty ” or “ nice ” path which leads them to a similar scenario : Mrs. Claus stole some of Mr. Claus ’ presents , and it is the user ’s duty to spank them out of her .
Although not a traditional holiday game for the family , it certainly contains creative content and incorporates reality by use of the holiday season .
This page has gained a few links , but lacks viral ability .
It does not encourage the user to share the page with anyone else in the same way other successful viral campaigns do .
4. X - Box ’s Holiday Gift Influencer
The Holiday Gift Influencer by X - Box helps kids to write letters to convince their parents to buy them an X - Box .
The tool generates a customized letter which kids can print or email to the potential gift giver .
This tool does a great job at generating creative content and touching reality with the holiday season , but it lacks viral ability .
The tool would have been much more successful if rather than downloading the pdf , it sent the actual letter via email with the pdf attached or as an image embedded in the email .
3. Simon Sez Santa 2.0
Created by Signature Advertising and Marketing Solutions , SimonSezSanta provides a “ Simon Sez ” box which permits the visitor to type any action verb .
A real life Santa then acts out this action to the best of his ability .
Although not every verb is recognized — and is responded to very wittingly — it is pretty remarkable how many feats are identified .
Even words like fly , frolic , and electric slide are correctly executed .
The viral ability is somewhat limited with a “ Tell a Friend " email link , but it ’s there .
2. Office Max ’s ElfYourself
A big hit last year , elfyourself.com has returned once again for the holiday season and has earned 32,804 links since its launch .
The OfficeMax produced site allows the user to upload up to five different images of friends ’— or foes ’ — heads to be placed on a boy band of dancing elves ’ bodies .
A choice of disco , country , or other dance styles makes this application even more exciting .
The user can choose to spread the laughter by emailing his or her masterpiece to friends and family .
Again , we see a mixture of creative content , viral , and the elf aspect hitting reality by incorporating the holiday season .
1. Disney ’s Personalized Video Message From Santa
Disney ’s Family.com has taken advantage of the holidays by creating an interactive Christmas themed web page .
It allows parents of hopeful kids to send personalized messages from the big man , Santa himself .
The parent can upload an image of the child and the application will incorporate it into the message .
Santa , while in the midst of a hot chocolate - induced computer crash , reminds the youngster that he or she needs to be good to make the cut for the “ nice ” list .
The page definitely has creative content and includes viral ability by giving the user a link to send to friends and family to view the message .
A strong viral marketing campaign indeed , it has attracted 296 valuable links in a relatively short period of time .
In conclusion , a strong viral marketing campaign hits home with the user , contains creative content , and encourages the user to share the marketing piece with friends and family .
Furthermore , websites that incorporate personalization into their campaign seem to do the best job of becoming truly viral .
The pervasiveness of the holiday season makes it a great time to build the foundation of a strong viral marketing campaign ; however , organizations should be taking advantage of this interactive technology year - round .
I would also be remiss to not include our own holiday greeting – please watch and enjoy !
Happy Holidays !
Ancient History Sourcebook :
Aristotle : Spartan Women Again , the license of the Lacedaemonian women defeats the intention of the Spartan constitution , and is adverse to the happiness of the state .
For , a husband and wife being each a part of every family , the state may be considered as about equally divided into men and women ; and , therefore , in those states in which the condition of the women is bad , half the city may be regarded as having no laws .
And this is what has actually happened at Sparta ; the legislator wanted to make the whole state hardy and temperate , and he has carried out his intention in the case of the men , but he has neglected the women , who live in every sort of intemperance and luxury .
The consequence is that in such a state wealth is too highly valued , especially if the citizen fall under the dominion of their wives , after the manner of most warlike races , except the Celts and a few others who openly approve of male loves .
The old mythologer would seem to have been right in uniting Ares and Aphrodite , for all warlike races are prone to the love either of men or of women .
This was exemplified among the Spartans in the days of their greatness ; many things were managed by their women .
But what difference does it make whether women rule , or the rulers are ruled by women ?
The result is the same .
Even in regard to courage , which is of no use in daily life , and is needed only in war , the influence of the Lacedaemonian women has been most mischievous .
The evil showed itself in the Theban invasion , when , unlike the women other cities , they were utterly useless and caused more confusion than the enemy .
This license of the Lacedaemonian women existed from the earliest times , and was only what might be expected .
For , during the wars of the Lacedaemonians , first against the Argives , and afterwards against the Arcadians and Messenians , the men were long away from home , and , on the return of peace , they gave themselves into the legislator 's hand , already prepared by the discipline of a soldier 's life ( in which there are many elements of virtue ) , to receive his enactments .
But , when Lycurgus , as tradition says , wanted to bring the women under his laws , they resisted , and he gave up the attempt .
These then are the causes of what then happened , and this defect in the constitution is clearly to be attributed to them .
We are not , however , considering what is or is not to be excused , but what is right or wrong , and the disorder of the women , as I have already said , not only gives an air of indecorum to the constitution considered in itself , but tends in a measure to foster avarice .
The mention of avarice naturally suggests a criticism on the inequality of property .
While some of the Spartan citizen have quite small properties , others have very large ones ; hence the land has passed into the hands of a few .
And this is due also to faulty laws ; for , although the legislator rightly holds up to shame the sale or purchase of an inheritance , he allows anybody who likes to give or bequeath it .
Yet both practices lead to the same result .
And nearly two - fifths of the whole country are held by women ; this is owing to the number of heiresses and to the large dowries which are customary .
It would surely have been better to have given no dowries at all , or , if any , but small or moderate ones .
As the law now stands , a man may bestow his heiress on any one whom he pleases , and , if he die intestate , the privilege of giving her away descends to his heir .
Hence , although the country is able to maintain 1500 cavalry and 30,000 hoplites , the whole number of Spartan citizens fell below 1000 .
The result proves the faulty nature of their laws respecting property ; for the city sank under a single defeat ; the want of men was their ruin .

Much as Microsoft is currently grappling with technical snafus associated with the New Xbox Experience , Sony faced its own minor debacle during the implementation of the long - anticipated trophy system for PlayStation 3 games .
System lockups aside , confusion abounded over which games would feature the new award system .
At fault for the mystery was that unlike Microsoft 's mandatory approach to gamerscore achievements , Sony left the option to implement trophies up to the discretion of both internal and third - party developers .
At that time , Sony 's director of PlayStation Network Eric Lempel told GameSpot that , eventually , all new PS3 games would include trophies .
[ UPDATE ]
The eventually in question is apparently coming sooner rather than later .
A Sony representative confirmed for GameSpot that trophy support will be mandatory in all PS3 games submitted for certification beginning next year .
" Trophies will be mandatory for titles submitted after January 1 , 2009 , " said the rep .
" Of course , many teams have already started to incorporate trophies and have added support for older titles . "
Currently , a number of development houses have revisited their previously released titles to implement the award system , including Naughty Dog ( Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune ) , Rockstar ( Grand Theft Auto IV ) , and Criterion ( Burnout Paradise ) .
However , these rewards are not awarded retroactively , requiring a fresh play - through to secure the achievements .
When former model , Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart , could n’t find a warm winter coat to match her vegan lifestyle , she launched Vaute Couture .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An experimental malaria vaccine is the most promising yet , protecting up to 65 percent of infants from infection in two studies in Africa , researchers reported on Monday .
Separate tests in Kenya and Tanzania showed GlaxoSmithKline ’s vaccine called RTS , S could protect babies and toddlers from infection with malaria and could prevent disease even in those already infected .
While the vaccine is far from perfect , it is the best yet against the mosquito - borne parasite , the researchers agreed .
They said they would begin phase III clinical tests , the last stage before seeking regulatory approval , next year .
“ Even a partially effective vaccine has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives each year , ” said Christian Loucq , director of the nonprofit PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative , which helped to conduct the study .
“ We are one important step closer to the date when malaria will join diseases such as smallpox and polio , which have been either eliminated or controlled through vaccines . ”
The World Health Organization estimates malaria killed 881,000 people and infected 247 million worldwide in 2006 .
Some malaria experts say those numbers underestimate the problem .
The disease is especially hard to fight as people are continually infected by mosquitoes throughout their lives .
The tiny parasites get into the blood and live and reproduce inside the body , causing fever and sometimes deadly brain infections .
Dr. Salim Abdulla of the Bagamoyo Research and Training Center in Tanzania and colleagues tested 340 infants , giving them three doses of the RTS , S vaccine or three doses of hepatitis B vaccine .
The malaria vaccine protected 65 percent of infants from infection with malaria during the six months of the trial , they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine and told a conference on tropical diseases in New Orleans .
YEARS OF EFFICACY
“ We are very confident that the efficacy of the vaccine extends for several years , ” Joe Cohen of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals in Belgium told the briefing .
An earlier study had shown the vaccine could protect children for at least 18 months .
The children also got vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus , whooping cough and Haemophilus influenzae B as part of a World Health Organization childhood vaccination program , and the vaccines all worked well , the study showed .
“ I see the effects of malaria in my country firsthand , ” Abdulla told the briefing .
“ So these results are very exciting and give me a new hope of seeing a first generation malaria vaccine available ... in the near future . ”
In a second trial , Dr. Ally Olutu of the KEMRI - Wellcome Trust Collaborative Research Center in Kenya and colleagues vaccinated 894 children aged 5 to 17 months with three doses of either a slightly different formulation of the malaria vaccine or a rabies vaccine .
The found clinical episodes of malaria fell by 53 percent .
While this is slightly different from complete protection from infection , the researchers said the point is to protect children from disease , and they felt the results were comparable .
“ It is , indeed , a hopeful beginning , ” William Collins and John Barnwell , malaria experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , wrote in a commentary published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
They noted that the vaccine was not yet tested in regions with the most intense malaria transmission .
This story was also published in the Atlanta Journal - Constitution and is a followup to ProPublica 's investigation into the CDC response to formaldehyde findings in FEMA trailers .
A government study to track the health of children who lived in FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina is still stuck in the planning stages , three years after families first began complaining about health problems related to formaldehyde in their temporary homes .
See interactive timeline
The Centers for Disease Control , which is supposed to conduct the study , hasnât figured out how it will find the children , many of whom moved out of the trailers months or even years ago .
It also hasnât settled on a scientific methodology , according to interviews and documents obtained by ProPublica , a nonprofit investigative newsroom .
Before the work can actually begin , the study must be approved by the White Houseâs Office of Management and Budget .
The CDC also must get money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fund the study .
The final bill could reach $ 87 million , according to Michael McGeehin , who is leading the study .
Families moved into 140,000 FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in August 2005 .
In February 2008 , the CDC urged people to move out of the trailers because formaldehyde levels were high enough to cause health problems .
Today only about 10,000 trailers remain occupied .
Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of formaldehyde , which can increase the risk of cancer and asthma attacks and can cause severe skin , ear , nose , and throat irritations .
The chemical is found in the glue that is used to make plywood and particleboard in most trailers .
Heidi Sinclair , a Baton Rouge - based pediatrician who treated dozens of children for symptoms related to formaldehyde exposure , said many of her patients have moved to different parts of the country .
" CDC should have started doing this a year before they wanted to start the study , " said Sinclair , who got an email from the CDC in October asking her to join a panel that will help find the children .
" These people are going to be impossible to track down .
Most of them have pay - as - you - go cellphones and have already moved . "
The CDC hopes to enroll 6,000 children and monitor their health for as long as six years .
Brad Miller ( D - NC ) , chair of a House subcommittee that has issued several reports slamming the CDCâs handling of the formaldehyde problem , said the agencyâs approach to the childrenâs health study is " unconscionable . "
" The longer it takes to launch this study , the more difficult it will be to locate participants , characterize their exposures accurately , and identify life - changes since leaving the trailers that might influence health outcomes down the road , " Miller said in a statement to ProPublica .
" We owe those children , whose health may have been compromised due to the public housing provided them , a better effort than this . "
The CDC began talking about doing a childrenâs study more than a year ago .
It highlighted the study last month in its response to a report by Millerâs subcommittee and a story by ProPublica , blaming the CDC for producing a flawed study that FEMA used to suppress public concerns about formaldehyde .
But the news release gave few details and did not mention a start date .
McGeehin hopes to get enough money from FEMA by the end of the year to allow contractors to begin bidding on the project .
Heâd like to award the contract in the spring .
" Itâs a long process to get this going unfortunately , but it needs to be done , " he said .
" One concern we have is tracking people who were in the area and where they live now , but there are methods to do that and we will do the best we can . "
David Williamson , the CDC official in charge of developing a registry of the trailer occupants , said FEMA has their names and their pre-Katrina addresses , but has no information about where they live now .
He said the CDCasked FEMA for its data in June , but he doesnât know when it will be delivered .
" There is a set of procedures to keep peopleâs information confidential and secure , and we are going through that with FEMA now , " Williamson said .
Lindsay Huckabee , whose five children experienced frequent nosebleeds and other respiratory problems whiletheylived in a FEMA trailer , isnât surprised by the studyâs slow pace .
" Itâs part of the way things have been going with this .
Talks get started a year after you find out about a problem , and then it takes another year for the problem to be addressed , " Huckabee said .
" Not that I want to knock progress , but it is discouraging to see how things are going . "
During her familyâs year in a FEMA trailer , Huckabee said her daughter developed asthma so severe that she was often hospitalized .
The health of all her children has improved since they moved , Huckabee said , but sheâs worried they might have problems in the future .
People exposed to high levels of formaldehyde can develop cancer decades later .
" Itâs frustrating not knowing what to expect , " Huckabee said .
" Some people say that the formaldehyde could cause problems for life .
Others say my kids should be fine now that they are out of the trailer . "
After the CDC settles on the studyâs scientific methodology and on a contractor to do the work , the Office of Management and Budget still has to weigh in .
OMB reviews are standard for large projects , McGeehin said .
The OMB has been criticized by some in Congress for injecting politics into federal scientific studies and rulemaking .
Earlier this year CDC chief Julie Gerberdingâs congressional testimony on climate change was edited by the OMB to minimize the health consequences of waterborne diseases , extreme weather events and intense heat .
The OMB also played a role in delaying EPA studies of the health risks of formaldehyde and many other contaminants , according to a report released this year by the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress .
" The problem with that review is that there are no scientific experts at OMB that would be reviewing this , " said Rick Melberth , director of regulatory policy at OMB Watch , a Washington D.C. - based nonprofit .
" I think the public will be outraged to know there is a White House review of this study by non-scientists . "
A CDC scientist who has had many studies reviewed by OMB said the review process is " characterized by endless review and re-review . "
" Itâs like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard , " said the scientist , who did not want to be quoted by name for fear of retribution .
" There is just an unprecedented level of scrutiny by a range of vested interests . "
ProPublica obtained a PowerPoint presentation ( see last page ) from a May meeting of the CDCâs Board of Scientific Counselors indicating that OMB would begin reviewing the childrenâs study in July of this year and the results would be published in January 2015 .
But McGeehin said he wonât send the study to OMB until the projectâs contractor is selected and has had time to review it .
Scott Needle , who was running a clinic in Bay St. Louis , Miss .
when Katrina hit , has been waiting more than two years for the government to do a comprehensive childrenâs study .
Many of his patientsâ families moved into FEMA trailers after they lost their homes , and children soon began showing up at his clinic with cold and flu symptoms that never seemed to subside no matter how many times he treated them .
In April 2006 , when news reports began linking formaldehyde to those symptoms , he asked the Mississippi State Department of Public Health to investigate whether formaldehyde was causing the problem .
He said he was told that the state didnât have the resources for such a study and that he should contact the CDC , which he did .
In July 2007 the CDC agreed to evaluate 144 children living in FEMA trailers , but the methodology didnât directly address Needleâs concerns .
The study was restricted to children who had respiratory problems before the hurricane and it focused only on how many times they had been hospitalized .
Researchers found that children who lived in the trailers were hospitalized a bit more often than children who didnât , but the difference was so slight that they didnât draw any conclusions .
The final report didnât mention the word formaldehyde .
Needle , who now practices medicine in Florida , has doubts about the new study , too .
" If the study had been done earlier , maybe we could have teased out some answers , " he said .
" Now I donât know if there would be any way to know . "
NEW YORK 
Despite the bad economy , Internet advertising revenue rose in the third quarter , according to figures released Thursday .
The report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers said online advertising revenue totaled almost $ 5.9 billion in the third quarter , up 11 % from the period last year and a 2 % rise from the second quarter .
Companies that depend on Internet advertising , including Google , have seen their shares plummet recently on fears the economy will inhibit growth in what remains a relatively small market .
David Silverman , a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers , said the third - quarter growth is " nice to see . "
" I think given the economic environment , seeing any increase in any economic activity — let alone advertising — would be a bit of surprise , but speaks maybe to the strength of interactive advertising , " he said .
Silverman believes advertisers will keep spending on online ads , especially in an economic downturn , because they are often paying for ads based on performance — such as when a consumer clicks on an ad to visit an e-commerce site .
" They actually see they 're getting a result for their dollars spent , " he said .
For the first nine months of the year , online advertising revenue totaled $ 17.3 billion .
This compares with $ 15.2 billion in the period last year .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve is likely to cut the federal funds rate as low as it can go at this week 's meeting , without adopting a zero - interest policy , and to begin shifting its focus to nontraditional policies .
" It would make the most sense for this meeting to be the last rate cut rather than dragging it out to the January meeting , " wrote Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi , adding that a " hallmark of the Bernanke Fed has been to move quickly and aggressively . "
Rupkey 's forecast calls for the Fed to cut rates by three - quarters of a percentage point to 0.25 % .
Most Wall Street firms expect a rate cut of a half point to 0.50 % .
See full story on rate - cut forecasts .
" The size of the move is in large part psychological , " said the economic team at Bank of America .
See full story .
Rates are already very low and are not playing much part in the credit crunch that is strangling the economy .
Investors should know that the Fed still has plenty of ways to stimulate the economy , even with rates near or at zero , economists said .
The bottom line on Fed policy is supply of money .
The Fed typically targets the price of money , but , with the price so low , it will focus on increasing the quantity of money through its balance sheet .
Vince Reinhart , a former senior Fed staffer who is now at the American Enterprise Institute , said the Fed will make a promise in its policy statement " to use the balance sheet to help foster economic recovery and better - functioning markets . "
The two - day meeting got underway Monday afternoon .
A public statement is expected at 2:15 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday .
Since the last Fed meeting , economic conditions have deteriorated , and many economic indicators have been setting multiyear lows .
The recession has turned into a global downturn , with similar weakness in Europe and Japan and many emerging economies .
The Fed meeting was originally set to last just one day , but an extra day was added to discuss various options for " quantitative easing " operations .
Economists at Barclays Capital said they expect the Fed statement " to give some guidance on how the Fed expects to proceed " in the area of nontraditional monetary policy .
In essence , the Fed is providing credit directly to market participants , bypassing the fragile banking sector .
The Fed 's balance sheet has already expanded dramatically as the Fed has lent money to banks , securities firms and public companies .
" A lot has been done already , " said J. Alfred Broaddus , a former president of the Richmond Fed .
Total Fed assets on its balance sheet have soared $ 1.3 trillion of 145 % since Sept. 10 , according to the UBS economic team .
Fed officials have already signaled that more balance - sheet expansion is planned .
The Fed is expected to make plain that its monetary - policy focuses include the funds rate and balance - sheet growth , said the economic team at Bank of America .
The Fed may also add that it plans to purchase securities in markets that particularly need liquidity .
With this money flowing into the banking sector , many economists are worried about inflation down the road .
But other economists do not believe that will pose a significant threat .

Nov. 14 , 2008
In August I wrote a piece titled " It 's Like These Guys Take Pride in Being Ignorant " .
The title was a direct quote from Barack Obama , while discussing some absurd campaign tactics of the GOP .
I went on to outline the top five cases of Republican idiocy in the past eight years .
If you click the above link , keep in mind that the list was written beforeSarah Palin was on the ticket , so her moronic bumblings were still under the radar somewhere up there in Alaska .
But back to the topic at hand , in that piece , the number one most idiotic moment was when conservative blogger and online editor for the Washington Examiner , Mary Catherine Ham , claimed that New York Times columnist , Bob Herbert , attacked McCain 's now infamous Obama - Britney Spears - Paris Hilton ad as racist because he was " wracked with white guilt " .
If you 've ever read Herbert 's column online or in the Times or seen him in his role as a cable news political pundit , you may have noticed that ... well ... he is not white .
He is black .
Ham 's comment was extraordinarily stupid .
The fact that , earlier this week , that pinnacle of Republican ignorance has been topped , is astounding .
What may be more amazing is that the comment that topped it did not pass through the lips of George W. Bush or Sarah Palin .
Instead it came from a guy named John Hinderaker , who , according to the bio on his blog at powerlineblog.com , should be pretty smart .
But before I get to exactly what Hinderaker said , it is worth taking a look back at exactly what I wrote in regards to Mary Katherine Ham back in August .
My reasoning for awarding her the top spot in the GOP idiocy countdown can be directly applied to why I can now call Hinderaker 's comment the dumbest right - wing statement ever made .
Here is the blurb describing why Ham got the honors :
The reason I 'm awarding Ham the number one spot is because of her willingness to completely ignore clear , visible and indisputable facts in order to robotic - ly spit out the same Republican talking points she has been spitting out for years .
What makes it even better is that the New York Times and " white guilt " are not new issues to Ham .
She has been writing about the two issues for years and her ability to remain astoundingly ignorant about issues which she claims to be an expert on is truly a triumph of ignorance .
It is hard to imagine anyone topping this type of ignorance , but have no fear , the Republicans are showing no signs of slowing down .
We can rest assured that many of the ignorance all - stars like Sean Hannity , Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck will continue striving to clear the very high bar that Mary Katherine Ham has set .
With that in mind , here is Hinderaker 's quote :
Obama thinks he is a good talker , but he is often undisciplined when he speaks .
He needs to understand that as President , his words will be scrutinized and will have impact whether he intends it or not .
In this regard , President Bush is an excellent model ; Obama should take a lesson from his example .
Bush never gets sloppy when he is speaking publicly .
He chooses his words with care and precision , which is why his style sometimes seems halting .
In the eight years he has been President , it is remarkable how few gaffes or verbal blunders he has committed .
If Obama does n't raise his standards , he will exceed Bush 's total before he is inaugurated .
Hilarious .
This moronic quote requires no further explanation or analysis , but I would like to point out my very favorite part - " In the eight years he has been President , it is remarkable how few gaffes or verbal blunders he has committed . "
Wow , that 's stupid .
In case you do n't believe that someone really wrote this , then published it on the web - or if you just want to double check and make sure that the statement was n't made as a joke , here 's the original post at powerlineblog.com
The sad thing is that while I can dismiss Hinderaker 's quote as stupid , the reality - challenged right - wing of the Republican Party is here to stay .
Sure , we have seen some Republicans over the past week or so graciously accepting defeat and making an effort to come together , but a large chunk of the Party is choosing instead to follow the lead of Sarah Palin and Karl Rove .
The term being thrown around for this type of nonsense is intellectual violence .
And that 's exactly what it is , a downright assault on anything thoughtful .
Until sometime in 2006 or so , the United States of America had become the only place on the planet where it was a political liability to be smart .
Intellectuals who ran for office had to keep their brain power in the closet like they were gay Republicans running for office in Alabama .
Fortunately for all of us , the anti-intellectual bullying trend is slowing down , however , it has not come to an end yet .
As long as Sarah Palin , Sean Hannity , Ann Coulter , Rush Limbaugh and Karl Rove continue to have a seat at the table for the day 's argument , America will continue to leave it 's ugly and embarrassing political scar exposed for all the world to see .

Learning lessons about the importance of UI from the iPhone
Having seen a LOT of buzz over on Twitter and Friendfeed about the forthcoming N97 , I feel compelled somewhat to make a point about this subject , especially as everyone seems to be missing the point badly .
I should admit now that I have n’t used an N97 , but then neither it seems has anyone else apart from Robert Scoble , so I feel as well placed as anyone to comment .
Killer or Filler ?
The label ‘ iPhone killer ’ has become so hackneyed now I ’m not sure anyone believes it when it ’s applied to a new product , but yet again we see it slapped onto another touch screen wannabe .
There ’s already a lot of positive hype about this product , which I ’m sure will be fairly slick in many ways , Nokia do design some great phones .
However , I remain skeptical about the ability of Nokia or Symbian to turn out an OS experience as compelling and slick as the iPhone .
The most amusing thing about the comparisons I see is the way that people knock the iPhone because it does n’t have a 5 m pixel camera , or a full qwerty keyboard .
Rather than take that as a negative , I take that as a positive sign that the company designing this thing have chosen to focus on a few important aspects of this device and make them really sing , rather than cramming the phone with features , a la Samsung or Nokia and not making any of it brilliant .
A touch of class
It is reminicsent of Google ’s maxim – take one thing and do it well .
In the case of the iPhone this is the concept of touch .
What seems gimmicky turns out to be really intuitive , and breaks down the barriers between you and your objectives with the device , which is the ultimate goal of any UI designer .
Interactions become as simple as ‘ see what you want – press it ’ , rather than ‘ up - down - left - up - push - left - up ’ which just sounds like the commands from some early 80s text - based adventure .
It ’s also really open , as the screen can then be made to be any type of interface , depending on the needs of the application .
As long as the OS and in particular the web browsing experience remains more fluid and simple with iPhones , nothing any of the other manufacturers do will make a difference .
It does n’t matter if you ’ve got a 10 megapixel - Carl - Zeiss - smoothy - maker - with - added - zing attached , if your core offering – a personal computer that you can make calls with , browse the internet etc fails , what good is the rest of that rubbish ?
The only thing I hold out any hope for at the moment is Android .
I have n’t used it in any form , so I ca n’t comment directly , however the first iteration does seem to be better than people expected , and at least Google are focusing on the core of the experience on offer , i.e , the OS and the browser , and not thinking about hardware so much .
This alone gives it a much better chance I feel .
Another plus is the openess of it ; rather than developing proprietary applications , they leave the field as open as possible for other people to demonstrate the full potential of the platform .
They also seem to be making it possible to add applications on gracefully , something Symbian most certainly does not do .
So what can we learn from this ?
The main thing is that ‘ less is more ’ .
It hurts me to trot out such tired cliches , but I think when you ’re looking at the objectives for a product , in hardware or software , then you do need to keep it simple .
Simple objectives mean more resources applied in a given direction , so more can be done to tackle that objective .
Then you just have to hope you ’ve chosen the right objectives in the first place .

As if there are n’t enough taxes , you could soon be paying more for soda .
In an effort to close the $ 15 billion state budget gap , New York Governor David Paterson is calling for a 15 percent tax on soft drinks .
If you drink diet , you ’re okay .
The tax would only be imposed on regular , non - diet soft drinks .
The logic : it could generate more than $ 400 million while helping to curve obesity .
For that reason some public health advocates support the soda tax , hoping it will lead to healthier choices .

BBC Radio host sacked after call to taxi firm requesting ' non- Asian ' driver
Sacked : BBC Radio Bristol host Sam Mason , who was dismissed following a ' racist ' phone call to a local taxi firm
A BBC Radio presenter has been sacked following a ' racist ' call to a taxi firm , in which she requested a ' non- Asian ' driver .
Sam Mason told the operator that ' a guy with a turban would freak her daughter out ' insisting they send an English driver instead .
The ex-glamour girl , 40 , called the firm to order a taxi for her 14 - year - old daughter off - air , while presenting her BBC Bristol radio show .
After the operator branded her request ' racist ' , Mason insisted , claiming it was n't the first time she had made the request .
She said : ' A guy with a turban is going to freak her out .
She 's not used to Asians . '
When the operator said it would not be possible to carry out her wishes , she said : ' You 've managed it before . '
Mason , who has previously battled alcohol addiction , claimed she was n't racist but insisted she was looking out for her daughter 's interest .
Mason said : ' If it were me I would n't care if it had two heads , but it 's my little girl we are talking about . '
After the operator refused to book a car , Mason complained before hanging up .
The operator said : ' We would class that as being racist .
We can't just penalise the Asian drivers and just send an English one . '
She later called back before a manager accepted the booking .
Mason said : ' I work at the BBC .
I 'm far from racist and that uneducated woman has no right to call me one . '
BBC Radio Bristol , where Mason hosted an afternoon show
The BBC were alerted to the conversation after it was recorded and sent to the Sun newspaper .
The mother - of - one was subsequently suspended and fired 24 hours later .
A BBC spokesman said : ' Although Sam Mason 's remarks were not made on - air , her comments were completely unacceptable and , for that reason , she has been informed that she will no longer be working for the BBC with immediate effect . '

This is the story of the deadliest war since Adolf Hitler 's armies marched across Europe - a war that has not ended .
But is also the story of a trail of blood that leads directly to you : to your remote control , to your mobile phone , to your laptop and to your diamond necklace .
In the TV series Lost , a group of plane crash survivors believe they are stranded alone on a desert island , until one day they discover a dense metal cable leading out into the ocean and the world beyond .
The Democratic Republic of Congo is full of those cables , mysterious connections that show how a seemingly isolated tribal war is in reality something very different .
This war has been dismissed as an internal African implosion .
In reality it is a battle for coltan , diamonds , cassiterite and gold , destined for sale in London , New York and Paris .
It is a battle for the metals that make our technological society vibrate and ring and bling , and it has already claimed four million lives in five years and broken a population the size of Britain's .
No , this is not only a story about them .
This - the tale of a short journey into the long Congolese war we in the West have fostered , fuelled and funded - is a story about you .
I Rapes Within Rapes
It starts with a ward full of women who have been gang - raped and then shot in the vagina .
I am standing in a makeshift ward in the Panzi hospital in Bukavu , the only hospital that is trying to deal with the bushfire of sexual violence in eastern Congo .
Most have wrapped themselves deep in their blankets so I can only see their eyes staring blankly at me .
Dr Denis Mukwege is speaking .
" Around 10 per cent of the gang - rape victims have had this happen to them , " he says softly , his big hands tucked into his white coat .
" We are trying to reconstruct their vaginas , their anuses , their intestines .
It is a long process . "
We walk out into the courtyard and he begins to explain - in the national language , French - the secret history of this hospital .
" We started with a catastrophe we just could n't understand , " he says softly .
One day early in the war , the Unicef medical van he was using was looted .
Coincidentally , a few days later , a woman was carried here on her grandmother 's back after an eight - hour trek .
" I had never seen anything like it .
She had been gang - raped and then her legs had been shot to pieces .
I operated on her on a table with no equipment , no medicine . "
She was only the first .
" We suddenly had so many women coming in with post - rape lesions and injuries I could never have imagined .
Our minds just could n't take in what these women had suffered . "
The competing armies had discovered that rape was an efficient weapon in this war .
Even in this small province , South Kivu , the UN estimates that 45,000 women were raped last year alone .
" It destroys the morale of the men to rape their women .
Crippling their women cripples their society , " he explains , shaking his head gently .
There were so many militias around that Dr Mukwege had to keep his treatments secret - the women were terrified of being kidnapped again and killed .
He became an Oskar Schindler of the Congolese mass rapes .
As we walk down to watch 200 rape victims being taught to sew under a large , dark bridge , he tells me what they can expect now .
" When the rapes begin , the husbands and fathers often just scarper and never come back .
The women never hear anything from them again .
Other times , the men blame the women and shun them .
It 's very hard for us to persuade the women to leave the hospital , because where are they going to go ? "
He introduces me to Aileen , who is 18 but looks much younger .
She holds her hands tightly in her lap .
Her story is stark , the details sparse .
Her village was raided by a militia on 10 October , and " they beheaded people in the central square " .
Her voice is high - pitched ; she is almost squeaking .
She was seized and taken back out into the forest by the militia where they kept her for six months .
" I was raped every night .
The first night my body really ached and hurt because I was a virgin , " she says .
She would be passed on from one man to the next .
It is only as she speaks that I notice the large protruding bump sagging into her lap .
The baby is going to be born next month .
She says she has spoken to her family , but Dr Mukwege tells me later this is a fantasy .
" What , " she asks me with wide eyes as we leave , " do you think I should do ?
Where can I go ? "
It is coldly appropriate to start here .
The rape of Aileen and the rape of the thousands of women who stagger into the Panzi hospital are , I soon discover , merely part of a larger rape - the rape of Congo .
II The Last of the Belgian Colonialists
Bukavu is a cratered , shattered shack - city in eastern Congo that lies on the edge of Lake Kivu .
In the street markets , people trade scraps of food for Congolese notes worth a few pence .
In the houses , they stagger along without water or electricity .
Wandering through this cacophony , I find a lone white woman , a lingering remnant of the origins of this war .
She can reveal how all this began .
As we sit over lunch , Tina Van Malderen says , skimming the menu : " I do n't drink water - only wine . "
Her hair is greying but her smile is warm .
" I came to Bukavu as a little girl in 1951 when my father came to work for the Belgian administration , " she explains .
" It was paradise .
There were only Europeans then .
No Africans .
Black people lived in the surrounding areas .
It was n't like South Africa , they were n't forced .
They did n't want to live with us .
They came into the town to work .
They had their own market . "
She speaks of the days of the Belgian empire with a soft - focus sepia longing .
" I have four sisters , and we would swim in the lake all day .
It was like a non -stop holiday . "
Her family owned a chain of shops , and the only castle in Congo .
She is incredulous when I ask if there was any cruelty towards black people back then .
" Absolutely not .
We loved our blacks .
When they had children , we gave them gifts . "
Perhaps sensing my scepticism , she adds : " Maybe on the plantations they were a little bit rude to them . "
The Belgians unified Congo in the first great holocaust of the 20th century , a programme of slavery and tyranny that killed 13 million people .
King Leopold II - bragging about his humanitarian goals , of course - seized Congo and turned it into a slave colony geared to extracting rubber , the coltan and cassiterite of its day .
The " natives " who failed to gather enough rubber would have their hands chopped off , with the Belgian administrators receiving and carefully counting hundreds of baskets of hands a day .
This system of forced cultivation continued until the Belgians withdrew in 1960 , when Patrice Lumumba became the first and only elected leader of Congo .
" He was a stupid man , " Tina says swiftly .
" On the first day of independence , he said we had beaten and humiliated the blacks .
He signed his death warrant by doing that . "
She 's right - he did .
Lumumba claimed to be a democratic socialist who wanted to overcome Congo 's ethnic divisions .
We will never know if he could have fulfilled this dream , because the CIA decided he was a " mad dog " who had to be put down .
Before long , one of its agents was driving around Kinshasa with the elected leader 's tortured corpse in the boot , and the CIA 's man - Mobutu Sese Seko - was in power and in the money .
Tina 's family sold their castle to the dictator as he renamed the country Zaire .
" People always ask if he paid .
Of course he paid ! " she laughs .
Mobutu became another Leopold , using the state to rob and murder the Congolese people .
Tina 's family started to worry in the 1970s when he announced a programme of " Zaireanisation " - a Mugabe - style transfer of the resources of foreigners to his cronies .
" My mother arrived at work one day and there was a black man come to take possession of everything , including her car .
She had to walk home , " Tina says , glugging red wine .
" Everything began to fail after that .
The food became disgusting .
Even our dog did n't want to eat it . "
This is Tina 's first visit home - she still calls it that - since they fled .
" I saw the house we lived in .
From outside it still looked nice but when I went inside ... " she shakes her head .
" The black people can not live properly .
If I had to compare Congo , I must say it has n't changed at all .
They are not naked any more , but they are still savages . "
Tina 's countrymen established the nation - state in the Congo , and they designed it to be a vampire - state .
The only change over the decades has been the resource snatched for Western consumption - rubber under the Belgians , diamonds under Mobutu , coltan and cassiterite today .
" Cheers , " Tina says , downing her wine .
III The War for Games Consoles
If you want to glimpse what all this death has been for , you have cross Lake Kivu and drive for four hours , on pocked and broken roller - coaster roads , until you reach a place called Kalehe .
Scarring the lush green hills are what seem to be large red scabs that glisten in the sun .
The term for these open wounds in the earth is " artisinal mines " , but this dry terminology conjures up images of technical digs with machines and lights and helmets .
In reality , they are immense holes in the ground , in which men , women and children - lots of children - pick desperately with makeshift hammers or their bare hands at the red earth , hoping to find some coltan or cassiterite to set on the long conveyor belt to your house , or mine .
Coltan is a metal that conducts heat unusually brilliantly .
It is contained in your mobile , your lap - top , your son 's PlayStation - and 80 per cent of the world 's supplies sit beneath the Democratic Republic of Congo .
As I crawl down into the mine - its cool , damp darkness is a strange contrast to the raging Congolese sun - the miners laugh .
The idea of a muzungu - a white man - in their mine seems to them impossibly comic .
But they soon get back to picking away at a roof that looks like it could collapse at any moment .
Ingo Mbale , 51 , explains how the West 's hunger for coltan is fed .
" We were enslaved three years ago , " he says .
" An RCD captain [ from one of the militias ] arrived and forced us to mine for them at gunpoint .
They gave us no money , it was slave labour .
There is nothing left in many of these shafts now , they exhausted them .
They killed many people .
Our gold and coltan and cassiterite went out to the world via Rwanda . "
Watching these men , the shape of Congo 's recent history becomes clear .
There is an official story about the war in Congo , and then there is the reality , uncovered by a trilogy of bomb - blast reports from the UN Panel of Experts on the DRC .
The official story is convoluted and hard to follow , because it does not ultimately make sense .
But its first chapter is true enough , and goes something like this .
In 1996 , a Maoist with an eye for money called Laurent - Désiré Kabila grew tired of simply running his little fiefdom in eastern Zaire , where he peddled ivory and gold with a nice sideline in kidnapping Westerners .
Kabila decided to depose Mobutu , the omnipresent and omni-incompetent tyrant , and seize power for himself .
He cobbled together a ragtag army of child soldiers known as the Kadogo and , with the support of neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda , the edifice of Mobutuism collapsed even before their tinny , tiny advance .
Kabila installed himself as another Leopold - alike , banning political parties and bathing in corruption .
But then in 1998 Kabila asked the Rwandans and Ugandans to withdraw their troops from Congo - so long , and thanks for the armies - and the official story begins to drift away from reality .
The Rwandans pulled back for a fortnight , but then mounted a massive invasion of Congo , seizing a third of the country .
The public reason for this assault sounds reasonable .
After the 1994 genocide in Rwanda - a slaughter that made even Auschwitz look slow - paced - tens of thousands of the Hutu Power machete - wielders fled across the border to Congo and set up long - term bases .
How could any country rest with its murderers armed and crazed on its borders ?
" We must prevent the génocidaires from regrouping , " said Paul Kagame , the Rwandan president , with the supportive Ugandan military following in tow .
From his palace in Kinshasa , Kabila appealed to his friends for help resisting this Rwandan - Ugandan attack .
Zimbabwe , Namibia and Angola obligingly sent armies marching into Congo to fight back , and Africa 's First World War began .
The armies and militias marauding across Congo then became rebels without a cause , fighting each other because they were there and because pulling out would be a humiliating concession of defeat .
In this version , the war in Congo is a mess , started with the best of intentions - the Rwandans ' desire to track down génocidaires - only to spiral out of control .
It presents the mass slaughter as a giant cock - up , a cosmic mistake .
This is strangely reassuring .
It is also a lie .
Once the Congo was drenched in death , the UN commissioned a panel of international statesmen to travel the country and uncover the reasons behind the war .
They found that the Rwandan government 's story hid a much darker truth .
The Rwandans had a clear intention , right from the beginning : to seize Congo 's massive mineral wealth , to grab the coltan mine I am standing in now and thousands like it , and to sell it on to us , the waiting world , as we quickly flicked the channel away from the news of this war with our coltan - filled remote control .
The other countries came in not because they believed in repelling aggression , but because they wanted a piece of the Congolese cake .
The country was ravaged by " armies of business " , commanded by men who " carefully planned the redrawing of the regional map to redistribute wealth , " the UN declared .
The UN experts knew this because the Rwandan troops did not head for the areas where the génocidaires were hiding out .
They headed straight for the mines like this one in Kalehe , and they swiftly enslaved the populations to dig for them .
They did not clear out the génocidaires - they teamed up with them to rape Congo .
Jean - Pierre Ondekane , the chief of the Rwandan forces in Goma , urged his units to maintain good relations " with our Interhamwe [ génocidaires ] brothers . "
They set up a Congo Desk that whisked billions out of the country and into Rwandan bank accounts - and they fought to stay and pillage some more .
The UN found that a Who 's Who of British , American and Belgian companies were involved in the illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .
The ones they recommended for further investigation included Anglo - American PLC , Barclays Bank , Standard Chartered Bank and De Beers .
The British Government - while boasting of its humanitarian goals in Africa - barely followed up the report , publicly acquitting a few corporations like Anglo - American whose subisidary AngloGold Ashanti has been shown by Human Rights Watch to have developed links with a murderous armed group in the region , and leaving others like De Beers in an " unresolved " category .
Oh , and the reason why this invasion was so profitable ?
Global demand for coltan was soaring throughout the war because of the massive popularity of coltan - filled Sony PlayStations .
While Sony itself does not use Congolese coltan , its sudden need for vast amounts of the metal drove up the price - which intensified the war .
As Oona King , one of the few British politicians to notice Congo , explains as we travel together for a few days : " Kids in Congo were being sent down mines to die so that kids in Europe and America could kill imaginary aliens in their living rooms . "
As I climb back out into the hard sunshine , the miners turn to me .
" Could you send us a hammer ?
We really need one .
The militias took all our equipment . "
IV The Tyrant's Jeer
On the long journey in an armoured UN vehicle , the questions seem so obvious , so trite .
How could a government led by genocide victims suddenly commit its own epic crime against humanity , for nothing more than money ?
The answer lies across the border , through the rainforest , towards Kigali .
I meet Charles Muligande , the Rwandan foreign minister , on the top floor of the Hotel Des Milles Collines , the real Hotel Rwanda .
This is where hundreds of Tutsis hid out the holocaust while their brothers and sons were hacked to pieces on the streets outside .
Muligande has a strange combination of a youthful , unlined face and graying hair ( with matching moustache ) , and he carries with him the unimpeachable moral stature of the victim .
The sadness around the eyes , the haltingly recounted story of being driven across the border to Burundi as a child refugee , the relatives slaughtered in the genocide - they are all cruelly present .
How can I challenge him ?
He speaks softly about the trauma counselling that is happening in Rwanda , and the fragile attempts at reconciliation .
And then it comes - the chuckle .
I ask him about Congo 's future , and he lets out a strange , hard - to - place laugh .
" The DRC is a country that for the last 45 years has had pockets outside the control of central government , " he says .
" Even on the eve of the election , there will by places that are beyond the control of central government .
This should n't be a cause for concern . "
And again with the chuckle .
What about the people who pay the price of the instability he waves away so casually ?
How does he sleep at night , knowing Rwanda has inflicted on its neighbours suffering akin to the horrors he and his family endured ?
He chuckles harder now , almost coughing .
" This is rubbish .
If we do a balance sheet , we incurred a lot of losses in fighting that war . "
He says it with such airy conviction I have to grope in my mind for the right response .
Why then does the UN 's report say that Rwanda 's pillage was " systematic " and " deliberate " ?
" That is an invention , " he snaps .
By the UN , Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch ?
" Yes .
It does n't become true just because it is repeated .
If you have such a blind faith in Amnesty International , " - he spits the words - " and the UN and Human Rights Watch , there is nothing I can tell you .
It is like you are asking me to believe Jesus Christ is not my saviour come to change my soul .
It is a faith - based position . "
No amount of probing will shift him .
When he talks about the genocide , he is compassionate , honest , brave .
When he talks about his own country 's crimes against Congo , he sneers .
Their trauma , it seems , is worth nothing .
As he speaks , I wonder - does he believe this , or does he , in midnight sweats , think about the children driven from their homes just like a baby Muligande was all those years ago ?
The more I probe , the more his face contorts into the tyrant 's jeer .
I have seen this before , in Iraq and in Israel / Palestine - the furrowed brow and the rote claim that the evil UN and Amnesty have it in for us .
Blood ?
What blood ?

The victims of the war - of that laugh - are scattered everywhere in eastern Congo .
By the roadside the next morning , I find the living remnants of Ramba village , a home to 15,000 .
They make up a clump of 400 starving people building a makeshift camp by the roadside .
Maneno Mutagemba Justin , their chief - a young man with sore , reddish eyes - explains what happened .
" The Interahamwe came into our village .
They killed and they raped our women .
Now they have stolen our houses and told us never to come back . "
People fled in all directions , losing their husbands or children .
Nobody is quite sure how many relatives they have lost forever .
" We have no food here , and we left everything behind .
We have no pots , no pans , no water . "
These people live a long drawn - out postscript to Thomas Hobbes , the 17th - century philosopher who warned that in the absence of a state , life will be : " Solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short . "
Yet the most piercing image of pain I see in Congo is not in places like this .
It is not in the pygmy village where children with sweet distended bellies sleep with their families in the tea - bushes because they are terrified of being beheaded by the militias .
It is not even in the eyes of the man Oona King and I see being casually beaten to death by a mob on the road one moody afternoon , another unrecorded Congolese write - off that we swiftly speed away from .
No , it is the women carrying more than their own bodyweight in wood or coal or sand , all day , every day .
By every Congolese roadside , there are women with ropes tearing into their foreheads as they bind a massive load on to their backs .
With so few horses , so few cars and so few roads , starving women are used here as pack - horses , transporting anything that needs to be moved on their backs for 50 p a day .
They are given the quaint title of " porters " .
Francine Chacopawa is 30 but she looks much older , her faced lined and cratered in a complex topography of pain .
Her spine is curved , her skin is rough and broken , her hands calloused .
When she laboriously puts down the wood she is carrying , she has a red canyon in her forehead where the rope was , rimmed with sores that weep from the rubbing .
" This is the rope that keeps my household alive , " she says .
It is the war that has reduced her to this state .
" Since the war started , you can't farm in peace , and the children are starving , so I prefer to die in this work ...
My husband cannot get a job , so this is what I have to do .
I leave at five o'clock in the morning and get back at seven o'clock at night .
I am worried my children are running away to look for food , because we only get to eat once a day .
When I get home , my husband gets angry and asks why I have been away so long .
We have suffered so much .
The children we bring into the world are forced to be porters as well .
We are the most unhappy people in the world . "
She tells me the pack she is carrying weighs 200lb , and I write this off as understandable hyperbole .
Then my translator and the UN driver load her pack on to my back ( with great difficulty ) .
I immediately fall to my knees .
I stagger up and manage to stumble a few feet before falling over again .
I am almost crying in pain ; my back aches for weeks .
This is Francine 's life .
She does not even stop on Sundays .
" How can I ?
We must eat , " she says .
Portering has made her miscarry twice , and Francine says she has seen women die by the side of the road , buckled under their loads .
I ask her when she will stop portering .
She shrugs , and says nothing .
Her eyes say : " When I die . "
The wood is heaved back on to her back , and she staggers away , the rope rubbing against her sores .
VI The Head of State Without a State
Joseph Kabila is surrounded by crocodiles .
We are standing by the back wall of the White House , the slimline presidential palace in Kinshasa , and the rippling , reptile - infested Congo river rings around us .
His house looks like a well - kept municipal library in an American town , a world away from the psycho- kitsch of the Mobutu era .
The President 's eyes have narrowed .
" How long have you been here , to think you can write about Congo ? " he asks , unsmiling .
I say I have been here a fortnight .
He nods slightly .
" Then that 's OK . "
Kabila does not like talking to journalists .
Indeed , he does not like talking to anyone - he has conspicuously failed to turn up at his own election rallies over the past few months .
I have been smuggled in at the end of his meeting with the All - Party Parliamentary Group on the Great Lakes Region , a collection of decent British politicians who have come to try to erode the worst humanitarian crisis in the world by inches .
" I want to see some quick wins [ for the Congolese people ] from the presidential election , " he says , assuming he will win the looming polls - the first in Congo since 1960 .
He then rattles off a list of improvements he hopes to implement to prove that democracy works - better water supplies , better schooling .
He offers up these platitudes in absent English , his handsome face covered with a light sprinkling of stubble that seems to be greying in the sun .
He became President at the age of 29 when his father was pinned down and executed in a failed coup in 2001 .
At that moment the reluctant son of the Big Man was thrust from a life of army drills and watching martial arts movies to being in a charge of the world 's biggest war zone .
Neckless and nervous , he says his two minutes ' worth of stump speech now and then closes up .
He signals to his Versace - suited security guards that it is time for him to leave .
My five minutes of questions - more than any other journalist gets - have been greeted with a polite stonewall of banality .
The White House has a feel of unreality .
It is a hologram of power , the simulacrum of a functioning country .
Kabila is in the surreal position of being head of state without a state , President of the Democratic Vacuum of Congo .
He has no levers of power to pull .
As I discovered later in my journey , he has no army worthy of the name , he has no police force , he cannot guard his own borders or build his own schools .
From the sealed calm of the palace , I look over a wall and see the real Congo walking past - people slumped against walls or busy doing nothing or frantically fending off hunger any way they can .
The fantasy of a functioning country dies outside his own brickwork .
Since his father died , Kabila has been trying to glue together a nation from the shattered fragments .
In 2002 , he negotiated the Lusaka Accords , in which the invading countries promised to remove their armies .
The global price of coltan had collapsed , so Rwanda 's interest was waning .
Besides , the withdrawing countries realised they could suck the mineral marrow from Congo without the costly business of occupation , simply by setting up Congolese militias as their proxies on their way out the door .
Kabila tried to out - bribe powerful militia leaders by offering them a place at the heart of government .
That 's why , of his four vice presidents , three have their own private armies .
To watch over this " peace process " , the UN sent in 17,000 peacekeepers for a country the size of Western Europe .
At the core of Kabila 's project to make Congo into one nation with one government is brassage - the integration of the militias .
At squalid camps across the country , the militiamen who have been raping and murdering are invited to hand in their weapons and join the new national army .
I head for Camp Saio , a camp outside Bukavu where men with Samuel L Jackson sunglasses and cheekbones that could cut butter are milling and mulling as they wait for " reintegration " .
Places like this are the key to Congo 's future .
The country 's success stands or falls on whether the militiamen can be coaxed to come here and slowly build a state .
Dr Adolphe Tumba , the head of the camp , takes me trudging through the mud on a tour .
In the first room I see , there are nine stinking beds .
Men are sitting , rotting plaster covering their wounds .
In the corner is a soldier shivering in his bed , his face covered with the lesions that come with the final stages of Aids .
He opens his eyes - they recoil , wounded by the light .
They close again as he curls wearily into a tight ball .
I ask the men what life was like on the front line .
" We ate .
We had food there , " they snap back .
I ask again , assuming they misunderstood .
" We had food at the front line .
It was better .
Why did you come here without something for us to eat ? "
They last ate two days ago .
They have not received their $ 5 - a - month wages for 40 days .
They are starving .
A UN source warned me : " The people in that camp are going out and rampaging into the nearby villages .
They do it for survival .
They steal to get by .
Yesterday they killed a man , the day before they killed a woman and some kids .
It 's all done by men in uniform coming out of that camp . "
Joseph , a 22 - year - old , tells me he joined up when he was a teenager because his village was attacked by the Rwandans .
" They killed my father , my grandfather and my little sister .
So I decided to join Mai - Mai [ a Congolese militia ] .
I can't count how many people I killed .
I did it for six years . "
His friends gather round , and some of them are more eager to brag about their kill rates .
They remind me of kids on some estates I have visited , bragging about their Asbos .
Are they telling the truth , or is this teenage display ?
As they become more and more animated describing their killing sprees , as their eyes become wider and their stories more vivid , our UN escort begins to panic and tells us we must leave .
" Quickly ! " he calls .
As we drive away , I realise it is not enough that our greed for resources started this war - it is vandalising any chance of bringing it to an end .
While these state - building camps can offer only starvation and a sometimes - never $ 5 wage , Unicef says the militias are offering the same men $ 60 a month to carry on seizing and raping and killing .
They can afford it because they still control most of the coltan , gold and diamond mines , and Western and Chinese companies are still snapping up the sparklers they offer .
So long as the militias can continue to use our money to outbid the national government , there will never be a unified state in Congo , and life will continue to be a live - action replay of Thomas Hobbes ' bleakest descriptions .
And yet , even the best case scenario - effective brassage , a unified army , a coherent state - carries with it blood - drenched risks .
What if once Kabila gets control of the country , he morphs into a Mobutu or a Mugabe ?
Then all this nation - building will turn out to have been an exercise in capacity - building for a murderer .
Who is this man with a neckless , nervous gaze ?
A rogue source at the British Embassy who has high - level dealings with the regime ponders over dinner : " There are essential two theories about Kabila , " he says .
" The first is that he is a good man surrounded by shits .
The second is that he is one of the shits .
Let 's assume the first is true - what difference does it make ?
He is surrounded by Rumsfelds and Cheneys , friends of the father who would kill him if he stepped out of line .
There is a large group around him whose finances and even their impunity from charges in the Hague depend on him staying in power .
Would they allow him to lose power , or even to share it too much ?
Really ? "
At times , it seems Congo is lost in a fog of moral ambiguity .
Everybody agrees the state needs to be unified , and there seems to be only one state on offer - Kabila 's - given the near - certainty he will win the election .
An aid agency head says : " In this country , all you can ask about a politician is - is this person corrupt and self - seeking and does n't give a damn about Congo , or is this person corrupt and self - seeking but wants what 's best for Congo too ?
Of course Kabila 's circle is corrupt .
To have power in this country you must be corrupt .
It 's a corrupt system . "
The best hope , it seems , is to drag Congo up from being a broken stateless war zone where millions die to a bog - standard corrupt state .
To the starving soldiers of Camp Saio , watching open - mouthed and hungry as we drive away , even this sunken ambition seems optimistic .
VII Spiritual Warfare
The coven of witches is dancing and cackling in the water .
They have a hose - pipe and they are spraying each other 's naked bodies , squealing and laughing .
One of them comes up to me , wearing a worn - out Barney the dinosaur T - shirt , and splashes some water at my face .
I am in a children 's home , Chez Mama Coco , an hour 's drive from Kinshasa , and the place is filled with starved witch - children who have been thrown out by their parents for displaying signs of being under the influence of Satan .
Some have been burned and slashed , and some mutilated .
One of the workers introduces me to a child - they do not know his name because he has not spoken since he arrived , but they call him Fidel - and tugs down his trousers .
Where his penis once was , there is nothing but an angry red scab .
" His mother cut it off during the exorcism , " he says .
This is another consequence of our war .
Herve Cheuzeville , the outgoing Head of Mission for Warchild , explains : " The idea of withcraft has always existed in Congo , but it is new to accuse children of it .
It never happened before .
It is a result of the terrible traumas of the past six years . "
The Combat Spirituel church in Bukavu consists of an immense veranda filled with benches , with a neat white building attached .
These churches have been pioneers of Congo 's 21st - century witch - hunts , and when I arrive at their Sunday service , they greet me with whoops and hallelujahs .
The evangelical preacher at the podium has a kind of Christian Pan's People dancing behind him , and he exclaims : " We salute God by dancing ! "
The congregation contains over 1,000 people , and they look more like the crowd at a football match than at a dreary Church of England ceremony .
They blow whistles , jump up and down , and dance wildly .
A man with a miraculous story about how he was cured of Aids through the power of prayer takes to the platform .
I am told that if I want to talk witchcraft , however , I need to return late on Thursday , when the purgings and exorcisms happen .
I come back , and Papa Enoch Boonga - the " spiritual co-ordinator " - is waiting for me with a 14 - year - old witch .
I am led into the little house .
The lights are switched off , and Papa Enoch produces a lantern that lights his face and casts a long shadow .
In his slow , rhythmic French , he begins to tell me how : " Satan is waging war on the Congolese people .
He comes to kill and hate .
The answer to Satan 's campaign against us is spiritual combat . "
That is his cue to drag out Clarice .
She is a small girl wrapped in a big woollen cardigan .
In a low , blank rote , her eyes cast down , she says : " I was taught sorcery when I was 12 .
My grandmother turned me into a witch by giving me a doughnut to eat . "
Enoch looks at me triumphantly .
" This is how it works !
They give evil food ! "
He takes over from Clarice 's halting speech .
" Then the grandmother came at night in spiritual form and said , ' I gave you the doughnut to eat , now you must give me your little sister to eat . '
She was so frightened she said , ' OK , OK , ' and the next day her little sister fell ill and died .
Then her grandmother demanded she break the leg of her mother , so when he mother was out gathering wood , she fell and broke her leg .
Now the girl started to feel the power of sorcery and began to transform herself into a dog or a cat . "
I keep looking at Clarice in disbelief , but then I realise she thinks I am glaring in condemnation and I look away .
As Enoch speaks , the chanting behind us from the main service is getting louder and louder - " Out Satan , out ! " hundreds of people cry , clawing at invisible demons in the air .
He continues , " Her father is an artisinal miner and he stopped being able to find anything because of her sorcery .
They fell into poverty . "
I have to interrupt .
I ask Clarice , softly : " Do you really think it is your fault your little sister died ? "
" Yes , " she says .
Her eyes remain fixed on the floor .
" It was actually her parents who realised she was a witch , " Enoch says .
" They were very worried about their lives going bad , and they went to church and prayed and God told them what the problem was . "
He says they conducted an exorcism of Clarice , and , yes , it was tough .
" When you cast Satan out , you almost destroy the person , but they come back with Jesus Christ in their heart . "
As I look into Clarice 's downcast eyes , I realise it is not only the physical landscape of Congo that lies in ruins .
The psychological landscape has been trashed .
The war has left girls like her in a society littered with superstition landmines that will not be cleared away for decades .
She limps away , back to a life soaked in self - hate .
VIII - Packing Out the Albert Hall
The last time there was a holocaust in Congo , British and American people reacted with a great national revulsion .
Books like Arthur Conan Doyle 's The Crime of the Congo topped the bestseller lists , millions petitioned parliament to act , and the Royal Albert Hall was packed out with mass meetings detailing the Congo 's long nightmare .
A century on , the words and analyses of that great campaign still ring true .
Joseph Conrad called it " the vilest scramble for loot that has ever disfigured the human conscience " - words that would make a perfect introduction to the reports of the UN Panel of Experts now .
But today , these four million people have died in the dark , unnoticed and unmourned .
The generations living in the West today have said nothing while the country has been reduced to near - Leopoldian levels of desperation by the scramble for loot , conducted on our behalf and for our benefit .
The average life - expectancy in Congo is 43 and falling .
I did not see any elderly people on my journey ; they do not exist .
In a country where the war is laughably referred to as " winding down " , a World Trade Center - full of people is butchered every two days , and in the lost rural areas I could not reach , bubonic plague has made a triumphant come - back .
A health minister says in despair : " I have been told by the UN to prepare a plan for avian flu .
I had to write back and say I am powerless to deal with the plague , so what am I supposed to do about chickens ? "
This war was launched by nations that sensed - rightly - that our desire for coltan and diamonds and gold far outweighed our concern for the lives of black people .
They knew that we would keep on buying , long after the UN had told us time and again that people were dying to provide our mobiles and games consoles and a girl 's best friend .
Today , we still buy , and the British Government - along with the rest of the democratic world - obstructs any attempt to introduce legally enforceable regulations to stop corporations trading in Congolese blood .
They ignore the UN 's warnings that : " Without the wealth generated by the illegal exploitation of natural resources arms cannot be bought , hence the conflict cannot be perpetuated , " and insist that voluntary regulations - asking corporations to be nice to Africans - is " the most effective route " .
In Bukavu , a 29 - year - old human rights campaigner called Bertrand Bisimwa summarised his country 's situation for me with cruel concision .
" Since the 19th century , when the world looks at Congo it sees a pile of riches with some black people inconveniently sitting on top of them .
They eradicate the Congolese people so they can possess the mines and resources .
They destroy us because we are an inconvenience . "
As he speaks , I picture the raped women with bullets burying through their intestines and try to weigh them against the piles of blood - soaked electronic goods sitting beneath my Christmas tree with their little chunks of Congolese metal whirring inside .
Bertrand smiles and says , " Tell me - who are the savages ?
Us , or you ? "

Answers 26 AD .
There was no year 0 . Â£ 2000 .
Let B be the price of the bike .
Then B = 1000 + B / 2 . So B - B/2 = B/2 = 1000 .
So that means B is 2000 .
A hexagon .
You cut through all the 6 faces of the cube .
Each face contributes an edge to the shape .
96 . Each contestant loses once except for the champion .
18 . This was a tough one .
18 is 17 in base 9 .
They are the prime number 17 in different bases .
10001 is binary for 17=1x16+0x8+0x4+0x2+1x1 . 122 is 17 in base 3 . 17=1x9+2x3+2x1 101 is 17 in base 4 . 17=1x16+0x4+1x1 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House was studying on Saturday how best to rescue collapsing U.S. automakers , a day after picking up the pieces of a failed congressional bailout plan .
The Bush administration stepped into the auto fray on Friday , saying it would consider tapping a $ 700 billion fund set up to rescue Wall Street banks , after Congress failed to pass a bailout .
Auto company executives and analysts have said that General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC need immediate help to avoid bankruptcy .
Ford Motor
Co is in slightly better financial shape but says it needs a major line of credit .
Bankruptcy of one of Detroit ’s Big
Three would be a body blow to the U.S. economy , which is already in recession , immediately hitting car parts makers and car dealers , as well as manufacturers .
Administration officials were gathering financial information from the automakers and assessing data such as their cash position , said Tony Fratto , a spokesman for President George W. Bush .
“ We ’ll be focused on trying to get the policy right while considering the best interests of the taxpayer and our economy , and we ’ll take the time we have available to do that right , ” Fratto said .
“ No decisions have been made . ”
“ We ’ll take a look at that information , make some judgments and review our options , ” he said .
Also on Saturday , top European car makers warned of a bleak 2009 , in growing signs that the industry ’s troubles went far beyond the life - or - death struggle in the United States .
A senior administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said no announcement was expected this weekend .
“ We ’re considering the full range of options with respect to the automakers , and we have n’t indicated what we will do , except to note that disorderly bankruptcy is something we should try to avoid , ” the official said .
UNIONS , DEMOCRATS URGE AID
Democratic leaders and the main U.S. auto workers union appealed to Bush ’s Republican administration -- now in its final weeks before turning over to Democratic President - elect Barack Obama -- to provide emergency funds after a Senate deal to save Detroit ’s Big Three collapsed in acrimony late on Thursday .
The failure of the $ 14 billion bailout plan in Congress set markets reeling around the world .
But signs that the White House and U.S. Treasury Department might mount a last - ditch effort to help the carmakers buoyed Wall Street on Friday .

Before financial markets opened on Friday , the administration said it was considering tapping the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) fund that was set up for the financial industry , reversing an earlier vow to oppose its use for an auto bailout .
Polls show Americans split on bailing out the U.S. automakers , a highly visible troubled sector in a country grappling with recession .
The auto companies say one in 10 jobs in the United States are linked to their industry .
But the companies are widely criticized for fighting tougher fuel efficiency standards and poor model designs that have left them with big , inefficient vehicles that have lost popularity with consumers .

In response to the company ’s many struggles , GM said it would cut its first - quarter North American production by 60 percent .
Bush can ill afford the failure of one or more of the automakers as he prepares to leave office on January 20 with a presidential legacy already battered by the grim economy and the unpopular war in Iraq .
Obama has said he was disappointed Congress did not approve the bailout .
Even if GM and Chrysler secure a last - ditch loan from the Bush administration , analysts see continued uncertainty ahead .
Both will be under intense pressure to cut new cost - saving deals with creditors and the main labor union at a time when U.S. auto sales are at their lowest level adjusted for population since World War Two .
The United Auto Workers blamed the failure of the congressional bailout plan on Senate Republicans who want more wage concessions from the union .
The UAW said it was now up to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to find a way to bail out U.S. automakers .
Thursday ’s deal fell apart in Congress over proposed wage concessions by the UAW , including the date at which the autoworkers ’ would accept pay parity with workers at foreign - owned U.S. auto plants .
The Democrats hold a majority in the Senate but needed Republican support for the proposal to succeed .
Nortel Networks
Corp has sought legal advice to study a bankruptcy protection scenario in the event that its restructuring plan fails and has also been exploring potential assistance from the Canadian government , the Wall Street Journal reported .
On the subject of legal advice for studying a bankruptcy scenario , the WSJ cited people familiar with the situation , while on the potential government aid scenario , it cited a person familiar with the situation .
Nortel�s spokesperson said no bankruptcy filing was imminent though the Toronto - based company has engaged several advisors to plan ahead , the newspaper reported .
Nortel could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .
Nortel , North America�s biggest maker of telephone equipment has lost billions of dollars and cut tens of thousands of jobs since the technology bubble burst at the beginning of this decade .
The company has been unable to recover since then , with its problems exacerbated by the global economic slowdown .
RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue said in November the company faced significant liquidity concerns , with bankruptcy a distinct possibility before 2011 .
Dec. 7 was once a significant date on the American calendar .
But sometime in the past 20 years it faded almost entirely out of view .
Partly this was generational and partly it was historical , as the end of the Cold War drew a line under the era that began with the day of infamy .
And partly it was a matter of indifference and neglect .
With that in mind , here 's a forecast for tonight 's result : Starting around the time the returns from Pennsylvania and Virginia are announced , 9/11 becomes another Dec. 7 .

A Witness Sealed with Blood : Gay Mormon Suicides and the Politics of Silence
Hugo Salinas
October 2001
This paper includes some personal reflections about the gay Mormon suicides that I have recently researched for Affirmation .
Even though I struggle much with this issue , I believe it is crucial that we talk about it .
The expression " the politics of silence " comes from an essay by Paul Monette in which he talks about the importance of coming out and fighting censorship .
" Some of the people who hate us so much think we 're out to indoctrinate their children , " writes Monette in his essay .
" Frankly , we 're trying to save their children from suicide . "
I 'm not sure if Monette realized then how prophetic his words are for the Mormon community .
It seems to me that all of us are caught between our fears of talking about this horrific crisis and our desperation to do something about it .
The current epidemic of gay Mormon suicides is a terrible act of injustice .
And yet I feel that suicide is an extremely complex issue , and that I am in no condition to assess how different factors may have influenced the decisions these gay Mormons made .
Moreover , even though I realize that there is a potential to claim these people as martyrs -- victims of homophobia who have " sealed their witness with their blood , " I do n't feel comfortable calling them martyrs or playing up the sad circumstances of their deaths .
Most of all , this paper is about my own struggle with the politics of silence .
I struggle with the politics of silence because on the one hand I believe that individuals should have the right to privacy , and yet I am outraged when I see how institutions use privacy as their excuse to avoid accountability or to distort the truth .
Perhaps I can illustrate this point with a story that I recently researched in the news .
In 1988 , Gordon Ray Church , a gay Mormon who was a student at Southern Utah State College , was tortured and killed by two ex-convicts .
It was the most heinous homicide in Utah 's history , a hate crime similar to the murdering of Matthew Shepard , and yet no one at that time dared to divulge the true nature of the crime .
" The killing was at least partly sex- related , " vaguely hinted The Salt Lake Tribune .
A Millard County judge placed a gag order and sealed all the court documents , in part because of the brutality of the crime and the fact that it involved a prominent family from Delta .
When the trial finally opened and Gordon Church 's gayness became a matter of public record , no one characterized the homicide as a hate crime .
It was n't till 1994 that a Salt Lake Tribune reader finally dared to tell the truth in a letter to the editor .
" I wondered why The Tribune suggested that [ Archuleta 's ] motive for torturing and killing Gordon Church was because Church was a Southern Utah University student who frequented a Cedar City convenience store , " he wrote .
" So much for accuracy in the media ... [ Michel Archuleta and Lance Wood ] did n't [ kill Church ] because Church was a student or because he was at a quick stop .
They did this because they perceived him to be gay .
It 's too bad that The Tribune can't bring itself to print the truth about one of the most heinous homophobic murders in U.S. history . "
It took The Salt Lake Tribune twelve years to debunk the politics of silence .
I also struggle with the politics of silence because on the one hand I am committed to truth and knowledge , and yet I recognize that I do n't always live up to my lofty ideals .
In March 2000 , when four gay Mormons killed themselves in four weeks , I sent a nervous message to the webmaster of the Affirmation site .
" Is it wise to talk about gay Mormon suicides in the Affirmation website ? " I asked him .
" Is n't there a danger of inspiring more copycats ? "
My concern about copycats was well - intentioned , and yet my message was condescending .
The politics of silence are based upon this very idea - the idea that I can handle the truth , but you cannot .
No matter how well - intentioned , today I feel that there is a far greater danger when we side with the politics of silence .
There is also a profound irony in connection with all these gay Mormon suicides and the politics of silence .
By ending their lives , all these gay Mormons chose silence , and yet at the same time they sent a compelling message about the overwhelming challenges they were facing .
Some of them even made explicit statements about their personal turmoil .
" I implore the students at BYU to re-assess their homophobic feelings , " wrote Stuart Matis in The Daily Universe shortly before committing suicide .
" Seek to understand first before you make comments .
We have the same needs as you .
We desire to love and be loved .
We desire to live our lives with happiness .
We are not a threat to you or your families . "
My friend DJ Thompson was even more explicit in his suicide note : " " It is unfortunate that the lives of good people such as Stuart Matis , Matthew Shephard , and many others go unnoticed , " he wrote .
" I see Proposition 22 as the last straw in my life - long battle to see peace in the world I live in . "
Last May , when we started to hear stories about gay Mormon suicides , the Wasatch Chapter of Affirmation helped organize a memorial service at St. Mark 's Cathedral , and Duane Jennings started to use the slogan , " No more deaths , no more silence . "
Many of the same people who had helped put together a memorial service when Matthew Shepard died were also involved in this service .
Allison Bingham spoke on behalf of Affirmation Youth Services , and I gave a brief eulogy for my friend DJ Thompson .
About a year later , Scott MacKay asked me to help put together a memorial page on the Affirmation website .
I accepted the challenge in part as a tribute to DJ .
I spent the next few weeks reading and documenting some of the saddest stories you can imagine .
A 25 - year - old Washington lobbyist jumps off a freeway bridge .
A BYU professor leaves his wife and children as if going to work , but instead pulls off the freeway and shoots himself in the heart .
A 33 - year - old active Mormon burns all the letters from his lover and hangs himself in his own home .
My goal was to document every single instance to the best of my abilities , to be as thorough and accurate as one possibly could , and yet once and again my task was hindered by the politics of silence .
Sometimes the families of gay Mormon suicides refuse to publish an obituary notice .
Sometimes they lie about the cause of death and , in some cases , they do n't even know that their sons and brothers were gay .
" We can use the first name , " I was told by a young gay Mormon from Las Vegas who helped me with a story , " but not the last name .
To this day his family does n't know that he committed suicide because he was gay . "
And in the process of finding out these stories , I too became an accomplice in the politics of silence .
For one thing , I never directly contacted any of the families .
Instead I spent endless hours at the Marriott Library , reading thousands of obituary notices .
I visited many cemeteries along the Wasatch Front , taking pictures of every gay Mormon suicide grave I could find .
I researched the records of the LDS Church .
I searched high school yearbooks .
And I used a network of gay - friendly people whom I contacted by email , by phone , and in person .
I also became an accomplice in the politics of silence because I learned to introduce myself according to the audience .
" I 'm writing a biographical sketch on so - and - so , and I was wondering if I could get a copy of his picture from one of your yearbooks , " I told some .
" I 'm doing family history , " I told others .
" I 'm doing research on Utah suicides , " I told yet others , carefully avoiding the words gay and Mormon .
I learned that lesson as I tried to contact the owner of a gay bar in Salt Lake City .
" My boss hates religion , " one of his employees told me when I explained to him my association with Affirmation .
" You can leave a message , but I doubt he 'll reply . "
The employee was right - the man never called me back .
In the end , I came up with information about more than 20 people who took their lives .
They were all Mormons , and they were all struggling to reconcile their beliefs with their sexuality .
I do n't claim to understand all the circumstances that lead them to suicide , but I think that Robert McQueen was right in his analysis of the deaths of 1965 .
" My friends from 1965 were good people , " he wrote in The Advocate .
" They wanted to be better people , but they believed in their church more than they believed in themselves .
When their church rejected them because they were gay , it destroyed them .
I doubt the Mormon Church will ever accept even a portion of the blame . "
Today I 'm more convinced than ever that we need to debunk forever the politics of silence .
It 's not shameful to take one 's own life , but it is shameful to ignore the fact that these suicides are occurring .
It is shameful that we are endorsing these suicides with our silence , or fueling more with further messages of hate and intolerance .
" If you destroy the record , you destroy the truth , " says Paul Monette .
We need to preserve and tell the stories of all these gay Mormon suicides , not because they are exemplary , but because they are compelling .
They are indicative of a health crisis in our midst .
This crisis is not triggered by a virus , but it is certainly fueled by messages of hate and bigotry .
We need to preserve and tell these stories , because just like many other diseases , this crisis thrives in ignorance .
For every case of a gay Mormon suicide that we have documented , there are many whose names we may never know , because the details have been hidden by the politics of silence .
And for every Mormon who has taken his or her life , there are many who already feel dead , because they can't reconcile their lives with the messages they hear at home , at school , and in church .
We need to preserve and tell these stories to show what should never have happened .
We need to preserve and tell these stories because admitting that they occurred is the first step toward changing reality .
We need to preserve and tell these stories because if we do n't do it , nobody will .
For those of you who feel depressed , bitter , or overwhelmed by feelings of fear and anxiety , my message is simple :
Do n't be an accomplice in the politics of silence .
Speak up .
There is help available .
You are not alone .
Thousands of gay and lesbian Mormons have been through the same turmoil , and most of them have survived and prospered .
This can also happen to you .
Accept yourself as you are and find the courage to talk with someone you trust .
For those of you who are youth advisors or teachers in schools and in the church , my message is simple :
Never ridicule a young girl who cannot follow your model of femininity .
Never make fun of a boy who does n't fit your expectations of masculinity .
Never teach the youth that a heterosexual marriage in the temple is the royal road to happiness .
Never teach that homosexuals would be better off dead .
Never teach that God sends AIDS upon gay men to punish them as in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah .
For bishops and other stakes leaders , my message is simple :
Do not believe that you understand what it means to be gay or lesbian .
Never threat a troubled soul with discipline or with excommunication .
More importantly , never recommend to anyone a " treatment " that is unethical , unscientific , or unrealistic .
Many of the gay Mormons who have taken their lives did so after being the victims of these " treatments . "
For the general authorities of the Church , my message is simple : Stop doing politics in the name of heterosexual morality .
Stop dividing families in the name of decency .
Stop excommunicating homosexuals in the name of theology .
The Mormon promotion of anti-gay laws has not decreased the rates of divorce and infidelity -- it has increased the rate of Mormon suicides .
These are not smart moves for a Church that claims to be embarked on the mission of promoting religious and cultural tolerance .
I do not believe in blaming the deaths of my friends and brothers solely on the Church 's intolerance , but every time Church leaders call homosexuality a perversion , every time they promote anti-gay laws , ever time they call our gay youth to repentance , they contribute to the self - hate and anxiety that are leading so many of our people to take their own lives .
Some extraordinary things take place every time a parent or a sibling has the courage to resist the politics of silence .
My first example of this comes from the Matis family .
In March 2000 , after the suicide of Stuart , his brother Bill sent a letter to The Daily Universe .
Part of the letter reads , " To those who feel that my brother was no better than a murderer or an adulterer , I would like to say that the murderer and adulterer choose to be what they are .
My brother did n't choose to be homosexual any more than you or I chose the color of our skin .
Many who knew him say that he was one of the most Christ - like people they had ever met .
He was a son , brother , uncle , nephew , cousin and true friend . "
My second example comes from David and Carlie Hardy , who are the parents of a gay son .
One evening in 1997 , while their son agonized over a Seminary lesson on Sodom and Gomorrah , their stake president reassured the mother , " If we just keep it quiet ... it will all be just fine , trust me . . . "
That same evening this son slit his wrists in his room at home .
Fortunately the son survived .
And even though their stake president wanted them to " keep it quiet , " the Hardys refused to be accomplices in the politics of silence .
They went public with their son's story and , in the process , they became powerful advocates against intolerance and homophobia , touching the lives of many people .
We all must find something to do , some way to resist and debunk the politics of silence .
For some of us , resistance will mean coming out to our friends , to our family , or to ourselves .
For others , it will mean raising our hand in Sunday School every time we hear the rhetoric of intolerance and homophobia .
For others , it will mean going public with our stories , participating in public forums , and sending letters to the editor .
After having read the stories of all these people , after having documented their lives and visited their graves , I still do n't know if all these gay Mormon suicides are martyrs or even heroes , but I do know that they are witnesses .
Their lives testify to a pain and sorrow that we cannot comprehend .
Their deaths speak of a health crisis that we must stop .
" I 've learned in my adult life that the will to silence the truth is always and everywhere as strong as the truth itself , " writes Paul Monette .
" So it is a necessary fight we will always be in : those of us who struggle to understand our common truths , and those who try to erase them . "
The task that our Mormon community faces is daunting , but a single step will start moving us in the right direction .
Let 's move from denial to acceptance , from ignorance to tolerance , from fear to dialogue .
No more deaths , no more silence .

JONESTOWN , Guyana ( CNN ) -- Cyanide was being bought and shipped to the Rev. Jim Jones ' jungle compound in South America for at least two years before 909 Americans died there at the command of their cult leader , CNN has learned .
Sources in Guyana said the Jonestown camp began obtaining shipments of cyanide -- about a quarter to a half - pound of the deadly poison each month -- as early as 1976 , well before most of Jones ' followers made the move there .
CNN 's Soledad O'Brien tells the story of the last hours of Jonestown -- and the few who did survive out of desperation and daring -- as CNN Presents " Escape from Jonestown . "
Jones led his followers to their death after his gunmen killed a visiting congressman , Rep. Leo Ryan , and four others , including an NBC News correspondent and his cameraman , on November 18 , 1978 .
Jones told the members of his Peoples Temple church that the Guyanese Army would invade their settlement after the murders .
He demanded that parents kill their children first , then take their own lives , rather than face the authorities because of what Jones had done .
Of the 909 who died , 303 were children -- from teens to toddlers .
Many were killed by Jones ' loyalists , who used syringes to squirt cyanide down their throats .
Jones stockpiled cyanide »
CNN was told Jones obtained a jeweler 's license to buy cyanide .
The chemical can be used to clean gold .
But there was no jeweler 's operation in Jonestown .
Escape from Jonestown
Thirty years ago , more than 900 died by murder and suicide .
Only 33 survived .
Soledad O'Brien reports on their untold stories .
Thursday , 9 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Six months before Ryan arrived on a one - man investigative mission , the settlement 's doctor wrote in a memo to Jones :
" Cyanide is one of the most rapidly acting poisons .
... I would like to give about two grams to a large pig to see how effective our batch is . "
The purchases are " strong evidence that the Rev. Jim Jones had been plotting the death of his followers long before that fateful day , " O'Brien reports .
Ryan , the only U.S. representative assassinated in office , was shot at a nearby airstrip as he tried to leave with 15 church members who told him Jones was holding people captive in the remote jungle encampment .
" That was literally a jungle prison , " said Gerald Parks , whose wife , Patricia , was shot to death in the airport attack .
How did he escape death ? »
Four other members of his family survived , including two young daughters who were lost in the jungle for three days after running away from the airstrip to hide from the killers .
Woman returns to scene for first time »
" It was a dictatorship , " said Vernon Gosney , who was badly wounded in the airport shootings .
" It was supposed to be socialism , but it really was fascism . "
Jones was a phony faith healer who moved his Indiana church to northern California in the mid-'60s in search of a safe place to survive the possibility of nuclear warfare .
In the mid-'70s , when a magazine raised questions about church beatings and financial abuses , Jones moved his flock to Guyana , in South America , to the jungle settlement he called his " beautiful promised land . "
" It was a slave camp run by a madman , " said Leslie Wilson , a young mother then only 21 , who began walking away from Jonestown early on the day that ended in the suicides and murder .
She and 10 others trudged almost 30 miles through the jungle to another town .
Wilson carried her 3 - year - old son on her back .
" It was a freedom walk , " she said .
" It was a walk to freedom . "
Tim Carter , a Jones aide , stayed in the camp almost to the end and saw his wife and his 1 - year - old son die before he was sent away on an errand .
Authorities made him return two days later to help identify bodies .
Carter saw Jones lying with a bullet hole in the side of his head .
" I remember thinking the son of a bitch did n't even die the way everybody else died , " Carter said .
For more than 90 years , kids in California enjoyed creating parades of Circus Animal Cookies baked by Mother 's Cookies , an iconic grocery - store snack brand headquartered in Oakland .
But this generation will be the last to munch on the bright - pink frosted animals : Mother 's Cookies crumbled on Oct. 6 , when the owners abruptly shut down and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
They blamed a variety of economic factors , including the rising costs of fuel , flour , butter and sugar .
" It 's a tough market in which to find credit , " said Barrett Golden , spokeswoman for Catterton Partners , the private equity firm that bought Mother 's Cookies a few years ago .
The flagship cookie 's image will live on in a hipster homage .
ClothMoth , an independent t- shirt company based in Houston , created a tribute tee featuring rows of Circus Animals and a bittersweet farewell : " Lights down , little cookies . "
Until its supply runs out , ClothMoth is shipping a small bag of the cookies with each shirt order .

I WAS SIFTING THROUGH MY OLD FOOTAGE AND JUST DISCOVERED HIDDEN FROM THE MASSES .
FOOTAGE BROADCAST OVER ABC ON 9/11 AND NEVER SEEN FROM AGAIN FOOTAGE OF REPORTS OF EXPLOSIONS AT THE CAPITAL .
DIGG THIS
“ Constitutions , bills of rights , statements of principle , party platforms , and all other Guarantees can never be more than self - imposed restrictions which cease to affect the people who run a government the instant they cease to believe in their rightness , or as soon as it is clear that the people will not punish the government for ignoring them . ”
~ Per Christian Malloch , " The Theory of Anarcho - Capitalism and its Libertarian Opponents " ( unpublished )
I have an admission to make .
It is n't that earth - shattering , nor will this be the first time I 've made this particular admission .
Nonetheless , my admission is : I learn much more by writing these essays than anyone will ever learn from reading them .
This truth plays out over and over each time I submit a piece to LRC , or Strike - the - Root , or a newsfeed to the John Birch Society website , or when one of my pieces appears in print anywhere else .
This truth manifests in any number of ways , including the insight I absorb as a natural result of doing the research .
It also manifests when I read and consider the feedback I receive .
To illustrate , I 'll examine two recent examples , both of which speak to something that occasionally seems obscure :
No one has precise knowledge of how to facilitate the transition from the current situation to a stateless society .
One might even argue that there is little to be gained by fiercely debating such strategic matters .
More importantly , as has been mentioned before , several times , by several people , there is no need to " get to " anarchy anyway , since it 's already here and therefore cannot be escaped .
Writes Cuzán :
… a “ third party ” arrangement for society is non-existent among those who exercise the power of government themselves .
In other words , there is no “ third party ” to make and enforce judgments among the individual members who make up the third party itself .
The rulers still remain in a state of anarchy vis -à - vis each other .
They settle disputes among themselves , without regard for a Government ( an entity outside themselves ) .
Anarchy still exists .
( Emphasis in original . )
Indeed !
A Funny Thing Happened Along the Road to Ancapistan
In response to my " Would You Push the Button to End the State ? " essay , I received several notes from an LRC reader in Somalia .
As an aside , that a person in far off Somalia thinks my modest musings are worthy of not only reading , but also thoughtfully responding to , is immensely flattering and intellectually rewarding .
( Interesting fact : The Internet is awesome . )
In response to my " Teaching Freedom Early ? " newsfeed , I read a not - so - complimentary comment on the JBS website .
That a person thinks I need to " get a life " and feels compelled to say so publicly , albeit anonymously , helps to balance out any flattery - induced - ego - boost I might experience from the example above .
( Interesting fact : The Internet presents a low barrier - to - entry , which when combined with the ability to remain anonymous , sometimes makes people brazen and occasionally insulting .
Then again , I 've noted that phenomenon before . )
The main issue of the first respondent 's e-mails , which covered quite a bit of philosophical and political ground , resolved to :
Is minarchy between the current ( statist ) condition and full - fledged anarchy ?
And if this is true , why not start with getting closer to minarchy as a strategic means to achieving full - fledged market anarchism ?
In contrast , the main issue of the second respondent 's comments seemed to be that I was a pseudo - intellectual with too much time on my hands .
( Frankly , I can't argue with that ! )
The first respondent felt that the primary questions were about " day 1 " not " day 1000 . "
That is , he felt that few could reasonably argue with the logical superiority of market anarchism in the long term .
Rather , he asked , " What about the short term ? "
He posed several rather typical questions about moving from statism to anarchy .
Among them :
How does one privatize the existing ( and quite large ) stockpile of weaponry ?
What of the courts ?
Who polices and locks up criminals ?
How can one enforce contracts , since the right to seize property requires police and accounting ?
Who oversees a system that can facilitate assets : property and liquidity ?
Who regulates Natural Monopolies ?
I reckon these are valid questions .
Certainly , I hear them often enough .
Not surprisingly , there have been a plethora of answers to these types of questions as well .
Despite my attempts to answer some of them , the best primer to these issues might be Roderick Long 's " Libertarian Anarchism : Responses to Ten Objections , " which covers some of these issues , and others , in excellent philosophical and historical detail .
The Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single … Question ?
One of my radical libertarian colleagues has a pet theory that he has shared with me several times .
He thinks that few people , if anyone , ever follows the links in a piece like this .
Given my own reading habits , I tend to agree , and am therefore tempted to extensively block quote from Long ( and others ) below , turning this essay into a type of one - stop - shop for answers to these recurring " how - to " questions about market anarchism .
You know what though ?
I wo n't .
Actually , I refuse to do so .
The reason was provided some time ago by another colleague of mine , Manuel Lora .
He writes :
The problem starts when the “ viability ” of freedom becomes contingent upon the “ answer ” to those questions .
That is , if the “ right ” and fully satisfactory answer is not achieved ( ignoring that no such answer could ever be 100 % correct ) , then somehow the desire for liberty is lessened and statism creeps back in .
Lora continues :
“ How would roads work ?
How can a flu pandemic be prevented ?
What about organ trafficking ?
Would we need car insurance ?
How much ?
Who would [ we ] determine that ?
What if drugs are cheap and widely available ?
I do n't want people to have AK - 47s !
What about licensing and standards ?
If everyone can make their own money , then it 's going to be chaos ! ”
Lora then answers the question :
So let me answer the question as clearly as I can .
I am not a socialist !
Lora is noting , quite correctly , that the answers to every conceivable implementation issue cannot be deduced a priori .
Simply put , if central planning worked , there probably would n't be any market anarchists !
I 'll go Lora one better regarding these types of questions and any other similar questions that anyone is tempted to send me via e-mail in the future .
My answer , as bad as it might sound , is : How should I know ?!
Besides , as my second respondent implies , anyone who endeavors to answer every conceivable question about the future not only has too much time on his hands , but fancies himself a version of Kreskin on steroids as well !
( If Shrubya can raise a tragic lack of intellectual curiosity to high art , I can get a pass for not caring once in a while , no ? )
Granted , discussing and attempting to answer such questions can be very interesting .
( Full disclosure : I 'll likely be involved in such a discussion before week 's end ! )
Honestly though , I do n't really give a large rat turd who oversees a system that facilitates assets in a stateless society .
I rarely worry about regulation of natural resources or monopolies after the EPA is closed .
The rather obvious fact that I 've only a faint clue to the answers to such questions is just icing on the cake .
What does concern me is individual liberty .
Luckily , it is upon this foundation that everything else is based anyway .
As an aside , was the fact that few could accurately predict where the newly - freed slaves would work or live sufficient justification for keeping them chained up ?
I do n't want to be stolen from , enslaved , or unfairly imprisoned .
I do n't want to steal from anyone , enslave anyone , or imprison anyone , particularly for a behavior , that while possibly unwise , infringes upon no one else .
I believe in private property .
Just because you and a couple of other folks supposedly voted to steal that property from me does n't change the morality of the action .
( If it does , then this whole discussion is moot . )
If we start there — with the argument from morality —
I 'm willing to take my chances that the polar bears , the Rain Forest , and the planet will survive just fine .
Given the amounts of my own money and time I 've voluntarily invested , I 'm also pretty confident that the poor and the sick will be cared for as well .
I 'll even admit that some issues with which mankind might be faced in the future might be large enough to require cooperation .
Here 's the thing .
Cooperation does n't come out of the barrel of a gun .
Is it too much to ask that the self - righteous busy bodies spend only their own money ( or money given voluntarily to them ) and stop making war on the rest of us ?
Fighting the Battle in the Locale that Houses It
A while back , as I spoke to another father at one of my son 's Boy Scout camp - outs , something he said made me think .
He had just asked me which of the contenders for president I 'd be supporting and I had answered , " They 're all lying , thieving , killers , so who cares ? " or words to that effect .
To his credit , he admitted that I had a point .
( The number of times this has happened is low enough for me to think that not everyone has figured this out , but I 've already beaten that horse to within an inch of its life . )
He then wondered aloud : " How does one remain hopeful for the future , after such a conclusion ? "
That 's an interesting question .
I do n't think cynicism is the inevitable result of deducing that megalomaniacs , interested in lining their own pockets and not much else , run the State .
In fact , I remain convinced that by realizing where the battle will ultimately be fought and won — in my head — I do n't have to become cynical at all .
Just because it becomes apparent that the lying , cheating , stealing , buttheads I used to think were " my leaders " are just , well , lying , cheating , stealing buttheads is no reason for sadness .
Ridding oneself of delusion is a liberating experience , not a depressing one !
A clue to why what we think is more important than what we experience comes from Victor Frankl , who noted that the battle is in the mind when he said :
We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others , giving away their last piece of bread .
They may have been few in number , but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing : the last of the human freedoms — to choose one ’s attitude in any given set of circumstances , to choose one ’s own way .
( Emphasis in original . )
The battle then is won or lost not without but within .
As someone said long ago , " What happens to you is way less important than what happens in you . "
The battle for freedom and liberty is fought by the individual with himself and his beliefs , not against faceless bureaucrats in D.C. or elsewhere .
Maybe Zhuge Liang offered a further clue with :
Those who are skilled in combat do not become angered , those who are skilled at winning do not become afraid .
Thus the wise win before they fight , while the ignorant fight to win .
Conclusion
My philosophy :
Win the battle for freedom in your own head , against your own ignorance , first .
Enter the battlefield of ideas and share them with others , if you like , soon thereafter .
Worry about who pays for the roads in Libertopia much later , if ever .
Trust a bureaucrat , even a well - armed bureaucrat , with the future , never .
( That complicated pre-existing conditions will have to be dealt with is actually rather exciting ! )
If what I say here has not convinced you , that 's okay .
In fact , I 'm pleased .
I do n't want to convince you .
I want you to convince you .
If I can convince you about market anarchism today , some other A - hole can convince you about statism tomorrow .
I 'd rather have you make you own decisions — with or without help from my pedestrian erudition — and go from there , voluntarily .
I 'll still take my chances .
Will you ?

A way to livecode scheme visually , by plugging in and tearing off bits of code .
Heavily inspired by this and scratch
Try it out here :
Remember last week when I mentioned the Microsoft Web Platform Installer ?
It 's an bootstrapper that gets you setup for free web development , all in a single application .
It 'll setup IIS7 , get you Visual Studio , SQL Server , .NET , etc. Cool .
And there was much rejoicing ( except XP folks , sorry . )
Well , the team just released the Web Application Installer ( Beta ) .
Get it ?
First Platform , now Applications .
What does it do ?
Well , how about a screenshot .
Yes , that 's Drupal in there .
And PHPBB .
And WordPress .
Sweet .
I 've talked to the team , and they 've promised that DasBlog is next in line to get in that list o' applications .
It 's a * ahem * gem of an application .
Well , it 's a great start .
Open Source , baby , baby .
The installer knows about prerequisites , although the app can't currently install them for you .
However , it 'll point you to all the correct places to get what you need .
When you 've satisfied the prerequisites , it 'll setup IIS for you , prompt you for application - specific configuration and you 're up and running .
It 'll also validate the configuration so you 'll know ahead of time if the app will work .
There are people at Microsoft do care about Open Source .
I 'm telling you guys and gals , we 're turning this ship around .
Slowly , but we are .
Oh , by the way , the Web Application Installer uses and ships ICSharpCode .
SharpZipLib , which is GPL'ed Open Source .
It has an exception , however :
" .. gives you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable , regardless of the license terms of these independent modules , and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice , provided that you also meet , for each linked independent module , the terms and conditions of the license of that module .
An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library "
Which is legal Open Source license speak for " link on , brother , link on . "
There you go , Microsoft ships an app with a mostly GPL 'ed library .
Madness .
Cats and Dogs , living together , mass hysteria !
Go check them out :
They require Vista or Windows Server , x86 or x64 and you 'll need admin rights .

DOYLESTOWN , Pa. ( AP ) 
A former elementary school teacher near Philadelphia has been sentenced to home confinement and probation for leaving threatening notes around the school .
Forty - six - year - old Susan Romanyszyn was sentenced Thursday to two years ' home arrest and 20 years ' probation .
She has cancer , and the judge who sentenced her says that if her health improves she will be moved to jail .
Romanyszyn was convicted in June of 11 counts of making terroristic threats .
Authorities say she orchestrated a campaign of fear at Longstreth Elementary School last year because she was angry over a classroom assignment .
She denies making the threats and says she was framed .

The modern obsession with celebrity started in 18th - century Britain with obituaries of unusual people published in what served as the gossip sheets of the era , an English literature scholar says .
Some researchers think the phenomenon of celebrity was born with the 19th - century Romantic movement in art , music and literature ( think of works by Chopin , J.M.W. Turner and Edgar Allen Poe ) .
Instead , Elizabeth Barry of the University of Warwick in England claims the modern public fascination with celebrities can be traced back to the rise of newspapers and magazines and the popularity of the obituaries in the 18th century .
" Different kinds of deaths came to be commemorated and you did n’t have to be something like a military hero or be a political player or be some sort of high person in society to get public commemoration on your death , " Barry told LiveScience .
" I was interested in looking at that process . "
Widely read
Obituaries were one of the most - read sections of newspapers and magazines of the 1700s .
They were intended to provide an account of the life of someone who had recently died as a way of illustrating how the life you led would be rewarded or punished in death .
However , the rise in popularity of obituaries actually came because the deceased were regarded as objects of scandal and public fascination — in other words , Great Britain ’s first celebrities .
These periodicals that published obituaries started out as religious pamphlets aimed at reminding people that they should be very pious because they could die at any moment , Barry said .
Later , they became more secular , grab - bags featuring obituaries , political news and essays .
At first , only kings and famous artists and writers got obits , but later publications also featured death write - ups for eccentrics , performers , sportsmen and others who previously were not seen as worthy of a written memorial , Barry said .
The periodicals were extremely popular , with circulations in the tens of thousands , which was a lot back then , she said .
" They tried to meet the needs of a new urban audience where the lower - middle class and middle class were rubbing around in the same spaces as aristocrats , " Barry said .
" It was trying to speak to both and it was kind of uneasy .
It got a lot of flack and was seen to be too populist and low - brow . "
For instance , the Gentleman ’s Magazine in 1789 gave an account of the life of Isaac Tarrat , a man known to hire himself out to impersonate a doctor and tell fortunes in a fur cap , a large white beard and a worn damask night gown .
Another subject , Peter Marsh of Dublin , was made famous by his convictions about his own death in 1740 .
After being hit by a mad horse which died soon after , Marsh convinced himself that he would also go mad and die .
The Gentleman ’s Magazine reported that he duly died " of a conceit that he was mad . "
Short - lived fame
Barry said : " Celebrity — short - lived fame — became a feature of British society , and the untimely or dramatic death began to create as well as test this new kind of fame .
The obituary plays a key role in this process and represents an important mechanism for introducing modern notions of fame and celebrity into British society . "
Obituaries also were published in similar , though less widely read , periodicals in the colonies that became the United States , Barry said .
These obits were written in a Puritan framework , focusing on the way people died , perhaps with " a bible in their hand , " she said .
In either nation , obituaries allow death to become a way of creating a bereaved community that transcends the social divisions of the past , or more recently , divisions of race , Barry said .
" It ’s a way of bringing the country together , citizens together , such as when the wife of William of Orange dies , or Princess Diana dies in the 20th century , they are all mourning this same woman and she is very much one of the people , " she said .
" There is a sense of an imagined community of people created through the media , and death is something that cuts through the perceived differences . "
Barry ’s research is detailed in the current issue of the International Journal of Cultural Studies .
NEW YORK , Dec. 14 ( UPI ) -- New York - area residents with the last name Sinatra say having the same last name as a late celebrity is not as great as you might think .
Francesco Sinatra Sr. of Staten Island alleged TV actor Tony Danza was so insistent to meet a possible relative of the late crooner Frank Sinatra that he continually pressured him in 2005 , the New York Post reported Sunday .

Francis A. Sinatra , a cousin of Francesco's , said his famous last name nearly stopped him from attending Iona College .
" My mother had sent a check , and I never heard back from them , " the 55 - year - old said .
" My mother called , and whoever she spoke to said they had just disregarded the application because they thought it was a joke . "
The Post said while New Jersey native Frank P. Sinatra Jr. got a free meal at New York 's Rainbow Room thanks to his last name , he left quickly before eatery workers learned he was not related to the music great .
" They said , ' We can't take your money .
You 're grandfather was like a god here , ' " Sinatra Jr. said .
" I looked at my girlfriend and said , ' We 've got to get out of here right now . ' "

… to suppose that the value of a common stock is determined purely by a corporation ’s earnings discounted by the relevant interest rates and adjusted for the marginal tax rate is to forget that people have burned witches , gone to war on a whim , risen in defense of Joseph Stalin and believed Orson Welles when he told them over the radio that the Martians had landed .
~ James Grant
An investment operation is one which , upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return .
Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative .
~ Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd
In general , Americans feel pretty darned smart when it comes to handling money .
Since the stock market crash of October 19 , 1987 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gone from 1,738.40 to a March 14 , 2005 closing price of 10,804.51 .
Granted , many people lost money when the dot.com and telecom bubbles burst , yet Americans remain unshaken in their collective belief that staying in the stock market will make them wealthy in the long run .
To be sure , you will hear the mantra that " stocks always go up in the long run " from diverse sources ranging from star Wall Street analysts ( such as Abbey Joseph Cohen ) to your next - door neighbor .
What a dream world America has become where we can read the business pages , watch CNBC , " invest " in can ’t - lose stocks , and then grow wealthy , over time , without much thought or effort .
When examining this prevalent mindset , using Graham and Dodd ’s distinction between investing and speculation , I must conclude that most Americans are speculators not investors .
This position is easy to defend .
An important aspect of investing is to have the mindset of a business owner .
In 1983 , Warren Buffett conveyed 13 owner - related business principles for Berkshire Hathaway ’s shareholders to embrace .
The first principle is potent yet simple in that Warren Buffett and Berkshire ’s vice chairman — Charlie Munger — view Berkshire Hathaway " … as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets . "
Mr. Buffett further explains that
Charlie and I hope that you do not think of yourself as merely owning a piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily and that is a candidate for sale when some economic or political event makes you nervous .
We hope you instead visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely , much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family .
Indeed , having an ownership mindset is a step toward becoming an investor , yet , on a stand - alone basis , does not quite get you there .
For if an individual is truly an investor in a business , he would have a basic understanding of its operations , its assets and liabilities , its profitability , and its cash flow .
Moreover , an investor would quickly grasp the power of the following quote from Ludwig von Mises ’ magnum opus Human Action :
Monetary calculation is the guiding star of action under the social system of division of labor .
It is the compass of the man embarking upon production .
He calculates in order to distinguish the remunerative lines of production from the unprofitable ones , those of which the sovereign consumers are likely to approve from those which they are likely to disapprove .
Every single step of entrepreneurial activities is subject to scrutiny by monetary calculation .
The premeditation of planned action becomes commercial precalculation of expected costs and expected proceeds .
The retrospective establishment of the outcome of past action becomes accounting of profit and loss .
( Emphasis added )
A tool businessmen use to determine the success or failure of past actions is a financial statement .
A businessman and an investor should have a firm understanding of all the entries in a company ’s balance sheet , the income statement , and in the statement of cash flows ( which are the three key components of a financial statement ) .
Via analyzing the company ’s financial statement , a businessman can directly correlate whether his company ’s capital base ( i.e. , the company ’s net worth as reflected in the balance sheet ) is expanding or contracting depending upon if the company turned a profit or made a loss .
Such monetary calculation assists a businessman in deciding to maintain or change a business plan based upon satisfying the ever - sovereign consumer .
The analysis does n’t stop here .
Businessmen and investors will also take a keen interest in deriving the following ( among others ) from the financial statement :
Working capital
Quick ratio
Liquidity
Debt to equity ratio ( i.e. , leverage )
Return on equity
Total debt service coverage
Inventory turnover
Accounts receivable turnover
This may look complicated and , to a certain extent , it is .
Yet , to be a true investor , such " thorough analysis " — as mentioned above by Graham and Dodd — is essential .
Conversely , if someone cannot read a financial statement ( i.e. , a balance sheet , an income statement , and a statement of cash flows ) , then when it comes to purchasing common stock in publicly traded companies , such a financially illiterate person is inherently a speculator , not an investor .
After all , such a speculator has no idea how to value a business and merely owns a " piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily . "
With financial illiteracy being the overwhelming norm in America ( let ’s face it , public schools have miserably failed at teaching basic accounting , finance , and economics ) , I believe I have successfully defended my position that most American " investors " are simply speculators .
Now to bring a bit of politics into the picture here .
President Bush is touting an " ownership society " in which Social Security reform is a cornerstone — thereby allowing for personal Social Security accounts where individuals can " invest " funds into the stock market .
I would counter that President Bush is , not surprisingly , abusing the English language .
After all , with a financially illiterate populace ( thanks again public schools ) , I assert that President Bush is essentially doing nothing different from CNBC , the stock brokerage firms , and the Wall Street Journal in that he is promoting a " speculator society . "
Of course , the key difference here is that the federal government will be coercing Americans to speculate at gunpoint .
For those who feel that they fit the mold of being a speculator , yet want to make the effort to become an investor , there is hope .
Let me give you a crash course .
The first step to take is to read Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd ’s classic book Security Analysis .
This book will teach you how to read a financial statement .
The next step is to read The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham .
As Warren Buffett stated , it is " By far the best book on investing ever written . "
Enough said .
Finally , you must gain an understanding of Austrian economics .
Two excellent introductory books are Economics for Real People : An Introduction to the Austrian School by Gene Callahan and The Austrian Theory of the Trade Cycle and Other Essays produced by the Ludwig von Mises Institute .
Keep in mind that it was the " Austrians " who correctly identified and explained the dot.com and telecom bubbles that left so many stock portfolios in tatters .
By combining Graham and Dodd with Austrian economics , you will have the tools necessary to become a successful investor .
After all , long - term wealth accumulation requires a great deal of thought and effort — not the opposite as promoted by America ’s financial pop culture .

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
China has called upon rich nations to abandon their “ unsustainable lifestyle ” to fight climate change and expand help to poor nations bearing the brunt of worsening droughts and rising sea levels .

This year , China surpassed the U.S to become the largest emitter of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas from industry , power plants and vehicles lifting global temperatures .
Unlike other developing nations ( such as India and Brazil ) China has not taken an active role in the discussions against global warming .
Even now it is against binding caps on its emissions .
However Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has announced that China will look to curbing pollution if developed countries commit to clean energy technology transfers and funding .
China is promoting a plan to dramatically boost the flow of greenhouse gas - cutting technology from wealthy economies to developing countries .
According to Zou Ji , a professor at Renmin University in Beijing involved in shaping this plan , China proposes that developed countries devote a percentage of their GDP to the technology transfer fund and to other global warming initiatives in developing countries .
This would result in a total of $ 284 billion a year if members of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development ( OECD ) paid up based on the size of their economies in 2007 .
Premier
Wen says that the global financial crisis should not distract the international community from fighting global warming .
China ’s economic interests definitely appear to be tied to protecting the environment .
The Xinhua News Agency has just announced a massive domestic economic stimulus package worth 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) through 2010 .
Investment will be made in infrastructure , social welfare and environmental protection .

The right to carry arms is enshrined in the US constitution
In a quiet side street not far from where the Texas freeway system knits the sprawling suburbs of Houston into something like a city centre , business is booming at the Top Gun shooting range .
Recession is not biting here in the oil - rich Energy Capital of the World as it is in the rest of the United States - but that is not the only reason why it is difficult to find a parking space outside Top Gun towards the end of the working day .
America 's gun owners are worried that the incoming Obama administration , which is coming to power offering hope and change , is going to mean something rather different for them - restriction and regulation .
So they are rushing to buy certain types of weapons in the dying weeks of the Bush years .
Sales of military - style assault weapons ( like the Russian - designed AK - 47 ) which are considered the likeliest targets for future curbs have increased by 50 % in some areas .
My son knows what I 'm going to do - I 'm going to shoot to kill
Jessica Inside Top Gun I met Jessica who was completing the 10 - hour , $ 148 course which would allow her to carry a concealed firearm in Texas .
Jessica is a single mum who had been putting off doing the course and had now finally decided to complete it before any further restrictions were placed in her way .
She was clear about why she was doing it .
" Being a single mum , I can't imagine not having a gun for home protection because that makes me a more confident parent , knowing that if someone intrudes into my home I know exactly what to do and my son knows what I 'm going to do .
I 'm going to shoot to kill . "
Cultural divide
It is not quite what Mr Obama meant by change , or indeed economic stimulus from the extra sales of weapons and courses , but it is one of the more revealing responses to his victory which the last few weeks have brought .
The Top Gun shooting gallery could not exist in Europe
It is a reminder that Barack Obama 's win was not just a victory of optimism and energy over age and staleness , it was also a victory across a cultural divide , of one sort of America over another .
A gun-lovin ' , largely rural and conservative vision of the US was clearly defeated by a brand of big city liberalism which fears or despises firearms and wants to do something about America 's love affair with them .
The American right to bear arms is enshrined in the second amendment of the constitution , so there is a limit to what even a Democratic president supported by majorities in both the House and the Senate could do it about , even if he were minded to .
Any legislation would really tinker around the edges of the right , restricting the purchase of certain types of assault weapon , and certain sizes of ammunition cartridge .
And Mr Obama , although he did not talk much about gun control , did try to re-assure the gun community in a speech in October that he was not going to take their shotguns , rifles or handguns .
He 's done everything in his power to restrict those privileges that we have
Jeff Trometer on Mr Obama
The gun lobby , though , prefers to remember the " Bittergate " episode when Mr Obama was secretly recorded at an off - the - record fundraiser talking about how in certain areas Americans clung to their guns and their religion out of bitterness at how the country was changing around them .
The gun lobby sees that as representing Mr Obama 's true thoughts and intentions and is on its guard .
Jeff Trometer , one of the staff at Top Gun , is deeply suspicious of the new president , claiming : " He does not like guns , he does not like gun owners and he 's done everything in his power to restrict those privileges that we have . "
' Fundamental freedom ' Top Gun is the kind of business that simply could not exist in Europe - the staff wear holstered handguns both in the shop and on the shooting range .
Gun ownership ensures a balance of power , say enthusiasts A souvenir T - shirt carries a kind of spoof of a multiple - choice government form with two boxes marked Gun Owner and Gun Victim - underneath , it says , " Choose One " .
No area of American daily life makes this country feel more foreign to Europeans - business is brisk at the range and plenty of doctors , lawyers and office workers stop off on the way home from work to sharpen their skills and to relieve a little stress .
European tourists often come too , lured by the chance to fire a machine - gun or a pistol under strict supervision .
But , while many Americans would strongly disagree , gun enthusiasts see this as a struggle not about the right to target - shooting or even hunting in the wild but a dispute in which something much more profound is at stake .
They believe the constitutional guarantee of the people 's right to bear arms means that the balance of power between the government and the governed is different in America from anywhere else in the developed world .
Mr Trometer put it like this : " If you start tearing at our fundamental freedoms and you take this right away and then maybe someone else comes along and says , ' You really do n't have the right to speak your mind ' .
" All of a sudden this framework of rights as a citizen of this country ... there 's nothing left . "
The Obama administration , its hands full with recession and global financial crisis , has given no indication that it intends to take on the gun lobby .
If it does eventually decide to confront the issue then there is no doubt it will find the gun owners of America ready , as always , for a fight .

5 Rolling Bridge ( UK ) : The Bridge that Curls Up on Itself
Designed by Heatherwick Studio , the award - winning Rolling Bridge is located Paddington Basin , London .
Rather than a conventional opening bridge mechanism , consisting of a single rigid element that lifts to let boats pass , the Rolling Bridge gets out of the way by curling up until its two ends touch .
While in its horizontal position , the bridge is a normal , inconspicuous steel and timber footbridge ; fully open , it forms a circle on one bank of the water that bears little resemblance to its former self .
Twelve metres long , the bridge is made in eight steel and timber sections , and is made to curl by hydraulic rams set into the handrail between each section .
6 Oliveira Bridge ( Brazil ) : World ’s First X - shaped Cable Stayed Bridge with two crossed lanes

The bridge is over 50 meters long and it was first built in 1894 during the Qing Dynasty over 100 years ago .
However , the original structure was destroyed in a big fire in 1959 and the one visitors see today was a recreation finished in 1964 .
It is a pure wooden architecture made up of pillars , purlins and balusters of different sizes and shapes .
The body of the bridge is divided to three tiers , the largest one in the middle take the shape of a traditional Chinese drum tower .

The 800 - ft long bridge has a 28 - ft clearance when closed but raises in the centre to a maximum clearance of 140 - ft that allows ships to pass down the Thames .
Back in the days when goods were moved by sea instead of air the bridge was raised around 50 times daily .
Tower Bridge took 432 workers 8 years to build .
During that time they sank 70,000 tonnes of concrete into 2 huge piers , lowered 2 counterbalanced bascules into place each weighing 1,000 tonnes and then clad the whole bridge in Portland stone and Cornish granite to disguise the 11,000 tonnes of steel beneath .
9 Magdeburg Water Bridge ( Germany ) : Europe ’s Largest Water Bridge

The American economy has hit a new low .
Home values are plummeting , bills are rising and job layoffs have every worker concerned .
If we cared more about people than money , we would not be having what happened today , Suze Orman said .
Factor in the sudden bankruptcy of 158 - year - old investment bank Lehman Brothers , an $ 85 billion federal bailout of insurance giant American International Group Inc. , Bank of America 's quick purchase of Merrill Lynch and rumors of future sales and the rejection of a $ 700 billion government bailout , it 's no wonder Americans are worried about their money .
Are you sick to your stomach and scared out of your mind ?
Money expert Suze Orman is here to explain what 's really going on -- and how you can protect yourself .
" We have built an entire economy on lies and deceit , " she says .
" It 's like building a home or an entire building on a sinkhole .
You have a foundation , supposedly .
But a little crack , if something goes wrong -- a little earthquake , a tremor -- and it starts to open , everything starts to fall down and ... that is exactly what has happened in the United States of America . "
Suze says the current financial downturn started all the way at the top of banks , mortgage companies and brokerage firms .
" There was greed at the top -- serious greed , " Suze says .
" When you have stocks , you have individual companies that want to make money .
And [ CEOs ] want to make more money because the more money they make , the more their compensation is , the more their stock price goes up . "

How to weather a financial storm
These companies made money by selling investments like mortgages to people who could n't afford them , Suze says .
" Have you all ever wondered , ' Why does Suze Orman say people first , then money , then things ? ' " she says .
" It means if we cared about people more than we cared about money , we would not be having what happened today , because the people who run the corporations , if they had cared about all of you , they would n't have created loans that you could n't afford . "
A lack of regulations also contributed to the downfall -- and Suze says there were n't more rules established because they would cut into the bottom line .
" The more money the brokerage firms , the mortgage companies and all those companies made , the better the economy was .
Because if they lent you money , you had money now that you could spend , " she says .
" When the economy looks great , everybody feels like , ' Oh , we 're doing good . '
The stock market goes up .
When the stock market goes up , the price of shares go up .
The compensation for the CEOs go up . "
As things progressed , Suze says many people fell under Wall Street 's spell .
" A lot of you have built your personal financial foundation on deceit and lies .
You bought a home that you could n't afford ...
You spent money like it was going out of style and it was n't your money to spend , because why ?
They were borrowing it , " Suze says .
" When you borrow money , you leverage yourself .
The United States of America leveraged itself so high that when it started to come down , the whole thing now has fallen down . "
Oprah.com : 6 deadly sins of home equity
The recent billion - dollar bankruptcies are going to make things more difficult for the average person , Suze says .
For example , Suze says securing credit may be nearly impossible .
" The chances of you being able to really get a mortgage , a car loan , even student loans for your children , may be far more difficult than you have any idea , " she says .
" If you currently have credit cards that you 're not using that have open lines of credit on it , probably you will see them close down . "
In terms of investments , Suze says people close to retirement may need to reconsider .
" Many people now have seen their 401 ( k ) either cut in half [ or ] down 40 percent , " Suze says .
" [ People ] may have to work a lot longer than they planned , may not have enough money to generate income to send their kids to school . "
Homeowners will also feel a burden , Suze says .
As people lose their jobs , fewer homeowners can afford to pay their mortgages and property taxes .
" The less amount of people that are paying property taxes , the less your state has to pay the firemen , the police department , " Suze says .
" The more your property taxes go up , the less you can afford your mortgage . "
With all of these economic puzzle pieces in play , Suze says she would n't be surprised if we switched to a cash economy -- which means buying only what you can afford now .
" Banks are n't going to want to give you money where they 're afraid that you might not pay them back , " Suze says .
" I personally think that 's a great thing . "
So what can you do to protect yourself ?
" People , stop living the financial lies that you have been living , " Suze says .
" If you do n't have the money to pay for something , can you just not buy it ?
Can you wait ?
Can we start looking at keeping our cars for 10 years rather than getting a new one every three ? "
Oprah.com : Are you protected financially ?
Tammy and Tim are a couple who asked for help cleaning their financial house .
Like many Americans , they say they have no health insurance and owe more on their home than what it 's worth .
The couple also says they have no life insurance to provide for their two children should tragedy strike .
Since
Tim was laid off from his job last spring , the couple has been living largely off credit cards -- and owe more than $ 90,000 across 29 different cards .
Tammy says the bills added up before they knew it .
" We are taking every bit of money that we do make and putting it toward our credit card payments .
We 're very proud people and never have been late in 20 years on our payments , " she says .
" We tend to take our cash , pay our credit cards and then use our credit cards to pay our mortgage and put gas in our car and feed our kids . "
Tim says he and Tammy have no idea what to do once their credit is maxed out .
" Right now is where we really need the most help , " he says .
" We 're open for any advice that we can get . "
Suze has some tough love for this struggling couple .
After looking at Tammy and Tim 's finances , Suze says the couple falls $ 2,000 short each month .
With property taxes , utilities and the mortgage payment together , Suze estimates it costs at least $ 3,000 a month to live in their current home .
Suze 's suggestion is a harsh truth for Tammy and Tim .
" I love you enough to tell you what you need to do to not only save yourselves , but to save your children so there 's enough money then to buy them health insurance , for them to have life insurance , " Suze says .
" You need to sell your home . "
Tim says he 's concerned about putting his house for sale in a depressed market .
" If you had just been honest a year ago , two years ago , that you could n't afford the mortgage payments -- you could n't afford the lifestyle that you were living -- you would not be in this situation here today , " Suze says .
" If you get rid of the house , you will start to live an honest life without lies .
You 'll start to make more money .
You 'll feel better . "
Tim and Tammy want to know what their next step should be .
" Let 's put the house on the market to sell .
Let 's see what it should be priced at .
Talk to your bank about possibly having to do a short sale and just see what happens from there .
That is our first step toward honesty , " Suze says .
It wo n't be easy , but Tammy says they 're ready .
" Whether we 've been naive or not , it 's a reality , and now we 're finally seeing the light and realizing that it's a change we need to make , " she says .
Cash - strapped couples are n't the only ones concerned by the country 's economic crisis .
Millions of aging Americans who have money in retirement accounts have seen their nest eggs shrink in recent weeks .
Suze reveals which people really need to rethink their plans for the future .
If you 're 10 to 20 years away from retirement , Suze says there 's no reason to panic .
" As long as you are invested in good quality mutual funds , diversified across the board , as this all goes down , you 're buying more shares , " she says .
" The more shares you buy , eventually , when it turns around ... the more money you 'll make . "
The situation is more serious for men and women planning to leave the workforce in the next year .
Suze says if you recently lost money in the stock market , there is n't time to recover your losses .
" The harsh reality there is what ?
You are going to have to work more , " she says .
" For something to recover -- even at an 8 or 9 percent annual average rate of return -- it could take you 12 years to get back there . "
Oprah.com : How you can prepare for retirement
If you need to start dipping into your savings in the next 10 years , Suze says it 's best to take your money out of the stock market and invest in CDs and treasury bills or bonds .
" For those people who need the money to be safe and sound , you need it to generate income now .
You have to come out [ of the stock market ] at this point , " she says .

The Article : Block the Vote —
Will the GOP ’s campaign to deter new voters and discard Democratic ballots determine the next president ? by Robert Kennedy and Greg Palast in Rolling Stone .
The Text :
These days , the old west rail hub of Las Vegas , New Mexico , is little more than a dusty economic dead zone amid a boneyard of bare mesas .
In national elections , the town overwhelmingly votes Democratic : More than 80 percent of all residents are Hispanic , and one in four lives below the poverty line .
On February 5th , the day of the Super Tuesday caucus , a school - bus driver named Paul Maez arrived at his local polling station to cast his ballot .
To his surprise , Maez found that his name had vanished from the list of registered voters , thanks to a statewide effort to deter fraudulent voting .
For Maez , the shock was especially acute :
He is the supervisor of elections in Las Vegas .
Maez was not alone in being denied his right to vote .
On Super Tuesday , one in nine Democrats who tried to cast ballots in New Mexico found their names missing from the registration lists .
The numbers were even higher in precincts like Las Vegas , where nearly 20 percent of the county ’s voters were absent from the rolls .
With their status in limbo , the voters were forced to cast “ provisional ” ballots , which can be reviewed and discarded by election officials without explanation .
On Super Tuesday , more than half of all provisional ballots cast were thrown out statewide .
This November , what happened to Maez will happen to hundreds of thousands of voters across the country .
In state after state , Republican operatives — the party ’s elite commandos of bare - knuckle politics — are wielding new federal legislation to systematically disenfranchise Democrats .
If this year ’s race is as close as the past two elections , the GOP ’s nationwide campaign could be large enough to determine the presidency in November .
“ I do n’t think the Democrats get it , ” says John Boyd , a voting - rights attorney in Albuquerque who has taken on the Republican Party for impeding access to the ballot .
“ All these new rules and games are turning voting into an obstacle course that could flip the vote to the GOP in half a dozen states . ”
Suppressing the vote has long been a cornerstone of the GOP ’s electoral strategy .
Shortly before the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 , Paul Weyrich — a principal architect of today ’s Republican Party — scolded evangelicals who believed in democracy .
“ Many of our Christians have what I call the ‘ goo goo ’ syndrome — good government , ” said Weyrich , who co-founded Moral Majority with Jerry Falwell .
“ They want everybody to vote .
I do n’t want everybody to vote .
. . .
As a matter of fact , our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down . ”
Today , Weyrich ’s vision has become a national reality .
Since 2003 , according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission , at least 2.7 million new voters have had their applications to register rejected .
In addition , at least 1.6 million votes were never counted in the 2004 election — and the commission ’s own data suggests that the real number could be twice as high .
To purge registration rolls and discard ballots , partisan election officials used a wide range of pretexts , from “ unreadability ” to changes in a voter ’s signature .
And this year , thanks to new provisions of the Help America Vote Act , the number of discounted votes could surge even higher .
Passed in 2002 , HAVA was hailed by leaders in both parties as a reform designed to avoid a repeat of the 2000 debacle in Florida that threw the presidential election to the U.S. Supreme Court .
The measure set standards for voting systems , created an independent commission to oversee elections , and ordered states to provide provisional ballots to voters whose eligibility is challenged at the polls .
But from the start , HAVA was corrupted by the involvement of Republican superlobbyist Jack Abramoff , who worked to cram the bill with favors for his clients .
( Both Abramoff and a primary author of HAVA , former Rep. Bob Ney , were imprisoned for their role in the conspiracy . )
In practice , many of the “ reforms ” created by HAVA have actually made it harder for citizens to cast a ballot and have their vote counted .
In case after case , Republican election officials at the local and state level have used the rules to give GOP candidates an edge on Election Day by creating new barriers to registration , purging legitimate names from voter rolls , challenging voters at the polls and discarding valid ballots .
To justify this battery of new voting impediments , Republicans cite an alleged upsurge in voting fraud .
Indeed , the U.S. - attorney scandal that resulted in the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales began when the White House fired federal prosecutors who resisted political pressure to drum up nonexistent cases of voting fraud against Democrats .
“ They wanted some splashy pre-election indictments that would scare these alleged hordes of illegal voters away , ” says David Iglesias , a U.S. attorney for New Mexico who was fired in December 2006 .
“ We took over 100 complaints and investigated for almost two years — but I did n’t find one prosecutable case of voter fraud in the entire state of New Mexico . ”
There ’s a reason Iglesias could n’t find any evidence of fraud : Individual voters almost never try to cast illegal ballots .
The Bush administration ’s main point person on “ ballot protection ” has been Hans von Spakovsky , a former Justice Department attorney who has advised states on how to use HAVA to erect more barriers to voting .
Appointed to the Federal Election Commission by Bush , von Spakovsky has suggested that voter rolls may be stuffed with 5 million illegal aliens .
In fact , studies have repeatedly shown that voter fraud is extremely rare .
According to a recent analysis by Lorraine Minnite , an expert on voting crime at Barnard College , federal courts found only 24 voters guilty of fraud from 2002 to 2005 , out of hundreds of millions of votes cast .
“ The claim of widespread voter fraud , ” Minnite says , “ is itself a fraud . ”
Allegations of voter fraud are only the latest rationale the GOP has used to disenfranchise voters — especially blacks , Hispanics and others who traditionally support Democrats .
“ The Republicans have a long history of erecting barriers to discourage Americans from voting , ” says Donna Brazile , chair of the Voting Rights Institute for the Democratic National Committee .
“ Now they ’re trying to spook Americans with the ghost of voter fraud .
It ’s very effective — but it ’s ironic that the only way they maintain power is by using fear to deprive Americans of their constitutional right to vote . ”
The recently enacted barriers thrown up to deter voters include :
1. Obstructing Voter - Registration Drives
Since 2004 , the Bush administration and more than a dozen states have taken steps to impede voter registration .
Among the worst offenders is Florida , where the Republican - dominated legislature created hefty fines — up to $ 5,000 per violation — for groups that fail to meet deadlines for turning in voter - application forms .
Facing potentially huge penalties for trivial administrative errors , the League of Women Voters abandoned its voter - registration drives in Florida .
A court order eventually forced the legislature to reduce the maximum penalty to $ 1,000 .
But even so , said former League president Dianne Wheatley - Giliotti , the reduced fines “ create an unfair tax on democracy . ”
The state has also failed to uphold a federal law requiring that low - income voters be offered an opportunity to register when they apply for food stamps or other public assistance .
As a result , the annual number of such registrations has plummeted from more than 120,000 in the Clinton years to barely 10,000 today .
2. Demanding “ Perfect Matches ”
Under the Help America Vote Act , some states now reject first - time registrants whose data does not correspond to information in other government databases .
Spurred by HAVA , almost every state must now attempt to make some kind of match — and four states , including the swing states of Iowa and Florida , require what is known as a “ perfect match . ”
Under this rigid framework , new registrants can lose the right to vote if the information on their voter - registration forms — Social Security number , street address and precisely spelled name , right down to a hyphen — fails to exactly match data listed in other government records .
There are many legitimate reasons , of course , why a voter ’s information might vary .
Indeed , a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that as many as 20 percent of discrepancies between voter records and driver ’s licenses in New York City are simply typing mistakes made by government clerks when they transcribe data .
But under the new rules , those mistakes are costing citizens the right to vote .
In California , a Republican secretary of state blocked 43 percent of all new voters in Los Angeles from registering in early 2006 — many because of the state ’s failure to produce a tight match .
In Florida , GOP officials created “ match ” rules that rejected more than 15,000 new registrants in 2006 and 2007 — nearly three - fourths of them Hispanic and black voters .
Given the big registration drives this year , the number could be five times higher by November .
3. Purging Legitimate Voters From the Rolls
The Help America Vote
Act does n’t just disenfranchise new registrants ; it also targets veteran voters .
In the past , bipartisan county election boards maintained voter records .
But HAVA requires that records be centralized , computerized and maintained by secretaries of state — partisan officials — who are empowered to purge the rolls of any voter they deem ineligible .
Ironically , the new rules imitate the centralized system in Florida — the same corrupt operation that inspired passage of HAVA in the first place .
Prior to the 2000 election , Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris and her predecessor , both Republicans , tried to purge 57,000 voters , most of them African - Americans , because their names resembled those of persons convicted of a crime .
The state eventually acknowledged that the purges were improper — two years after the election .
Rather than end Florida - style purges , however , HAVA has nationalized them .
Maez , the elections supervisor in New Mexico , says he was the victim of faulty list management by a private contractor hired by the state .
Hector Balderas , the state auditor , was also purged from the voter list .
The nation ’s youngest elected Hispanic official , Balderas hails from Mora County , one of the poorest in the state , which had the highest rate of voters forced to cast provisional ballots .
“ As a strategic consideration , ” he notes , “ there are those that benefit from chaos ” at the ballot box .
All told , states reported scrubbing at least 10 million voters from their rolls on questionable grounds between 2004 and 2006 .
Colorado holds the record : Donetta Davidson , the Republican secretary of state , and her GOP successor oversaw the elimination of nearly one of every six of their state ’s voters .
Bush has since appointed Davidson to the Election Assistance Commission , the federal agency created by HAVA , which provides guidance to the states on “ list maintenance ” methods .
4. Requiring Unnecessary Voter ID’s
Even if voters run the gauntlet of the new registration laws , they can still be blocked at the polling station .
In an incident last May , an election official in Indiana denied ballots to 10 nuns seeking to vote in the Democratic primary because their driver ’s licenses or passports had expired .
Even though Indiana has never recorded a single case of voter - ID fraud , it is one of two dozen states that have enacted stringent new voter - ID statutes .
On its face , the requirement to show a government - issued ID does n’t seem unreasonable .
“ I want to cash a check to pay for my groceries , I ’ve got to show a little bit of ID , ” Karl Rove told the Republican National Lawyers Association in 2006 .
But many Americans lack easy access to official identification .
According to a recent study for the Election Law Journal , young people , senior citizens and minorities — groups that traditionally vote Democratic — often have no driver ’s licenses or state ID cards .
According to the study , one in 10 likely white voters do not possess the necessary identification .
For African - Americans , the number lacking such ID is twice as high .
5. Rejecting “ Spoiled ” Ballots
Even intrepid voters who manage to cast a ballot may still find their vote discounted .
In 2004 , election officials discarded at least 1 million votes nationwide after classifying them as “ spoiled ” because blank spaces , stray marks or tears made them indecipherable to voting machines .
The losses hit hardest among minorities in low - income precincts , who are often forced to vote on antiquated machines .
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights , in its investigation of the 2000 returns from Florida , found that African - Americans were nearly 10 times more likely than whites to have their ballots rejected , a ratio that holds nationwide .
Proponents of HAVA claimed the law would correct the spoilage problem by promoting computerized balloting .
Yet touch - screen systems have proved highly unreliable — especially in minority and low - income precincts .
A statistical analysis of New Mexico ballots by a voting - rights group called VotersUnite found that Hispanics who voted by computer in 2004 were nearly five times more likely to have their votes unrecorded than those who used paper ballots .
In a close election , such small discrepancies can make a big difference :
In 2004 , the number of spoiled ballots in New Mexico — 19,000 — was three times George Bush ’s margin of victory .
6. Challenging “ Provisional ” Ballots
In 2004 , an estimated 3 million voters who showed up at the polls were refused regular ballots because their registration was challenged on a technicality .
Instead , these voters were handed “ provisional ” ballots , a fail - safe measure mandated by HAVA to enable officials to review disputed votes .
But for many officials , resolving disputes means tossing ballots in the trash .
In 2004 , a third of all provisional ballots — as many as 1 million votes — were simply thrown away at the discretion of election officials .
Many voters are given provisional ballots under an insidious tactic known as “ vote caging , ” which uses targeted mailings to disenfranchise black voters whose addresses have changed .
In 2004 , despite a federal consent order forbidding Republicans from engaging in the practice , the GOP sent out tens of thousands of letters to “ confirm ” the addresses of voters in minority precincts .
If a letter was returned for any reason — because the voter was away at school or serving in the military — the GOP challenged the voter for giving a false address .
One caging operation was exposed when an RNC official mistakenly sent the list to a parody site called GeorgeWBush.org — instead of to the official campaign site GeorgeWBush.com .
In the century following the Civil War , millions of black Americans in the Deep South lost their constitutional right to vote , thanks to literacy tests , poll taxes and other Jim Crow restrictions imposed by white officials .
Add up all the modern - day barriers to voting erected since the 2004 election — the new registrations thrown out , the existing registrations scrubbed , the spoiled ballots , the provisional ballots that were never counted — and what you have is millions of voters , more than enough to swing the presidential election , quietly being detached from the electorate by subterfuge .
“ Jim Crow was laid to rest , but his cousins were not , ” says Donna Brazile .
“ We got rid of poll taxes and literacy tests but now have a second generation of schemes to deny our citizens their franchise . ”
Come November , the most crucial demographic may prove to be Americans who have been denied the right to vote .
If Democrats are to win the 2008 election , they must not simply beat John McCain at the polls — they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP vote tampering .

Internet Apps & Social Networking Office Boom Linked to Breaches
New study finds that nearly all organizations have employees using Internet apps at work , and 60 % use social networking at the office
One of IT 's worst nightmares may be coming true : according to a new survey , organizations where more employees are using social networking at work now than six months ago have experienced more security incidents .
Nearly 60 percent of all IT managers surveyed by FaceTime Communications reported that their users social - network at the office .
Of those organizations , the ones where more users were using social networking today than six months ago experienced an average of 39 security incidents a month , requiring 24 hours worth of remediation .
Those with about the same or fewer users of social networking at work experienced around 22 or 23 such incidents a month , with about half the remediation time .
The overall survey looked at the use of Internet - based applications like Facebook , Linked In , instant messaging , and voice - over - IP .
" Employees are bringing these applications in … and this is a challenge for IT people because it's at odds with what they are comfortable with , " says Frank Cabri , vice president of marketing and product management at FaceTime Communications .
" They are trying to enable their employees to get the job done , but they have to be sure their network is up and available , and that information is not leaking out through those channels they can't monitor . "
Facetime 's survey found that nearly 100 percent of employees at the surveyed organizations use at least one consumer application such as Facebook , YouTube , Skype , or instant messaging ( that 's up from 85 percent last year ) , and around 80 percent of employees use social networking sites for their jobs as well as for personal use .
On average , an organization has 9.3 of these types of Internet applications in use by its employees .
The report surveyed over 500 employees and IT managers , over half of which work at organizations with over 1,000 employees .
Among the most surprising finds in the report , according to Cabri , was that one third of the employees surveyed said they had the right to run these applications on their desktop , even if it was a violation of IT policy .
" If applications are attractive and they allow the benefits for work or both , people are willing to go against corporate IT policy , " he says .
Another red flag was when it came to data leaks at these organizations : four in 10 IT managers said they had experienced security incidents that were purposeful , while 27 percent had seen " unintentional release of corporate information " occur .
" 37 percent of IT managers reported an incident of [ someone ] knowingly sending out confidential information that was a violation " of policy , Cabri says .
" That seems to be a big number to deal with . "
And those leaks came via social networking , IM , and peer - to - peer communications , he says .
Nearly one fourth of the organizations had been hit by at least one Web - borne attack costing the business an average of $ 50,000 per month , according to the report .
Large organizations found this cost them as much as $ 125,000 a month .
The main attacks were viruses , Trojans and worms ( 59 percent ) , and spyware ( 57 percent ) .
The IT managers in the survey said they face an average of 34 security incidents per month , and bigger companies ( over 5,000 employees ) experience close to 70 a month .
Facetime 's Cabri says the answer is IT and the user community finding a middle ground .
" I would never advise a company to give access to each and every [ Facebook app ] to its users , " for instance , he says .
First , determine which Internet apps users are deploying and how they are using them , he says .
" The key is putting controls in place , " Cabri says .
You could allow Facebook , for instance , but only with business applications within the group and block chats , he says .
" And you should be measuring and reporting on what they are doing " with it , he says .

Obama risks trap with Ahmadinejad letter , analysts warn Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Barack Obama may have pledged during his campaign to talk to Iran 's leaders , but he could fall into a trap by replying to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's congratulatory letter , analysts warn .
A reply , they say , could undermine the president - elect 's political support in the United States and rehabilitate Ahmadinejad 's tarnished image in Tehran while missing Iran 's key player : Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Obama said at his first post-election press conference last week that he would " respond appropriately " to the letter but neither he nor his transition team has yet given any indication when or even whether he will follow through .
Two US - based Iran analysts said it would be better for Obama not to reply at all , while another recommended he take his time to write back .
" It is important for the Obama administration to ignore Ahmadinejad as much as possible because he is not a useful interlocutor and it looks like his political star has fallen , " expert Gary Samore told AFP .
" I think it makes much more sense to try to open a dialogue with the supreme leader who actually controls the nuclear issue and the other important foreign policy issues , " said Samore , from the Council on Foreign Relations think tank .
Analysts say Iran lies at the nexus of US concerns about the region in which they see Tehran trying not only trying to build a nuclear bomb but to sabotage US interests in Iraq , Lebanon , the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan .
" I hope the Obama people ignore the congratulatory message from Ahmadinejad , " Samore added .
" If Ahmadinejad could take credit for beginning a dialogue with the United States without conditions , then that would help to rehabilitate his political standing , " Samore said .
Early in his campaign , Obama said he was prepared to hold tough presidential negotiations without preconditions with Iran but analysts said public criticism prompted him to temper his call by insisting first on proper preparations .
The outgoing administration of President George W. Bush has gradually eased its hardline toward Iran by taking part in multilateral negotiations offering Tehran both carrots and sticks to stop enriching uranium .
Analysts said the Bush administration -- when it sent top diplomat William Burns to a meeting in Geneva in July -- effectively dropped its precondition of refusing to meet with Iranians until it stops uranium enrichment .
The administration is also contemplating opening an interests section in Iran , the first diplomatic mission there since ties were severed in the wake of the Iranian revolution in 1979 and the taking of US diplomats as hostages .
It is setting up " a really nice platform for Obama , " said Suzanne Maloney , a former State Department policy adviser on Iran .
Even if it says the interests section is to boost ties between peoples rather than governments , the Bush administration or its successor has to " engage in some direct ongoing discussions with the Iranians , " Maloney said .
But Maloney said Obama runs " a political risk at home " if he replies to the missive from Ahmadinejad , widely reviled for his denial of the Holocaust , alleged support for terrorism and threats against Israel .
Maloney , who was privy to a debate that resulted in Bush ignoring a letter from Ahmadinejad , said Obama can still reassure Iran he is intent on direct talks by sending a " good signal " after his inauguration on January 20 .
The new president could do that , she told AFP , by appointing a high - level diplomat to deal solely with Iran .
Trita Parsi , president of the National Iranian American Council , said Ahmadinejad 's letter " constituted somewhat of a political problem for " the incoming president .
" It 's a way for Ahmadinejad to impose himself on Obama and essentially signal him ' you can't get around me , ' while Obama is probably thinking about getting around him , " Parsi told AFP .
Parsi , who said Obama will likely take his time to reply to the letter , underscored Samore 's point that Obama should seek out Khamenei because he is the real decision maker in Tehran .
Like the other analysts , Parsi believes Obama 's initial response to the letter and strong opposition to an Iranian nuclear weapon struck the right diplomatic balance .
The analysts also expected Obama , while seeking more direct talks with the Iranian leadership , to continue the multilateral talks begun belatedly by the Bush administration with Russia , China , Germany , France and Britain .
" From the European perspective , it would be a great problem if he didn't , " Parsi said before adding : " He 's going to work more closely with the allies rather than working around them . "
They include his friendship with Gordon Liddy , the former White House operative who spent four and a half years in jail for planning the break - in at the Watergate building .
Appearing on Mr Liddy ’s popular radio show last year , Mr McCain said his host showed “ adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great ” and said he was “ proud ” of Mr Liddy and his family .
As the moments tick away before tonight 's scheduled launch of the space shuttle Endeavour to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , another countdown is underway :
Only a handful of launches remain before the shuttle program 's scheduled retirement in 2010 .
When President - elect Barack Obama takes office two months from now , he and his aides will need to decide quickly whether or not to hold to that date , a determination that will have major implications for the future of U.S. space exploration .
The U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , Congress 's investigative arm , has identified the shuttle 's future as one of the most urgent issues facing the incoming Obama administration .
" NASA has already begun the process of shutting down production and transitioning people , equipment and resources to new endeavors , " GAO director of acquisition and sourcing management Cristina Chaplain says .
She adds that the longer the decision is delayed , the more difficult it will be to keep operating the shuttle safely and cost - effectively .
" Moreover , putting off a decision may hamper the transition itself and keep NASA from pursuing new space transportation development , " Chaplain wrote in an e-mail .
At present , the scheduled replacement for the low Earth orbit–only shuttle is the Constellation program , which would allow astronauts to return to the moon and target even more distant destinations such as Mars .
But even assuming a 2010 shuttle phaseout , Constellation wo n't be ready for manned flights until at least 2015 .
The shuttle 's retirement , and the introduction of what became the Constellation program , are key points of Pres. George W. Bush 's 2004 Vision for Space Exploration .
Another central tenet of that plan is a target for returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 , a goal that some deem problematic .
Bush 's plan " added what seems to many people to be an arbitrary and sort of artificial deadline of landing people on the moon , " says Jim Bell , an astronomy professor at Cornell University and recently named president of the Planetary Society , a nonprofit that advocates for space exploration .
" We 're not saying that NASA should n't go to the moon , we 're not saying the moon 's not worthy of exploration , " Bell says .
" What we 're saying is that those kinds of things could be the right thing to do , but not in this artificially constructed timescale . "
The Planetary Society this week unveiled its road map for the future of the space program , timed to provide the incoming administration with outside scientific guidance .
The document advocates for increasing international partnerships , setting Mars as the ultimate target for human exploration , and allowing the shuttle to enter obsolescence as planned in 2010 .
" We are absolutely in favor of its scheduled retirement , " Bell says , praising NASA Administrator Michael Griffin for supporting the plan and noting that the Columbia Accident Investigation Board recommended the shuttle be replaced as quickly as possible .
" The longer that NASA hangs on to it , the more of — unfortunately — a liability it becomes . "
Some see a lapse in NASA 's ability to command manned space missions as unacceptable .
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R ) of Texas , where space exploration is a major industry , wrote an op -ed for the Houston Chronicle last year warning that NASA would need to rely on Russian spacecraft for transport to and from the ISS during the five - year gap between 2010 and 2015 .
" As the world 's leader in space technology , it is simply unacceptable that we will be in this position of technological dependency , " she wrote .
" Our national security depends on our ability to explore space without relying on nations who may not always have our best interests at heart . "
( These sentiments were echoed in an e-mail from Hutchison 's press secretary today . )
Where NASA will head during Obama 's presidency is an open question .
( His aides did not immediately respond to requests for comment . )
As reported by the Washington Post last November , during the Democratic primary , Obama announced that his $ 18 - billion - a - year package for early education and K - 12 would be funded by " delaying the NASA Constellation Program for five years . "
Later drafts of the education plan did not include the Constellation language .*
But a new position paper from the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) may offer a glimpse of the future .
The CAP is a think tank headed by John Podesta , former chief of staff to Pres .
Bill Clinton and one of the top aides on Obama 's transition team .
According to the Orlando Sentinel , the CAP paper states : " The decision to phase out the shuttle by 2010 should be reconsidered ; it should be flown until a suitable replacement becomes available . "
Bell fears that extending the shuttle 's timeline will only push back other priorities , especially given the current financial climate .
A 2010 retirement would free up the funding to pursue Constellation , he says , and would keep NASA on track .
" The American space program , " he says , " needs to move on . "
* A more recent campaign document devoted solely to space exploration , in contrast , proposes expediting Constellation and extending the shuttle 's service by at least one flight to narrow the five - year gap .
Normally , a flight from San Salvador to Los Angeles takes 4 1/2 hours .
On Sunday , however , a TACA International Airlines flight took nearly 14 hours , with nine of them spent on the ground as passengers clamored for relief .
Dense fog forced Flight 670 , en route to Los Angeles International Airport , to be diverted to Ontario International Airport about midnight , where it sat on the tarmac until mid-morning .
Just why the passengers were forced to wait for so long on the cramped aircraft remained a matter of dispute Monday .

According to the air carrier , authorities at the Ontario airport did not allow the plane ’s 193 passengers to disembark .
Local authorities , according to the TACA statement , did not want passengers to pass through customs and enter the country .
Airport officials , however , gave a different story .
According to a statement from Los Angeles World Airports , which operates the Ontario facility , TACA never asked that passengers be allowed to exit the aircraft .
The airline planned to take off from the airport soon after it refueled , according to the airport agency .
But as the plane waited for fog to clear at LAX , the airline did not request that U.S. Customs and Border Protection process passengers so they could stretch their legs or sit in the terminal .

Although the airport did not have customs staff on hand to process exiting passengers , it could have summoned them , according to the airport agency .
“ It is also unknown why , even after suggested , TACA staff did not request clearance to have their passengers deplane for humanitarian reasons , ” the agency said in a prepared statement .
Water and snacks were provided to passengers about 4 a .m. by airport staff , and emergency responders received “ a few reports ” of passenger illnesses , airport officials said .
No one was hospitalized .
The TACA flight ’s crew was changed about 7 a.m. because it had run longer than its allotted hours , Ontario airport spokeswoman Maria Tesoro - Fermin said .

After a normal servicing Monday morning , Flight 670 finally departed Ontario just before 9 a.m. and landed safely at LAX nearly 30 minutes later .
The TACA plane was one of three international passenger flights diverted to Ontario on Monday , said Nancy Castles , a spokeswoman for LAX .

[ Editor 's Note - Dec 21 , 2008 : The SeaMeWe - 4 cable connects 12 countries : Pakistan , Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia , Bangladesh , India , Sri Lanka , United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Italy and France . ]
France Telecom says that it immediately alerted one of the two maintenance boats based in the Mediterranean area , the “ Raymond Croze ” .
This France Telecom Marine cable ship based at Seyne - sur - Mer has received its mobilization order early this afternoon and will cast off tonight at 3:00 am with 20 kilometers spare cable on board .
It should be on location on Monday morning for a relief mission .
Priority will be given to the recovery of the Sea Me We4 cable , then on the Sea Me We3 .
By December 25th , Sea Me We4 could be operating .
By December 31st , the situation should be back to normal .

Why the Mediterranean is the Achilles ' heel of the web New Scientist
The word - based task was under way .
The inmate was being shown a series of words and phrases , and was supposed to rate each as morally offensive or not .
There were three kinds of phrases : some were intended as obvious moral violations , like “ having sex with your mother ” ; some were ambiguous , like “ abortion ” ; and some were morally neutral , like “ listening to others . ”
The computer software captured not only the inmate ’s response but also the speed with which he made his judgment .
The imaging technology recorded which part of the brain was involved in making the decision and how active the neurons there were .
Neurons in the brain consume oxygen when they are “ firing , ” and the oxygen is replenished by iron - laden hemoglobin cells in the blood .
The scanner ’s magnet temporarily aligns these iron molecules in the hemoglobin cells , while the imaging technology captures a rapid series of “ slices ” — tiny cross-sections of the brain .
The magnet is superconductive , which means it operates at very cold temperatures ( minus two hundred and sixty - nine degrees Celsius ) .
The machine has a helium cooling system , but if the system fails the magnet will “ quench . ”
Quenches are an MRI technician ’s worst fear ; a new magnet costs about two million dollars .
The inmate wore a helmet with a head coil for receiving magnetic data and , on the inside , a screen on which words were projected .
A sensor measured “ skin conductance ” — palm sweat .
During the functional imaging scans , there was a series of high - pitched beeps , then a loud drilling sound .
And during the brain - anatomy scans the machine made a low , rapid thumping , like a metal heartbeat .
As the inmate ’s brain was scanned , he crossed his feet at the ankles and then uncrossed them .
His toes wiggled .
Psychopaths are as old as Cain , and they are believed to exist in all cultures , although they are more prevalent in individualistic societies in the West .
The Yupik Eskimos use the term kunlangeta to describe a man who repeatedly lies , cheats , steals , and takes sexual advantage of women , according to a 1976 study by Jane M. Murphy , an anthropologist then at Harvard University .
She asked an Eskimo what the group would typically do with a kunlangeta , and he replied , “ Somebody would have pushed him off the ice when nobody else was looking . ”
The condition was first described clinically in 1801 , by the French surgeon Philippe Pinel .
He called it “ mania without delirium . ”
In the early nineteenth century , the American surgeon Benjamin Rush wrote about a type of “ moral derangement ” in which the sufferer was neither delusional nor psychotic but nevertheless engaged in profoundly antisocial behavior , including horrifying acts of violence .
Rush noted that the condition appeared early in life .
The term “ moral insanity ” became popular in the mid-nineteenth century , and was widely used in the U.S. and in England to describe incorrigible criminals .
The word “ psychopath ” ( literally , “ suffering soul ” ) was coined in Germany in the eighteen - eighties .
By the nineteen - twenties , “ constitutional psychopathic inferiority ” had become the catchall phrase psychiatrists used for a general mixture of violent and antisocial characteristics found in irredeemable criminals , who appeared to lack a conscience .
In the late nineteen - thirties , an American psychiatrist named Hervey Cleckley began collecting data on a certain kind of patient he encountered in the course of his work in a psychiatric hospital in Augusta , Georgia .
These people were from varied social and family backgrounds .
Some were poor , but others were sons of Augusta ’s most prosperous and respected families .
Cleckley set about sharpening the vague construct of constitutional psychopathic inferiority , and distinguishing it from other forms of mental illness .
He eventually isolated sixteen traits exhibited by patients he called “ primary ” psychopaths ; these included being charming and intelligent , unreliable , dishonest , irresponsible , self - centered , emotionally shallow , and lacking in empathy and insight .
“ Beauty and ugliness , except in a very superficial sense , goodness , evil , love , horror , and humor have no actual meaning , no power to move him , ” Cleckley wrote of the psychopath in his 1941 book , “ The Mask of Sanity , ” which became the foundation of the modern science .
The psychopath talks “ entertainingly , ” Cleckley explained , and is “ brilliant and charming , ” but nonetheless “ carries disaster lightly in each hand . ”
Cleckley emphasized his subjects ’ deceptive , predatory nature , writing that the psychopath is capable of “ concealing behind a perfect mimicry of normal emotion , fine intelligence , and social responsibility a grossly disabled and irresponsible personality . ”
This mimicry allows psychopaths to function , and even thrive , in normal society .
Indeed , as Cleckley also argued , the individualistic , winner - take - all aspect of American culture nurtures psychopathy .
The psychiatric profession wanted little to do with psychopathy , for several reasons .
For one thing , it was thought to be incurable .
Not only did the talking cure fail with psychopaths but several studies suggested that talk therapy made the condition worse , by enabling psychopaths to practice the art of manipulation .
There were no valid instruments to measure the personality traits that were commonly associated with the condition ; researchers could study only the psychopaths ’ behavior , in most cases through their criminal records .
Finally , the emphasis in the word “ psychopath ” on an internal sickness was at odds with liberal mid-century social thought , which tended to look for external causes of social deviancy ; “ sociopath , ” coined in 1930 by the psychologist G. E. Partridge , became the preferred term .
In 1958 , the American Psychiatric Association used the term “ sociopathic personality ” to describe the disorder in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
In the 1968 edition , the condition was renamed “ general antisocial personality disorder . ”
Cleckley ’s book fell out of favor , and Cleckley described himself late in life as “ a voice crying in the wilderness . ”
When he died , in 1984 , he was remembered mostly for his popular study of multiple - personality disorder , written with Corbett Thigpen , “ The Three Faces of Eve . ”
In 1960 , Robert Hare took a job as the resident psychologist in a maximum - security prison about twenty miles outside Vancouver .
On his first day , a tall , slim , dark - haired inmate came into his office and said , “ Hey , Doc , how ’s it going ?
Look , I ’ve got a problem .
I need your help . ”
Hare later wrote of this encounter , “ The air around him seemed to buzz , and the eye contact he made with me was so direct and intense that I wondered if I had ever really looked anybody in the eye before . ”
Hare asked the inmate , whom he called Ray in his account , to tell him about his problem .
“ In response , he pulled out a knife and waved it in front of my nose , all the while smiling and maintaining that intense eye contact , ” Hare wrote in his 1993 book , “ Without Conscience : The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us . ”
Ray said he was planning to use the knife on another inmate , who was making overtures to his “ ‘ protégé , ’ a prison term for the more passive member of a homosexual pairing . ”
Ray never harmed Hare , but he successfully manipulated him throughout Hare ’s eight months at the prison , and two and a half years later , after Hare had joined the faculty at the University of British Columbia , Ray , now paroled , tried to register there with a forged transcript .
Hare was n’t familiar with the psychopathy literature when he was working at the prison .
Later that year , he moved with his family to London , Ontario , where he pursued a Ph.D. at the University of Western Ontario .
( When his brakes failed at the first steep hill on the trip east , he recalled that Ray had worked on his car in the prison garage . )
His dissertation was on the effects of punishment on human learning and performance .
One day in the library , he came across “ The Mask of Sanity . ” Reading Cleckley ’s case histories put Hare in mind of Ray , and of other types he had encountered in the maximum - security prison .
Were these men psychopaths ?
Over the next year , Hare read not only Cleckley but also the early literature Cleckley had synthesized .
After receiving his doctorate , in 1963 , and returning to Vancouver , he set about what would be his life ’s work : the study of psychopathy , and the creation of the Psychopathy Checklist , the twenty - item diagnostic instrument that Kiehl is using at Western .
Thanks to the checklist , scientists working in different places can be confident that the subjects they are studying are taxonomically similar .
The PCL also has a wide variety of forensic applications .
It is employed throughout Canada in parole - board hearings and is gaining popularity in the U.S.
In the thirty - seven states that allow the death penalty , a high psychopathy score is often used by prosecutors as an “ aggravating factor ” in the penalty phase of capital cases .
Psychopathy scores have also been used in child - custody cases ; a high score may result in one parent ’s loss of custody .
Hare ’s influence on the field of psychopathy is profound .
Today ,
Hare ’s former students hold important administrative positions throughout the Canadian prison system , and are prominently represented in the next two generations of psychopathy researchers around the world .
One day when Kent Kiehl was eight years old , his father , Jeff , a copy editor at the Tacoma News Tribune , came home talking about a local man named Ted Bundy .
“ This was a guy who had grown up just down the street , ” Kiehl told me , “ and he had supposedly killed all these women . ”
Bundy , whose family moved to Tacoma when he was a child , is known to have sexually assaulted and murdered at least thirty women in the nineteen - seventies .
But to outward appearances he was an exceptionally promising young man .
He had received glowing letters of recommendation both from a psychology professor at the University of Washington , where he was an undergraduate ( “ he is exceedingly bright , personable , highly motivated , and conscientious ” ) , and from the Republican governor of Washington , Dan Evans , for whom he worked .
His good looks , charm , and verbal skills — qualities that made him such an effective predator — convinced many in the Tacoma community that he was innocent , up until the time he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , in 1979 .
Bundy was executed in Florida in 1989 .
Kiehl ’s father was a sports fanatic , but he suffered from a form of muscular dystrophy that made it difficult for him to walk .
( He died when Kiehl was twenty - two . )
“ My dad ’s greatest wish for me was that I play college football , ” Kiehl told me .
Kent fantasized about playing for the University of Washington Huskies in front of fifty thousand fans .
He ended up at the University of California at Davis , where he played in front of a couple of thousand .
He enrolled as a pre-med , planning to be a doctor , but was having trouble balancing his academic and athletic commitments .
When he blew out his knee at the start of his sophomore year , his choice became clear .
Kiehl had taken a course in psychology under Debra Long , a professor specializing in psycholinguistics , who was also his academic adviser , and he had enjoyed the work they did on emotional processing and the brain .
Long asked what inspired him , Kiehl recalled .
“ I said I want to understand why people do bad things — how someone could get to be like Ted Bundy — and I want to study the brain .
So she said , ‘ You should combine those two things and study psychopaths . ’ ” Kiehl ’s first published paper was based on data collected from four hundred and eighty - five undergraduates at U.C. Davis , to whom he distributed a psychopathy checklist adapted from Hare , which they filled out themselves .
He found that a high proportion of psychopathic traits were remarkably consistent with a pattern of disruptive behavior .
Kiehl ’s early training in psychopathology coincided with the emergence of functional neuroimaging ; Kiehl , a techie , quickly became adept at the computer skills necessary to run experiments .
The earliest technique , measuring what ’s known as an event - related potential , or E.R.P. , charts the brain ’s electrical activity , using an electrode - studded skullcap .
In a landmark 1991 E.R.P. study conducted at a prison in Vancouver , Robert Hare and two graduate students showed that psychopaths process words like “ hate ” and “ love ” differently from the way normal people do .
In another study , at the Bronx V.A. Medical Center , Hare , Joanne Intrator , and others found that psychopaths processed emotional words in a different part of the brain .
Instead of showing activity in the limbic region , in the midbrain , which is the emotional - processing center , psychopaths showed activity only in the front of the brain , in the language center .
Hare explained to me , “ It was as if they could only understand emotions linguistically .
They knew the words but not the music , as it were . ”
Since then , cognitive neuroscience has come to be dominated by brain scans , although they are not as widely used in psychopathy research .
So far , fMRI studies of psychopaths have only reinforced different models of psychopathy that were in place before fMRI became popular , theories that Kiehl studied while pursuing a doctorate in Hare ’s lab at the University of British Columbia .
Some scientists think that psychopaths suffer from an extreme and far - reaching attention deficit , which causes them temporarily to forget the moral and social consequences of certain antisocial actions .
Joseph Newman , who chairs the psychology department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison , is the leading advocate of this theory .
His model is based on traditional research methods , such as lab work using rats with brain lesions , and studies of humans using a well - known card - playing task , in which players gradually start to lose money ; the players in the control group stopped as their earnings diminished , but the psychopaths could focus only on the outcome of the next card choice .
Another hypothesis is that psychopaths lack fear of personal injury and , more important , moral fear — fear of punishment .
David Lykken pioneered this theory in the nineteen - fifties , and it has been taken up by James Blair , Christopher Patrick , and others .
The updated version of this model posits that psychopathy is a result of a dysfunction of the amygdala , the almond - shaped bundle of gray matter situated in the midbrain , which is another area instrumental in emotional processing .
When Kiehl arrived at the University of British Columbia , Hare sent him to a new maximum - security prison nearby .
Kiehl recalled , “ Bob said , ‘ There is this new prison that just opened up , with the worst of the worst offenders — you can work there . ’
So I submitted my proposal to do E.R.P. studies , and met with the prison psychiatrist , whose name was Johann Brink .
He said , ‘ I got you this office over here , here are your keys , and there are the inmates ’— that was my training .
They open the door , and there are fifty guys with tattoos looking at me .
My first week , I interviewed a serial killer .
He told me he had killed sixteen people and described how he had chopped them up — and I am sitting right across the table from the guy . ” [ #unhandled_cartoon ]
Kiehl ’s most memorable “ perfect forty ” on a PCL was an inmate I ’ll call George .
Kiehl was at the prison on the morning that George arrived .
After being processed , George stripped naked and walked around the track outside the cellblock in the pouring rain .
“ I was new here , ” he later explained to Kiehl , “ and I wanted to establish right away that I am a crazy motherfucker so leave me alone . ”
George described his criminal past in full detail .
He started out committing petty crimes as a child and by seventeen had been convicted of arson .
In the early nineties , after serving eighteen months in prison for breaking and entering , he moved back in with his mother .
One day , the two had a fight , and his mother picked up the phone to call the cops .
“ Man , can you believe the balls on that chick ? ” George asked Kiehl .
He wrapped the phone cord around his mother ’s neck and strangled her .
“ Then I threw her down the basement stairs , but I was n’t sure she was dead , so I got a kitchen knife and stabbed her , and her body made these weird noises , I guess gas escaping , but I was n’t sure , so I grabbed a big propane cannister and bashed her brains in . ”
Then he went out and partied for three days .
“ When I came back , that house stank — what a stench . ”
He cleaned the whole basement with bleach , wrapped up his mother ’s body , put it in the trunk of her car , and drove to the mountains .
On the way , a policeman stopped him and asked if he was drunk .
George said that he was just looking for a place to pee .
So the cop pointed him toward a dirt road , and George went up there and left the body in the woods .
It turned out he had dumped his mother in a mountain - pine - beetle - infested area , and a forestry crew came across the body a few days later .
“ Fucking pine beetles , ” George remarked .
At first , the police could n’t find any evidence in the house , but George had neglected to clean the propane tank , which was splattered with his mother ’s blood .
When he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment , George just smiled .
In a report due to be released this Thursday in San Francisco , NASA scientists will reveal satellite imagery indicating that over 2 trillion tons of polar land ice has melted since 2003 , we contacted the most famous polar resident to get his reaction .
In the following exclusive pre-Christmas interview , Inspired Economist investigative reporter Ramsay Mameesh , asks Santa Claus about his role in causing global warming and the dangers it poses for his business .
As well as China ’s effect on North Pole Industries ’ toy market share .
And how the economic downturn is impacting toy production .
Ramsay Mameesh : Santa Claus , thank you so much for agreeing to do an interview with the Inspired Economist , I know you ’re a busy man so close to Christmas .
I think everyone is familiar with who you are , so to save time I ’ll skip the usual introduction , and get straight to questions .
Do you feel any sense of responsibility for our current climate crisis ?
Santa Claus : Ho , Ho , Ho .
I see you ’re still upset about not getting the Tonka Truck Fire Engine that one Christmas !
RM : Yeah , something like that .
But seriously , do n’t you think the culture of consumption that you personally promote , is directly responsible for melting polar ice - caps ?
I mean , you may be driving yourself out of business , does n’t that concern you ?
Santa Claus :
Yes , we are very concerned about climate change , and that ’s why I have appointed a special committee of Elves to explore solutions .
One of the Elf ’s suggestions is that we begin using Reindeer poop , to power our facilities , instead of coal .
It ’s sort of a nasty Catch - 22 , North Pole Industries is a toy manufacturer , and if we do n’t produce toys we ’re out of business .
On the other hand , over consumption is causing climate change , and endangering our manufacturing facilities .
I want to assure you , and all the good boys and girls , that as CEO of North Pole Industries we will find creative solutions .
Christmas will continue .
RM :
That ’s good to know , I ’m sure children around the world , will be relieved to hear that Christmas will continue .
However , you did not answer my question , are you willing to admit for the record that you played a key role in causing global warming ?
Santa Claus : I see this is going to be a bah humbug interview .
Look , it ’s not only toy production , that causes global warming .
There ’s S.U.V.’s , coal fired power plants , deforestation and many other sources besides toys .
But yes , I would agree that over consumption is a real problem , and that is why this year I am urging everyone to celebrate a Green Christmas .
RM : Speaking of Green , what is your opinion on Christmas trees , the production of Christmas trees causes global warming ?
Are you in favor of banning Christmas trees ?
Santa Claus :
We ’re not in the lumber business .
RM : Fair enough .
What about the practice of giving kids coal , even if they ’ve been bad , is n’t it sending the wrong message ?
Santa Claus :
We stopped that practice a couple of years ago , but did n’t make it public , to try and keep the bad boys and girls in line .
Thanks a lot !
Say , when did you go all Green ?
I do n’t remember you being Green as a kid ?
RM : A few years ago .
Okay , let ’s move on from the Green subject , and get into some business questions .
How are profits this year holding up with the economic downturn ?
Santa Claus : First , we ’re a non-profit , so we do n’t have to please shareholders – only children .
And we run a recession proof business , children will always want presents , so we do n’t anticipate any decrease in demand .
RM : What about China ?
Word on the street is that China has significantly affected your market share of Christmas toys ?
Santa Claus :
Am I being interviewed by the Grinch ?
I need a cookie and a glass of milk .
Look , no doubt China has hurt business , and our brand image as well .
All the lead toys , have caused some children to abandon toys , in favor of other types of gifts .
And as you know , the Elves belong to a pretty strong union ( Toy Local 1 ) , while China is a non-union manufacturer .
So , yeah , we do feel a margin squeeze .
However , we have a strong R&D division , and we are generally able to stay one step ahead of the Chinese .
You know , I brought this issue up with President Reagan one Christmas eve .
I said to him “ What are you doing , opening up the U.S. market to Chinese toys , when they do n’t even celebrate Christmas !?!
He got coal that year .
RM : I have a bunch more questions , like the the tabloid driven PETA boycott over Reindeer working conditions , but we ’re about out of time for this interview , so I want to get to the big question – why did n’t I get the shiny red Tonka Truck Fire Engine ?
Santa Claus :
As I recall , that year you did not do your homework , you were not good to your brothers and sister , and you skipped school .
That year you were basically an obnoxious …
RM : I ’m sorry Santa , but I ’m afraid we ’re out of time , I want to thank you again for appearing on the Inspired Economist and I wish you and all the reindeer the best of luck this Christmas .
Santa Claus : Fa , la , la , de , da .

Barack Obama is shaking up the South by greatly expanding the black vote and forcing Republicans to confront splits in the same white conservative base that has long fortified the GOP in Congress .
Obama shakes up Georgia 's Senate race
CUMMING , Ga. — Barack Obama is shaking up the South by greatly expanding the black vote and forcing Republicans to confront splits in the same white conservative base that has long fortified the GOP in Congress .
Georgia ’s U.S. Senate race is Exhibit 1 , as a record turnout by African - Americans in early voting has lifted the candidacy of Democrat Jim Martin against Saxby Chambliss , the Republican incumbent .
At the same time , Wall Street ’s meltdown — punctuated by the state ’s own fiscal woes — has soured the mood for Republicans , and Chambliss must win back conservatives , angered by his vote for Treasury ’s $ 700 billion financial rescue plan .
Advertisement
Here in Cumming , the county seat for Republican Forsyth County , north of Atlanta , all these forces were on display this week in the courthouse square .
As a small group of upscale - suburban supporters gathered to hear Chambliss , Andy Schneider , a self - described small businessman , lifelong Republican , Georgia native and former firefighter , stood in overalls on the corner holding a sign that condemned the Treasury rescue plan as “ Corporate Welfare ” and urged voters to “ Bail the Rats Out of Congress . ”
“ It ’s for the people , by the people , ” Schneider told Politico .
“ I think that 99 percent of the phone calls that Saxby got were for him to vote against the bailout , yet he did it anyway .
He ’s supposed to represent the people of the state of Georgia . …
By far , the vast majority did not want the bailout . ”
Libertarian Allen Buckley , a 48 - year - old attorney and third - party candidate , stands to benefit from the unhappiness of conservatives like Schneider , and Chambliss could be forced into an embarrassing December runoff if he ca n’t get the 50 percent plus one required under Georgia law .
The Republican is outwardly confident , but there ’s urgency in his voice as he tours North Georgia , trying to boost turnout in his predominately white base : “ The other folks are voting , ” he bluntly tells supporters .
Smelling blood , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee jumped in two weeks ago and is on track to spend close to $ 5 million before Nov. 4 to keep Martin competitive .
Former President Bill Clinton came to Atlanta on Saturday for a closed - door event to raise funds and rally the party ; new Democratic ads cast Chambliss as taking millions from Wall Street donors and then backing the “ bailout ” at the taxpayers ' expense .
“ He bailed out all the fat cats up on Wall Street ” begins a new radio ad jingle this week .
“ Saxby economics wo n’t fill my pickup truck ... wo n’t catch my mortgage up .
Saxby economics do n’t trickle down on me . ”
In the past , Chambliss might have easily weathered this storm .
But Obama and the financial meltdown are a one - two punch , challenging the political equations that have guided Republicans in the South since Richard Nixon four decades ago .
That “ Southern Strategy ” — born of the post - civil rights , Vietnam , War on Poverty unrest of the ‘ 60s — swung Democratic whites into the GOP .
But no one envisioned an Obama or black voter turnout of this size ; no one could see today ’s financial crisis , which has reopened the old divide between Republican Big-Business backers and the party ’s more populist conservative voters in the region .
Everything begins with Obama , and here in Dr. Martin Luther King ’s old haunts , the young presidential candidate is never spoken of as just “ that one . ”
It ’s more like “ Hurricane Obama ” or “ The Locomotive . ”
“ My 84 - year - old grandmother has never voted , and this year she insisted I take her , ” says Tommy Wright , a United Steelworkers operative in Gwinnett County .
New data released this week shows black registration has grown to 30 percent statewide .
Among the nearly 1.4 million absentee and early ballots counted thus far , blacks have maintained a 35 percent share , according to the latest tallies released by the Georgia secretary of state ’s office Wednesday .
When Hispanic and Asian - American voters are counted , the white majority share of the early vote is about 61 percent .
These numbers will surely change in the final tallies , but Charles Bullock , a University of Georgia political scientist , predicts that blacks could very well account for a record 30 percent of the Georgia vote this year — five percentage points higher than in the last presidential campaign , he said .
If the number should go higher — as seen in the early voting — it would throw out years of assumptions by pollsters .
“ This one does n’t follow any of the rules , ” said Tom Perdue , a longtime political consultant for Chambliss .
“ You ca n’t figure it out . ”
Like much about Southern politics , there ’s a personal side beyond the numbers .
Just years apart , Chambliss , who turns 65 next month , and Martin , 63 , crossed paths as fraternity brothers at the University of Georgia in the turbulent ‘ 60s .
Each embodies much about his party in the years since .
A handsome , big - voiced man , the senator will forever seem the modern Southern good - old boy , more frat house than courthouse , but a likable person who allows tough things to be done in his name .
A small city lawyer from southwest Georgia , Chambliss first came to Congress in 1994 , the same year Republicans took over the House and installed a fellow Georgian , Newt Gingrich , as speaker and two other Southern deputies in the top command .
Gingrich would ultimately fall .
But at the height of President Bush ’s power in 2002 , Chambliss jumped to the Senate , ousting a Democratic incumbent and assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Agriculture Committee as only a freshman .
In the same period , Martin , a former legal aid lawyer , labored out of the limelight in the state Legislature and later ran the Georgia Department of Human Resources under Democratic — and , for a period , Republican — governors .
Five - foot - eight and bespectacled , he might be Chambliss ’ bookish cousin , a modern Walter Mitty character reveling in his dream now .
The senator campaigns in two passenger buses big enough for a football team — and band .
Martin’s is a 15 - seat Chevy van that resembles an airport parking lot shuttle .
When a reporter asks about the campaign , he says proudly : “ I believe we are tied . ”
When it ’s pointed out that that does n’t do it , Martin laughs .
“ It ’s pretty extraordinary that we ’re in this position right now , ” he says .
Beneath this demeanor is a tough intellect .
“ I ’m not mean , but I ’m tough .
I ’m plenty tough , ” he says .
Tough enough to survive polio as a child and still serve as an Army intelligence officer in the Vietnam War .
Martin has four degrees from the University of Georgia : “ As my brother says , I have more degrees than a thermometer , ” he jokes .
And with supporters in Lawrenceville , he paraphrases the late Southern historian George Brown Tindall when speaking of this election — and what could be his own odyssey .
“ In this process of change , we ’re not losing our identity , ” Martin says .
“ We ’re finding out who we are . ”
The same could be said of Chambliss , the dominate character in this drama .
The senator led an almost charmed existence in his first years in Congress , but nothing lately has been so fortunate .
It took months of struggle to complete a new Farm Bill this year that put him at odds with the White House as he sought to protect the region ’s powerful cotton interests .
Within days , he broke ranks with the administration in May over a supplemental spending bill that included a landmark expansion of education benefits for veterans — but also billions in new domestic spending .
National Democrats will never forgive Chambliss — who got draft deferments — for the punishing ads run in 2002 to help him oust Democratic Sen .
Max Cleland , who lost both legs in Vietnam .
But the great irony is that Chambliss is being punished hardest now for taking moderate stands applauded by his Democratic critics .
Responding to agriculture concerns , the Georgian first got himself in trouble last year when he flirted with bipartisan business - backed immigration reforms — and drew the ire and boos of conservatives at home .
Chambliss quickly backed away , but when the Treasury bill came up this fall , he voted for the measure on Oct. 1 despite that fact that all seven of the House Republicans from Georgia opposed the measure .
Chambliss ’ Farm Bill credentials are a mixed blessing in Georgia , since many conservatives are opposed to the subsidies he protects at a time of high food prices .
When he next worked with Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) on a bipartisan energy policy , it also irritated some on the right .
“ This is all about Chambliss , not Martin , ” says Emory University ’s Merle Black , a longtime observer of Southern politics .
“ If he had n’t voted for the bailout , he would be sailing through . ”
At one level , the senator embodies the tension for Southern Republicans as they try to govern from Big - Business , Chamber of Commerce positions while holding onto their more conservative , more populist base .
“ He ’s trying to balance between where his money comes from and where his votes come from , ” says Black .
Republican Jim Broyhill famously lost in North Carolina in the ‘ 80s for the same reasons .
Chambliss is no Broyhill , the heir to a furniture fortune , but the financial meltdown is now so all encompassing that it magnifies the distrust of anyone in the senator ’s position .
Add in the attacks by national Democratic ads , and the politics seems to come full circle .
Chambliss is accused of taking $ 2.5 million in Wall Street political donations and then supporting the bailout , a televised attack line funded as an independent expenditure by the DSCC .
Technically , under campaign rules , the spot is not cleared in advance by the DSCC ’s chairman , Sen. Charles Schumer .
But Schumer is himself a New York Democrat , very close to Wall Street money men and an early supporter of the Treasury bill .
“ It shows they have no compunction .
The truth does n’t make any difference to them , ” Chambliss says .
“ I ’d like to check his FEC [ Federal Election Commission ] report , ” he says of Schumer ’s own campaign receipts .
“ I do n’t know where he got $ 2.5 million from . ”
Chambliss ’
House career included a period when redistricting forced him to compete for black votes ; that experience could now be an asset outside Atlanta .
His work on Savannah harbor dredging is expected to win him support there from the longshoreman ’s union , with its large black membership .
And he has nurtured ties to black clergy in the Macon area .
Even now , the incumbent is still below 50 percent in his own polls , but “ Martin is at a ceiling , ” he says .
“ What we ’ve got to do is get independent votes .
The base is gradually coming back . ”
That is , unless it opts to punish him first by forcing a runoff .

Politics
WHILE the Democrats and Barack Obama won big yesterday , even coming close to a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate , Obama will find their options substantially constrained by reality .
Their handicap is the financial condition of the nation they ’ll inherit .
Think of a trustee or conservator of a bankrupt company .
Those who fear a radical Obama miss the point of the lack of maneuverability of the next president .
Behind the mortgage crisis looms the credit - card crisis , the student - loan crisis and the car - loan crisis .
Sweating this mess out of the system will take two years of zero growth or contraction .
We wo n’t have a Great Depression , for the government will irrigate our economy with money .
But we ’ll have stagnation , followed by inflation .
So Obama will take office with unlimited political power but highly circumscribed practical power .
He can pass whatever legislation he wants , but will be unable to indulge his ideology .
The irony will be bitter for the Democrats .
Finally able to rise above the political limits they ’ve faced , they ’ll encounter new limitations in the fundamental problems of the economy .
The Republican Party ’s role is to rebuild in the shadow of the frustrations of the Obama presidency .
Just as MoveOn.org built the massive grass - roots base that yesterday impelled the Democrats to victory , so Republicans must go down to their grass roots , get in touch with their base and rebuild an opportunity to win national elections .
Power has been bad for the GOP , sapping the party ’s soul and eroding its purity .
But opposition , especially when a socialist like Obama wrestles with the practical problems of capitalism , will be a heady experience for the Republicans .
The conservative movement can be reborn in opposition in a way they never could have been as the governing party .
For political historians , it ’s worth noting that Obama has n’t scored the knockout that many predicted .
As I write , it seems clear that John McCain will lose by a few points in the popular vote , not by the double digits so confidently predicted in the media polls .
The fact is that most of the undecided voters went to the Republicans .
In the face of a mandate limited by reality and undermined by his inability to sweep the nation as had been predicted , Obama will face a difficult situation .
As the economy falters , he ’ll find himself unable to raise taxes as he wants and stymied in his plans for government takeover .
A very tough future , for a man who won such a heady victory .

There was a huge television screen in the city and the crowds were so big .
An Obama victory was expected but the margin was unknown .
I watched it all on television at home and I am very proud of Obama .
There is a huge party in Kisumu city where Obama 's father was born and Obama is expected to visit soon as the US president elect .
Our president has declared a national holiday .
HAMED , MAZAR -I- SHARIF , AFGHANISTAN
Well , it is a a really historical result for the US democracy .
However , I as an Afghan , feel a concerned about the future of Afghanistan because Obama had announced that he would oust the US troops from Afghanistan and end the US war with Al - Qaeda .
The question is what will happen to Afghanistan and the Taliban .
The US nation had promised to support the Afghanistan nation to win the war against terrorisim and Taliban .
And now ?
NOOR MUHAMMAD , KARACHI , PAKISTAN Senator Obama 's election as president of the United States of America is a new and refreshing turn in the history of democracy .
It promises hope and courage for the lovers of democracy throughout the world , including Pakistan .
Not only is Senator Obama a symbol of the rise of the ' slave race ' , his victory is also a blow for those who consider race , lineage and colour of leaders , instead of valuing the humanitarian ideas they represent .
There is a lesson in Obama 's victory for the intelligentsia and public of Pakistan and other countries struggling to establish the ' rule of people ' .
Real change takes time .
It took the Americans 43 presidential elections before realizing and expressing the true potential of democracy .
It will take us much lesser time , if we realize today .
I hope that the US under Obama and Biden is different from the US under Bush and Cheney .
If it 's not , nothing will have changed .
FARAH HANNA , EAST JERUSALEM
As a Palestinian , the election of Obama will not bring any change for me .
Obama has not uttered a word about the starved Palestinians in Gaza .
In contrast , he has praised Israel .
He has not mentioned ending the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories including East Jerusalem .
Instead he has even commented that Jerusalem will be the " undivided capital " of Israel .
Shame on the president who , instead of supporting liberation movements and human rights , flatters the Israeli lobby .
NIRMA , SANTIAGO DE CUBA
The overwhelming election of Obama as president once again demonstrates the ability of the American people to change , to choose a new destiny , to correct the course that a country should take when it is wrong .
Long live open societies and respect for popular expression .
Death to the tyranny and those who govern at all costs are perpetuated indefinitely in power .

HERNANDO JIMENEZ , BOGOTA , COLOMBIA Colombians must receive with joy the triumph of Obama .
It is a glimmer of hope to overcome the racism that for centuries led us to think of the words " Indian " and " black " as derogatory ones .
Obama is a hope of reconciliation in our war , which is in addition to fratricidal it is nameless .
Also for Colombia , Obama might be the path of change .

" UNCLE SASHA " , ST PETERSBURG , RUSSIA I really like Obama and his wife has impressed me .
What I worry about is the way he was brought to victory .
It seemed that Democrats were playing chess , while Republicans were playing giveaway chess .
They set an old man paired up with a housewife against the handsome Obama .
I am afraid that now they will make Obama take unpopular decisions and then use him as a scapegoat .

ALEXANDER , RUSSIA
This shows that racism has won in the US .
Obama has no knowledge or experience , but his skin colour is " politically correct " .
But I hope that this election will vaccinate the United States from racism for the future .
Obama is bound to demonstrate his political incompetence and this will teach Americans a lesson : a presidential election should not depend on the candidates ' skin colour .

ANONYMOUS , CHINA American elections have shaken me to the core .
I have always thought the Chinese political system is the best in the world , but it is not so .
We are deprived of our sacred rights , rule of law and human rights are trampled upon and to have a democratic system like the one in the USA would be more difficult than reaching the sky .
But we long to achieve freedom and democracy , which is a difficult task for us young people in China .

Finally change has arrived !
Obama has a clear vision for the Middle East , and its one that revolves around dialogue .
This is one of the happiest days , seeing that the US is making such historical approaches .
Who knows maybe one day the US can have a president of Arab heritage !
Obama 's vision for the economy and global warming is very exciting , and I am extremely delighted to have played my part in supporting Mr. Obama .
MIKKO TAIPALE , TURKU , FINLAND
Now that the generational shift is taking place in Europe , we can also see it become a reality in the US .
This election result represents a historical change to reach out to the world and offer true change to world politics on this dire financial situation .
I see an opportunity for unilateral troubleshooting bringing nations closer together .
I hope that Obama will not resort to protective measures to boost his domestic economy .
JOSE ALONSO , MIAMI , UNITED STATES
I do not foresee a positive government of Obama , especially in the relationship with Latin America , because of his opposition towards the NAFTA and the classical protectionist policies of his party .
Anyway , within four years we will have an opportunity to correct the course and U.S. will remain the only nation with one fourth of the millennium without dictators and coups d'etat .

Have you checked out New York City in Google Earth lately ?
You should , because Google added a layer of photorealistic building textures which make the city look like something from a decent flight simulator .
Or , in one word : awesome !
Google has been adding new photorealistic textures for many months now , and the users themselves have contributed .
As a result , there 's almost no important landmark in NYC without a 3D model .
See for yourself in the screenshots below :
It once seemed like having Hironobu Sakaguichi and Nobuo Uuematsu , respectively the famed designer and composer of Final Fantasy fame , coming to work for Microsoft was a huge win for the Xbox 360 .
However , the two have failed to capture the hearts of gamers in any big way since Mistwalker Studios was formed .
Both of the studios ' titles , Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey , were solid games that did n't make much of a splash at retail .
Now , the company 's third Xbox 360 title has been canned .
AQ Interactive , the Japanese publisher of Mistwalker 's games , used Christmas Day to quietly announce its plans to cancel Cry On , the third title from the studio , which was due for the Xbox 360 .
An action RPG featuring the artwork of famed Japanese artist Kimihiko Fujisaka , Cry On remained largely shrouded in mystery — little information and no in - game media were released .
" [ We ] decided to cancel the project after analyzing the current market environment and forecasts for the future , " 1UP was told by a spokesperson .
" We deeply apologize for troubling those who were awaiting its release . "
It 's disappointing to see what could have been a big , and potentially exciting , JRPG for the Xbox 360 disappear into the industry 's growing dead - game sea , but it 's clear that the traditional style of play offered by Mistwalker titles is n't necessarily attractive to Xbox gamers worldwide .
There 's no word on what , if anything , Mistwalker Studios plans to work on now .
The economy ’s yearlong downturn , officially declared a recession Monday , could last well into next year or even beyond , challenging the government to devise new responses as traditional methods show limited results .
The National Bureau of Economic Research , the private body charged with determining the onset of a recession as well as its endpoint , said Monday that the current downturn met its definition of a recession : “ a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months . ”
The downturn began , the bureau said , at the end of last year as businesses started slashing jobs -- which they have done every month this year .
The group did not say how long the recession might last , but the stock market reflected widespread pessimism .
After a widely followed index of U.S. manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level in 26 years , the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 679 points , or 7.7 % , and the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index plunged 8.9 % .

“ This downturn promises to be the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s , ” said Joshua Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm MFR Inc .
“ We ’ve only just started .
I ca n’t see bottoming out until sometime in 2010 . ”
The slide in stock prices ended a five - day rally , the market ’s strongest in seven decades , built on hope that the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama could turn the economy around .
“ The market got ahead of itself last week , ” said Scott Anderson , senior economist with Wells Fargo & Co. in Minneapolis .
“ But we ’re back into our funk again .
The fundamentals of the economy still look like things are going to weaken still further over the next few months . ”
A psychology of fear has gripped businesses and consumers and is likely to prolong the recession , said Lee Ohanian , a professor of economics at UCLA .

“ This one has a potential to be longer and deeper than other postwar recessions , ” he said .
“ People are very , very scared and worried .
In my opinion the government has created much more uncertainty about the economy than it should have done .
So it ’s really hard to tell how long this recession could last . ”
Government officials reiterated that they would do what was required to turn the economy around .
“ While we are making progress , the journey ahead will continue to be a difficult one , ” Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson said .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , addressing the Austin , Texas , Chamber of Commerce , pledged to use the central bank ’s full resources to repair the credit markets and prime the economy .
Advertisement
But “ despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve and other policymakers , ” he said , “ the U.S. economy remains under considerable stress . ”
Although the Fed has lowered its benchmark interest rate to only 1 % , a very low level by historical measures , Bernanke said it could be lowered further .
However , that rate does n’t directly affect long - term rates paid by borrowers .
As a result , the Fed is considering purchasing Treasury bonds on the open market , a move that could bring down long - term borrowing costs .
“ I am not suggesting the way forward will be easy , ” Bernanke said .
“ But I believe that the policy responses taken here . . . will help to restore confidence in our financial system and place our economy back on the path to vigorous growth . ”
The National Bureau of Economic Research , a nonprofit , nonpartisan group , was founded in 1920 to study the economy and formally designate each business cycle ’s peak -- when an economic expansion gives way to a recession -- as well as each trough -- when growth resumes after a downturn .
Advertisement
Since 1978 , the group has had a special committee in charge of the designation process .
Although a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of declines in the gross domestic product -- a measure of all goods and services produced -- the current downturn does n’t meet that yardstick .
The GDP shrank in this year ’s third quarter at a 0.5 % annual rate but showed growth of 2.8 % in the second quarter and 0.9 % in the first quarter .
The bureau , however , uses a larger variety of indicators , including monthly measures of employment , industrial production and personal income .

Economists say that ’s because GDP figures can mask economic woes .
For instance , if firms are producing goods , GDP will go up even if no one is buying them and they are simply going into inventories .
Sung Won Sohn , a professor at Cal State Channel Islands , said the economy would probably have shown two straight quarters of shrinking GDP this year if the government had n’t handed out tax rebates as part of an economic stimulus program .
“ The rebates resulted in a blip in the second quarter , and now that blip is gone , ” he said .
Job losses appeared to weigh most heavily in the bureau ’s decision .
Advertisement
The economy normally must create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep pace with population growth .
But lately job creation has been in reverse .
Through October , an average of 120,000 jobs a month have been lost this year .
The unemployment rate stood at 6.5 % in October , and many economists expect the rate to top 8 % next year .
“ The committee found that economic activity measured by production was close to flat from roughly September 2007 to roughly June 2008 , while activity measured by employment reached a clear peak in December 2007 , ” the bureau said .
The organization ’s economists “ judged that the weight of the evidence ” suggested that the economy peaked -- and the recession began -- in December 2007 .

It is so funny xD ----->
Vote if you liked it !
Outrage and anguish over the passage of Proposition 8 has spurred massive street protests throughout California , and leaders of the gay and lesbian community believe the backlash could spark an unprecedented nationwide push for gay rights .
Today , same - sex marriage supporters have planned simultaneous protests throughout California and in all 50 states , as well as cities in Canada , England and Australia .
It 's a never - before - seen response , surpassing in size and scope even the 1969 Stonewall riots , which started the modern gay rights movement after New York City police raided a Greenwich Village gay bar .
" This is unprecedented and very significant , and we must not allow it to be a fleeting moment of screaming and yelling , " said longtime activist Cleve Jones .
He is calling for seven weeks of sustained protest and civil disobedience to force federal action on a host of gay - rights issues , calling the state - by - state pursuit of rights a " failed strategy . "
" This has got to be made real , " he said .
So far , the protests are being organized not by the large and established gay - rights organizations , but largely by individuals spreading the word via the Internet and cell phones .
The backlash after Tuesday 's vote has been enormous and wide - reaching .
People and businesses have become targets of blacklists and boycotts .
Two temples of the Mormon church , which advocated for the marriage ban , received letters containing a white powder , though the FBI determined the substance was not toxic and do not know who sent them .
The Human Rights Campaign , the nation 's largest gay - rights organization , on Friday published a list of donors to the pro-Prop .
8 campaign .
What 's next
What course the response ultimately takes remains to be seen .
This uprising so far lacks clear leadership .
The gay and lesbian community in San Francisco has called a town hall meeting for next week to begin to formulate a plan of action .
Whatever their decision , the next step is likely to be something beyond California 's borders .
" People around the country were watching this very closely , " said Kellan Baker , a Washington , D.C. , resident who is organizing today 's protest there .
" For Californians to go to the ballot box to strip people of civil rights they had been enjoying is , I guess , the last straw . "
Stephen Vaisey , a UC Berkeley assistant professor of sociology , said he believes the response from supporters of same - sex marriage shows they did not really believe the ban would pass .
Vaisey said he is closely watching the response and said it could be the first stage of a larger movement - but that depends on protesters .
" For that , you need to get beyond some of the stuff that is happening , " he said .
" If the focus is a religious group that is not going to change its doctrine and has no power over public policy , then what you get is a backlash , not a movement . "
Individuals targeted
The boycotts and blacklists are affecting not only the political faces behind the Prop. 8 campaign , but also individual supporters .
Phillip Fletcher , a Palo Alto dentist who donated $ 1,000 to the campaign , is featured prominently on a Web site listing donors targeted for boycott .
He said two of his patients already have left over the donation .
On Sunday , protesters were outside the Mormon church he attends , and he said they were cursing at adults and children who came for the service .
" I 'm not sure if it 's so much equal rights or if they are trying to silence , threaten and intimidate a group of people , " Fletcher said .
Mormons decry protests
On Friday , the Mormon church 's top leaders , known as the First Presidency , officially responded to the fallout from the vote .
In a statement , they said , " These are not actions that are worthy of the democratic ideals of our nation .
The end of a free and fair election should not be the beginning of a hostile response in America . "
The campaign behind Prop. 8 is not planning any sort of counterprotest , and leaders of the campaign said they are frustrated by the aggressive response they have seen since election day .
" The election is over .
There was a full and high - profile discussion of the issue and voters turned out in record numbers to decide it , " said Andrew Pugno , general counsel for the Yes on 8 campaign .
Critical court case
What could get opponents of same - sex marriage in the street , however , would be the state Supreme Court tossing out the vote , he said .
San Francisco city officials , joined by the city of Los Angeles and Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties , have petitioned the court to do just that .
" I think you 'll have a revolution on your hands at that point , " Pugno said .
Whether it gets to that point , some people on both sides believe the debate on the issue should be over .
Dan Savage , who is editorial director of the Seattle weekly the Stranger and who has written extensively on same - sex marriage , said he believes it 's no longer acceptable for people to support some rights for gays and lesbians but not marriage .
" To borrow a phrase , either you 're with us or you 're against us , " Savage said .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A record number of hedge funds went bust during the third quarter , a report showed Thursday , as shaky markets and tight credit drove investors away from risky investments .
Hedge Fund Research , a Chicago - based information company , said the number of hedge funds liquidated in the third quarter rose to 344 , which is more than three times the 105 liquidations in the third quarter of 2007 .
It 's also 77 more than the previous record of 267 liquidations in the fourth quarter of 2006 .
The data also showed that 693 hedge funds were closed in the first nine months of the year versus 409 in the same period last year .
That 's an increase of 70 % and represents nearly 7 % of all hedge funds , according to HFR .
" The hedge fund industry is currently experiencing a structural consolidation that mirrors broader trends across the entire financial industry , " HFR President Kenneth Heinz said in a statement .
Stock market volatility and a lack of available credit " increased the challenges for both funds and investors , " he added .
Indeed , in the third quarter , the number of hedge funds closing shop exceeded the number of funds launched for the first time since HFR started tracking this data in 1996 .
At this rate , hedge fund liquidations are on track to reach 920 for the full year , the report said .
That would outpace the 563 liquidations last year , and could top the previous record of 848 in 2005 .
This year has been brutal for many fund managers as the financial crisis has unfolded and investors have fled risky investments .
Hedge funds have been flooded with redemption requests in recent months as the crisis has exploded and investors have asked for their money back to cut losses or pay back debt .
The third - quarter was a particularly brutal , with the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting nearly 25 % from October to November .
" Risk tolerance is at a historical low , " Heinz said .
" Investors are not even distinguishing between a fund that 's up 10 % and one that 's down 10 % .
Both facing redemptions . "
Heh , I just wanted to type that headline .
As the saying goes , oh my !!
WASILLA -- A 42 - year - old Wasilla woman was arrested Thursday at her home by Alaska State Troopers with a search warrant in an undercover drug investigation .
Sherry L. Johnston was charged with six felony counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance .
Johnston is the mother of Levi Johnston , the Wasilla 18 - year - old who received international attention in September when Gov. Sarah Palin and her husband , Todd , announced their teenage daughter was pregnant and he was the father .
She has signaled she has no intention of fading quietly from the national scene back into arctic anonymity .
Palin ’s tricky path back
WASILLA , Alaska – Though the long knives are out for her in the aftermath of the sweeping defeat suffered by the Republican presidential ticket , Sarah Palin has signaled she has no intention of fading quietly from the national scene back into Arctic anonymity .
Palin , who captivated Americans with her meteoric rise from small - town mayor to Alaska governor to surprise Republican vice presidential nominee , still generates broad enthusiasm among the conservative base and is considered an ascending star by Beltway conservatives .
Advertisement
But amid the wreckage from the Obama - led Democratic hurricane , there is no obvious route back to the national spotlight for Palin or easy course to chart for a possible presidential run in 2012 .
Palin told CNN Wednesday morning " 2012 sounds so far off that I can't even imagine what I 'd be doing then . "
Still , after casting her vote early Tuesday morning here in her hometown , where homemade “ Palin 2012 ” signs occasionally appeared at political events in the last few weeks , Palin hinted she was considering repackaging herself for her next foray onto the national stage by hewing closer to the image of good - government pragmatist that she projected here , rather than the fire - breathing partisan that emerged on the presidential campaign trail .
“ You know , if there is a role in national politics , it wo n’t be so much partisan , ” Palin told reporters .
“ My efforts have always been here in the state of Alaska to get everybody to unite and work together to progress this state … it certainly would be a uniter type of role . ”
Tone aside , it ’s unclear what path Palin might follow back to national prominence .
She has another two years left as governor , but it wo n’t be easy to maintain a share of the national spotlight or bolster her resume from the Alaska governor ’s office .
That ’s because she returns home to lower approval ratings than before her star turn in the Lower 48 , not to mention the potential of suspicious and envious lawmakers , a state ethics law that may bar her from cashing in on a book deal or lectures , and a whole lot of Alaskans wondering whether she ’s just looking for the next step in her political career .
There are a few recognizable steps for Palin could take after her first gubernatorial term ends .
She has proven to be a huge fundraising draw and could follow the Mitt Romney model .
Romney , who Palin could face in the 2012 Republican presidential derby , spent 2005 and 2006 – the last two years of his sole term as governor of Massachusetts – crisscrossing the country wooing the GOP base and raising money to dole out to Republican candidates in key primary states .
He also used the cash to pay a core group of political operatives , who at the conclusion of his gubernatorial term became the nucleus of his unsuccessful bid for the 2008 nomination .
That route would allow Palin to cash in on her newfound fame by signing a book deal , hitting the lecture circuit or doing radio commentaries – which would boost her public profile , though it probably would n’t quell lingering concerns about her experience that plagued her vice presidential bid .
If she wanted to burnish her executive bona fides , she could run for reelection in 2010 .
But do n’t count on that , said close friend Judy Patrick , who served on the Wasilla city council while Palin was mayor and ran Palin ’s unsuccessful campaign for lieutenant governor in 2002 , after Palin was term - limited out of the mayor ’s office .
“ We ’d have to be delusional to think that she ’s just going to come back here and live in obscurity and stay the governor of Alaska , ” said Patrick , who compared Tuesday ’s loss to the 2002 setback , which paved the way for Palin ’s 2006 gubernatorial win .
“ So I ’m certain that there are bigger things for her future , but I do n’t know what the timing would be . ”
There ’s plenty of buzz in Alaska political circles that Palin has her eye on a Senate seat , which would give her a platform from which to garner national press , boost her foreign policy credentials ( an area of particular concern during her V.P. bid ) and build a Washington network crucial to a presidential campaign .
She may get a shot at a Senate seat sooner than the normal rotation would dictate , if Alaska ’s embattled 40 - year incumbent Sen .
Ted Stevens , a fellow Republican , is able to pull out a surprise victory in his reelection bid against his Democratic challenger , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich .
After Stevens was convicted last week on seven felony counts of hiding gifts , Begich jumped out to a lead that one poll measured at 22 points .
Yet Thursday evening , Stevens was clinging to a slim lead as votes continued to be counted .
If Stevens wins , but then is expelled by the Senate – as the chamber ’s leaders have predicted –
Palin could run in a special election for his seat as soon as next year .
If Stevens loses , Palin could challenge the state ’s other senator , Republican Lisa Murkowski , in the primary when her seat comes up in 2010 .
In 2002 , Palin was disappointed when she was passed over for appointment to the seat by Murkowski ’s father , then - Gov. Frank Murkowski , who had vacated it to serve as governor .
Instead , Murkowski tapped his daughter , prompting a nepotism controversy that Palin wielded to unseat Frank Murkowski in the 2006 GOP gubernatorial primary .
But it would be tough for Palin to unseat Lisa Murkowski in an election , asserted Ivan Moore , an Alaska pollster whose surveys have shown Palin ’s approval ratings dropping from a high of 89 percent in mid-2007 to 64 percent in his most recent poll .
“ It ’s gotten to the point now where Sarah and Lisa ’s numbers are really quite similar , so it ’d be competitive , ” he said , adding , “ There was a time when there was n’t anyone in the state who could take Sarah on and survive . ”
Moore traces Palin ’s slide , which his surveys show have mostly halted , to confusion over her brand , which was built around a clear , anti-corruption , ethical - government message .
“ Sarah Palin , in the year and a half she spent being governor up here , was really very pragmatic , middle of the road , and did a pretty good job maintaining her approval ratings among Democrats and across the ideological spectrum , ” Moore said .
“ Then she went down south and became a very different Sarah Palin on the campaign trail , and people are conflicted as to which the real Sarah Palin was . ”
Plus , Moore said Palin ’s public image suffered when she was dinged for an ethics violation in the so - called “ Troopergate ” scandal , even though a report released by her administration Monday afternoon absolved her .
Neither Troopergate , nor her stumbles on the campaign trail or recent revelations about her bucking guidance and directives from the brain trust of her running mate John McCain will hinder a potential Palin 2012 presidential bid , said GOP strategist Craig Shirley , provided Palin publicly focuses on governing Alaska , while quietly assembling a solid team for her second act on the national stage .
“ In this day and age , in the hyper - speed world of communications , very rarely anymore does somebody in politics become reduced to a punch line , ” he said , cautioning that Palin must be careful not to squander the appeal she built with the Republican base .
“ A star was definitely born , it ’s just a question of how brightly and how long that star can burn , ” he said .
“ If she surrounds herself with ( Republican National Committee ) kids who do n’t have a grounding in conservative philosophy and it just becomes about re-rolling her out with a series of stunts , then she wo n’t be successful .
If she wants to be taken as a serious player , then she will reach out to the serious people in the conservative movement , in the Republican party , who understand what Republicanism should be about , ” Shirley said .
“ She has n’t been particularly well served by the staff that was assigned to her by the McCain campaign , ” he added .
Any benefits from a short Senate stint would be outweighed by the risk of compromising her position as an outsider , Shirley contended , comparing her path back to Ronald Reagan ’s winning the presidency in 1980 after narrowly losing the 1976 Republican nomination .
Shirley , whose 2005 book chronicles the significance of Reagan ’s 1976 bid , said , “ He used those four years very strategically , ” by honing his positions advocating tax cuts and a harsh line toward the Soviet Union .
Palin may have her work cut out for her in Juneau without the extra homework .
She ’s already butted heads with many top Republican lawmakers , and her campaign trail rhetoric likely offended some of the Democrats she relied on to pass her signature initiatives , including ethics reforms and a windfall profits tax on oil companies , according to Les Gara , a Democratic state representative from Anchorage .
“ There are a lot of bruised egos , ” he said , singling out the McCain - Palin campaign ’s attacks on the legislature ’s bipartisan Troopergate investigation .
“ There are some legislators – frankly , mostly folks on her side of the aisle -- who have a much bigger heartache with her than Democrats do , ” he contended .
Lisa Murkowski , after attending a Sunday rally for Stevens at a Wasilla hockey complex Palin built during her days as mayor , told Politico , “ The governor will have a task ahead of her in rebuilding some relationships .
I would hope that she is going to give her all to being a great governor .
And if she is a great governor , that enhances her ability to do whatever it is that she may want to pursue , whether it is governor for another term , whether it ’s the presidency in 2012 or whether it ’s the possibility of a federal seat . ”
Andy Barr contributed to this report .
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was convicted on seven felony counts relating to his corruption trial .
After the verdict was read Steven continued to profess his innocence and went on to say that " this verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the Justice Department lawyers conducted this trial .
I ask that Alaskans and my Senate colleagues stand with me as I pursue my rights .
I remain a candidate for the United States Senate . "
If you truly believe that a federal trial was carried out in an " unconscionable manner , " you have defied your obligation as a US Senator to uphold the Constitution of the United States ' fifth and fourteenth amendment , and thus , you are unfit to hold the office which you seek .
The mere absurdity of your reasoning justifies your conviction .
Now onto the polls .
Obama now has an outside shot at hitting 400 Electoral Votes .
A new poll by Rasmussen places Arizona in the Lean Rep category .
If in the next eight days Obama takes the lead in Arizona the election is over .
Here were the rest of today 's polls :
I 've spent the majority of my free time today collating 2004 and 2006 election results .
Using this data I hope to provide some historical perspective on Senate Coefficients .
Look for it later tonight and look for a follow up to our Bradley Effect Model later in the week .
Update : I incorrectly entered the Senate poll for Virginia taken by VCU as a presidential poll .
This has now been corrected ; my thanks goes out to " dickelocker " for bringing this to my attention .

This clip of Tom Cruise on David Letterman later tonight , in which he laughs about his fear of psychiatry and his insane , megalomaniacal tendencies , is one piece in a set : Scientology Prince asserts normalcy .
Everyone thought Cruise was a crazy Scientologist , because that 's how he had acted with Oprah ( jumping on her couch ) ; Matt Lauer ( calling him " glib ) and in that leaked Scientology recruiting video .
Cruise 's attempt at redemption started with a conciliatory lunch with Sumner Redstone , the Viacom CEO who had canceled his contract because he was acting nuts .
It continued through with a carefully - constructed , well - received impersonation of Redstone in the movie " Tropic Thunder . "
" This might usher in a new era for the strange , secretive actor , " the Observer wrote .
Next thing you know , he was on Oprah Winfrey 's show again .
He still seemed sorta crazy .
Then he was back with Matt Lauer on the Today Show , kinda - but - not - really apologizing for calling Lauer " glib " in a fight about psychiatry .
Cruise still seemed to hate psychiatry .
And sorta crazy .
Tonight he's on Letterman , reading this Top Ten list and being a good sport about Scientology - related items like the " Vicks Vaporub " and the " power - mad " ones .
But you know what ?
He still seems creepy and crazy .
A reader writes :
I thought I 'd pass on an anecdote about my daughter and other kids I 've come into contact with during this ungodly long election cycle .
I voted for McCain in the primary .
As a political reporter and columnist in Michigan , I have the news on in our house with some frequency .
That 's how my now 6 - year - old got to know Barack Obama .
And she loved him .
She asked to tag along when I went to cover his events .
Maybe it 's the smile , the calmness .
But she felt very assured by the idea of this man being president , long before I was ready to switch my vote .
She was the one trying to convince her grandparents to vote Obama last winter .
And I 've found that Obama has the same effect on lots of kids , whether they come from liberal or conservative homes .
He is a rock star with the under 10 crowd , believe me .
And I have to say , as a journalist , I found their reactions fascinating in light of both the race debate and the fact that kids tend to be carbon copies of their parents .
So that Scholastic poll does n't surprise me at all .
So the next time you see a kid with an Obama shirt , she just might have asked for it for her birthday , like mine , instead of having it foisted upon her by overbearing parents .
Rutgers University launched an AUV called RU17 on May 17 from Atlantic City and dubbed it Scarlet Knight for the transatlantic voyage .
On October 28 , about 3,500 miles into the voyage , a leak was detected and the university has not heard from it since .
The Scarlet Knight was to end up off the coast of Spain before winter .
When the leak was detected the AUV was near the Azores Islands , about 900 miles off the coast of Portugal .
The university hopes to get the sub back and examine the cause of the leak .
Another run at a transatlantic voyage is scheduled for this upcoming spring .

Midafternoon last Wednesday , Top Gear USA host Eric Stromer 's Toyota Camry Hybrid flipped after being hit from behind while traveling through the streets of Hollywood .
The blow slid the car up onto a curb and the car rolled up onto it 's passenger side .
A decidedly stoic palm tree put a stop to the proceedings although no air bags whatsoever were deployed .
Stromer emerged from his hybrid unharmed but markedly startled and in a radio interview on fellow TG USA host Adam Corolla 's radio show , Stromer dishes that his primary concern during the accident was spilling his newly purchased " triple grande nonfat latte . "
We are looking forward to the gripping social commentary Stromer will bring to the table for the new series .

THE POLLS TELL THIS REMARKABLE STORY : GOP presidential candidate John McCain badly miscalculated when on Sept. 24 , in a huge roll of the dice , he said that he 'd suspend his campaign the next day in order to bring Republicans and Democrats together to save our foundering financial system .
This bit of braggadocio almost immediately cost McCain the lead he'd had over Democrat Barack Obama since the second week of September .
The public backlash against his grandstanding might strike some as too harsh .
After all , every campaigning politician engages in over - the - top theatrics and woos naïve voters with exorbitant promises ; Obama makes promises by litany .
But we can't recall any other instance in the long history of electoral politics where a candidate made a promise and then actually tried to make good on it prior to the election .
This unusual misstep was worsened by McCain 's failure to deliver the goods .
He ended up looking more like Doodyville 's Mayor Phineas T. Bluster than savvy professional gambler Bret Maverick .
As a result of his impolitic gamble , McCain lost the lead and then some .
He now trails nationally by four to eight points , depending on the poll -- and by much larger margins in some key swing states .
" It is difficult to find a modern competitive presidential race that has swung so dramatically , so quickly and so sharply this late in the campaign , " says Peter Brown , assistant director of the respected Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
On Oct. 1 , he wrote , " In the last 20 days , Sen .
Obama has gone from seven points down to eight points up in Florida , while widening his lead to eight points in Ohio and 15 points in Pennsylvania . "
Brown says that no candidate has overcome such a dramatic reversal in the past 50 years .
OBAMA'S SURGE BEGAN IN ADVANCE OF the first candidates ' debate on Sept. 26 , ruling out that event as a defining moment .
Shortly before the debate , statistician Nate Silver wrote on his political Website , Fivethirtyeight.com : Obama is in the strongest position in the polls he 's been in all year .
Silver , a young man famous for his work with baseball statistics , emerged this year as a leading expert on presidential polling .
Although he unabashedly supports Obama , his mathematics embraces neutrality .
He carefully weighs all of the major political polls to produce a snapshot of current voter sentiment and to predict voters ' behavior on Nov. 4 .
By Silver 's calculations , Obama has the lead now in so many key states that it's hard to imagine him losing all of them by election day , even with Joe Biden as his running mate .
Silver 's Website attracts more than 200,000 visitors a day , including me .
Recently , I 've also begun visiting the Princeton Election Consortium site , maintained by Professor Sam Wang and statistician Andrew Ferguson ( http://election.princeton.edu).
It , too , tries to reduce multiple polls into simple cross-sections of voter sentiment .
Unlike Silver , however , Wang and Ferguson are looking at the here and now , not trying to predict the outcome .
Silver 's reading of the polls sees McCain hurt more by the financial crisis than by the debate or running - mate Sarah Palin 's embarrassing interviews with ABC's Charles Gibson and CBS 's Katie Couric .
MCCAIN WAS HURT by the poor economy even before he decided to " suspend " campaigning and rescue the country .
An ABC News / Washington
Post poll released three hours before McCain 's decision to suspend found that 53 % of the voters saw the economy as the most important campaign issue , up 12 points in two weeks .
The heightened economic concern was largely due to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson 's controversial , three - page $ 700 billion bailout plan , which gave him more clout and a bigger budget than the leaders of most African countries .
Call him Bwana .
The poll found that Obama had a 14 - point lead over McCain in trustworthiness to deal with the economy , which may have influenced McCain 's decision to rush to Washington and act like he was leading the charge up San Juan Hill .
His bombastic arrival did light a fire under foot - dragging Democrats who could n't countenance Maverick 's getting any credit for a legislative breakthrough .
But the public awarded him no brownie points .
A Gallup poll released on Oct. 1 indicates that McCain has narrowed Obama 's lead from eight points to four , inside the margin of error .
But state polls tell a different story .
Quinnipiac on Oct. 1 found Obama gaining in Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania , while McCain saw his popularity drop significantly in these locales .
So , if he 's going to pull off an upset , McCain must work much harder in a lot more places before election day .
As of Friday morning , and thus after the vice - presidential debate , Silver saw Obama winning 331.2 electoral votes to McCain 's 206.8 .
Wang and Ferguson were 95 % sure that Obama would win 322 electoral votes , while McCain would get 216 .
To win , 270 are needed .
If Maverick suspended his campaign on the advice of his aides , he got a bum steer .

OO Example Code
The Setup ...
An email conversion on the CLUG mailing list got on the topic of doing Object Oriented program ( with runtime polymorphism ) in a non-OO language like C .
What would it take , what would the code look like and is it worth it ?
The Problem ...
Here is a small example of a OO program that uses the following classes :
|<< interface >>| | Shape | A | +---------+-------+ | | | Rectangle| | Circle|
Shape provides an abstract interface that supports Draw ( ) , MoveTo( x , y ) , and RMove To ( dx , dy ) methods .
Rectangle and Circle support that interface as well as defining their own specific methods ( e.g. SetRadius ( newRadius ) for Circle ) .
Note :
My intention was to have the Shape class be a pure interface , with all implementation in the derived classes .
A few of the examples move the MoveTo and RMoveTo methods implementations into the Shape class .
This certainly reduces redundency and is an acceptable optimization for this example .
The Challenge ...
I initially produced the C and C++ versions of the program .
Someone on the CLUG list offered a Perl version .
So I thought that it would be interesting to see this small problem written in several different OO languages ( or non -OO languages with manual polymorphism ) .
The Results ...
OO Languages
Languages in this table provide some sort of support for the Object Oriented programming .
General Purpose non-OO Languages
Languages in this category are general purpose languages that do n't provide any features for Object Oriented programming .
Special Purpose Languages
Languages in this category are special purpose languages .
This includes things like scripting languages and data base languages .
The entries in this category really stretch the envelope to be able to do polymorphism .
Almost , but not quite ...
Bryce Jacobs offers a XBase version .
Unfortunately , Bryce 's version only offers a limited form of polymorphism ( where the base class must enumerate all subclasses ) .
Bryce also offers some general criticism of the OO paradigm which you might enjoy .
Submitting a new language
Anyone can submit a version , just send it to me , Jim Weirich , at jim.weirich@gmail.com .
If you do send in an example , the following guidelines will make it easier on my end :
If you are going to submit a language that is already on the list , make sure the new version is different in an interesting way .
( In other words , minor formatting differences or variable renamings are not interesting )
The code may be presented in as many files as need for your language .
If you wish to have the files sorted in a particular order , prefix the filename with a number and an underscore .
( e.g. 01_shape.c , 02_rect.c ) .
Include the output of the program in a file named '/ articles/poly/output.txt ' .
Package the whole thing together for emailing in a tar or zip file .
If you would rather have a blog or website URL linked to your name in the contributors table , just say the word .
Otherwise I will link with your email address .
If you would prefer no link , that 's ok too .

entertainment television , beating a number of worthy foes for the honor .
The Czech native , recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the planet 's highest paid models , was dubbed by E ! as " she of the mysterious belly button " due to " media speculation about what appears to be an unusually smooth navel . "
We can't speak to whether she 's had navel work done , but Kurkova won the honor over Bar Rafaeli , who came in # 2 , and Angelina Jolie , who took the bronze .
Congratulations to Karolina Kurkova .
Here 's the complete list of the top 10 sexiest women on Earth - representing six continents !

As the clock ticks down on his days in the White House , President George W. Bush is taking part in one of his last presidential rituals — helping to shape the perception of his years in office .
In an interview conducted earlier this month by his sister , Doro Bush Koch , Mr. Bush said he wanted to be remembered “ as a person who , first and foremost , did not sell his soul in order to accommodate the political process . ”
“ I came to Washington with a set of values , and I ’m leaving with the same set of values , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ And I darn sure was n’t going to sacrifice those values ; that I was a President that had to make tough choices and was willing to make them .
I surrounded myself with good people .
I carefully considered the advice of smart , capable people and made tough decisions . ”
In excerpts of the interview released by the White House , Mr. Bush did not explicitly mention the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or the war in Iraq , which many would consider to be the defining moments of his presidency .
But he said he wanted to be known “ as somebody who liberated 50 million people and helped achieve peace ; that focused on individuals rather than process ; that rallied people to serve their neighbor ; that led an effort to help relieve HIV / AIDS and malaria on places like the continent of Africa ; that helped elderly people get prescription drugs and Medicare as a part of the basic package ; that came to Washington , D.C. , with a set of political statements and worked as hard as I possibly could to do what I told the American people I would do . ”
The interview , which will become part of National Public Radio ’s StoryCorps series , was broadcast in part on Thanksgiving , and will be archived at the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress .
First Lady Laura Bush , who also took part in the conversation , said that what had been most rewarding for her to witness was the liberation of women in Afghanistan — a development that she hoped would have ripple effects across the region :
I worry about Afghanistan , but I will always have a special place in my heart for the women that I ’ve met there , both on my visits to Afghanistan and then the many women from Afghanistan who ’ve traveled to the United States on scholarships or with the Afghan American Women ’s Council , or with a lot of other ways that American citizens have opened their homes to women in Afghanistan so they can be educated quickly , because they missed their education when they were children or young women , because they were n’t allowed to learn anything .
I think that ’s really important .
I think as we look all around the Middle East , we ’ll see that women can be the ones who really lead the freedom movement , and that American women are standing so strongly , I think , with the women in Afghanistan and other places .
President Bush discussed his signature education initiative , the No Child Left Behind law , which he called “ one of the significant achievements of my Administration . ”
He also covered more personal topics — the influence of his parents and the role that faith has played in his life over the last eight years :

Computer technology helps reconstruct image of Copernicus
Enlarge Image
Researchers in Poland say they have solved a centuries - old mystery and identified the remains of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus .
A comparison of DNA from a skeleton in Poland and strands of the astronomer 's hair found in a book in Sweden almost certainly confirm it is his skeleton .
Archaeologists found the skeleton in north - eastern Poland three years ago in a cathedral where Copernicus lived .
He worked in Frombork Cathedral on the Baltic Sea coast in the 16th Century .
Copernicus was one of the key proponents of the idea that the Earth orbits the Sun .
For many years he was a canon and only carried out his astronomical studies in his spare time .
People had speculated about his final resting place for centuries .
Teeth DNA
Three years ago , archaeologists dug up a skull and partial remains of a man aged about 70 , Copernicus ' age when he died , near an altar at the cathedral .
Jerzy Gassowski , the leader of the archaeologists ' team , said forensic facial reconstruction of the skull found that it bore a striking resemblance to existing portraits of the father of modern astronomy .
Scientists then matched the DNA from one of the skull 's teeth and a femur bone with two strands of Copernicus ' hair .
The hair was found in a book once owned by the astronomer now kept in Sweden 's Uppsala University .
( Fortune ) --
The three - person auditing firm that apparently certified the books of Bernard Madoff Investment Securities , the shuttered home of an alleged multibillion - dollar Ponzi scheme , is drawing new scrutiny .
Already under investigation by local prosecutors for its potential role in the scandal , the firm , Friehling & Horowitz , is now also being investigated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants , the prestigious body that sets U.S. auditing standards for private companies .
The problem :
The auditing firm has been telling the AICPA for 15 years that it does n't conduct audits .
The AICPA , which has more than 350,000 individual members , monitors most firms that audit private companies .
( Public - company auditors are overseen , as the name suggests , by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , which was created in 2003 in response to accounting scandals involving WorldCom and Enron . )
Some 33,000 firms enroll in the AICPA 's peer review program , in which experienced auditors assess each firm 's audit quality every year .
Forty - four states require accountants to undergo reviews to maintain their licenses to practice .
Friehling & Horowitz is enrolled in the program but has n't submitted to a review since 1993 , says AICPA spokesman Bill Roberts .
That 's because the firm has been informing the AICPA -- every year , in writing -- for 15 years that it does n't perform audits .
Meanwhile , Friehling & Horowitz has reportedly done just that for Madoff .
For example , the firm 's name and signature appears on the " statement of financial condition " for Madoff Securities dated Oct. 31 , 2006 .
" The plain fact is that this group has n't submitted for peer review and appears to have done an audit , " Roberts says .
AICPA has now launched an " ethics investigation , " he says .
As it happens , New York is one of only six states that does not require accounting firms to be peer - reviewed .
But on the heels of the Madoff revelations , on Tuesday , the New York State senate passed legislation that requires such a process .
( The bill now awaits Gov. David Paterson 's signature . )
" We 've not been regulated in the fashion we should 've inside the state , " says David Moynihan , president - elect of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants .
David Friehling , the only active accountant at Friehling & Horowitz , according to the AICPA , might seem like an odd person to flout the institute 's rules .
He has been active in affiliated groups : Friehling is the immediate past president of the Rockland County chapter of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and sits on the chapter 's executive board .
Friehling , who did n't return calls seeking comment , is rarely seen at his office , according to press reports .
The 49 - year - old , whose firm is based 30 miles north of Manhattan in New City , N.Y. , operates out of a 13 - by - 18 - foot office in a small plaza .
A woman who works nearby told Bloomberg News that a man who dresses casually and drives a Lexus appears periodically at Friehling & Horowitz 's office for about 10 to 15 minutes at a stretch and then leaves .
( State automobile records indicate that Friehling owns a Lexus RX . )
The Rockland County District Attorney 's Office has opened an investigation to see if the firm committed any state crimes .
People who know Friehling , through the state accounting chapter and through the Jewish Community Center in Rockland County ( where he 's a board member ) were reluctant to discuss him .
Most members of both boards would n't comment except to say they were surprised by Friehling 's connection to Madoff .
" He 's nothing but the nicest guy in the world , " says David Kirschtel , chief executive of JCC Rockland .
" I 've never had any negative dealings with him . "

I first watched Star Wars IV - VI when I was very young .
Seven , maybe , or nine ?
So my memory was dim , but I recalled Luke Skywalker as being , you know , this cool Jedi guy .
Imagine my horror and disappointment , when I watched the saga again , years later , and discovered that Luke was a whiny teenager .
I mention this because yesterday , I looked up , on Youtube , the source of the Yoda quote : " Do , or do not .
There is no try . "
Oh . My. Cthulhu .
Along with the Youtube clip in question , I present to you a little - known outtake from the scene , in which the director and writer , George Lucas , argues with Mark Hamill , who played Luke Skywalker :
Luke :
All right , I 'll give it a try .
Yoda : No !
Try not .
Do .
Or do not .
There is no try .
Luke raises his hand , and slowly , the X - wing begins to rise out of the water — Yoda 's eyes widen — but then the ship sinks again .
Mark Hamill : " Um , George ... "
George Lucas : " What is it now ? "
Mark : " So ... according to the script , next I say , ' I can 't .
It 's too big ' . "
George : " That 's right . "
Mark : " Should n't Luke maybe give it another shot ? "
George : " No . Luke gives up , and sits down next to Yoda — "
Mark : " This is the hero who 's going to take down the Empire ?
Look , it was one thing when he was a whiny teenager at the beginning , but he 's in Jedi training now .
Last movie he blew up the Death Star .
Luke should be showing a little backbone . "
George : " No . You give up .
And then Yoda lectures you for a while , and you say , ' You want the impossible ' .
Can you remember that ? "
Mark : " Impossible ?
What did he do , run a formal calculation to arrive at a mathematical proof ?
The X - wing was already starting to rise out of the swamp !
That 's the feasibility demonstration right there !
Luke loses it for a second and the ship sinks back — and now he says it 's impossible ?
Not to mention that Yoda , who 's got literally eight hundred years of seniority in the field , just told him it should be doable — "
George : " And then you walk away . "
Mark : " It 's his friggin ' spaceship !
If he leaves it in the swamp , he 's stuck on Dagobah for the rest of his miserable life !
He 's not just going to walk away !
Look , let 's just cut to the next scene with the words ' one month later ' and Luke is still raggedly standing in front of the swamp , trying to raise his ship for the thousandth time — "
George : " No . "
Mark : " Fine !
We 'll show a sunset and a sunrise , as he stands there with his arm out , straining , and then Luke says ' It 's impossible ' .
Though really , he ought to try again when he 's fully rested — "
George : " No . "
Mark : " Five goddamned minutes !
Five goddamned minutes before he gives up ! "
George : " I am not halting the story for five minutes while the X - wing bobs in the swamp like a bathtub toy . "
Mark : " For the love of sweet candied yams !
If a pathetic loser like this could master the Force , everyone in the galaxy would be using it !
People would become Jedi because it was easier than going to high school . "
George : " Look , you 're the actor .
Let me be the storyteller .
Just say your lines and try to mean them . "
Mark : " The audience is n't going to buy it . "
George : " Trust me , they will . "
Mark : " They 're going to get up and walk out of the theater . "
George : " They 're going to sit there and nod along and not notice anything out of the ordinary .
Look , you do n't understand human nature .
People would n't try for five minutes before giving up if the fate of humanity were at stake . "

When the 111th Congress convenes on Jan. 6 , Buddhists , Muslims and Hindus will be underrepresented in its membership .
No shocker there perhaps .
But a new analysis of incoming members ' religious affiliations by the Pew Forum indicates there 's no small measure of change in Congress ' religious ties :
It 's much more diverse than just half a century ago .
Yeh , sure , those Protestants still form a majority of these high - paid talkers ( 54.7 % ) , slightly more than their 51 % of the population .
( But way down from the 74.1 % of 1961 . )
Pew finds that other religious followers -- Catholics , Jews and Mormons -- are actually overrepresented in Congress .
( Quick , who 's the highest - ranking Mormon there ?
Answer below . )
Catholics make up 30 % of Congress , better than their population percentage of just under 25 % .
Baptists are next largest at 12.4 % of members when they make up 17.2 % of the adult population .
Now , watch out for the Methodists , who are apparently on a methodical march , constituting 10.7 % of the members when they 're only 6.2 % of the population .
( By the way , 100 % of the outgoing first family are Methodists .
The incoming first family lists its religious affiliation as " Christian , " as will be represented in the two pastors participating in the Jan. 20 inauguration . )
Jews make up only 1.7 % of the U.S. adult population but 8.4 % of congressional members , including 13 % of senators , which , come to think of it , means 13 senators .
Mormons are 1.7 % of the population and 2.6 % of members .
Episcopalians , 1.5 % population and 7.1 % members .
Presbyterians , 2.7 % population , 8.1 % members , according to the new Pew analysis .
As this fall 's congressional economic bailout bill revealed , members of all religions really like pork .
No Hindus have served in Congress yet , and California 's own Democratic Rep. Pete Stark is the first and only member of Congress to publicly declare no faith in a supreme being .
There are two Muslims in Congress now and two Buddhists , plus one Quaker .
For the purposes of the Pew study , " Washington Redskins " was classified a " faith , " not an official religion .

Kucinich home hit twice with paintball attack , according to police report RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Popular Ohio Democratic congressman Rep. Dennis Kucinich was targeted by vandals , according to police records reviewed by UPI .
" The wife of the congressman and former Democratic U.S. presidential candidate told authorities that vandals , likely teenagers , had hit their home with paint balls , " the wire service reported .
The Plain Dealer said that Kucinich's wife heard a loud banging noise around 1:30 am last Thursday and subsequently noticed the outside of the Kucinich 's home had been hit with orange paintballs .
Elizabeth Kucinich said the vandals returned Friday and attacked their home with additional paintballs .
Police have no suspects , the Cleveland Plain Dealer said .
Kucinich 's wife said she saw two young men jump a fence to get away .
Kucinich took has taken the national stage on numerous occasions for popular liberal causes , among them the impeachment and censure of President George W. Bush .
Despite the two attacks , the story received just a few paragraphs in the Plain Dealer .
According to The Daily Mail Online , the teddeh bears shown below are " the first soft toys to take part in extra- vehicular activity ... at such an altitude . "

I imagine that one of the most universal but least discussed rites
of passage is the discovery that the house you grew up in has a very
distinct smell , and that it was n’t just everyone else ’s house that
smelled peculiar .
Recognized only on return from your first long time
away , this is typically not the romantic smell of baking pies or pipe
tobacco , but neither is it anything foul , like a backed - up septic tank
or mildew .
It ’s instead something that defies description , a complex
olfactoral web that is unique to the group living under one roof .
Like
snowflakes , no two are ever alike .
It is for this reason that I never plan to start a family where I
currently reside .
I live next to a Wendy ’s fast food restaurant , and
the smell of my home is very describable :
It ’s the smell of Wendy ’s
food cooking .
The last thing I want is to have my future kids return
from college one day only to realize that their childhood home smells
like something called a Baconator .
Fast food restaurants like Wendy ’s have become easy visual shorthand
for the homogeneity of American culture .
Yet because they tend to sit on
large expanses of asphalt , few Americans actually live as close as I do
to one .
This is probably for the better , because living next to a fast
food restaurant is a strange experience and , if the modern residential
landscape is any indication , people do not seem to want a home life
that they could describe as a strange experience .
I moved into my current apartment at a very particular moment in
Wendy ’s history — two years after founder Dave Thomas ’ death but less
than a year before a California woman would claim that she found a
finger in the restaurant ’s chili .
These were heady
Wendy ’s times , to
say the least .
Before moving in , I had considered Wendy ’s my favorite
fast food chain .
Its ingredients always seemed the freshest and the
least fast - foody , and I found Dave Thomas very likable .
( When I was
about 12 , my parents laughed when I asked them if they thought Thomas
visited every Wendy ’s franchise .
I still do n’t think it ’s such an odd
question — I would if I were him . )
It did n’t take long , however , before the idea of eating Wendy ’s
became difficult to stomach .
It was n’t the food — that had n’t changed
at all .
It was , instead , the smell of the food , and how its fried - ness
could creep into my apartment at any hour of the day .
Unlike the only
other Wendy ’s in downtown Philadelphia , the one next to my apartment
is n’t on the ground floor of a larger building .
Instead , whatever
structure had previously been on the site was torn down and a one - story
Wendy ’s was built in its place , almost as if one had been airlifted
from the suburbs and tucked snuggly into the tiny space between older ,
traditional Philadelphia buildings of first - floor businesses with two
or three apartments above .
The distance between the Wendy ’s kitchen
vents and the back of my third - floor apartment next door , then , is very
short .
There is , to be sure , lemonade to be made of living next to Wendy’s .
Because this one was built in the classic Wendy ’s architectural style ,
and not in any way that acknowledged its dense urban surroundings , it
has one of those greenhouse - like dining rooms with windows that look
out over two streets .
I ’ve always found the Wendy ’s solarium to be a
nice touch for diners , but , against a sidewalk , it means that
pedestrians have the pleasure of an up - close look at what people are
eating .
I like seeing what people eat .
I also get to see how people
treat a space like a Wendy ’s dining room , which can be equally
interesting .
Some will sit there for a while after eating , reading or
doing crossword puzzles below plastic ivy in hanging baskets .
I ’ve seen
some who sit there for hours and just stare out the window .
A lot of
these people are recurring characters in the Wendy ’s tableau .
At the same time , there are a bunch of bars in the area , plus a
methadone clinic down the street , so sometimes you get more than the
crossword - puzzle crowd .
It ’s not uncommon for people to use the small
alcove on the building ’s side as a bathroom .
Last week I saw a guy
passed out in the solarium , his face held up by a small Frosty cup .
Sleeping at this Wendy ’s is , in fact , neither rare nor ( judging from
the amount of people who do ) discouraged .
That there ’s only a tiny undrivable alley behind Wendy ’s and my
apartment presents additional problems .
This means that trash trucks
ca n’t collect from the rear , so the restaurant must store its garbage
in a room that opens to the street .
When it ’s time to clean that room ,
the dirty water runs all over the sidewalk .
This leaves behind a greasy
film , a slippery layer of fat that makes you wish you were walking
through the urine instead .
And about once a week , not too long after
the restaurant ’s 1 a.m. close , a loud tractor trailer parks on one
street , lowers a metal ramp down into the store , and a delivery man
unloads cases of hamburger meat , French fries , and chicken nuggets .
If
you ’re asleep , you wake up ; if you ’re trying to get home to sleep , you
have to climb over a metal ramp .
For four years , nothing but the menu changed at this Wendy’s .
Then ,
a few months ago , they installed a game called Stacker on the wall next
to the condiment counter .
In Stacker , a square slides across a row on a
video screen until you stop it by hitting a button , at which point a
new square will start sliding across the next row .
Successfully sack
the squares and you can win anything from fake teeth to an iPod .
I’ve
never seen Stacker in a fast food restaurant before , and I ’ve yet to
see anyone in Wendy ’s play it .
Random , right ?
And yet …
For all the nuisance its brings to the neighborhood , for
its effrontery to smart urban design , for all its weirdness and
smells , the Wendy ’s works in some strange way .
Maybe it ’s the nature of
living in a city , where relationships are as complex , as give and take ,
as any family ’s .
Sure there are people who pee on the side of the
Wendy ’s , but some people have pets who pee on their furniture , and that
actually seems worse .
Wendy ’s does leave the sidewalk greasy , but other
people have neighbors that they can only speak to through Dr. Phil .
At
the Border ’s around the corner from me , employees wake you if they find
you asleep in one of those oversized chairs tucked into bends in
bookshelves ( I know this first - hand ) , but nobody will wake you up at
Wendy’s .
And on rare occasions , say once a year , I ’ve found that a
soft - boiled egg broken over a Wendy ’s baked potato makes for an OK
dinner when the refrigerator is empty .
At the end of the day , I guess it ’s better than living in one of
those weird ghost towns of foreclosured McMansions .
You ca n’t win an
i Pod there .

George Soros joins the great howling majority saying that the Paulson plan is weak .
What 's more , he says , the conditions that Congress and the Senate have tacked onto the plan just make it less likely to work , because the banks will be less likely to subject themselves to it ( he 's right ) .
What Hank Paulson should do instead with his $ 700 billion , Soros says , is buy bank equity , not crap assets .
( This is what most other smart people are saying , too . )
George notes that , because banks borrow $ 12 for every $ 1 of equity , this $ 700 billion would produce $ 8.4 trillion of lending power .
It would also solve the real credit problem : a lack of capital .
And ... here 's the kicker ... it would encourage private investors , including George Soros , to step up and take advantage of low bank - stock prices to buy even more equity .
We and hundreds of others have been shouting down a rainbarrel about this equity vs. crap assets problem , but , regrettably , no one in Washington is paying any attention to us .
The answer is so simple and so obvious .
Our only hope at this point is that , when / if the neutered Paulson plan does n't achieve the desired results , Hank will decide to start investing his bailout money in equity instead of toxic trash .
George Soros ( from the FT ) :
Instead of just purchasing troubled assets the bulk of the funds ought to be used to recapitalise the banking system .
Funds injected at the equity level are more high - powered than funds used at the balance sheet level by a minimal factor of twelve - effectively giving the government $ 8,400 bn to re-ignite the flow of credit .
In practice , the effect would be even greater because the injection of government funds would also attract private capital .
The result would be more economic recovery and the chance for taxpayers to profit from the recovery .
This is how it would work .
The Treasury secretary would rely on bank examiners rather than delegate implementation of Tarp to Wall Street firms .
The bank examiners would establish how much additional equity capital each bank needs in order to be properly capitalised according to existing capital requirements .
If managements could not raise equity from the private sector they could turn to Tarp .
Tarp would invest in preference shares with warrants attached .
The preference shares would carry a low coupon ( say 5 per cent ) so that banks would find it profitable to continue lending , but shareholders would pay a heavy price because they would be diluted by the warrants ; they would be given the right , however , to subscribe on Tarp ’s terms .
The rights would be tradeable and the secretary of the Treasury would be instructed to set the terms so that the rights would have a positive value .
Private investors , including me , are likely to jump at the opportunity .
The recapitalised banks would be allowed to increase their leverage , so they would resume lending .
Limits on bank leverage could be imposed later , after the economy has recovered .
If the funds were used in this way , the recapitalisation of the banking system could be achieved with less than $ 500bn of public funds .
Do n't like Soros ?
Here 's another voice saying exactly the same thing in the WSJ .

Kiyoshi Ito , a mathematician whose innovative models of random motion are used today in fields as diverse as finance and biology , died Nov. 10 at a hospital in Kyoto , Japan .
He was 93 .
His death was confirmed by his daughter , Junko Ito .
Mr. Ito is known for his contributions to probability theory , the study of randomness .
His work , starting in the 1940s , built on the earlier breakthroughs of Albert Einstein and Norbert Wiener .
Mr. Ito ’s mathematical framework for describing the evolution of random phenomena came to be known as the Ito Calculus .
“ People all over realized that what Ito had done explained things that were unexplainable before , ” said Daniel Stroock , a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Mr. Ito ’s research was theoretical , but his models served as a tool kit for others , notably in finance .
Robert C. Merton , a winner of the Nobel in economic science , said he found Mr. Ito ’s model “ a very useful tool ” in his research on the evolution of stock prices in a portfolio and , later , in helping develop a theory for pricing stock options that is used on Wall Street today .
Mr. Ito , he said , was “ a very eminent mathematician . ”
Bacon may be America 's current favorite pork product , inspiring countless 21st - century memes and t- shirt slogans , from " You had me at bacon " to " Keep calm and put bacon on . "
But the passion for cured pork stretches far back through history — and to many other parts of the world .
Bacon in Ancient and Medieval Times
Salted pork belly first appeared on dining tables thousands of years ago in China .
Pork curing methods spread throughout the Roman Empire , and Anglo - Saxon peasants cooked with bacon fat .
Until well into the 16th century , the Middle English term bacon or bacoun referred to all pork in general .
The word bacon derives from various Germanic and French dialects , including the Old French bacun , Old High German bacho ( meaning buttock ) and Old Teutonic backe , which refers to the back .
But the cut typically used to make bacon comes from the side , or belly , of the hog .
In modern England , a side of bacon is called a " gammon " and a thin slice of bacon is known as a " rasher " .
In the 12th century , a church in the English town of Great Dunmow promised a side of bacon to any married man who could swear before the congregation and God that he had not quarreled with his wife for a year and a day .
A husband who could " bring home the bacon " was highly regarded by the community for his forbearance .
Bacon in the New World
Queen Isabella sent eight pigs to Cuba with Christopher Columbus , but the National Pork Board credits Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto as the " father of the American Pork Industry . "
He brought 13 pigs to the shores of the New World in 1539 ; within three years his herd had grown to 700 .
Native Americans reportedly fell in love with the flavor and readily accepted pigs and pork products as peace offerings .
By 1653 , a rapidly expanding , free - roaming and unruly swine population nearly thwarted Dutch construction of a wall on Manhattan Island meant to keep the British and Native Americans out of New Amsterdam .
The site later became known as Wall Street .
Pigs continued to run wild in New York City into the 19th century .
Bacon on the Modern Table
In a health - conscious age , you might expect to find fatty bacon low on the list of preferred foods .
But Americans are eating more pork now than they have in decades — and as anyone who dabbles in pork belly commodities can tell you , bacon can singlehandedly boost the pork market .
Americans eat 70 percent of their bacon with breakfast , but the crispy , salty meat also stars as a sandwich ingredient and a favorite of chefs in fine dining establishments — causing bacon shortages and price hikes at times .
Still , bacon remains a bargain when it comes to adding flavor .
Bacon aficionados enjoy the cured meat in everything from classic dishes like chowders to more adventurous concoctions such as bacon ice cream , chocolate - covered bacon , and bacon jam .
With low - sodium and lean varieties available , even a dieter can partake in moderation .
Google is taking some heat this morning from a Wall Street Journal piece that argues the company is abandoning its support of network neutrality in an attempt to make sites like YouTube faster than the competition .
The WSJ claims Google has approached major internet service providers " with a proposal to create a fast lane for its own content . "
That would seem to fly in the face of the company 's long - standing support for network neutrality , but Google has called the WSJ 's article " confused , " and says that it remains committed to network neutrality .
The contention comes from the varying definitions of network neutrality .
The simplest version of network neutrality says all internet traffic should delivered at the same speed over the same network .
Unfortunately for supporters of the everything - is - absolutely - equal version of network neutrality , the concept has always been an ideal , more of a myth than reality .
The problem lies with what are known as content delivery networks
( CDNs ) that use so - called edge servers , located physically closer to you , to cache and deliver content faster .
When you request the content from , in this case YouTube , it can be transmitted from the proposed edge servers rather than from Google 's central servers .
That means faster downloads for YouTube , but it also means a significantly less strain on bandwidth for the rest of the web .
For example , imagine you download a YouTube movie , the next time someone on the same network wants to access the same file , the network can simply pass through the cached ( and therefore faster ) version .
Edge servers reduce the need for ISPs to handle traffic outside their networks , which is one of the primary bottlenecks for internet speed .
Services like Akamai , Limelight and other CDNs are a common , if expensive , way for larger sites ( with the money ) to ensure that their data is transmitted faster ( for instance , this page you 're reading right now is cached and served by Akamai ) .
The WSJ article refers to a Google project known as OpenEdge , which ( as Google explains on its Public Policy blog )
is a plan to put its own edge - cache servers directly inside ISP
networks .
The idea of the plan is that downloading a YouTube video or Picasa photo album is faster .
Google has offered to " colocate " caching servers within broadband providers ' own facilities ; this reduces the provider 's bandwidth costs since the same video would n't have to be transmitted multiple times .
We 've always said that broadband providers can engage in activities like colocation and caching , so long as they do so on a non-discriminatory basis .
What 's more , Google and other net - neutrality supporters have long made a notable exception for edge caching and believe that such practices actually make for faster overall internet .
Consider the web as we know it : the vast majority of it is text , which does n't require a tremendous amount of bandwidth .
But then there are video and streaming services which do require massive amounts of bandwidth .
Without edge caching , the video traffic would , as the joke goes , " clog the tubes " and effectively slow down the web .
Defenders of Google 's plan argue that the company is doing nothing different that what Akamai does .
But there is a difference .
Akamai has no content of its own and therefore it 's always in Akamai 's best interest to ensure that all its traffic is treated the same .
Google , on the other hand , does have its own content and , obviously , it has a vested interest in making that content faster and more accessible than its competitors .
Google caches within an ISP 's network could make Picasa twice as fast as Flickr , Orkut faster than Facebook and so on .
Of course , keep in mind that Microsoft , Amazon , Yahoo and others also have various deals with ISPs to speed up their content through edge servers .
In fact , Amazon recently launched CloudFront , a pay - as - you - go CDN .
Google has n't said much about its goals for OpenEdge , but it would n't be a stretch to imagine the service will eventually lead to some APIs that create a Google competitor to Amazon 's CloudFront service .
So is the WSJ right ?
Well , while it seems logical to argue that edge caching gives those that use it an unfair fast lane on the web , the reality is that , without edge caching , the whole web might be quite a bit slower .

MIDI Basics
What it is , how it works , why it 's important
and how to hook it up in your home studio
by Rich the TweakMeister
MIDI 101
1. Understand MIDI data
2 . How to setup a keyboard and sequencer
3. Configuring Ports , Channels , Tracks and Instruments
O k , professional mixologists , filter - heads , LFO - freakoids , Vintage synth - masters , and advanced sample rippers please click here to go back to the end of the article , where I will let you back in .
And do n't smirk at these new dudes on the way out !
This article is for the newbie who wants to get going using MIDI and audio and making their own music .
This is the most basic of the basics .
Its for the person who knows nothing at all about MIDI and audio technology but wants to learn really fast and learn everything you need to know for success .
So I should only have Newbies here now .
Cool .
Do n't worry about all those " pro " elitists , they were here once themselves ( and probably not long ago ) .
Lucky for you , the Tweak is your teacher .
Pay attention ' cause there is a test at the end .
Let the TweakMeister get you up to speed in 10 minutes .
In this article we talk about MIDI , then next we 'll get into AUDIO and after that we 'll ties them together and discuss the Basic Recording Studio .
Let me say it now .
Those that succeed as home electronic musicians understand MIDI .
You can try to get by without it , but it will dog you at every turn .
Do n't think the MIDI is only something that keyboard players need to know .
Today , MIDI controller data is used to automate a variety of studio gear , including the hardware and software mixing consoles we use .
Read the next paragraphs several times , slowly .
MIDI is made of Controller and Note DATA , not Audio .
MIDI , the Musical Instrument Digital Interface is a protocol developed in 1983 by major synthesizer manufacturers to allow one synth to play another remotely .
They tried to figure out a way they could make a second synthesizer play by sending it control data from the first .
They figured it out , and more !
The developers quickly found out a computer could record and playback 16 channels of this data and it revolutionized the way music is produced .
Then they discovered with the right hardware you can have several of these 16 channel bundles ( or ports ) all running at once .
The implications were profound .
Now one person could compose multi-part music all by themselves .
IMPORTANT : MIDI works by sending NOTE ON and NOTE OFF events down a midi cable as well as timing information and controller ( knobs , wheels , and sliders ) information .
Read that again , OK ?
MIDI works by sending NOTE ON and NOTE OFF events down a midi cable as well as timing information and controller ( knobs , wheels , and sliders ) information .
MIDI does not send sound , or audio down the MIDI cable .
---->
Understand that MIDI is NOT an audio signal <-----
The sound ( or audio waveform ) of the keyboard or module does not go down the MIDI cable , only these computer encoded " events " do .
What is an " event ? "
It 's all just numbers , man .
But not the large blocks of numbers that make up an audio waveform .
MIDI events are just ones and zeros that say when you pressed down which key ( a note ON event ) , how hard you pressed it ( velocity number ) , when you let the key up ( a note OFF event ) , pressed the next key , moved a knob ( controller data ) , changed a program ( program change command ) .
That is the basic point you have to fully understand .
The cool thing is that all this MIDI data , once recorded , is fully , totally , completely editable , malleable , changeable , transformable , re-assignable , erasable , replaceable and it all happens on the edit screens of your sequencer .
This is MIDI Data
Notice that in this screen " position " is the time stamp , " num " is the midi note on command , " val " is the velocity value and length / info is the length in ticks .
240 has the duration of an eighth note
How MIDI Works
MIDI Sequencers ( i.e. , Sonar , Logic , Cubase ) work by recording these NOTE ON / OFF events along a timing grid that can be played back at any tempo .
When you press Play on a sequencer , it simply sends the data back to the synth , which turns on the notes and plays it just like a player piano .
Get it ?
Because the Synth receives the exact same events that it sent when you played the track , it sounds exactly the same .
If it does n't sound like you want you can edit it on the screen .
That is how MIDI data is converted to sound .
Once the synth is playing back a midi track , now you can record that track as an audio track , assuming you have a hardware MIDI synth , by connecting the analog outputs of the synth to the soundcard line inputs and pressing record .
Now you have an audio track .
Makes sense so far ?
Cool .
If not , read that paragraph again .
It 's critical .
MIDI devices ( i.e. , keyboards , hardware sound modules and control surfaces ) typically have 16 channels they can send and receive on .
Much like your TV , you can have a different program on each channel .
The only difference is that MIDI can play all 16 channels at the same time .
These channels correspond to tracks in your sequencer .
On each track , you can assign a different instrument .
A typical starter MIDI keyboard may have hundreds of instruments to choose from .
You record each track while the previous tracks play back .
Because MIDI has 16 channels , you can have 16 instruments playing together , like a 16 piece band , if you want , that is totally of your own design .
Core Concept : MIDI data can be recorded as sequences of notes onto different tracks which correspond to channels
MIDI IN , Out and Thru ( Standard MIDI jacks )
Why is MIDI confusing ?
Because the terms change depending on your vantage point .
From the vantage point of the computer , the MIDI out goes " to " a device , like a keyboard .
The MIDI in comes " from " a device , like a keyboard or drum controller .
From the standpoint of the keyboard , the MIDI out goes to a computer or another device .
When you play notes on the keyboard , data goes out the MIDI out of the keyboard .
It does not go through the MIDI Thru .
Keyboard MIDI OUT -------->Computer MIDI IN
Computer MIDI OUT -------->Keyboard MIDI IN
Keyboard MIDI
Thru------->exact copy of the data coming in the keyboard MIDI in
The Computer MIDI out passes through the Keyboard 's MIDI IN and then to the Thru .
The data coming out the keyboard MIDI thru jack is exactly the same as that which arrived at the MIDI in from the computer .
However , and here it gets tricky , the data going out the MIDI out of the keyboard does NOT go through the MIDI thru .
Only data coming into the keyboard goes out the thru .
Got it ?
If you understand that simple point you will be ahead of most people .
Whew !
USB MIDI
USB MIDI i/o is simpler to deal with from a conceptual point of view .
Data flows in both directions down a single cable .
There is no " MIDI Thru " is USB , so you cannot daisy chain .
MIDI PORTS : How we get MIDI data into and out of the computer
There are 16 channels for every hardware MIDI IN and OUT PORT ( MIDI i/o ) on your computer .
Your computer 's audio interface may have MIDI i/o , and if not you can buy a MIDI interface to add MIDI i/o .
First lets look at all the ways you can get MIDI data to your computer .
Going IN to the Recording Software : 5 ways
MIDI IN Ports :
There are 5 basic ways to bring MIDI data into a computer .
You need to have at least one of them to connect a keyboard or controller .
1 . Some keyboards ( not all ! ) come with built - in USB MIDI interfaces .
For these you just connect the USB cable to the computer and install a driver ( if required ) .
The port will show up in your software .
Example of a keyboard controller with USB MIDI .
You do n't need a MIDI interface if you connect via USB .
See more controllers
2 . Many soundcards and audio interfaces may have a built - in MIDI interface .
The M - Audio 2496 , Delta 1010 , Emu 1820 M , MOTU 828 mk2 , Tascam FW1884 ( and FW 1082 ) are examples of devices that have built - in MIDI ports .
Here you connect your gear to the standard MIDI jacks on the interface .
The M- Audio Fast Track Ultra USB 2.0 Audio Interface is a USB 2.0 audio interface that has a MIDI in and out port on the back .
See my chart that shows which audio interfaces offer MIDI ports
3 . In this case that you do n't have a built - in hardware MIDI interface on your soundcard or a USB MIDI interface on your keyboard ( or controller ) , you have to purchase a separate MIDI Interface .
They are not expensive and are generally more reliable than joystick ports .
Usually the interface connects by USB to the computer and you connect your MIDI hardware via the standard MIDI jacks on the interface .
Example of a separate USB MIDI interface .
See more USB MIDI Interfaces
4. Various MIDI Cable Conversion Interfaces .
There are conversion cables that , along with device drivers , can turn various connectors on PCs to MIDI ports .
There are basically 2 types .
1 . The Joystick port to MIDI cable ( These are primarily for soundblaster soundcards ) , 2 . The serial port to MIDI cable .
These cable devices are typically only as reliable as the drivers .
You want to make sure they are compatible with your operating system .
While these are often inexpensive they may have an issue with your system .
If you have to go cheap , go with a USB to MIDI cable like an Emu X - MIDI or M-audio MIDI sport UNO
5 . There are a lot of older rack midi interfaces .
There are bound to be many on ebay and in the pawn shops .
With these you must be very careful , especially if they were designed for Windows 95 , 98 and for older DOS based computers .
These typically connect by serial or parallel ports .
Steer clear .
Without a functioning driver , these midi interfaces will not work .
If you have a number of midi input devices like keyboards , drum machines , controllers and control surfaces they each need a way to connect to the computer .
You can have a USB keyboard , a drum machine connected through a MIDI port and a control surface connected by a 2nd midi port and all 3 will input data simultaneously to the track you are recording .
Methods can be mixed an matched .
You computer will see and use all MIDI inputs connected , whether they are on your soundcard or interface , are connected through your USB hub , or are coming from a separate MIDI interface .
To send control events , ( i.e. , " notes " ) to your sequencer any keyboard with a MIDI out will work , even if it sounds like crap .
Remember , you only need it to trigger the NOTE ON NOTE OFF event to the sequencer , which will send them to your available synths , which will send the sound to the speakers .
Get it ?
Though the playing happened at the keyboard , the sound can be triggered at any MIDI sound source , whether they exist in hardware or software .
You can even use an old CASIO with the speakers ripped out as long as it has a MIDI out .
To Review : External MIDI IN ports bring MIDI data from outside to inside the computer , where it can be recorded , and sent back out the MIDI OUT port to the external device upon playback .
Going OUT of the Recording Software to hardware and software synths
Now lets look at how MIDI data leaves the sequencer application in the computer and goes to different devices that make sound , both inside and outside the computer .
External Ports :
The recorded data goes out of the sequencer to the MIDI out port which is connected to the MIDI in port on your hardware instruments .
The obvious example here is the computer that sends MIDI data back to a hardware synthesizer .
The instrument receives the data and plays the sound .
Virtual Ports : Internal MIDI ports direct data to sound sources inside your computer .
Your sequencer can create a virtual MIDI OUT port for every software synthesizer on your system .
Up to 16 MIDI channels can be available for this virtual port , though a typical softsynth may not use them all .
An internal virtual MIDI port may also go to a MIDI synthesizer that is built into your soundcard ( Soundblaster cards have these ) or to a small software synth installed in your operating system , such as the Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth , which is part of Windows XP .
In this example , from Sonar 4 , I have 2 hardware external MIDI ports ( the E - DSP entries , which were created when I installed my EMU 1820 m audio interface ) and 3 internal virtual ports , the MS GS Wavetable SW synth , Pro 53 , and Cakewalk TTS .
( the TTS was created when I installed Sonar , and I bought the Pro 53 as an add - on ) I can route the track to any channel on any port .
The External MIDI port will show up in your sequencer application after you install the drivers .
When you use a software synth , a virtual MIDI port is created and will show up in your sequencer application as soon as the soft synth is " instantiated " ( that 's just a buzzword for " initialized . " or started . )
Configuring your MIDI System 's Ins and Outs
Figure 1 : Basic MIDI setup using a 1 port USB MIDI interface with standard MIDI jacks Keyboard MIDI OUT --------->MIDI Interface IN ( required ! ) MIDI Interface USB OUT ----> Computer USB IN ( required ! ) MIDI Interface OUT --------->Keyboard MIDI IN ( if you are only using your software synths this connection is not required .
If you want the computer to play the sounds on your keyboard , or if you want to connect a 2nd module it is required ) Keyboard MIDI THRU ------->Keyboard or Module # 2 MIDI IN ( optional ) Keyboard or Module # 2 MIDI THRU ----->
Keyboard or Module # 3 MIDI IN ( optional )
Take a look at some Keyboards , MIDI Modules , and Software Synths
Connecting Keyboards and Modules :
The sequencer MIDI out port can connect back to your keyboard 's MIDI IN and play up to 16 channels of voices if the keyboard is " multi- timbral " ( meaning it can sound many instruments at once ) .
Some synths are not .
Old keyboards , like a DX7 , only respond to 1 channel unless you hot rod it .
You can usually set the keyboard to respond to only one channel if you want or to only channels 1,2,3,7,8 , for example , or to all 16 .
Turning off channels allows you to daisy chain more keyboards or modules by cabling up the 2nd machine from the MIDI THRU on the 1st machine ( which is an exact copy of the data coming in the MIDI IN ) to the MIDI IN of the second machine .
It is possible to have one MIDI port to control 16 different keyboards if you want it too !
Usually , if your rig gets this large you will buy a MIDI interface with 4 ports so you can play all 16 channels of your Triton on one port .
On a second port you might have with 10 channels from your Proteus 2000 , a couple for your Electribe , one for each of your 3 effects box , and the last for your drum machine .
Port 3 may use all 16 channels for a control surface and Port 4 might use all 16 more for a digital mixer ... ooops sorry , I forgot we are just getting started .
Example of how the SEQUENCER MIDI OUTS can be routed to External keyboards and Software Instruments
Once you have configured your MIDI system ( see Figure 1 above ) you should note how the channels inside the sequencer can be routed to different sources both inside and outside the computer ( see Figure 2 below ) .
On every MIDI track in the sequencer , you specify where it goes .
The more gear you have , the more places you can send the data .
You could take the bassline you just recorded and route it to a virtual drum machine , edit the notes so they all trigger kick drums , for example .
Or make a Marcato String cadence on your Triton , copy the data to another track , assign the track to Module 2 and have the same data play an ambient synth pad .
The two together sound like a very dreamy string section .
Get the idea ?
The flexibility of routing MIDI data allows for tremendous creative expression .
Below you see a MIDI system with 3 hardware devices and 3 software devices .
You can achieve that with just one hardware MIDI port .
Figure 2 : Flow from Sequencer MIDI OUTs to Synths MIDI INs
Advanced MIDI
In / Out / Thru Brain - Teasers
Lets say you have 2 machines daisy - chained on the same MIDI OUT port .
That is , the keyboard MIDI IN is connected to the computer MIDI out and MIDI sound module # 1 MIDI IN is connected to the Keyboard 's MIDI THRU ( see Figure 1 again for an example of daisy chaining ) .
Now lets look at figure 2 again .
If you are sending a track down channel 7 from the sequencer and have the Keyboard turned OFF on channel 7 , What will happen ?
The keyboard will ignore the data but will still pass it to the next module .
Why is that ?
Because all of the data coming in to the keyboard is also going out the MIDI THRU , MIDI sound module # 1 will play the track .
So you ask , what happens if channel 7 is set to ON for both devices ?
Bingo dude !
You got it , they both play .
Now if each synth was on a different PORT , would both synths make a sound .
Nope !
Why not ?
Each port is totally discrete , that is separate .
The data on Port A does not go down Port B .
To recap , remember , each port has 16 channels of its own .
The Port is the parent ; the channel is the child .
So , lets jump ahead , if you get a midi interface that has 8 ports , how many channels do you have ?
Yes , you math genius , 128 .
Does that mean you can connect 128 keyboards to ONE 8 port midi interface .
YES !
But do n't call me to wire it ok ?
Most people put each synth on it's own dedicated port so they do n't have to turn channels on and off all the time .
The m-audio 2496 is an inexpensive reliable soundcard for music production and has a built in MIDI port .

Age Of Ignorance
A place to post my comments which had been censored on another blog and to coment on their antics and nefarious deeds .
Back in her time as a Christianist culture warrior in Wasilla , Alaska , Sarah Palin demanded total transparency from her moderate Republican opponent :
Within a few months , Palin was officially challenging Stein and exploiting the cultural shift masterfully .
She welcomed a national anti-abortion group in to carpet bomb Wasilla with pink postcards affirming her pro-life bona fides .
She orchestrated an NRA endorsement and a mailing from the group falsely proclaiming Stein , a lifelong hunter , " anti-gun . "
( Stein complained to the local newspaper that Palin was telling voters he wanted to " melt down " all the firearms in the state . )
And , in a move practically out of Karl Rove 's playbook , she dwelled on how Stein 's wife used her maiden name , going so far as to demand a marriage certificate as proof of their nuptials .
Palin 's campaign literature proclaimed her " deeply devoted to conservative family values " -- all in the context of an ostensibly nonpartisan election .
( Stein himself was a moderate Republican . )
So it is part of Palin 's record to demand the marriage license of a fellow Republican , but to ask for any medical confirmation of the mysterious birth of Trig earlier this year , any affidavit from the obstetrician , any objective evidence at all that Trig is indeed Sarah Palin 's biological child is , well , in the words of John Podhoretz , " virtually unspeakable . "
Look : this is usually not hard at all .
Births are recorded at the hospitals where they occur .
And , as you might expect , there 's a long list of babies born at Mat - Su Medical center , where we are told Trig was born on April 18 this year .
But for some reason , Trig Palin 's name is not among them .
Why would a hospital exhaustively record all births on their premises and leave out easily the most famous baby ever born there ?
There were only 24 births at Mat - Su in April of this year : it 's not like they could have mislaid one .
So why is there no formal record of Trig 's birth ?
This is not an " unspeakable " question .
It 's a simple factual one .
Presumably there 's an explanation .
Perhaps the Palins decided that it would be an invasion of Trig 's privacy to have the birth actually recorded in the hospital where he was born .
But at least they should be able to tell us that .
Or perhaps the hospital decided for some reason not to record that one birth .
I have no idea .
I do know that if Sarah Palin were running against Sarah Palin , she would demand evidence , as she did with something just as accessible with respect to John Stein 's marriage license .
How much longer are we supposed to put up with the far right running on different standards than everyone else ?
Hand over all the medical records and put Sarah Palin in front of a press conference now .
We need answers to an almost dizzyingly long list of questions and accountability for an equally long list of public lies .

Mozilla released the second beta for its Firefox 3.1 Web browser to testers Monday .
The latest release comes just seven weeks after the open source software maker launched the first beta of the version currently in the works .
“ It ’s not even been six months since we released Firefox 3 but what we ’ve noticed is that the Web continues to move really , really quickly , and so do we .
So , even before the release of Firefox 3 , we ’d already been working on what will become the next release of Firefox and when we took stock a couple of months after the release , we realized that we ’ve done a couple of really , really impressive and incredible things , ” said Mike Beltzner , director of Firefox development .
While Firefox 3 featured a dramatic speed improvement over Firefox 2 , Firefox 3.1 will have the same sort of step up , Beltzner told LinuxInsider .
“ We ’re going to be shipping a new Javascript engine called ‘ TraceMonkey ’ that ’s going to really improve the performance of the browser , especially for Web applications , but overall throughout the Web you should start feeling once again a browser even faster than Firefox 3 .
The idea was instead of waiting for a long release cycle we ’d make sure we got some of these improvements into the hands of users as soon as possible , ” he continued .
Beta Files
Available in 54 languages , Firefox 3.1 beta 2 includes both major and incremental changes , according to Beltzner .
Among the significant advancements are a “ Private Browsing Mode ” that enables users to surf the Net without leaving a trail of telltale URLs and histories .
“ [ It ] has a more granular set of history deletion tools .
It used to be that if you wanted to clear the history of your browser it was an all - or - nothing affair .
Now you can say , ‘ You know what , just erase the last couple hours of browsing history , ’ or even ‘ I want all traces of this particular Web site erased , ' ” Bletzner explained .
In addition to the TraceMonkey Javascript engine , Mozilla has included a few other enhancements .
Web Worker
Threads is a technology layer improvement that will allow developers to move some of the heavy processing of their sites away from the browser itself so that it has less of an impact on browser performance .
Downloadable fonts will enable
Web site authors to specify which font they want to appear on their page , Bletzner said .
“ Hopefully , we ’ll start seeing more interesting and pleasant fonts than the ones your computer shipped with while browsing the Web , ” he noted .
Incremental changes include improved Web rendering support , added support for Acid3 and CSS ( cascading style sheets ) properties , and also finished up support for technologies included in Firefox 3 , such as the HTML 5 offline specifications .
The new tab - switching and preview behavior previewed in the previous beta was removed due to beta 1 tester feedback .
Firefox vs. Internet Explorer
The latest beta looks like it has good additions , especially the continued evolution to TraceMonkey , Jeffrey Hammond , a Forrester Research analyst , told LinuxInsider .
“ As JavaScript becomes a more and more critical part of engaging Web sites , JavaScript performance become an important consideration .
It ’s one of the hottest areas of competition between Firefox , Internet Explorer , Safari and Chrome , ” he continued .
That said , however , the question is how will Firefox stack up against Microsoft ’s upcoming Internet Explorer 8 .
“ I think the private browsing matches up with the InPrivate capabilities of IE 8 fairly well , and both are moving toward partial support of HTML 5 .
That said , Microsoft is making some pretty substantial investments in group policy specification and community - driven rendering features to deal with the IE 7 vs. IE 8 standards view , ” said Hammond .
“ We ’ve been seeing Firefox at about 20 percent usage rates in enterprise IT , up from 12 percent a year ago .
I think that while there ’s no reason this trend can’t continue , as Microsoft commits substantial resources back into the IE space , it will increasingly become harder to convert existing IE users as long as Microsoft is showing it can innovate around features and performance as well , ” he concluded .
Funny church bloopers
I ’m not normally a huge fan of blooper - type videos , but some of these are hilarious — especially the part with the dropped communion wafer .
And watching the dog licking itself in the aisle at the wedding makes me grateful we did n’t have any pets at ours — the ring - bearer wrestling on the floor with the other little boy was more than enough diversion ( and I firmly believe every wedding should have at least one “ blooper ” moment , just so the couple has something memorable to reminisce about , since the rest of the thing tends to be a big blur ( at least mine was — a happy blur , but my big memory is hearing the fake ring we gave to the ring bearer making a ting - ting - ting sound on the floor as it dropped behind us ) .

ATLANTA -- Republican lawmakers are considering proposals for next year 's legislative session that would shorten Georgia 's early voting season and make it more difficult for close elections to reach a runoff .
State Rep. Austin Scott said he expects legislators to discuss tightening runoff guidelines in the wake of the surprising showing by Democrat Jim Martin that forced a Dec. 2 showdown with Republican U.S. Sen.
Saxby Chambliss .
He also said he was considering whether to draft a measure that would shorten Georgia 's 45 - day advance voting period .
" Most people think it was stretched out too far , " said Scott , a Tifton Republican who chairs the House committee charged with drafting electoral policy .
" Maybe two weeks would be long enough . "
Early voting began this year on Sept. 22 and expanded to more sites a week before the November election .
More than 2 million people voted during the period , and some waited in lines as long as eight hours .
Secretary of State Karen Handel , a Republican , said the long lines proved that " voters like the flexibility of having these options " but also said a thorough conversation is needed before deciding whether to revive the policy .
Her predecessor Cathy Cox , a Democrat , has said the popularity was a sign that elections officials should devote more resources toward early voting .
Scott said the six - week advance period could also expose the system to more voter fraud , and he said legislators could limit potential abuse by tightening early voting .
" The two goals of the election are access and integrity , " he said .
" And reaching that balance is sometimes easier said than done . "
Republicans could also overhaul election rules that now require a runoff if none of the candidates earn more than 50 percent of the vote .
Scott and a slew of House Republican leaders unsuccessfully proposed lowering the bar to 45 percent last year , and he said the provision could resurface from legislators concerned about the mounting costs of runoffs .
Statewide runoffs have cost tens of thousands of dollars in the past , and the Dec. 2 contest could top $ 100,000 .
" The counties have asked for that 45 percent threshold because of the cost of elections , " Scott said .
Georgia partisans have changed runoff guidelines twice in recent years .
The then - ruling Democrats passed legislation after Republican Paul Coverdell ousted Democratic U.S. Sen .
Wyche Fowler in a 1992 runoff that set the threshold for avoiding a general election runoff at 45 percent .
But after Republicans took control of the Legislature in 2004 , they changed the law again to require candidates to earn more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff .
Some claim Georgia 's runoff law was intended to thin black voting strength and prevent African - American candidates who led in primaries from making it to the general election .
Black front - runners in the primary won just 50 percent of runoffs when they faced white candidates between 1970 and 1986 , according to " Politics in Georgia . "
Democrats signaled they would fight any proposal to change the runoff policy a third time , and party spokesman Martin Matheny urged Republicans to " represent the people 's voice " instead of tinkering with electoral law .
State Rep. Rob Teilhet , D - Smyrna , warned any change could come back to haunt the GOP .
" Every time a party tries to change the election rules to help themselves , it ends up hurting them , " he said .
" We do n't need to change the runoff rule just because Saxby could n't get half the state to support him .
General Colin Powell was a swell guy when he was commanding the first war in Iraq .
And he was just super when , as Secretary of State for George W. Bush , he sold the second war in Iraq to the United Nations .
But now that he 's endorsed Barack Obama for President , Powell totally cannot be trusted — and he 's black !
So says crybaby bastard Rush Limbaugh , anyway .
Limbaugh wrote in an email ( Did they take away his radio show yet ? ) , " Secretary Powell says his endorsement is not about race .
OK , fine .
I am now researching his past endorsements to see if I can find all the inexperienced , very liberal , white candidates he has endorsed .
I 'll let you know what I come up with . "
As for Powell 's concern that a McCain presidency would result in two more conservative appointments to the Supreme Court , Limbaugh wrote : " I was also unaware of his dislike for John Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia .
I guess he also regrets Reagan and Bush making him a four - star [ general ] and secretary of state and appointing his son to head the FCC .
Yes , let 's hear it for transformational figures . "

Scalable Datasets : Bloom Filters in Ruby
When you ’re working with large datasets it ’s always nice to have a few algorithmic tricks up your sleeve , and Bloom Filters are exactly that - often overlooked , but an extremely powerful tool when used in the right context .
A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set , or more simply , it ’s an incredibly space efficient hash table that is often used as a first line of defense in high performance caches .
Database queries too expensive ?
Then a Bloom Filter might help .
As an example , Google ’s Bigtable uses a bloom filter as first lookup to avoid unnecessary disk accesses .
Bloom Filter theory and Applications
Instead of storing the key - value pairs , as a regular hash table would , a Bloom filter will give you only one piece of information : true or false based on the presence of a key in the hash table ( equivalent to Enumerable ’s include ? ( ) function in Ruby ) .
This relaxation allows the filter to be represented with a much smaller piece of memory : instead of storing each value , a bloom filter is simply an array of bits indicating the presence of that key in the filter .
Trying to build a fast spellchecker ?
Bloom filters are your best friend .
The ‘ probabilistic ’ part of the filter comes from the fact as with any Hash table , there is a probability of collision where two keys may map into the same bucket .
Hence , false positives are possible ( a filter with a single entry ( ‘ word ’ ) may indicate that ( ‘ word2 ’ ) is part of the set , but the reverse ( false - negatives ) are not possible ) .
The possibility of a false - positive is something you ’ll have to deal with ( for most caches it does n’t matter , since Bloom filters are an optimization technique to guard against the expensive operations ) , but as with any probability we can optimize it for each use case ( speed vs error rate ) .
For this exact reason , Bloom filters often use multiple hash functions for each key .
Let ’s see what that means …
Understanding the Math
Wikipedia has a great explanation of the math behind Bloom Filters , which I would encourage you to walk through , but the takeaway is that the probability of a false - positive ( where k is the number of hashing functions , n is the size of the set , and m is the size of the bloom filter in bits ) is :
Hence , we can pick a desired error rate and optimize the size of the filter to match our requirements .
In fact , if you do the math , you ’ll find an interesting rule of thumb : a Bloom filter with a 1 % error rate and an optimal value for k only needs 9.6 bits per key , and each time we add 4.8 bits per element we decrease the error rate by ten times .
Let ’s see what that means in practice for a 10,000 word dictionary :
0.1 % error rate for a 10,000 word dictionary in 18 kB of memory ?
Not bad !
Now let ’s do it Ruby .
Working with Bloom Filters in Ruby
After some poking around I ’ve resurrected Tatsuya Mori ’s sbloomfilter , fixed a few bugs , and extended the library .
To create the filter , you ’ll have to specify the size of the filter ( m ) , the number of hash functions ( k ) , and a random seed :
#!/usr/bin/env ruby require ' bloomfilter ' WORDS = % w ( duck penguin bear panda ) TEST = %w ( penguin moose racooon ) # m = 100 , k = 4 , seed = 1 bf = BloomFilter .
new ( 100 , 4 , 1 ) WORDS . each { | w | bf .
insert ( w ) } TEST . each do | w | puts " #{ w } : # { bf . include ?
( w ) } " end bf .
stats # penguin : true # moose : false # racooon : false # # Number of filter bits ( m ) : 100 # Number of filter elements ( n ) : 4 # Number of filter hashes ( k ) : 4 # Predicted false positive rate = 0.05 %
bloomfilter - rb.git - Ruby Bloom Filter implementation
Once the filter is populated you can easily view the stats and expected error rate .
Current limitations are : the hash function is fixed as CRC32 and seeded with k different values , and currently you cannot delete entries from a Bloom Filter - for that , a counting Bloom filter must be implemented .
Go forth and conquer !
GRAPHIC television advertisements that show crystal methamphetamine users being raped , threatening to kill their parents and prostituting themselves make teenagers four times more likely to approve of using the drug regularly rather than scaring them into avoiding it , an Australian study has found .
The ads , shown in the United States , are similar to a Federal Government - funded television campaign aired in Australia last year , which showed young people being arrested , picking at scabs and facing unemployment , but researchers say their studies have proven they are too graphic to be taken seriously and are a waste of money .
The Montana Meth Project , a national drug prevention program based in the north - western US state , saturated the national market with 45,000 ads on television , 35,000 on radio , 10,000 in print and 1000 on billboards between 2005 and this year , and claimed its shock tactics reduced ice use in the state by 45 per cent in teenagers and 72 per cent in adults .
But researchers at the University of Western Australia studied feedback from thousands of teenagers exposed to the campaign and found a threefold increase in the percentage of teenagers who said they did not believe using ice was risky and a fourfold increase in those who strongly approved of regular ice use .
Half thought the campaign exaggerated the risks .

I suspect that my experiences are going to be shared by quite a few people in the not - too - distant future , so why not record them ?
Table of Contents ·
Why Not iPhone ?
· Clearly , at this time , the iPhone hardware and software are slicker , and the ecosystem is bigger .
But I just ca n’t get past stories like Newber .
Well , and I already know how to program in Java and do n’t feel like picking up Objective - C and Cocoa to earn the privilege of being a sharecropper .
Hardware ·
It ’s nice .
I ’ve never actually had a “ smart ” or otherwise fancy phone before , so this is by far the nicest I ’ve owned .
Feels good in the hand .
The screen is fantastically high - quality ; the pix from here at ongoing look terrific even shrunk down .
It ’s already totally smudgy , but you only notice that when the lights are out and you ’re not using it .
The keyboard is easy to use even with big farmer ’s fingers like mine ; I ’ve made remarkably few typing errors .
Getting
It · If you join the Android marketplace ( $ 25 ) you can get one for $ 399 .
UPS wanted $ 200 + to ship it to Canada ( strengthening my opinion that UPS is a cabal of slimy banditos ) , so I shipped it to an American Sun colleague who dropped it in a Fedex to me .
It shows up in a plain white box with the requisite wires but no documentation whatsoever , except a little card saying you ca n’t get it going without a wireless data plan from your GSM provider .
· · ·
The UI In General · It ’s pretty good .
So far , I ’ve been able to figure out how to do everything I wanted , with only the occasional glance at the online PDF user guide .
Other reviewers have complained about sluggishness but it seems to run about as fast as I can think .
One of the reviewers whined that this thing having a touch - screen and a keyboard and a trackball was a sign of confusion , but that ’s just silliness , like Apple ’s contention for all those years that you should n’t want more than one button on a mouse .
In my half - day with the G1 , I ’ve found myself using all of them all the time , naturally and without thinking .
As a Phone · It seems to have all the features you might want .
My first few calls have been trouble - free .
It works just fine with my bluetooth headset .
Dialing on - screen is way easier than with the little Samsung clamshell it replaced , and if you ’re calling someone you ’ve put in your Favorites list , that ’s just two or three taps .
Reception is acceptable here at my house , which is significant because the signal quality is really poor .
Syncing ·
Like a lot of people who might pick this up , I use a Mac and its Address Book app .
Address
Book does n’t want to sync with Google unless you have an iPhone or Touch , but you can work around that .
Even though I use Gmail I ’d never actually noticed its “ Contacts ” feature .
Anyhow , as of now my contacts are on the G1 , which is nice .
Calendar sync is not yet solved , but I bet a lot of people are working on it , and it ’ll get there .
The Net · I had n’t actually been planning to use the net via GSM since I ’m usually around WiFi .
But you need it in order to get the process bootstrapped , so I signed up for a basic $ 35 / month plan with my network operator .
Roaming data rates are onerous , but if I read the settings correctly , you can tell the phone not to use them .
Canadian 3G does n’t work with the G1 so I ’m on Edge , which is faster than dial - up but not much .
On the other hand , I ’ve hooked up to several flavors of WiFi network , WEP , WPA , whatever , with no fuss at all .
WiFi reveals that the browser itself is kinda slow .
It ’s not as good as iPhone but massively better than any other allegedly - Internet - capable mobile device I ’ve used .
All they need to catch up is some fit - and - finish and that little pinch / unpinch trick for zooming .
As it is , I ’m sure I ’ll use the net regularly from the phone , which is a new thing for me .
The Apps · Gmail worked fine out of the box ; have n’t figured out how to delete messages unread yet , but I ’m sure there ’s a way .
There ’s another email program that hooks up fine to Sun ’s secure IMAP , which reminds me that I really need to do my filtering on the server not the client .
Having two email programs does n’t bother me , it ’s how I work on the mac too .
The chat program seems limited to GTalk , which is irritating but not serious , just about everybody I know uses Pidgin and does n’t object to letting it connect to GTalk .
The maps are nice , although I ’ve hardly been outside with it to give the GPS a chance ; its first shot was off by about five blocks , hmmm .
The map UI seems a little clunkier than the rest of it , I wanted to change modes all the time and had to go into the menu for that .
Programming
It · I ’m trying .
I have an idea that I ’m pretty sure will be visually pleasing if I can pull it off and , who knows , maybe useful too , in a way that might help Sun sell servers .
Hey , I even grabbed a very decent 7 - letter domain name with a “ Web 2.0 ” vibe .
There ’s a developer community happening .
I ’ve already got one question answered on #android , which is mostly l337 kernel hax0rz , but lively and amusing .
# android - dev , which is supposed to be about apps , is much quieter .
Also the Google engineers are watching both the IRC and Twitterstream ; I know because they ’ve already been in touch .
Editor 's Note :
The following article is reposted from GamePro .
Blizzard Entertainment Tuesday announced that total World of Warcraft subscribers has surpassed 11 million , equal to the population of the entire state of Ohio , according to 2007 census estimates .
The news comes as anticipation builds for the release of the game ’s second expansion pack , Wrath of the Lich King , which launches on November 13 .
“ Since debuting in North America in 2004 , World of Warcraft has become the most popular MMORPG in the world , ” Blizzard announced in a statement today .
“ In addition to being the bestselling PC game of 2007 , The Burning Crusade expansion holds the record for fastest - selling PC game of all time , with nearly 2.4 million copies sold in its first 24 hours of availability . ”
World of Warcraft is unique ( compared to most games ) in that gamers must pay a monthly subscription fee of $ 13 - 15 per month to play , in addition to buying the game for $ 30 .
The MMO has also drawn criticism from disgruntled spouses and researchers for being abnormally addictive .
This story , " Blizzard : World of Warcraft subscribers equal population of Ohio " was originally published by GamePro .
( CNN ) -- Democratic early voters outnumber Republicans in key states , according to incomplete election statistics , suggesting a surprising break from traditional trends , said analysts .
Democrat Kenneth Brown of Clayton County , Georgia , waited for hours Tuesday to vote for Sen. Barack Obama .
Just a week before a historic Election Day , registered Democrats in North Carolina are out - voting Republicans by a nearly 2 - to - 1 margin , according to official election statistics .
The state is seen as a crucial battleground for Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama .
The turnout by Democrats also appears to be higher in at least two other battleground states , Colorado and Nevada , whose electoral votes could make the difference for either White House hopeful .
As of Tuesday , at least 9,813,052 ballots had been cast in 31 states that allow early , in - person or absentee voting without having to provide an excuse .
The figures are based on reports from state election officials .
Of those votes , at least 1.2 million ballots have been cast by registered Democrats and at least 731,200 by registered Republicans .
These 1.9 million votes make up 19.6 percent of the 9.8 million early votes available for calculation by CNN.com .
Many early voting states do not specify party affiliation for voters .
As with early voting statistics in every state -- these are not election results .
Voters who are registered with a political party do n't always vote for that party 's candidates .
But the numbers suggest that this election is shattering traditional early voting patterns reflected by years of data .
Historically , more Republicans than Democrats have taken part in early voting .
Because of this , the statistics in no way provide an accurate account of party participation for the nation as a whole .
States that do provide party registration of early voters include North Carolina , Colorado , West Virginia , New Mexico , Louisiana , Iowa , Wyoming , Florida and parts of Nevada .
Figures from these states may offer insight about voting trends in the weeks before one of the most fascinating presidential elections in U.S. history .

CNN Voter Hotline
If you have a problem voting or see a problem , call the CNN Voter Hotline at 1-877- GOCNN08 ( 1-877-462-6608 ) ; CNN will report on some of your calls and our partner , InfoVoter Technologies , can help get you in touch with your election board or find your voting location .
A record - breaking 33 percent of all U.S. voters are expected to cast ballots early this year , said James Hicks of the Oregon - based Early Voting Center , a nonpartisan voter tracking group affiliated with the Pew Charitable Trust .
Hicks , who 's been working long hours through a " blur of numbers and charts " as November 4 approaches , said this year 's turnout is " astronomical " and a high Democratic turnout would be " very unusual . "
" It 's just not historically what we 've seen -- to have very high levels of Democratic turnout , " said Hicks , a self - described election geek .
" Traditionally we see white , older , wealthier people turning out for the early vote , and this time we 're seeing Democrats , we 're seeing minorities -- clearly there are some changes in the demography of early voting . "
In North Carolina , where a Democratic presidential candidate has n't won in 33 years , state election board Deputy Director Johnnie McLean has been watching the early balloting statistics pour in since voting began on October 16 .
" I was just looking at the totals a few hours ago for the first time this morning and I just could n't believe that we 've had 1.4 million to vote by absentee ballot already , " said McLean .
" Of course we also have more than 6 million voters so you have to take that into consideration . "
As of Tuesday , just over 396,000 registered Republicans had cast early votes in North Carolina , compared with registered Democrats , who had cast 771,500 ballots -- nearly twice as many .
Polls show McCain and Obama are locked in a tight contest in the state .
A CNN / Time / Opinion Research Corp. poll has Obama leading McCain by a mere 4 percentage points , 51 percent to 47 percent .
The poll -- taken between October 19 and 22 -- has a margin of error of 4 percentage points .
Early voter turnout in North Carolina is about 23 percent so far , said McLean , adding that a predicted one - third turnout for early voting would n't surprise her .
Hicks , who posts daily analysis to his blog , said , " Democrats have clearly made a strong push to get out the early vote this year and that 's paying dividends . "
Voter enthusiasm and commitment explain why most voters take the time to learn about early voting and to get out and cast ballots , according to experts .
Georgia voter Kenneth Brown stood in line for hours on Tuesday in Clayton County to vote for Democratic candidate Obama .
" I 'd be willing to stand in line again -- and vote again -- if I could , " said Brown .

Colorado and Nevada are two other states that both campaigns see as crucial .
By Tuesday , early Democratic voters in Colorado had outnumbered Republicans by 10.6 percent .
Election officials in Nevada only report party registration for Clark and Washoe counties , where the major cities of Las Vegas and Reno are located .
There , early voters have been trending heavily Democratic : 161,463 to 90,017 .
The two counties account for about 90 percent of the state 's population , and Democratic turnout is currently about 75 percent higher than turnout for Republicans , according to The Early Voting Center .
A CNN composite of several Nevada voter opinion polls released Tuesday showed Obama leading McCain by 7 percentage points -- 50 to 43 percent .
Florida , well known as a presidential battleground , has brought out nearly 1.2 million early voters so far , according to election figures .
According to figures provided Wednesday by the Florida Democratic Party , in - person early - vote ballots cast by registered Democrats in Florida totaled 772,694 .
Florida ballots cast in person by registered Republicans totaled 431,520 .
Forty - one percent of Florida 's registered voters are Democratic and 37 percent are Republican , according to state election officials .
Tuesday 's CNN composite of voter opinion polls for Florida shows Obama leading McCain by 4 percentage points , 49 percent to 45 percent .
Whatever picture the early voting statistics may paint , McLean said pundits should wait before they consider the election a done deal .
" It may be that voters later this week or on Election Day will vote the same way as the majority of folks who 've already voted , " said McLean , " but I do think that the election is not over until the last vote is counted . "
CNN 's Mallory Simon and Alissa Griffith contributed to this report .

The UN refugee agency says it has credible reports camps sheltering 50,000 refugees in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have been destroyed .
Reports suggest the camps were forcibly emptied and looted before being burned .
Aid groups say they are struggling to reach an estimated 250,000 people in the region fleeing fierce fighting between government and rebel forces .
The EU said the presidents of DR Congo and Rwanda had agreed to attend an emergency summit in the coming weeks .
After meetings in the region , Louis Michel , the European humanitarian aid commissioner , said Rwanda 's Paul Kagame had his Congolese counterpart Jospeh Kabila would meet in the Kenyan capital Nairobi .
See detailed map of the area Mr Michel said renegade rebel general Laurent Nkunda had not yet been asked to join the talks .
The commissioner told the BBC : " This conference has to have the kind of road map with complete monitoring system to assess if people who have signed this kind of agreement have delivered . "
A ceasefire is holding in and around Goma , the capital of North Kivu province , but aid agency chiefs say the situation remains highly volatile .
Stampede Food and water are scarce , and aid agencies have all but stopped work .
The BBC's Orla Guerin witnessed scenes of chaos at a refugee camp in Kibati on the outskirts of Goma , as desperately hungry people stampeded .
Children were trampled underfoot and panicked aid staff were forced to beat back the heaving crowd .
Exodus as terror spreads Q&A : DR Congo conflict
In pictures : Congo crisis Miliband flying out to DR Congo Our correspondent managed to pluck to safety one little girl who was knocked over in the melee and reunite her with her father .
Gen Nkunda 's forces are positioned some 15 km ( nine miles ) from Goma .
The origin of the ongoing conflict in eastern DR Congo is the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda .
Gen Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attack by Rwandan Hutu rebels , some of whom are accused of taking part in the genocide .
The Congolese government has often promised to stop Hutu forces from using its territory , but has not done so .
There have also been accusations of collusion between DR Congo 's army and Hutu guerrillas .
The Congolese government , for its part , has accused Rwanda of backing Gen Nkunda .
Rwanda denies this , but it has twice invaded its much larger neighbour in recent years .
' Extremely unsafe '
The UNHCR refugee agency said it was very concerned at reports that the camps in Rutshuru , 90 km ( 56 miles ) north of Goma , had been destroyed .
UN troops are struggling to prevent an escalation " There are some 50,000 people who were in those camps .
We do n't know where they would be , we 're afraid that they may have just dispersed off into the bush , " spokesman Ron Redmond said .
Gen Nkunda said on Thursday that he was opening a " humanitarian corridor " for people to return to their homes .
Those who did reach Kibati told the BBC that they had more chance of getting food in the forests and bushes around the village than inside Goma .
Gen Nkunda has threatened to take the city unless UN peacekeepers guarantee the ceasefire and security there .
The UN has more than 17,000 peacekeeping troops in DR Congo - the largest UN force in the world - but correspondents say it is struggling to cope with the crisis .
Looting , killings and rapes were reported in the city on Thursday , much of it blamed on retreating Congolese troops .

The population of elephants in Zakouma National Park has been reduced by almost 2/3 in the last two years due to organized poaching for ivory .
Only 1000 savannah elephants are now thought to survive in the park , and an urgent effort to save them has been launched by the Wildlife Conservation Society .
“ Zakouma is a last stand for elephants in the Sahel .
It ’s incredibly heartbreaking to stand before a dead elephant missing only its tusks .
How can we stand idly by and watch this population continue to get slaughtered because of simple human greed ? ” – Dr. Mike Fay , WCS conservationist in Chad
[ social_buttons ]
Ivory poachers use automatic weapons to take down the elephants , especially when herds venture outside of the park during seasonal travels .
Park guards have been killed by poachers , and civil unrest in Chad makes enforcing conservation efforts extremely difficult .
Zakouma is only 160 miles from Darfur .
“ The situation in Zakouma is dire , but there is still time to save the park ’s remaining elephants provided we can marshal the forces we need to stop poaching .
We need to continue to work closely with Zakouma ’s dedicated park guards and give them what they need to do their jobs , while our own field staff provide aerial reconnaissance and technical support . ”
- Dr. Steven E. Sanderson , WCS President
The WCS has established a fund to help finance aerial surveillance of the herds , more guards , and better equipment .
Money has already been donated to purchase a used airplane and to recruit a seasoned bush pilot to begin , but much more is needed .

Did you read all about the World Wildlife Fund ’s Earth Hour coming up on March 29th and get excited about what you can do to make a difference ?
Here are three simple things you can start with to take action :
1. Sign up for Earth Hour 2009
You can take action by signing up to participate in Earth Hour .
2. Spread the word
The most powerful tool you have is your voice .
Tell your friends , neighbors , schoolmates and coworkers , about Earth Hour .
Email the story and encourage others to sign up and further spread the good word .
Run your own Earth Hour using this tool .
3. Reduce your carbon footprint
Do your part to conserve energy .
According to Carbon Footprint , excessive electricity demand is one of the biggest culprits in terms of carbon emissions .
They have several recommendations on the many simple ways you can reduce your electricity usage , starting with lighting .
Earth
Hour is all about turning the lights out , so how about using energy - efficient lighting ?
Replace power hungry incandescent bulbs with CFL ( compact fluorescent ) or LED ( light - emitting diode ) bulbs .
Energy - saving bulbs have come a long way in recent years .
They now come in all shapes and sizes with more being introduced all the time .
It ’s Christmas time , do you have your LEDs on ?
While you ’re at it , get rid of that old fridge and replace it with an energy efficient one .
You ’ll see the difference on your electricity bill .
Ride your bike , carpool , or use transit instead of driving when possible .
Unplug electrical appliances when not in use .
All appliances use a trickle of power when plugged in even when the power is off – the cumulative effect of all that trickling power is staggering .
How about getting a programmable thermostat in your home ?
Set it a few degrees cooler overnight and especially for when you ’re out of the house .
Only run washing machines and dishwashers with a full load and air dry clothes and dishes whenever possible .
If everyone did these simple things , imagine how much energy would be saved !
It ’s never been so easy for a single individual to make a difference on such a massive scale .
We can all take a stand against climate change together if we all do our part .

UAW President : ' We wondered if we were just being set up ' by GOP David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Following the scuttling by Senate Republicans of a bipartisan bailout agreement for the troubled American automakers , United Auto Workers president Ron Gettelfinger appeared at a press briefing in Detroit to describe the last - minute negotiations in which he had been engaged and to condemn what he feels is bad faith on the part of the Republicans .
" Unfortunately the Senate Republicans , led by Senator McConnell , rejected the bipartisan legislation and restructuring process that had been agreed to by the White House , " Gettlefinger began .
Gettelfinger explained that despite having questions about whether " we were just being set up , " the UAW had agreed on Thursday to negotiate directly with Sen. Bob Corker ( R - TN ) on modifications to the bill and had reached an apparent consensus , " but the Senate Caucus rejected that agreement . "
According to Gettelfinger , the discussions with Corker largely involved bond - holders and retiree health care , which " would have made an enormous difference in the balance sheets of the companies and largely solved their financial problems . "
" Senator Corker admitted to our people ... that the other discussions over wages were largely about politics within the GOP caucus , " Gettlefinger stated , charging that using the wage issue as an excuse to reject the bill was simply a " subterfuge on the part of the minority in the Republican Party who wanted to tear down agreement that we came up with . "
The Senate GOP caucus made demands which would have " treated workers differently from every other stakeholder , instead of leaving it to the auto czar to work out the timetable and the mechanism for implementing sacrifices by all of the stakeholders , " said Gettlefinger " The GOP caucus was insisting that the restructuring had to be done on the backs of workers and retirees rather than having all stakeholders come to the table . "
Citing previous concessions by the union going back to 2003 , Gettelfinger asserted , " We 're on third base , and the other stakeholders are not even in the ball park .
...
We were prepared to make further sacrifices , but we could not accept the effort by the Senate GOP to single out workers and retirees for different treatment and to make them shoulder the entire burden . "
Republicans have continued to insist that the wage issue was genuine and not a " subtefuge " as Gettelfinger charges .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) told CNN , " The one issue that stopped this thing -- and I can tell you the Republicans wanted to get this through -- was a competitive wage over time . "
Following his initial statement , Gettelfinger was asked if he believes there is a deliberate effort going on to break the union .
In response , he quoted from an email he had been provided in which Republicans were urged to support the message that the bailout " is the Democrats ' first opportunity to pay off organized labor after the election .
..
Republicans should stand firm and take their shot against organized labor . "
" We 're a union , " Gettelfinger concluded .
" The right wing in this country have basically painted the word ' union ' to be a very negative word .
...
At the end of the day , who was the minority in the Senate representing ?
They thought perhaps they could have a two - fer here , maybe .
You know , pierce the heart of organized labor while representing the foreign brands . "

A man was arrested today after breaking into a city centre radio station and broadcasting obscenities live on air .
The man was arrested at 5 am after forcing entry to the Galaxy 102.2 studios in Birmingham 's Broad Street , a West Midlands Police spokeswoman said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A spokesman for the station said : " In the early hours of this morning ... there was an incident at the radio studios of Galaxy 102.2 in Birmingham .
" A man forced his way into the station but was arrested by the police at the scene . "
The spokesman declined to comment on how the man managed to get on air , adding : " We can make no further comment at this stage . "
A spokesman for Ofcom , the independent regulator for the UK communications industries , said no complaints had been received about the incident .
Mozilla has announced the availability of the first Mobile Firefox alpha release .
The project , which is codenamed Fennec , aims to bring the desktop Firefox browsing experience to mobile devices like MIDs and phone handsets .
This early alpha release delivers a compelling user interface and demonstrates the impressive scope of the browser 's potential on diminutive devices , but suffers from performance limitations and instability that reflect the need for significant refinement before it 's mature enough for mainstream adoption .
I tested the Fennec alpha on my Nokia N810 running Diablo , the latest stable version of the Maemo platform .
Mozilla is currently using the Nokia Internet Tablet devices as the reference platform for public testing of Fennec .
Users who do not own one of the Nokia devices can also download a version that runs in a window on regular desktop computers , much like an XULRunner application .
User interface
The Fennec user interface , which is largely designed for touchscreen devices , is simple and moderately elegant .
The top toolbar displays a URL input box with a refresh button and a button to launch the browser bookmark list dialog .
When the user begins editing the contents of the URL textbox , Fennec will display an autocompletion window , much like the " AwesomeBar " in the Firefox 3 desktop browser .
The completion window also includes buttons that will perform searches at Google and other sites with the contents of the URL box as a query .
The rest of the user interface is accessible through a gesture - based sliding system .
When the user rolls a finger across the screen and pulls to the right , the tabbing sidebar will be displayed on the left - hand side .
The tab bar displays thumbnail representations of open web pages rather than listing the page titles .
Each thumbnail is overlaid with a close button in the top left corner , and new tabs can be created by clicking the plus button at the bottom of the list .
Unlike the desktop Firefox browser , Fennec does n't support reordering tabs and does n't appear to support multiple windows .
It also has no mechanism for managing tab overflow .
The button for opening new tabs descends lower on the screen each time a new tab is opened and eventually disappears off of the bottom of the screen .
The N810 can do up to five tabs in normal mode and six tabs when displayed in fullscreen mode .
If the user creates six tabs in fullscreen mode , then the bottom one will be obscured in regular mode .
The memory constraints of the N810 make it unlikely that the user will ever be able to comfortably exceed four tabs , so this might not be a particularly relevant limitation in practice .
The right - hand sidebar has several toolbar buttons .
The top one , which is a star button for bookmarking pages , works exactly like the star in the Firefox 3.0 URL bar .
Bookmarking mostly works , but bookmark folders are n't fully implemented yet .
Beneath the star , there are back and forward buttons for navigating through the browser 's history .
There is currently no history list interface and the back / forward buttons do not display a list .
Page history is being preserved , however , because you can still see items from the browsing history in the autocompletion dialog .
The button at the very bottom of the right - hand sidebar provides access to an extended sidebar pane that provides access to browser extensions , downloads , and preferences .
The extension and download panes look identical to their respective dialog windows from the desktop browser .
The preferences pane , however , has been redesigned and simplified so that it has a more finger - friendly interface and a limited set of options .
The sliding gesture paradigm that is used to toggle the visibility of the sidebars is very interesting in principle , but it tends to be a bit frustrating in practice .
I often found the sidebars appearing arbitrarily when I was attempting to scroll down the page by dragging .
I 'm almost sold on the concept , but I think that the implementation still needs some refinement and sensitivity improvements before it will be a real winner .
I also noted some inconsistencies in dragging behavior .
When the user drags straight up , the top toolbar with the URL text box will usually disappear off the top screen , much like how it works on the iPhone browser .
But when the user has a sidebar open and does the same dragging behavior , the URL bar will remain in place and only the page will be scrolled .
If the URL bar has been scrolled off of the screen and the user slides in a sidebar , the URL bar will pop into place instantly .
Some users might consider that a usability win , but the inconsistencies felt jarring to me .
I also encountered a few instances where the top of the page would get stuck , obscured behind the URL bar .
Fennec 's advantages
Although the current user interface still needs some work , a big advantage of Mozilla 's approach is that using XUL makes it highly mutable and extremely conducive to rapid prototyping , experimentation , and extensibility .
This strength is used in some very smart ways in the first alpha , and it will enable the developers to make a much richer user interface than would otherwise be possible with only native controls .
It also opens the door for third - party developers to build and extend on it in innovative ways .
Extensions that have been designed for the desktop version of Firefox will not be directly usable on Fennec because of the significant differences in interface design , but it should be much easier to port a desktop Firefox extension to Fennec than it would be to port them to Nokia 's current microB browser .
In addition to standard browsing capabilities , Fennec also offers some features that are specifically relevant on mobile devices .
These include support for zooming , the W3C Geolocation Specification , and infrastructure for initiating calls by clicking on a phone number .
On the N810 , the user can control the zoom level by pressing the plus and minus shoulder buttons on the device .
I attempted to use Apple 's SunSpider benchmarking suite to test Fennec 's performance , but it was too intensive and caused Fennec to display several " Unresponsive Script " errors .
It could not complete the benchmark , and I had to force quit the browser .
I encountered similar errors on JavaScript - heavy web sites such as Slashdot .
The browser also crashed several times when loading various web sites .
In addition to poor stability and JavaScript performance issues on the N810 , Fennec 's user interface is also not sufficiently responsive .
It tends to feel very sluggish , and I often found myself waiting impatiently while I was pulling out sidebars and trying to switch between tabs .
It 's definitely less responsive than the simplistic pre-alpha version of Fennec that we viewed in our previous test back in April .
Mozilla Mobile director Jay Sullivan has addressed these issues in a blog entry .
He says that the primary focus so far has been on the user experience and on building an interface concept that will shine on mobile devices .
Now that the interface has started to come together nicely , he says that Mozilla 's next major focus will be on performance improvements .
Mozilla 's high - speed TraceMonkey JavaScript engine , which is still under heavy development , could also help address some of the problems .
" Fennec , the code name for the mobile version of Firefox , has reached its first alpha release for the Nokia Maemo platform .
As is the Mozilla way , we 've been doing our development in the open , and this is our ninth released milestone for Fennec .
We made the decision to label it ' alpha ' because we believe there 's enough in place that it 's worth broadening awareness to get more eyeballs on it and engage localizers , add - on developers , testers and others , " Sullivan wrote .
" The focus now is on performance and responsiveness .
We 're digging into optimizations , and there are performance projects happening in every area : the Fennec front end , layout , graphics , JavaScript , networking and more . "
Despite the numerous problems and limitations that I encountered while testing Fennec , the project is clearly evolving at a rapid pace , and the release still performs well enough to fit within the bounds of what I 'd consider acceptable for a first alpha release .
This version is n't ready for mainstream users yet , but it 's definitely worth testing for those who are interested in getting a first look at Mozilla 's vision for mobile browsing .
The Fennec alpha release is available for download from Mozilla 's FTP server .
The download links and additional information can be found in the official release notes .
For additional information , see Mark Finkle 's blog entry about the release , and the previously mentioned blog entry written by Sullivan .
Biggest Web attack of More than 1TB Reported by OVH founder Octave Klaba
The previous attack was of 620 Gbps ( Gigabits per second ) on security expert Brian Krebs ’ website , which leads to website offline for nearly a week .
OVH attacked by a botnet ( zombie army ) of hacked devices such as webcams to knock it offline .
