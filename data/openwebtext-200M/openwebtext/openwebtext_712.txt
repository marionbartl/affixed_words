" I honestly do n't think we 're bad people , " says Comcast CEO Brian Roberts . *

All he could manage was three hours at a stretch before passing out .
At first , his doctors were baffled , though they would eventually diagnose his condition as a severe form of anemia .
But for the time being , no one knew anything except that it was dangerous for Topolski to venture too far from his bed .
Topolski was a quality assurance engineer at Intel before going on disability , and he loved playing with new gadgets and software .
So in late February 2007 , he dragged himself out of the queen - size bed in his Hillsboro , Oregon , home , sat down at one of the three PCs a few feet away , and opened his latest toy , the file - sharing program Shareaza .
He was a big barbershop - harmony fan — he 'd sung baritone in Intel 's One Bit Parody quartet — and he wanted to test the software by searching for some new tracks and sharing the ones on his hard drive : tunes like the Civil War-era hit " The Vacant Chair , " and a Tin Pan Alley ode to prostitution , " She Is More to Be Pitied Than Censured . "
Topolski pointed Shareaza to his music folder .
Then he fell asleep .
And that 's when something strange happened — or rather , that 's when nothing happened .
Each time he woke up and checked his PC , he discovered there had been no activity at all .
Topolski knew that his music tastes were n't exactly mainstream ; but still , among the millions of BitTorrent , Gnutella , and eDonkey users out there who could see his files , no one wanted even one of his tunes ?
He 'd search some forums for help , then fall asleep again .
After more failed file - sharing attempts , Topolski installed a packet - sniffing application so he could log and review everything coming over his network .
He set up an online tunnel with a system administrator he knew in Brazil .
Topolski's computer would appear to be surfing from South America , not the suburbs of Portland .
That would tell him whether the problem was local .
It took him six weeks of short - burst sleuthing to reach his conclusion .
In a detailed post on DSL Reports — a site for broadband enthusiasts — under his online name , funchords , Topolski laid out a case against his Internet service provider .
Comcast appeared to be blocking file - sharing applications by creating fake data packets that interfered with trading sessions .
The packets were cleverly disguised to look as if they were coming from the user , not the ISP .
It was as if , in the middle of a phone call to a friend , Comcast got on the line and in the caller 's own voice told the friend he was hanging up , while the caller simultaneously heard the same message in the friend 's voice .
The post generated some discussion but no response from Comcast .
It did , however , catch the attention of an Associated Press reporter , who called Topolski to ask about duplicating the tests .
Topolski was happy to help and tried to provide all the assistance he could , but he lost touch with the reporter after doctors told him that , in addition to anemia , he had a massive malignant tumor in his colon .
Months later , as he recuperated in the hospital after the tumor was removed , Topolski heard again from the AP reporter .
The wire service had conducted its own tests on Comcast 's network and the results had been equally damning .
The resulting story about Comcast 's misdeeds had gone viral .
" Oh yeah , I think I kind of heard about that , " Topolski said , the sedatives still surging through him .
" It was a pretty big deal , " the reporter reminded him .
" Pretty surprising , " Topolski mumbled .
" I do n't think you understand , " the reporter insisted .
" This is a really big deal . "
For Brian Roberts , 2008 was supposed to be the year Silicon Valley crowned him the most important person in its world .
In five years as CEO of Comcast , the 49 - year - old had turned his father 's middling cable TV company into a media behemoth with $ 31 billion in annual revenue .
Robb Topolski caught Comcast blocking Internet traffic , which prompted an FCC investigation .

Sure , the tech metaphor of the moment was the cloud , but — metaphor be damned — Roberts knew that nothing could happen without the pipes .
You needed big , fat cables to get all those petabytes of data there and back .
And increasingly , those pipes belonged to Comcast .
He did n't seek this kind of power .
He spent the early part of the decade scooping up cable operations , but that was just to increase Comcast 's customer base .
Roberts provided packages that bundled TV , phone , and Internet , offering faster and faster speeds and luring away more and more customers from the phone companies , who could n't keep up .
( Comcast is now the third - largest telephone company in the US as a result . )
As callers ditched their landlines , they tended also to abandon DSL , which the phone companies made difficult to buy as a stand - alone product .
" DSL , " Roberts told investors recently , " is the new dialup . "
Today , the company has 14.7 million broadband Internet customers , making Roberts the largest provider of high - speed access to the home , and sometime early this year he is set to wrest the title of largest broadband provider , period — to homes or businesses — from AT&T .
Sure , new technologies are constantly being touted as potential rivals : 4G wireless , municipal Wi -Fi , fiber .
But none of them really have a chance .
By the end of 2007 , 22 cents of every dollar spent on broadband in the US went directly to Comcast .
And that figure looks like it 's only going to increase ; the number of ways to connect to the Internet reliably and at high speed is shrinking , not growing .
" There 's this magical thinking , both in the tech community and the regulatory community , that competition will solve all problems , " says Craig Moffett , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein .
" Well , get over it .
The evidence says we 're not going from two pipes to three but from two pipes to one . "
If Comcast is the one pipe that dominates , that 's because its main rivals are coming up short .
Verizon has spent the past few years trying to steal Roberts ' Internet and TV subscribers with a $ 20 billion fiber - optic project called FiOS , while AT&T has its own $ 8 billion fiber product called U -verse .
But together they cover only about 20 percent of the country , and analysts project that because of costs , they will stall at 40 percent .
And reach is only one of their handicaps .
In 2008 , Roberts launched upgrades that made AT&T 's 18 - Mbps U - verse seem like a throwback to acoustically coupled modems .
Verizon 's problem is economics .
It costs the company $ 4,000 to hook up each customer to FiOS , which now offers speeds as fast as 50 Mbps ; Roberts spends less than $ 50 to give one of his customers the equivalent upgrade .
As for wireless — supposedly the biggest threat to fat cable wires buried underground — no one really believes it can offer the bandwidth that consumers want at a reasonable price .
Still , Roberts does n't want to be thought of as merely the lord of the world 's dumb pipes .
He wants to be known as an innovator , a reputation he planned to burnish in 2008 .
Early last year , Roberts was ready to debut a reborn Comcast , a company that would turn those pipes into magical delivery systems .
At the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in early January , he delivered the first keynote ever given by a cable CEO .
" We must be the technology leader , " he said from the stage , reeling off a list of new initiatives , like a Hulu - style video - streaming feature called Fancast ( which debuted about the same time as Hulu ) and a new open software platform called tru2way , designed to allow small , third - party iPhone - like apps to be added to any Comcast - connected TV .
He promised incredible customer support and the rollout of Docsis 3.0 — a new Internet service with speeds that will eventually exceed 100 Mbps .
" I believe Comcast is the company you will want to partner with to give consumers what they really want . "
He ended with a declaration that Comcast was a different company now .
" It 's a whole new year for Comcast , " Roberts said , his eyes darting around the room .
" A whole new attitude .
It 's Comcast 3.0 . "
Roberts truly believed Comcast was ready for tech stardom as the Facebook or Google of 2008 .
Instead , he got Topolskied .
On October 19 , 2007 , the AP story broke with the headline " Comcast Actively Hinders Subscribers ' File - Sharing Traffic , AP Testing Shows . "
Bloggers called for protests and boycotts ; the Electronic Frontier Foundation said Comcast was using tricks formerly used by " malicious hackers . "
A coalition of Internet law scholars and consumer groups petitioned the FCC to step in .
Instead of basking in glory , Roberts found himself at the center of the fight over network neutrality — the attempt to keep ISPs from discriminating between different kinds of traffic and , say , favoring their own video or VoIP services over another company's .
It 's Good to Be the King :
Comcast 's Path to Power
New residential broadband subscribers are opting for cable instead of DSL ... ... which has given cable a big share of the broadband market ... ... cementing Comcast 's position as the undisputed ruler of cable and broadband .

By blocking BitTorrent — in effect discriminating against those packets — Roberts had opened himself up to accusations that he was a censor and a monopolist who wanted to limit citizens ' access to the Internet .
He was painted as power - mad , unable to restrain himself .
" Comcast will say , ' We 're not blocking . '
But they 're degrading , prioritizing , and filtering , without telling users .
And they 're planning to do much more of this , " blogged Susan Crawford , an Internet law professor at the University of Michigan Law School .
Roberts had n't anticipated the backlash .
Subscribers accepted that cable TV was just entertainment , but the Internet felt more essential , like water or electricity , and consumers were starting to think of broadband as a constitutional right .
Back in the days of basic cable , consumer complaints were always local and easily contained .
But the Internet , as it turned out , was different .
This was becoming a nationwide battle over who the pipes belonged to .
Comcast had invested billions to build its network .
Now its heaviest users were demanding that Roberts effectively hand over control to them .
The new Comcast center is the tallest building in Pennsylvania , a 58 - story reflective - glass beauty .
When it opened last summer , its towering height sent a clear signal that Comcast had arrived .
On the 45th floor , Brian Roberts can squint out over all of western Philadelphia , though today it gives him no pleasure .
He 's still plagued by thoughts of Robb Topolski .
" I honestly do n't think we 're bad people , and we have no evil intentions , " he says .
" We helped invent broadband . "
Roberts is 6 '2 " .
He is so lanky , his gray suit jacket drapes off his shoulders as if it 's still on the hanger , never touching his body .
The entire company dresses the same way : formal and dated , like midwestern bankers .
His speech is reassuringly calm , a nasal monotone he keeps in check regardless of his mood .
Roberts could be a partner at a mid-tier law firm or a senior actuary who shoots hoops on the weekend .
Inside the boardroom , his no - style style has made him a favorite of fellow media chiefs .
No jockeying for headlines , no flash , no grand competitive vision to match a grander ego .
" Comcast has become our top partner , or close to it , " says Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who says he trusts Roberts ' intuition and dealmaking skill .
When Roberts approached Schmidt about investing in Clearwire , the WiMax company started by Craig McCaw , Schmidt quickly agreed .
When Roberts then threatened to pull out during the final stages of negotiations , Schmidt dutifully followed suit .
A few days later , Roberts called to say Comcast was back in .
Google went back in , too , investing $ 500 million in 2008 .
" He works very hard , " Schmidt says .
" I think many people do n't understand how he operates . "
Rob Glaser , CEO of RealNetworks , contrasts Comcast 's style with Microsoft 's approach .
" If I do business with Comcast and then with a Comcast competitor , I do n't wake up with a horse 's head in my bed , " Glaser says .
" Even though Brian is in a position of a lot of power , there has never been a time when he approached that in a venal or reckless way . "
Yet there 's a stunning disconnect between how fellow chief executives view him and what customers think .
They see Comcast as arrogant , unresponsive , and overpriced .
The company has managed to place last or close to last in just about every survey of customer service .
In its annual ISP report , J. D. Power and Associates regularly rates Comcast in the cellar .
Harris Interactive , in its annual brand reputation survey , ranked Comcast just ahead of ExxonMobil and Halliburton .
Readers of the Consumerist , a shoppers ' - rights blog , voted Comcast the second - worst company in the US — after only Countrywide Financial , of subprime mortgage infamy .
Roberts remains philosophical about Comcast 's poor rankings .
Because Comcast is the biggest cable company , he argues , naturally it gets a high number of complaints .
The Topolski affair , as far as Roberts is concerned , is all based on a misunderstanding .
Every company " manages " its network by restricting and opening access to maintain speeds .
Providers have little choice , especially when it comes to P2P , the kudzu of cable .
File - sharing eats up a half to two - thirds of his upstream capacity in some places .
And because cable is a shared network — with some 300 homes downloading from any one pipe — a few BitTorrent devotees could make everyone 's surfing experience feel more like swimming against a riptide .
" We manage our network so 99 percent of the people have a great high - speed experience , " he says .
" You 've always had Ma Bell managing its network for things like how you handle voice traffic on Mother 's Day .
You get a busy signal occasionally . "
In his heart of hearts , Brian Roberts is still just a cable guy , exactly like his father before him .
And there 's something about the business that makes executives a little blasè9 about consumer complaints .
They 've been lambasted for so long , they just do n't hear it anymore .
Brian 's father , perpetually bow - tied 88 - year - old Ralph , started Comcast in the early 1960s .
Programming cost nothing — he simply took broadcast signals and piped them to homes .
Government regulation ( unlike for broadcast television ) was nonexistent .
And expansion was just a matter of finding more towns to wire .
Customers complained about price and service — but they never cut the cord .
" It 's the greatest thing since stealing , " one of Ralph 's first employees told his friends .
Roberts joined the family business in 1981 , right out of the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School .
He carefully studied how top cable execs worked , then carved out a new role for himself .
While others were brash and self - confident , Roberts sought to be quietly persuasive .
In 1997 , for example , he convinced Bill Gates to sink $ 1 billion into Comcast , arguing that it would help spread the Internet .
It was an amazing deal for Comcast .
In return for his investment , Gates got nothing , not even a promise that Roberts — then Comcast 's president — would deploy Microsoft 's set - top - box software .
Nor , for all his cash , did Gates get voting power ; Roberts controls his business through supervoting shares ( today he owns less than 1 percent of the stock yet commands 33 percent of the votes ) .
" You never hear stories about how someone got the best of Microsoft , " says one awed consumer - electronics executive .
" Brian Roberts did .
And how did he do it ?
With a velvet glove .
He 's the Bill Clinton of cable .
He charms everybody . "
Roberts made his biggest move in 2002 .
AT&T was the dominant player in cable at the time , but after the dotcom bust Roberts sensed weakness and launched a successful $ 51 billion hostile bid for AT&T 's cable unit .
Comcast had been a regional player ; suddenly it doubled in size , serving 21 million subscribers .
It 's now the local cable monopoly in 40 of the country 's 50 largest markets .
" They were just this little Philly company .
Now they 're like someone who , in a year , shot up from 5 ' 8 " to 6 ' 2 " , " says Gigi Sohn , president of digital rights lobby Public Knowledge .
" They 've had to try on a whole new wardrobe and have n't found the right fit yet .
They have n't done a good job of handling tremendous growth . "
PR disasters mounted .
One Comcast cable guy fell asleep on a customer 's couch ; the customer filmed it and put it on YouTube .
In Virginia , a 75 - year - old woman got so fed up with the company 's rude service and unreliable house calls that she smashed up a local Comcast office with a hammer .
In the past two years , Roberts has implemented what he calls the Comcast Marshall Plan , hiring 15,000 new frontline technicians and customer service reps .
By the end of 2007 , Roberts assumed that his consumer - complaint issues were behind him .
They were n't .
In the old days , cable users might have been mollified , but Internet users were an entirely different breed .
The Ames courtroom at Harvard Law School is typically reserved for mock trials .
Its 290 seats face a massive desk on a raised dais , where real Supreme Court justices occasionally sit to determine the fate of fake cases .
The FCC decided to hold its hearing on Comcast 's actions against file - sharing in Cambridge , and on this February day in 2008 , the five commissioners took their seats in the courtroom .
At a long witness table , one place was set for Comcast , the rest for its critics .
Earlier in the day , students , professors , activists , and customers gathered on the front steps of Austin Hall .
Some carried signs blasting the cable giant —
" No One Owns the Internet , " read one — other protestors made impromptu speeches about neutrality .
Before the hearing even started , campus cops had to turn people away .
An overflow crowd gathered in the basement , where a computer showed a webcast of the proceedings upstairs .
" It felt like the days before the Vietnam War , " says David Clark , an MIT scientist who is considered one of the fathers of the Internet .
Roberts did n't come .
Instead , he sent his consiglieri , executive vice president David Cohen .
A longtime Pennsylvania political operative , Cohen is stocky and pugnacious , the complete opposite of his boss .
Cohen gave an impassioned and unequivocal defense of the ISP 's actions .
" I 'm going to say , on the record , in front of this commission : Comcast does not block any Web site , application , or Web protocol , including peer - to - peer services .
Period .
Does n't happen , " he said .
" What we are doing is a limited form of network management , " he added , " during limited periods of network congestion . "
The response was just as unyielding .
One by one , assorted Internet guardians and programmers leaned into their microphones and pointed out the inconsistencies in Cohen 's statements .
They noted the harm that Comcast was doing , calling it discriminatory and dangerous to capitalism , to America , to the Internet .
" If Comcast gains the FCC 's permission to block BitTorrent , you can bet that BitTorrent will be the tip of the iceberg , " said Timothy Wu , a Columbia Law School professor .
Nevertheless , Cohen seemed to really thrill the audience .
He was n't the most exciting speaker , but several times he was greeted with surprisingly enthusiastic applause .
Later , it came out that Comcast had hired shills : seat - fillers , who the company claimed were there to save places for Comcast employees .
But for some reason those employees never showed up .
Comcast needed some other way to defuse the situation , so it put together a partnership with BitTorrent — " in the spirit of openness and fostering innovative solutions , " as BitTorrent 's president at the time put it — to find ways for the technology to travel in peace with the other packets on Comcast 's network .
It sounded like reconciliation , but it was only PR .
While BitTorrent the company was cofounded by the same programmer who created BitTorrent the technology , it had no actual control over the standard or its users .
BitTorrent fans dismissed Comcast 's move as just another cynical attempt to fool the government .
At the urging of Comcast 's foes , the FCC called a second public hearing , this one at Stanford University , where the man who started it all , Robb Topolski , presented his side of the story .
Nobody clapped for Comcast this time , because no one from the company came .
The public beatings were beginning to hurt .
In early fall , the company decided to measure just how bad the damage was by holding a series of subscriber focus groups .
Most of the people , it turned out , had never even heard of P2P .
In one session , a young man mentioned that he was using BitTorrent to assemble a library of every anime movie ever created .
The rest of the group quickly turned on him , accusing him of stealing their broadband .
" They did n't bash us ; they did n't talk about poor customer service .
It was actually pretty uplifting , " says one employee who attended .
" If you read the blogs on the P2P stuff , you 'd think we were Satan . "
It drove Roberts crazy to see Comcast getting trashed , to have his family 's business maligned .
Roberts had told the crowd at CES that he wanted to lead the technology industry , to be a senior statesperson .
Now self - proclaimed defenders of the Internet were casting him as a heel .
" Comcast leadership has an attitude of ' Damn the torpedoes , we 're not doing anything wrong , ' " Public Knowledge 's Sohn says .
" Well , the apple rots from the top , from Brian Roberts . "
In August , the FCC issued a 67 - page report that read as if Comcast was the worst company the FCC had ever regulated .
Comcast lied about its actions , schemed to prevent oversight , confused customers , and put the future of Net - based innovation at risk .
The commissioners doubted Comcast 's contention that blocking BitTorrent helped its network .
If that were the case , the report asked , why was the company doing it during times of light traffic and in areas where there were few bandwidth - sucking households ?
Was n't it possible that Comcast was trying to stop a technology that was a threat to its own video - on - demand cable services ?
The final verdict was devastating : " In laymen 's terms , Comcast opens its customers ' mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address or type of stamp on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein , " the FCC wrote .
" This practice is not ' minimally intrusive ' but invasive and outright discriminatory . "
The FCC did n't levy a fine .
In fact , it 's still not even clear whether the commission has the regulatory right to punish such behavior .
But Comcast could n't ignore the public spanking ( though it 's currently appealing the decision ) .
It submitted a report to the FCC detailing exactly how its network operated , from how many homes share an upstream connection ( about 100 ) to the equipment it used to fight P2P traffic ( the Sandvine PTS 8210 ) .
Comcast swore off discrimination based on any particular technology .
And it disclosed a policy that had secretly been on the books for a while but which it now intended to enforce :
It would cap subscriber bandwidth at 250 GB per month , enough for a user to download 125 movies in standard definition or to watch 1,750 hours of YouTube .
" Was it handled perfectly ?
You know , it 's like anything .
I wish we could 've done some things differently , " Roberts says .
" We hit a very raw nerve . "
In the end , the geeks won .
But they may have unwittingly hurt their own cause .
Roberts ' " concession " — putting uniform , nondiscriminatory caps on usage — will likely mark the demise of the all - you - can - eat Internet buffet .
ISPs like Time Warner Cable and AT&T have begun running limited tests of capped service , penalizing consumers for going over arbitrary limits ( ranging from 5 to 150 GB ) .
Countries where low caps are already common have found themselves trailing the world in how they use broadband ; in Australia , where the average cap is 15 GB , 70 percent of Internet users say they never download or watch video online .
When broadband is turned into a scarce commodity , surfing suddenly becomes a domestic negotiation :
Is it worth it to watch one more Family Guy episode on Hulu , to run BitTorrent , or to download a movie from Netflix ?
A recent IDC study found that the vast majority of Internet users have no idea how much data they consume or even how to measure it .
It 's possible that Comcast 's FCC - approved cure , if adopted by all ISPs , will strangle online video and drive consumers back to channel - surfing on cable TV , which would suit Comcast just fine .
To be fair , Comcast 's 250 - GB cap is far above current global standards , and Roberts still may turn out to be an ideal steward of Internet access , but not everyone is willing to wait around to see if he remains so generous .
In November , President - elect Barack Obama picked Susan Crawford as an adviser on recasting the FCC .
As a Comcast - blasting law professor , Crawford had equated Comcast 's actions against peer - to - peer file - sharing with those carried out by the Net censors in China .
She called the company 's moves " obviously deceitful " and argued for the Feds to break it up .
If Roberts thought 2008 was bad , 2009 may be shaping up to be truly horrible .
Brian Roberts is learning .
And part of his education has come from an employee nicknamed Famous Frank .
Last spring , a middle management customer - support executive named Frank Eliason , 36 , started Twittering in his free time .
Eliason is relentlessly upbeat and hated searching for " Comcast " on Twitter and seeing only slams .
He asked for permission not just to defend the company but to actually try to fix the problems .
If someone on Twitter complained about , say , an Internet outage , he 'd start troubleshooting for them .
Eliason — who goes by the online handle comcastcares — had already been gaining attention , and accolades , when one of Comcast 's senior executives realized that maybe Roberts should be clued in .
She left Roberts a voicemail — voicemail , not email , is the preferred form of communication among Comcast executives .
" You 're doing what ? " he responded in his own voice message .
" We 're just letting him go at it ? "
Nevertheless , he did nothing to stop it .
Eliason was actively trying to prevent customer complaints from spiraling into angry vendettas .
These were n't just regular users , either , but Twitter users , many of whom were likely the same early adopters who love BitTorrent , who complain to the FCC , who might even enjoy building an anti-Comcast blog .
Roberts began following the Twitter feed , and he realized that this was ... good .
He OK 'd adding people to Eliason 's special forces team , overruling Eliason 's direct boss .
Soon , Eliason became a minor Internet celebrity , hence his new nickname inside the company .
He was asked to speak at conferences as well as to other companies struggling with similar problems .
Thanks to Famous Frank , Comcast began thinking about going even further .
The weekend that the company published its response to the FCC — outlining how it managed its network and how it planned to change — one of Roberts ' lieutenants suggested something even more radical : having ordinary company engineers go on message boards to answer questions .
It was the kind of proposal that violated every tenet of the old cable code of business , and the matter could be settled only at an executive board meeting on the 52nd floor .
Roberts , sitting with his back to the window , listened to both sides .
Then he declared it was time to be a bit more transparent .
He finally got it .
He was turning a page .
" I think we should do this , but we all have to have thick skins , " he said .
" People are going to vent .
But that 's all right . "

Comcast Discloses Throttling Practices — BitTorrent Targeted
Comcast Ordered to Allow Free Flow of File Sharing Traffic
Moderate alcohol intake is associated with higher levels of omega - 3 fatty acids in plasma and red blood cells .
This is the major finding of the European study IMMIDIET that will be published in the January issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
The study suggests that wine does better than other alcoholic drinks .
This effect could be ascribed to compounds other than alcohol itself , representing a key to understand the mechanism lying behind the heart protection observed in moderate wine drinkers .
The IMMIDIET study examined 1,604 citizens from three geographical areas : south - west London in England , Limburg in Belgium and Abruzzo in Italy .
Thanks to a close cooperation with General Practitioners of these areas , all participants underwent a comprehensive medical examination , including a one year recall food frequency questionnaire to assess their dietary intake , alcohol consumption included .
Omega - 3 fatty acids , mainly derived from fish , are considered as protective against coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death , thus their high blood concentration is definitely good for our health .
Now European researchers found that moderate alcohol drinking acts like a ' trigger ' , boosting the amount of omega - 3 fatty acids in our body .
" Several studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption , including wine , is associated with protection against coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke - says Romina di Giuseppe , lead author of the study , from the Research Laboratories at Catholic University of Campobasso -
Although the mechanisms are not completely defined , there was some evidence that alcohol intake might influence the metabolism of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids , as omega - 3 .
That is exactly what we found in our population study .
People drinking moderate amounts of alcohol , one drink a day for women and two for men , had higher concentration of omega - 3 fatty acids in plasma and red blood cells independently of their fish intake " .

However important these results appear to be , the best is yet to come .
Researchers from Catholic University of Campobasso , in Italy , and from University of Grenoble , in France , turned their attention on the variety of alcoholic beverages consumed in order to see whether the high levels of omega - 3 fatty acids detected might be ascribed to alcohol itself or to other substances .
" From our previous studies we know that association between wine drinking and increased concentration of omega - 3 fatty acids have been observed – says Michel de Lorgeril , from the University of Grenoble , partner of the IMMIDIET project and co-leader of the study - Nevertheless , it was not possible to separate the effects of wine from those of beer or spirits .
Our study of 3 populations with different dietary habits and different consumption of alcoholic beverages types allowed us to explore this aspect . " .
" Analysis carried out on different alcoholic beverages –argues Licia Iacoviello coordinator of the IMMIDIET study at Catholic University of Campobasso - showed that the association between alcohol and omega - 3 fatty acids was present in both wine drinkers and beer or spirits drinkers .
However , the association was stronger between wine drinking and omega - 3 fatty acids levels .
This suggests that components of wine other than alcohol is associated with omega - 3 fatty acids concentration .
We may guess this effect can be ascribed to polyphenols " .
Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds contained in a different variety of food and beverages , such as wine .
Due to their strong antioxidant activity , they are able to reduce oxidation processes caused by free radicals .
" We consider these data to be a major finding - de Lorgeril concludes - opening a new window in the field of cardiovascular prevention .
Beyond the alcohol issue , our results raise crucial questions regarding the effects of polyphenols on lipids ( both in blood and cell membranes ) and possibly of lipids on polyphenols " .

The IMMIDIET study
Funded by the European Union under Key Action 1 : Food , Nutrition and Health QLK1- CT-2000-00100 , IMMIDIET aims to acquire fundamental knowledge in the field of cardiovascular disease , especially regarding the interaction between genetics and lifestyle .
At the core of the study there is an important episode of Italian migration : Belgium , a country that became the new home for thousands of Italians , mostly from the Abruzzo region , who came to work in the mines .
Many of those emigrants did n't come back to Italy but remained in their new country .
Some of them married a Belgian partner .
Their genes remained the same , of course , but how much " Italy " is still there in their diet ?
And how much did they transmit it to their spouses ?
Moreover , how many Italian emigrants assimilate dietary habits of the country in which they were guests ?
In this framework , the role of genetic factors and lifestyle can be assessed to explore new ways in prevention of cardiovascular diseases .
To carry on the research , married couples have been recruited in three European areas : South - East London in England , Limburg in Belgium and Abruzzo in Italy .
In the first phase of the study the couples involved were formed by people from the same area , Italians married with Italians ( in the Abruzzo region ) , Belgians married with Belgians ( in the Limburg area ) and English married with English ( in the South - East part of London ) " .
The second phase of IMMIDIET recruited mixed Italian–Belgian couples to understand if , acquiring dietary habits from Abruzzo , the Belgian partner changed his own risk regarding heart diseases .
Bush : Bible ' probably not ' literally true Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email This US President George W. Bush said in an interview Monday that the Bible is " probably not " literally true and that a belief that God created the world is compatible with the theory of evolution .
" I think you can have both , " Bush , who leaves office January 20 , told ABC television , adding " You 're getting me way out of my lane here .
I 'm just a simple president . "
But " evolution is an interesting subject .
I happen to believe that evolution does n't fully explain the mystery of life , " said the president , an outspoken Christian who often invokes God in his speeches .
" I think that God created the Earth , created the world ; I think the creation of the world is so mysterious it requires something as large as an almighty and I do n't think it 's incompatible with the scientific proof that there is evolution , " he told ABC television .
Asked whether the Bible was literally true , Bush replied : " Probably not .
No , I 'm not a literalist , but I think you can learn a lot from it . "

Between the juvenile delinquent hordes of PlayStation Home and some lackluster holiday figures , the PlayStation has been sort of a bummer lately , for reasons that have nothing to do with its raison d'etre -- gaming .
That does n't mean that the machine is anything less than a powerhouse -- as was made clear today when a group of hackers announced that they 'd beaten SSL , using a cluster of 200 PS3s .
By exploiting a flaw in the MD5 cryptographic algorithm ( used in certain digital signatures and certificates ) , the group managed to create a rogue Certification Authority ( CA ) which allows them to create their own SSL certificates -- meaning those authenticated web sites you 're visiting could be counterfeit , and you 'd have no way of knowing .
Sure , this is all pretty obscure stuff , and the kids who managed the hack said it would take others at least six months to replicate the procedure , but eventually vendors are going to have to upgrade all their CAs to use a more robust algorithm .
It is assumed that the Wii could perform the operation just as well , if the hackers had enough room to spread out all their Balance Boards .

Government Regulators Aided IndyMac Cover - Up , Maybe Others Darrel Dochow may not be the only official who helped banks hide financial woes .
Jan. 16 , 2009  --
A brewing fraud scandal at the Treasury Department may be worse than officials originally thought .
Investigators probing how Treasury regulators allowed a bank to falsify financial records hiding its ill health have found at least three other instances of similar apparent fraud , sources tell ABC News .
In at least one instance , investigators say , banking regulators actually approached the bank with the suggestion of falsifying deposit dates to satisfy banking rules -- even if it disguised the bank 's health to the public .
Treasury Department Inspector General Eric Thorson announced in November his office would probe how a Savings and Loan overseer allowed the IndyMac bank to essentially cook its books , making it appear in government filings that the bank had more deposits than it really did .
But Thorson 's aides now say IndyMac was n't the only institution to get such cozy assistance from the official who should have been the cop on the beat .
The federal government took over IndyMac in July , after the bank 's stock price plummeted to just pennies a share when it was revealed the bank had financial troubles due to defaulted mortgages and subprime loans , costing taxpayers over $ 9 billion .
Darrel Dochow , the West Coast regional director at the Office of Thrift Supervision who allowed IndyMac to backdate its deposits , has been removed from his position but he remains on the government payroll while the Inspector General 's Office investigates the allegations against him .
Investigators say Dochow , who reportedly earns $ 230,000 a year , allowed IndyMac to register an $ 18 million capital injection it received in May in a report describing the bank 's financial condition in the end of March .
" They [ IndyMac ] were able to maintain their well - capitalized threshold and continue to use broker deposits to make loans , " said Marla Freedman , an assistant Inspector General at Treasury .
" Basically , while the institution was having financial difficulty , it kept the public from knowing earlier than it otherwise should have or would have . "
Critics Point to Cozy Relationship Between Banks and Regulators
In order to backdate the filings , IndyMac sought and received permission from Dochow , according to Freedman .
" That struck us as very unusual , " said Freedman .
" Typically transactions are to be recorded in the period in which they occur , not afterwards .
So it was very unusual . "
One former regulator says Dochow 's actions illustrate the cozy relationship between banks and government regulators .
" He did nothing to protect taxpayers in losses , " former federal bank regulator William Black told ABC News .
" Instead of correcting it [ Dochow ] made it worse by increasing the accounting fraud . "
Meanwhile , IndyMac customers who lost their savings are demanding answers and are further infuriated after learning Dochow was also the regulator in 1989 who oversaw the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan , a scandal that sent its CEO Charles Keating to prison .
" He 's the person that claimed that he looked into Charles Keating 's eyes and knew that Charles Keating was a good guy and therefore ignored all of the professional staff that told him that Keating was a fraud , and he produced the worst failure of the Savings and Loan Crisis at $ 3.4 billion .
Now he 's managed more than triple that , " said Black , now an economics professor at the University of Missouri in Kansas City , Missouri .
Following the Lincoln scandal , Dochow was demoted and placed into a relatively obscure office , but later , inexplicably was brought back into the Office of Thrift Supervision .
Dochow declined to answer questions from ABC News .
IndyMac Customers Furious
After Ronnie Lopez was killed in Iraq , his mother Elaine invested the life insurance proceeds at IndyMac .
She lost $ 37,000 of it .
" I was hysterical , " she told ABC News .
" I literally thought I was going to kill myself that day , because I felt so bad that I had let him down .
I remember going to his grave and telling him " do n't worry , I 'm going to get that money back ' , and I feel like he was saying 'hey mom , do n't let them take that .
I did the ultimate for that '. "
A group of angry investors has started a website , demanding answers on the extent of Dochow 's actions .
" It 's just the strife and anger , " said IndyMac customer Lisa Marshall .
" That this Dochow person is still employed , it 's unbelievable , it 's shocking . "
While Dochow could end up losing his job , neither he nor his colleagues are expected to go to prison .
" This is criminal with the small ' c ' , " said Black .
" No one within the regulatory ranks may go to jail , but they have done the worst possible disservice to the taxpayers of America . "

Today ’s hideous jobs report has everyone reaching for historical analogies .
But there really are n't any that fit .
Even the most dire comparisons fail to capture just how bleak our situation really is .
In a big downer blog post about today 's " dreadful " numbers , David Leonhardt explains that the " share of adult men with jobs , which has been gradually falling for much of the last few decades , is now at its lowest level since the Labor Department began keeping records in 1948 . "
The nearest historical comparison he can find is the 1980 to 1982 recession .
" Just about every economist thinks that the labor market will continue to get worse , which means it ’s on a path to be in its worst shape since the painful recession of the early 1980s , " he writes .
But that recession was caused by interest rate hikes brought about by Paul Volker , who was then chairman of the Fed Reserve .
Volker was the ultimate inflation hawk , and he hiked interest rates up toward 20 % .
It 's understandable that you 're going to get job losses when you 've pushed interest rates up that high .
Our jobs losses are coming at a time when the Fed is doing the opposite , dropping the interest rate almost as low as it can go .
Last night , an analyst at Goldman Sachs predicted the Fed will drop rates another 50 basis points by the end of the year .
The fact that we 're seeing this many job losses while money is dirt cheap would seem to indicate that our economic condition is far more dire than anything we went through in the 1980s .
Anyone got a better comparison ?
PRINCETON , N.J. , Dec. 23 ( UPI ) -- Religion 's influence is declining in the United States , said two - thirds of U.S. adults interviewed for a Gallup poll .
The poll marks one of the lowest readings on the influence of religion in Gallup 's 50 years of asking about religion and continues a downward trend , said poll organizers .

In surveys , the percentage of U.S. adults who said religious influence was on the rise was 50 percent in April 2005 , 39 percent in May 2006 , 34 percent in May 2007 , 30 percent in May 2008 and 27 percent in the poll conducted Dec. 4 - 7 , said Gallup officials .
The lowest ebb in a Gallup poll came in 1970 during the Vietnam War when just 14 percent said they thought religious influence rising , said Gallup officials , noting shifts in religious perception often correspond to major events in politics and society .
The latest poll interviewed 1,009 adults nationwide and had a sampling error of 3 percentage points .
A Mount Shasta city councilwoman is among 33 people arrested in a four - month investigation into drug sales at two area high schools .
The Siskiyou County Interagency Task Force says an undercover agent enrolled at different times as a student at Yreka and Mount Shasta high schools to track illegal drug sales .
Jim Parker , a senior special agent in charge at the California Department of Justice , says agents received several tips that 40 - year - old Katrina Howard was involved as a seller .
Howard , a city council member since November , had 34 pounds of processed marijuana in her home , according to the task force .
She was arraigned Friday in Siskiyou County Superior Court on charges of conspiracy to sell marijuana and maintaining a residence where marijuana is stored or sold .
Howard did not yet have an attorney and was being held in the Siskiyou County Jail .
Anurag Dikshit still holds a major stake in PartyGaming
The billionaire co-founder of an internet gambling company has pleaded guilty to violating US internet laws and agreed to forfeit $ 300 m ( £ 192 m ) .
Anurag Dikshit , co-founder of the UK - listed company PartyGaming , entered the plea in a New York federal court .
He is charged with violating federal gambling laws , an offence which could incur a prison term of up to two years .
Mr Dikshit , an Indian national with an estimated fortune of $ 1.6bn , declined to comment to reporters .
The US justice department said Mr Dikshit , 37 , had pleaded guilty to one count of " using the wires to transmit bets and wagering information " .
US gambling law reforms in 2006 effectively made it illegal for PartyGaming to trade there .
Correspondents say Mr Dikshit , who still holds a major stake in the company , is unlikely to serve any jail time because of a plea agreement with prosecutors .
Mr Dikshit , who was released on a $ 15 m bail pending sentencing next December , has already paid $ 100m .
In Washington , they will inhabit a 115 - year - old Victorian with 33 rooms on a heavily guarded circular lot , next to the British Embassy .
The Bidens and their aides declined to discuss their plans or the question of whether Dr. Biden would find a new job in Washington .
But friends and colleagues said that in all the decades Mr. Biden worked in Washington , he never had much of a social life there .
He rarely stuck around for an evening fund - raiser or a cocktail party .
He was not a regular at typical lawmaker haunts like the Capital Grille or Charlie Palmer , instead inviting people to the Senate dining room if he happened to be in town for dinner .
“ I think he was far more interested in his children than the social whirl , ” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy , a longtime Biden friend .
“ I have to kid him a little bit , because he ’s no longer going to be asking , ‘ Are we going to finish this vote by 7:45 ? ’ so he can make this mad dash to the train . ”
Not that Mr. Biden will suddenly become a fixture at Washington dinner parties , predicted Mr. Leahy , who in his 34 years in the Senate has seen a few new administrations come to town .
“ Everybody loves to have the vice president over for dinner , and he ’ll have 100 invitations piling up , ” Mr. Leahy said .
“ But I think he can be very valuable to President Obama up on the Hill .
That will be the most important place to be . ”
Sally Quinn , the journalist and author , said that like the Obamas , who have spent little time in Washington , the Bidens will be social newcomers .
“ I ’ve never seen Joe Biden at a party in Washington , ” Ms. Quinn said .
“ Both of those couples are going to be fresh faces , even though they ’ve both been in the Senate and Biden ’s been here for a hundred years .
It ’ll be very interesting to have them around . ”
I ’m still not entirely sure why my parents bought me this for Christmas .
More confounding still was when , upon noticing my confused reaction as I gingerly removed the costume from the box , my mother whispered in my ear , “ You ’re gonna get so fucking crazy laid in this at the dungeon that the dom is going to have to beat the deranged chicks off you with a cast - iron ping pong paddle .
Trust me , son .
Just trust me . ”

Your Credit Score , Courtesy of Fair Isaac
Another certainty in this life , at least to for the American consumer , is their credit score – what is known as a FICO score .
The Fair Isaac Corporation score is used by the three major credit reporting bureaus which are : TransUnion , Equifax , and Experian .
That score will help lenders determine whether you will receive credit and , if so , at what terms .
The higher your score , the better the chance you ’ll be approved for a loan and at a favorable rate .
This week , Fair Isaac rolled out a modified version of their credit score , this one dubbed FICO 08 .
TransUnion is the first of the credit reporting bureaus who will use the new FICO method for calculating credit scores followed by Equifax in the second quarter .
Experian is currently in litigation with Fair Isaac over another matter , so we do n’t know when they ’ll include with the new methodology .
More Accurate Predictor of Problem Borrowers
Supposedly , the new score will be an improvement over the way that the old one was calculated , as it will help creditors do a better job of predicting borrower defaults .
In addition , it will be more forgiving of one time slip ups , but it will come down harder on repeat offenders .
Scores will still range from 300 to 850 and Fair Isaac is expecting an improvement in lending decisions by as much as 15 % .
Consumers may not notice much of a change for awhile , especially as many lenders use the score as only part of their methodology for determining whom they will lend to and for what terms .
Some analysts believe that many mortgage lenders will not use the new calculation method until all three credit reporting bureaus are using it .
Oftentimes , lenders will obtain credit scores from all three to determine one median score .
Get Your Free Credit Reports
For consumers , now is a good time to pull your credit reports to see if they are accurate and correctly reflect your personal information .
Mistakes can impact your credit score , but they generally will only be fixed if you catch them .
Thanks to an act of Congress , you can get free copies of all three credit reports at www.annualcreditreport.com.
If you want you credit score you ’ll pay a nominal fee for that service , something you can do when you order your reports .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc said on Tuesday said it was dropping copy protection from songs sold on the Internet and debuted its slimmest 17 - inch laptop yet , but with no dramatic products or master pitchman Steve Jobs , the company ’s final Macworld performance disappointed Wall Street .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Apple shares slid 0.7 percent , lagging by far the Nasdaq ’s 1.7 percent gain , reflecting frustration over the lack of news from the trade conference that had previously introduced the iPhone to the world .
“ There were some innovative products , but no true blockbusters , ” said Robert Francello , head of equity trading for Apex Capital hedge fund in San Francisco .
“ People were bullish going into it , and now they ’re kind of taking money off the table . ”
Apple said its iTunes music store , which has sold 6 billion songs thus far , will offer its 10 - million - song library free of digital rights management -- or copy - protection -- by the end of the quarter , for between 69 cents and $ 1.29 a song .
Songs will also be available straight to iPhones over the air , instead of through a computer .
The company decided not use Macworld to launch any major new product , as it had in past years , when it introduced such industry - changing devices as the iPhone .
In years past , the company ’s Macworld product launches had produced so much buzz that they managed to overshadow events at the far larger Consumer Electronics Show .
The 2009 CES show kicks off this week in Las Vegas .
Tuesday ’s event produced few surprises .
Apple announced a $ 2,799 17 - inch laptop that is the company ’s lightest and slimmest ever , as well as tweaks to software for home movies and photographs .
The event culminated with singer Tony Bennett crooning “ The Best is Yet to Come ” and “ I Left My Heart in San Francisco ” in a farewell of sorts to Apple , which will no longer attend the cultural event thronged annually by Mac - faithful .
Jobs , a fixture at past events , was nowhere in sight , despite some hopes for a cameo .
Last month , the company said its chief executive and salesman extraordinaire would not deliver the Macworld address .
That raised fresh concerns about the cancer survivor ’s health and signaled to many Apple - watchers that the company had no plans to launch a major product at Macworld .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has a lot of tough challenges in the early days of his administration : tackling the growing economic crisis , mending America ’s damaged diplomatic ties with many foreign countries – and taking on super villain the Chameleon .

Obama is set to appear in Marvel Comics ’ Spider - Man series , in a special insert titled , “ Spidey Meets the President ! ” where he will team up with the “ Wall Crawler ” to defeat Spidey nemesis the Chameleon who has designs on stopping Inauguration Day .
" When we heard that President - Elect Obama is a collector of Spider - Man comics , we knew that these two historic figures had to meet in our comics ' Marvel Universe , " Marvel 's editor - in - chief Joe Quesada said in a statement .
“ A Spider - Man fan moving into the Oval Office is an event that must be commemorated . ”

Female circumcision / genital cutting Introduction Female circumcision usually involves the cutting or removal of the clitoris .
This area of the genitals is very sensitive because it contains the most nerve endings .
Genital cutting is a painful practice that is often poorly carried out , and endangers the health and lives of millions of girls , particularly in Africa .
In some communities the controversial practice is a female rite of passage and remains an important religious and cultural tradition .
In regions where a new religion has become dominant , the tradition of genital cutting does not necessarily die out .
In the Middle East , female circumcision is practised in the Yemen , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Jordan and Syria .
Even in the United States , 10,000 girls are believed to be at risk from illegal operations within their own communities .
It has also been reported that young women in Australia , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Sweden and the UK have also undergone similar operations .

Cultural tradition Cultural tradition Genital cutting is widespread within some African cultures and ethnic groups .
It is seen as the climax of initiation , something that both boys and girls have to take part in before they are accepted as adults in the community .
Young people leave home to be trained in the ways of adult life .
For girls this means learning practical skills before returning to their homes as women .
According to supporters , the process of female genital cutting has practical merits in a physically harsh society .
It is proof that the woman is mentally strong and able to deal with the difficult responsibilities of adult life .
It also has religious and social significance .
The shedding of blood is seen symbolically as a stream connecting the woman to the rest of her close - knit community .
In a small community oneness is very important .
The ritual is also seen as an essential preparation for marriage .
After the initiation rituals women begin looking for a husband and hope to start a family .

Painful procedure Painful procedure
Those opposed to genital cutting prefer to use the term female genital mutilation .
They argue that it is a barbaric and needless practice inflicted on innocent young women .
It is certainly a painful process .
It is sometimes carried out by a midwife with anaesthetics , but more often than not there is nothing to ease the pain .
The operation involved varies widely from culture to culture .
In its most extreme form ( infibulation ) it can involve the removal of all external genitalia and the stitching up of the labia leaving only a very small opening for sex , urination , menstruation and giving birth .
This often makes a later operation necessary to create a larger opening .
Many objections to the practice of genital cutting are concerned with the particular circumstances in which it is done .
Amnesty International , a human rights organisation , reports that the operation is often carried out using blunt tools ( penknives , fragments of glass or tin cans ) .
A particularly brutal operation can leave a woman with haemorrhaging , infections , abscesses and sometimes a lifelong loss of sensation during sex .
The Pan -African Committee on Traditional Practices estimates that two million girls in Africa each year undergo some kind of genital cutting which endangers both their health and their lives .
Another objection concerns the inability of some young women to make a choice .
Cutting takes place when a girl is young ( aged between three and ten ) , vulnerable and unable to make an informed decision .
In a small village community pressure to take part is enormous .

A human rights violation ?
A human rights violation ?
Female genital cutting is currently practised among ethnic groups in 28 countries in central Africa .
Representatives from many of these countries meet each year to discuss ways to end the practice .
" Female genital mutilation and cutting is a violation of the basic rights of women and girls , " said Carol Bellamy , executive director of the UN's Children 's Agency ( UNICEF ) , on February 7 2005 , the International Day of Zero Tolerance of FGM .
" It is a dangerous and irreversible procedure that negatively impacts the general health , child bearing capabilities and educational opportunities of girls and women . "
The Kenyan Government , for example , estimates that 32 per cent of women aged between 15 and 49 have undergone the procedure in more than half of the country 's districts .
In 1998 , the Ministry of Health conducted a demographic survey which revealed that genital cutting was more widespread amongst certain ethnic groups .
These included Kisii ( 97 per cent ) ; Maasai ( 89 per cent ) ; Kalenjin ( 62 per cent ) ; Taita / Taveta ( 58 per cent ) ; Meru / Embu ( 54 per cent ) ; Kikuyu ( 43 per cent ) ; Kamba ( 33 per cent ) ; Miji Kenda / Swahili ( 12 per cent ) .
In north eastern Kenya , an area not covered in the survey , the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs estimates that at least 98 per cent of girls are subjected to infibulation .

Case for a woldwide ban Case for a woldwide ban Banning female genital cutting is not a simple solution .
Countries have to be wary about forcing the practice underground .
This may result in high mortality rates , as in the case of abortion .
They will also have to consider the effect on women who have already had the operation .
Such women will have taken part in this rite for religious and cultural reasons .
Imposing a ban may appear , on the surface , to be the best way forward .
But it is unlikely to be observed in communities where the practice is already deeply ingrained .
Nevertheless , opponents still insist that failure to act is not an option .
They argue that female circumcision is not a cultural issue and that women and children should not be coerced into painful operations against their will .

UK statistics UK statistics
In June 2005 , new figures showed that up to 76,000 women living in the UK may have undergone illegal operations .
An estimated 7,000 girls are still thought to be at risk .
Health professionals claim that girls living in Britain have been circumcised in operations overseas organised by family members .
In 2004 , the UK government closed a loophole to prevent young women from being taken abroad for circumcision .
The then home secretary , David Blunkett , condemned genital cutting as " very harmful " and warned that parents would face imprisonment if they broke the law .

The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader Plunges Into the Universe .
The question of which science fiction books are the best ever is a pointless one for most people , since many of the " greatest science fiction novels " are books that no one but science fiction fans will read .
A better question to ask might be :
What are the best science fiction books that you do n't have to be a hard - core science fiction fan to enjoy ?
We scanned our library and came up with these 10 ( well , 12 ) books that not only provide great SF fun , but also are approachable enough for the casual reader .
Some old , some new - but all good reads .
Dune by Frank Herbert David Lynch made this book into a 1984 film that was so incomprehensible that the actual novel - 600 pages on the future of religion , politics , desert ecology , and drug trafficking - look positively streamlined in comparison .
When the book came out in the mid 1960s its multiple story threads were daunting .

But ( ironically ) thanks to shows like The X - Files and even The West Wing , in which several things are happening all at once , people got used to following intersecting story lines .
The result is that Herbert 's magnum opus now comes across more like an epic historical novel that happens to be set in the future , not the past .
Herbert wrote several Dune sequels of varying quality .
More recently , Herbert 's son Brian teamed up with SF author Kevin J. Anderson to write a trio of prequels that Uncle John does n't think are on par with the rest .
Stick with the original .

This plot line is the skeleton on which author and real - life physicist Brin hangs some fascinating episodic story lines that involve problems the world faces today ( global warming , privacy , energy crunches ) , carried out to their possible outcomes 50 years from now .
Originally published in 1991 , Earth has already pegged a couple of items correctly ( such as a version of the World Wide Web and the idea of futzing with old movies using new computer graphics ) .
Plus , scientists have begun trying to generate tiny little black holes in labs .
So imagine what else Brin might ( eventually ) be right about .

That 's the setup of Ender 's Game ; the meat of the story comes from the struggle of one of these extraordinary children ( named Ender ) to keep a grip on his humanity even as he 's being turned into the perfect killing machine .

Card sets up a lot of questions about morality , war , and man 's purpose in Ender 's Game ; in the sequel , Speaker for the Dead , these questions get a payoff as the grown - up Ender finds himself in a position to save a new sentient species or allow it to be destroyed .
Proof that interesting philosophical questions can be asked ( and even answered ) in the form of a purely entertaining story .

Westriding is dispatched with her family to a far - off planet to find a cure for a plague , but she ends up confronting questions of original sin among aliens .
Lots of philosophy , and even some sex ( well , sort of ) , but also lots of action , plus a group of purely malevolent creatures who love nothing better than to toy with humans .
Hand this to someone who enjoys those massive romantic epics for a change of pace .

Geeks love this one , but for the right reasons - namely because it 'll make you laugh so hard that you may vomit involuntarily .
Note that this is humor of the distinctly British , Monty Python - like variety , so if you 're not into that , you may wonder what the fuss is about .
But if you ever laughed at Monty Python and the Holy Grail ( or even A Fish Called Wanda ) , you 'll be laughing at this one , too .
Hitchhiker has several sequels , each progressively less funny than the one before ( but still worth a chuckle or two ) .
Links : The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy | More by Douglas Adams Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons
It takes guts to snatch the format of The Canterbury Tales and use it to crank out epic science fiction , but the extraordinarily talented Dan Simmons ( who also writes bang - up horror and action novels ) is just the guy to do it .

Over the course of these two novels , Simmons creates a galaxy - wide human civilization that 's pitted against a mysterious enemy .
Hyperion uses the overlapping stories of a clutch of pilgrims to paint the picture of this future civilization ; Fall of Hyperion describes its downfall , as seen through the eye of a clone of the great Romantic poet John Keats .
Great storytelling , great action , great plotting ; not just a couple of the best science fiction novels ever , but two of the best adventure novels in a long time , period .

This one shows up on a lot of high school reading lists , and for good reason .
It 's a fine combination of science fiction and fantasy and an increasingly neglected literary form - a series of short stories , hung together with a single thread : they all take place on Mars .
( Photo : Alan Light , via Flickr )
The stories include encounters with real live Martians ( who may or may not be happy to see humans ) , the stories of the humans who leave Earth to come to Mars , and , in the end , the stories of the humans who are left behind , each short enough to be read in a single sitting .
It 's Bradbury at the top of his form , which means these are some of the better short stories you 'll find almost anywhere .
Links : The Martian Chronicles | More by Ray Bradbury Perdido Street Station by China Miéville
The perfect book for anyone who thinks that science fiction can't be literary and / or adventurous in form .
Miéville 's genre - buster of a novel is not unlike what you would get if you spliced together the genes of Charles Dickens and horror master H.P. Lovecraft and raised the resulting creature on the writings of Orwell , Huxley , and Philip K. Dick ( the fellow who wrote the story that was the basis of the movie Blade Runner ) .

It 's difficult to describe the novel , except to say that it involves mad scientists , interspecies romance , vampiric moth creatures , Tammany Hall - like urban politics , the value systems of alien species , interdimensional spiders , and a rip - roaring final action scene that takes place on the rooftops of a city you really can't imagine .
All written by someone who uses the English language like Yo - Yo Ma uses a cello .
Fabulous writing , regardless of genre .
Links : Perdido Street Station | More by China Mieville Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson William Gibson 's Neuromancer may be considered the first " cyberpunk " novel , but the fact is , it 's kind of a deadly bore .
Snow Crash , on the other hand , is a real hoot right from its first scene , which involves a madcap pizza delivery and is written with the same sort of delirious cinematic urgency that you 'll find in the best novels of William Goldman ( Marathon Man ) .

The novel 's plot involves a computer virus that ( get this ) dates back to Sumeria , but it does n't really hang together , so instead , enjoy the book for its portrayal of both an insanely Balkanized America and a huge cyberworld so vividly imagined that a whole bunch of Internet companies bankrupted themselves in the 1990s trying to create a world just like it .
Also , any book that features a large Aleutian with a nuclear bomb in a motorcycle sidecar and the words " Poor Impulse Control " tattooed on his forehead is one you know you 're going to have fun with .

The expiration date for this novel and its ideas regarding love and sex and human transcendence has sort of passed ( people used the novel for years as a foundation for their own desire for hippie polygamy , and now they do n't so much ) , but it still make for a good read for two reasons .
( Photo : Dd-b , via Wikimedia Commons )
One , Robert Heinlein wrote damn fine dialogue , which makes him more fun to read than most other writers today ( and how sad is that , since Heinlein 's been dead coming up on 15 years now ) .
Two , Heinlein thought seriously about the nature of God and the interrelationship between God and His followers , which is interesting to contemplate even if you 're not interested in the polysexual hijinks .
Also , Jubal Harshaw , the cranky old man who counsels the " Stranger " is like a dyspeptic Yoda advising an extraordinarily horny Luke Skywalker , is one of the great curmudgeons of the 20th century writing , and you do n't want to miss out on a character like that .

Great idea about the product , but I think sales page needs some more work ...
It looks clean and nice , but some more content and pictures wo n't hurt
WASHINGTON  A tight - knit group of former senior government officials who were central players in the savings and loan bailout of the 1990s are seeking to capitalize on the latest economic meltdown , enjoying a surge in new business in their work now as private lawyers , investors and lobbyists .
With $ 700 billion in bailout money up for grabs , and billions of dollars worth of bad debt or failed bank assets most likely headed for sale or auction , these former officials are helping their clients get a piece of the bailout money or the chance to buy , at fire - sale prices , some of the bank assets taken over by the federal government .
“ It is a good time to be me , ” said John L. Douglas , a partner in Atlanta at the law firm Paul Hastings and a former lawyer for bank regulators who helped create the agency that administered the last federal bailout , the Resolution Trust Corporation .
Some of these former federal officials , like L. William Seidman , the first chairman of the R.T.C. , are serving as advisers  sharing ideas with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the transition team for President - elect Barack Obama  even while they are separately directing investors or banks on how to best profit from this advice .
( CNN ) --
In keeping with the theme that swept President Obama into the Oval Office , change has come to the official White House Web site .
President Obama 's official White House Web site launched during his swearing - in ceremony .
Almost at the instant Obama was sworn in , www.whitehouse.gov relaunched with a redesign to signal a new era in government .
Gone was the staid site of the Bush White House , replaced by a dynamic new site reflective of his tech - savvy successor .
The new design includes more interactive features , a prominent photo gallery displayed across the top of the site , the ability to get e-mail updates , and a White House blog .
The site 's " briefing room " also includes places for a weekly video address , slide shows , proclamations , and executive orders as well as news about nominations and appointments .
" It 's a great first step , and the tip of the iceberg in what 's coming with participatory politics and the relationship between the president and the public , " said Andrew Rasiej , founder of the Personal Democracy Forum and co-founder of tech President.com .
Visitors to the site are invited to e-mail the president and his staff , although -- perhaps in a nod to the Twittersphere , where brevity is key -- comments are limited to 500 characters .
" President Obama is committed to creating the most open and accessible administration in American history , " states the site 's Contact Us page .
In introducing the new site , White House Director of New Media Macon Phillips wrote in the blog 's initial entry that Obama 's online efforts will center on communication , transparency and participation .

" Millions of Americans have powered President Obama 's journey to the White House , many taking advantage of the Internet to play a role in shaping our country 's future , " he wrote .
" WhiteHouse.gov is just the beginning of the new administration 's efforts to expand and deepen this online engagement . "
Obama was hailed throughout his campaign and transition as a politician who makes clever use of technology to communicate his message .
His campaign leveraged social - networking sites , and even the most casual texter could sympathize with his resistance to giving up his BlackBerry .
Diane Heith , an associate professor of government and politics at St. John 's University in New York City , wrote a scholarly article about then - candidate Obama 's Web site last year , where she noted its superiority to the other campaign sites .
The new White House site is clearly a continuation of his commitment to engage with citizens , she said .
" During the campaign , Obama supporters felt very connected to him , and if they can maintain that connection , it will do a lot to amass the base he is going to need moving forward , " she told CNN .
" The old site [ from the Bush administration ] really was not an exciting Web site , and it did n't have a tremendous amount of depth or information .
[ Obama 's ] site is much more sophisticated . "
David Parry , assistant professor of emerging media at the University of Texas at Dallas , said the new site continues the theme of Obama 's awareness of the importance of Web 2.0 , which empowers users to share online content .
" I think it 's one of the key reasons he was elected , and now they are using it as a means to go to the people and communicate , " he said .
" This site feels more personal and certainly looks more polished , whereas the [ Bush ] site looked more transitional . "
WhiteHouse.gov is not to be confused with WhiteHouse.org , a spoof of former President George W. Bush and his administration .

The billion - gallon wave of toxic coal - ash sludge that burst from a power - plant retention pond and buried 300 acres of rural Tennessee hints at a far larger problem : hundreds of similar threats nationwide .
More than 1,300 coal - ash waste sites are dotted across the United States , about half of them actively used , federal data show .
Some are landfills .
The rest are “ surface impoundments ” ( storage lagoons ) , which , like the one in Tennessee , mix ash with water .
Coal ash has some beneficial uses .
It can be mixed with concrete to make roads , for example .
But storing coal ash in a retention pond – common at coal - fired power plants nationwide – can be a threat to the environment and humans as well :
The ash contains many toxic metals , including arsenic , lead , and chromium .
At least 67 coal - ash sites have been found to be damaging drinking - water supplies in communities across 23 states , the US Environmental Protection Agency reported last year .
But those EPA - identified sites grossly understate the threat , environmentalists say .
EPA study finds only 13 ' safe ' coal - ash waste dumps
Among an additional 155 landfill and surface - impoundment sites in 36 states reviewed by the EPA in 2007 , all but 13 had no liner or an inadequate clay liner .
Most – two - thirds of them – had no liner at all .
( An impermeable liner is needed to keep toxic metals from leaching from the ash into groundwater supplies . )
This concerns Kevin Madonna , who , with his law - firm partner , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , keeps a close eye on water - pollution issues .
Using last year ’s EPA data , Mr. Madonna cross-checked coal - ash lagoons and landfills that had either a clay liner or no liner to see which ones were close to human populations and waterways .
One - third are close to human populations
Of the 155 waste sites , more than one - third were close or very close to significant human populations ; two - thirds were near or very near key waterways , Madonna found .
About half of the sites were coal - ash surface impoundments ( lagoons ) .
“ You have toxic wastes leaking into water bodies from probably every single one of these lagoons , ” Madonna says .
“ It ’s a huge mess . ”
Little is known about coal - ash storage sites , which are lightly regulated by states and exempt from federal hazardous - waste regulations .
Many are decades old , which increases the potential for leakage and containment failure , experts and environmentalists say .
Lisa Evans , an attorney for Earthjustice , an environmental group , says the EPA underestimates the problem .
“ Most impoundments are not monitored at all , ” she says .
“ The list of sites identified by the EPA in 2007 is far from comprehensive . ”
Needed : impermeable liners for waste sites
An earlier EPA report to Congress in 1999 showed that about three - quarters of some 300 active surface impoundment sites were unlined , Ms. Evans says .
Of those that were lined , most were probably lined with clay , which is an inadequate barrier to toxic metals and invites contamination oflocal ground water , says Charles Norris .
Mr. Norris is head of Geo- Hydro Inc. , a Denver - based consulting company that has analyzed the hydrogeology of such structures .
An impermeable composite ( plastic ) liner is what ’s required , he and others say .
The problem is perhaps most acute among nearly 100 coal - ash storage lagoons in two dozen states across the country .
Many of these ponds are far larger and far more toxic than the one that burst at the Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Kingston power plant at Harriman , Tenn. , on Dec. 22 .
That assertion is based on data released Jan. 7 by the Environmental Integrity Project ( EIP ) , a Washington - based watchdog group .
Their analysis of EPA data showed volumes of heavy metals that were larger than those at Kingston being deposited at other power - plant waste sites .
Aresnic , lead pose threat to well water
Arsenic levels in waterways near the Kingston spill were far above safe drinking water standards , according to EPA samples taken after the accident .
Such toxins can be removed at water treatment facilities , but pose a threat to drinking water wells ,
Some power - plant surface impoundments are 1,500 acres in area and contain perhaps 55 million cubic yards of material .
That ’s several times the size of the Kingston facility .
Environmentalists say Tennessee a warning sign
“ Our analysis confirms that this problem is truly national in scope and that Tennessee may end up only being a warning sign of much more trouble to come , ” EIP director Eric Schaeffer said in a statement .
He also warned of what he called “ inadequate oversight and monitoring of land - based disposal and other ‘ storage ’ of these toxic wastes . ”
Just ask Jan Nona , a retired secretary who lives in the little town of Michigan City , Ind. , two miles from a coal - ash landfill that has grown to be several city blocks long , several blocks wide , and a few stories tall .
Only part of the landfill is lined , so toxins like boron have leached into the city ground water .
“ I used to have a well with sweet water – until the boron level got too high , ” she says .
“ Me and my neighbors have had to give up our wells now that they have boron , manganese , molybdenum , and other things in them .
We ’ve got test results that boggle the mind . ”
Sturdiness of impoundment dams an issue
Others are more concerned about a catastrophic release .
In the past eight years , two other big dam breaks have occurred in coal - ash impoundments , one in Georgia and one more recently in Pennsylvania on the Delaware River .
Both spills killed river life for miles and cost tens of millions of dollars to clean up .
Just how sturdy are the hundreds of dams holding back hundreds of millions of cubic yards of coal - ash slurry ?
Many of these dams are made of compacted coal ash , as was the case at the TVA facility , rather than of compacted earth , which is more stable .
But “ coal ash is not in equilibrium with the environment , ” Geo -Hydro ’s Mr. Norris says .
“ It reacts quite strongly with any water that comes in contact with it .
I ’ve read the inspection reports from the TVA facility .
It ’s pretty clear this is material that is internally degrading . ”
( On January 9 , a second spill of waste from a TVA coal - fired power plant came at its Widows Creek facility in northeast Alabama .
This time it was not coal ash escaping , TVA officials said , but about 10,000 gallons of gypsum from a cooling - system pond , the Knoxville News Sentinel reported . )
Averting the problem might have cost one - tenth as much as cleanup
At the Kingston facility , TVA officials did not pursue a $ 25 million proposal to dry out the sludge and ship it to a properly lined landfill , despite evidence that the lagoon dam was weakening , according to published reports .
Instead they turned to less - costly alternatives .
Would tighter regulation have helped ?
Maybe .
But in the 28 years since Congress enacted 1980 ’s Solid Waste Disposal Act and required the EPA to report back on whether to regulate coal combustion waste ( CCW ) , EPA attempts to regulate the material have fallen before vigorous utility industry lobbying , lawyer Evans says .
In 2000 , for instance , the EPA determined that CCW did not warrant regulation as hazardous waste .
It subsequently cut most funding to develop national regulations and instead began drawing up voluntary guidelines , Evans says .
Since then , however , the EPA has “ collected significant new data and new analyses , ” says Matthew Hale , director of EPA ’s Office of Solid Waste , in a statement responding to Monitor queries .
EPA is now analyzing data gathered in its 2007 study , he said , “ and will consider this information as we continue to follow up on the regulatory determination on the management of coal combustion waste . ”
Utility group says better state regulations will suffice
A utility industry spokesman says it has been joined by many others , including states , to lobby against federal hazardous waste regulation .
State regulation is working , despite the Kingston collapse , according to Jim Roewer , executive director of the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group , an industry trade association .
“ A lot of people are claiming that if coal ash is not regulated as a hazardous waste at the federal level , then it ’s not regulated , ” he says .
“ States do have programs , and they are n’t static and have become more stringent over time ....
Tennessee and other states will be reviewing their programs ” in light of this spill .
Priorities for solving the problem are clear , environmentalists say
But environmentalists say the solution is obvious :
Phase out all wet storage of toxic coal ash ; immediately inspect and begin monitoring coal - ash storage and disposal units ; begin federal regulation of all coal - ash storage and disposal by year ’s end .
This daunting problem may be solved by putting coal ash in dry , specially - lined landfills to keep water out .
Cleaning up the Kingston spill will cost 10 times what it would have cost to dry and ship the ash to a proper landfill , Evans says .
“ It ’s a problem that has a clear solution , ” she says .
“ We just need to decide to do it . ”
Vatican would rather gay people were executed than married
( and it does n’t want disabled people to be protected , either , in case it promotes abortion )
The full extent of the regressive nature of the Vatican under Ratzinger was made clear this week when it was revealed that the Vatican had opposed two United Nations resolutions aimed at protecting gay and disabled people from discrimination and death .
When France proposed a resolution seeking all nations to decriminalise homosexuality , the Vatican immediately said it would oppose the resolution .
This is despite the fact that up to 70 nations still have legal punishments for gay people including , in some instances , the death penalty .
In a number of Islamic countries such as Afghanistan , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Sudan and Yemen , homosexual acts are still a capital offence .
The UN resolution is due to be proposed by France later this month on behalf of the 27 - nation European Union .
But Archbishop Celestino Migliore said the Vatican opposed the resolution because it would “ add new categories of those protected from discrimination ” and could lead to reverse discrimination against traditional heterosexual marriage .
“ If adopted , they would create new and implacable discriminations , ” Migliore said .
“ For example , states which do not recognise same - sex unions as ‘ matrimony ’ will be pilloried and made an object of pressure , ” Migliore said .
A strongly worded editorial in Italy 's mainstream La Stampa newspaper said the Vatican ’s reasoning was “ grotesque ” .
Franco Grillini , founder and honorary president of Arcigay , Italy ’s leading gay rights group , said the Vatican ’s reasoning smacked of “ total idiocy and madness ” .
Mr Grillini said the resolution had nothing to do with gay marriage , but was aimed at stopping the execution of gay people in Islamic countries .
An editorial in Rome ’s left - leaning La Repubblica newspaper said the Vatican ’s position “ leaves one dumbstruck ” .
Margherita Boniver , a leading member of Italy ’s leftist Democratic Party , called it “ alarmingly anachronistic ” .
The gay rights activist , Grillini , said he feared what he called another “ Holy Alliance ” between the Vatican and Islamic states at the United Nations to oppose the proposed resolution .
At a major U.N. conference on the family in Cairo in 1994 , the Vatican teamed up with Islamic and Latin American countries to defeat an abortion rights proposal .
In October , a leading Vatican official called homosexuality “ a deviation , an irregularity and a wound ” .
The secretary of the UK’s Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association , David Christmas , described the statement as “ ludicrous ” .
He said : “ The accusation that it is in some way discriminatory to attempt to counteract the prejudice and hatred which exists in over 80 countries that outlaw same sex relations would appear to be yet another example of the Vatican turning logical thinking on its head . ”
Mr Christmas pointed out that in nine countries or regions of countries the mandatory punishment for homosexuality is death by execution .
“ Is n’t the Vatican supposed to believe in the right to life ” , he asked ?
Meanwhile the Times has revealed that the “ Holy See ” also refused to sign a UN document last May on the rights of the disabled because it did not condemn abortion or assert the rights of foetuses with birth defects .
The Vatican made its position clear as it marked the United Nations International Day of Disabled People .
Archbishop Migliore said the Vatican could not accept a clause in the UN declaration affirming a right to “ sexual health and reproduction ” because “ in some countries such rights include the right to abortion ” .
The Italian left of centre Democratic Party said that coupled with the Vatican ’s stand on gays , this showed a " return to obscurantism " under Josef Ratzinger .
Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society said : “ These two incidents expose the Vatican ’s ‘ morality ’ to be a sham .
How otherwise could an organisation that purports to be a moral authority and whose current Pope ’s first encyclical was laughingly entitled God is Love actually oppose measures to put pressure on states who execute citizens because of their sexuality ?
It seems that in some respects the Vatican has not moved on very much from some of the medieval atrocities for which it was so famous . ”
Mr Wood continued : “ Most of the dwindling number of Catholics left in the pews will be horrified by this latest manifestation of the increasingly reactionary and authoritarian Vatican and this latest outrage can only serve to swell the ranks of the millions of lapsed Catholics .
But the interference in UN business in such a cruel and heartless way degrades not only the Vatican itself but undermines the reputation of the UN .
The so - called Holy See is not a legitimate partner of the UN and should never have been recognised .
It should lose its undeserved status immediately . ”

Video : Obama vows to tackle Middle East ' on day one ' David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday January 11 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON  US president - elect Barack Obama on Sunday vowed to take swift action on the Middle East peace process and Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
In an interview with ABC's This Week program broadcast Sunday , Obama defended his reluctance to speak out on Israel 's bloody offensive in the Gaza Strip before he succeeds President George W. Bush on January 20 .
Obama said he was building a diplomatic team so that " on day one , we have the best possible people who are going to be immediately engaged in the Middle East peace process as a whole . "
The team would " be engaging with all of the actors there " so that " both Israelis and Palestinians can meet their aspirations , " Obama said .
Under the Bush administration , the United States has been accused by the Palestinians of siding uncritically with Israel at the expense of the peace process .
Obama stood by his words of July , during a visit to Israel , when he had said : " If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . "
Obama meanwhile took note of a warning from former US defense secretary William Perry Thursday that he would likely face a " serious crisis " over Iran 's nuclear ambitions in his first year in office .
" I think that Iran is going to be one of our biggest challenges , " the president - elect said , warning a nuclear - armed Iran " could potentially trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East . "
Obama promised " a new emphasis on respect and a new emphasis on being willing to talk , but also a clarity about what our bottom lines are . "
" And we are in preparations for that .
We anticipate that we 're going to have to move swiftly in that area . "

You see it on bumper stickers every day : “ Jesus is Lord ” .
“ King of Kings ” .
“ Lord of All . ”
Were people voting with their bumpers , Jesus would win by a landslide .
But when the American right speaks of religion in politics , they are referring to Christianity .
When they fight for more religion in the courts and schools , they mean more of their religion ..
But the time is coming when fundamental Islamic madrasahs are going to start popping up next to their Christian schools .
A time when protesting Muslims , using the legal victories of the Christian right , will have Sharia Law enshrined in the courts next to the Ten Commandments .
What the evangelicals do n’t get ( and what will come back to bite them in a generation ’s time ) is that freedom for one means freedom for all .
Every law they pass to allow more of their religion into the government will also allow every other religion in .
There will come a day when Congress and kindergartners will have to break for Islamic prayer , whether they are Islamic or not .
In fact , anyone with a religion will be able to exert power over the status quo , begging the indulgence of school boards and State funds to make sure their religion is as respected and included under the law as Christianity .
And yes , the hardcore anti-Western imams with their hate speech will , in time , be protected under the very freedoms that they are trying to destroy .
There ’s nothing fanciful in this .
It ’s a direct cause - and - effect of the legal precedents that the Christian right are pursuing .
Religious inclusion for one sect will be applied to all , and you can bet that the extremists are watching this very closely , allowing the Pentecostals and evangelicals to do the hard work for them .
It bears repeating : freedom of religion must also mean freedom from religion .
Only by separating religion and government will we be able to maintain the objectivity and freedom that the West has enjoyed for so long .

Antidisestablishmentarianism is on the march .
Which is odd , considering there is only the faintest whiff of disestablishmentarianism to fight .
The Archbishop of Canterbury set this hare running with his usual confused mumbling into his beard .
To disestablish the church would be " by no means the end of the world " , he said bravely .
He hastened to add that he did not want the church sundered from the state right now .
And he would oppose " secularists [ boo , hiss ] trying to push religion into the private sphere " .
This sent the Telegraph and Mail into a spin , claiming a devilish distestablishment plot on the Labour backbenches - though they could find only three usual suspects .
These MPs say the likely move to end the 1701 Act of Settlement that bars Catholics from the throne will make an established church impossible .
How likely is this ?
Look at how Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have promoted faith and religiosity as " community " , and ask yourself if there is the faintest chance that Labour spends untold parliamentary time unpicking the cat 's cradle of a relationship between church , Lords and crown ?
Frankly , if Labour had the inclination for constitutional reform , first priority should be ending our disastrous first - past - the - post voting system .
True , it is embarrassing to be the only western democracy that has theocracy built into its legislature .
The 26 bishops in the Lords interfere regularly : they are a threat on abortion , and their campaign sank the Joffe bill , giving the terminally ill the right to die in dignity .
Of course they should not be there , when only 16 % of people will grace the pews on Christmas Day , and Christian Research forecasts church attendance falling by 90 % .
But a dying faith clings hard to its inexplicable influence on public life .
Labour has encouraged the power of the religions to a remarkable degree , consulting them on endless committees .
To be an atheist is now unacceptable in a political leader : when Nick Clegg confessed his non-belief , he had to recant and re-define himself as an " agnostic " .
The BBC is increasing religious broadcasting ; Radio 4 already does 200 hours .
Is this by popular demand ?
No .
An Ofcom survey put religion last in the public 's interests .
Expect a worsening clash in the new Equality Commission between religious rights and gay and women 's rights .
The Islington registrar who refused to conduct civil partnerships for religious reasons was an ominous landmark case .
This has been the year of religion 's fightback against secularism - a word made almost synonymous with the spiritual and moral decadence of materialism .
Angered by the runaway success of anti-God books by Richard Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens , AC Grayling and others , the different faiths - though each believes it has the one and only divinely revealed truth and often fights to the death to prove it - combine in curious harmony against secularists .
They blame us for all the evils of modernity , as if they could point to some morally better time when people feared God and sinned less .
There is , of course , no evidence that God-fearers ever behaved better than the ungodly .
One of the great mysteries of religion is why , even when people believed that heaven awaited the virtuous and everlasting torment was the destiny of sinners , there is no sign it made them any less prone to all the sins flesh is heir to .
Yet they turn on atheists for lacking any moral base without a God .
I could say we are mortally offended and demand protection from such insult .
But it is the prerogative of religions to be protected from feeling offended .
Priests , imams and rabbis reserve for their beliefs a special respect , ringfenced from normal public argument .
It is abusive and insulting to suggest that belief in gods and miracles is delusional , or that religions are inherently anti-women and anti-gay .
Meanwhile , non-believers suffer the far worse insult that we inhabit a moral vacuum .
But we will live with the insult if we are free to reply that there is no inherent virtue in being religious either : it does not make people behave better .
The unctuous claim there is a special religious ethos that can be poured like a sauce over schools and public services to improve them morally has been bought , to a depressing extent , by Labour , and over a third of all state schools are now religious institutions - despite overwhelming evidence that their only unique quality is selection of better pupils , storing up trouble with ever more cultural segregation .
Here is an enjoyably impudent piece of research from Innsbruck University .
People were observed buying newspapers , using an honesty box to pay .
They were interviewed later - so the person with the clipboard seemed unconnected with the newspaper purchase - and asked about age , occupation and attitudes .
Men cheated more than women ; people over 50 cheated more than the young ; higher education made no difference ; and by a long chalk churchgoers cheated most .
This may be a statistical anomaly .
But we all know one thing : religion no more makes people good than lack of it makes the rest of us bad .
Secularists take offence too at the way the religious paint unbelievers as poor desiccated rationalists , not only without values , but joyless , lacking a sense of mystery , devoid of awe .
Yet , earthbound , there is enough wonder in the infinite capacity of the human imagination , in a magical world of thought , dream , hope , memory and fantasy .
To be human is not to be particularly rational , the senses often overwhelming common sense .
There is no emotional or spiritual deficiency in rejecting religions that infantilise the imagination with impossible beliefs .
In January many more atheist buses - an advertising campaign launched on Comment is Free - will roll on to the street than expected .
The British Humanist Association is astonished at the response - a target of £ 5,500 has swelled to £ 130,000 , most in small donations .
The buses will bear as good a message as any this Christmas : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " .

Ashcroft : Maybe I make better decisions on ' morphine ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Former Attorney General John Ashcroft , in an entirely under - reported November interview , claimed that he makes the best decisions " when I have a lot of morphine in my system . "
In a conversation with Fora TV , Ashcroft was confronted with a question about a March 2004 incident , in which the former AG was visited by his would - be successor as he lay sedated in a hospital bed .
Ashcroft was asked by Gonzales to re-authorize a controversial domestic spying program , over the objections of Ashcroft 's deputy , James Comey .
He refused to reverse the Justice Department 's decision , sparking a power struggle which saw the White House re-authorize its own program without the approval of the Justice Department .
In the interview , Ashcroft did not deny the sequence of events , but called the tale a " heated dispute , " and refused to confirm any further details .
That 's when he said , " So , I think the system worked .
And I 'm glad that it did .
It may not prove a whole lot about a lot of things .
It may just prove that when I have a lot of morphine in my system , I make the right decisions . "
Referring to the morphine drip call button many hospitals give to patients in enormous pain , Ashcroft added : " Maybe I should have kept one of those at my desk throughout my administration .
Make better decisions . "

If the nightmare of Juarez is unfamiliar to you , check out , While You Were Sleeping by Charles Bowden .
That ’s from 1996 .
Via : El Paso Times :
A group calling itself the Comando Ciudadano por Juárez , or the Juárez Citizens Command , is claiming it will kill a criminal every 24 hours to bring order to the violent crime - plagued city .
The announcement of the supposed group was the first known case of possible organized vigilantism in Juárez as police and the military have been apparently unable to stop a plague of killings and other crimes .
“ Better the death of a bad person than that they continue to contaminating our region , ” the news release stated in Spanish .
The supposed group issued a news release via e-mail stating it is nonpartisan and funded by businessmen fed up with crime .
The group , also calling itself the CCJ , said it would issue a manifesto in the coming days and would set up a system where residents can electronically send information about criminals .
“ Our mission is to terminate the life of a criminal every 24 hours …
The hour has come to stop this disorder in Juárez , ” the CCJ stated .
The announcement comes as Juárez struggles with a wave of homicides , extortions , carjackings , robberies and other crimes that began last year .
Business people , teachers , medical professionals and others were targeted by extortionists in the last year as crime surged due in a part to a war between drug cartels .
There were more than 1,600 homicides in Juárez last year .
There have been more than 40 homicides already this year , including 10 on Wednesday .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Laid - off workers at a Chicago window factory ended a five - day sit - in after banks agreed to lend the failed company $ 1.75 million for outstanding wages and benefits , union officials said Wednesday .
Protesters demonstrate in support of the window - factory workers in Chicago on Wednesday .
" The occupation is over , " said Armando Robles , president of the United Electrical Workers local 1110 , which led the sit-in .
About 200 workers launched what they called a " peaceful occupation " of the Republic Windows and Doors factory Friday after Republic gave its employees three days notice of the layoffs .
According to the workers , Republic told them that Bank of America had cut off credit to the company .
Federal law requires 60 days notice or 60 days paid compensation for workers when they close plants .
Bank of America agreed Wednesday to approve $ 1.35 million in loans to pay those obligations .
Another $ 400,000 came from J.P. Morgan Chase , union officials said .
Workers approved the deal at a meeting Wednesday night .
Union official Carl Rosen said the average worker will receive about $ 6,000 under the package .
But he added : " This is about more than just money .
It 's about what can be achieved when workers organize and stand up for justice . "
Union representative Leah Fried said this week that Republic had put the blame squarely on the bank for the layoffs .
" The company told us very clearly they are shutting down , shutting their doors because Bank of America refused to continue their credit and their financing , " she said .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ordered the state government to suspend doing business with Bank of America on Monday as the weekend protest spilled into the workweek .
After meeting with the workers on Monday , Blagojevich told reporters that " we are going to do everything possible here in Illinois to side with these workers . "
His meeting with the workers came a day before he was arrested on federal corruption charges related in part to the selection of a successor to President - elect Barack Obama 's former Senate seat .

From Ricky Gervais ’ stand - up Live , the Out of England tour , he talks about a safe - sex leaflet that he claims is real and was distributed to gay men in the late 80s or early 90s to avoid the spread of AIDS / HIV .
There were 10 tips in all , but Gervais only shares five in his act .
It ’s such a great list , you wish you knew all ten , if they indeed exist .
A search of the Internet could not produce any such leaflet .
Why the banana thumbnail ?
That ’s what was on the ( supposed ) real leaflet that was distributed by the Terrence Higgins Trust .
And I must say it has some brilliant suggestions .
The below clip is slightly different than the version I saw , but it gets the main point across .
Beware , it ’s not safe for work …

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Army is investigating allegations that Special Forces troops killed an al Qaeda suspect in cold blood and cut off his finger during an overnight operation near Baghdad earlier this month .
The U.S. Army is investigating the killing of Iraqi bomb - making suspect , Hardan al - Jaburi .
The December 10 raid , on a house in the Salman Pak district , 15 miles south of Baghdad , targeted suspected bomb - maker Hardan al - Jaburi .
In a statement , the U.S. military said al - Jaburi , armed with an AK - 47 , confronted troops conducting the raid .
" Perceiving hostile intent , the forces engaged the armed man , killing him , " the statement said .
But his relatives , assisted by a tribal leader , complained in a meeting with U.S. officials in Baghdad 's Green Zone that al - Jaburi was singled out by troops after he was rounded up along with his brothers .
Soldiers ordered him into the family 's house and then shot him dead , the relatives said .
Watch video that shows suspect 's severed finger »
In addition to the family 's claims , sources told CNN that concern within the U.S. military itself about the way the raid was conducted also triggered the investigation .
Much of what happened during the raid at the farmhouse that night is not in dispute .
According to the U.S. military , the raid began with an airborne assault .
Those inside the house were warned by loudspeakers that it was surrounded .
Al - Jaburi and his brothers then surrendered to the Americans .
According to both the U.S. military and the family 's account , al - Jaburi went back to the house .
And there is where the stories diverge .
In the U.S. version , al - Jaburi burst out of the house wielding an AK - 47 and was shot in the farmyard .
But the Iraqi family 's version is that all the brothers were stripped to their underwear and forced to lie on the ground , unable to move without the Americans ' permission .
The family says the Americans then took al - Jaburi back into the house .
" The American soldiers ordered [ al - Jaburi ] to go back inside the house , " said the dead man 's brother , Nurri .
" He was told to turn the lights on .
And the moment he turned on the lights , the soldiers opened fire , and then dragged him deeper inside the house . "
The relatives showed CNN grainy mobile phone video that showed what appeared to be thick pools of blood on the floor and bloody handprints on the wall in one room of the house .
And the video showed something else -- al - Jaburi 's corpse with one finger , apparently the index finger of his right hand , missing -- with a bloody gaping wound in its place as though the finger was recently severed .
The dead man 's family said soldiers on the raid cut off his finger and said the mutilation was an act of intimidation .
The military declined comment on that aspect of the case .
In its statement about the shooting , the U.S. military said , " We take all allegations of impropriety seriously and are reviewing the operation and procedures used during the operation .
As such , while such a review is under way , it would be improper to comment any further at this time . "
When a CNN crew visited after the raid , the farmhouse was in disarray from the search .
Dresser drawers were tossed in a pile , pieces of furniture were stacked on a disheveled bed -- and the bloody handprints remained on the wall .
The family told CNN that military investigators came to the house last week , spoke to family members and took photographs .
But there 's no word on when the military 's review of the incident will be completed .
CNN 's Michael Ware contributed to this report .

Rush Limbaugh
AKA Rush Hudson Limbaugh III
Born : 12 - Jan-1951
Birthplace : Cape Girardeau , MO
Gender : Male
Religion : Methodist
Race or Ethnicity : White
Sexual orientation : Straight
Occupation : Radio Personality , Pundit
Party Affiliation : Republican
Nationality : United States
Executive summary : Conservative talk show host
Rush Limbaugh was born into a prominent Missouri family , and raised in a town about thirty miles from the Kentucky border .
His grandfather , the first Rush Hudson Limbaugh , was America 's Ambassador to India in the Eisenhower administration .
His uncle , Stephen Limbaugh , was appointed federal judge by Ronald Reagan , and his cousin , Stephen Limbaugh Jr , was appointed to the U.S. District Court by George W. Bush .
His father was a prominent local attorney , who imbued his children with conservative ideology .
His brother , David Limbaugh , is a lawyer and conservative writer .
He started in radio as a disc jockey on his home town 's KGMO ( part - owned by Limbaugh 's father ) while he was still in high school , using the on-air name " Rusty Sharpe . "
He dropped out of college , and eventually landed a job as a morning disc jockey at a small top - 40 radio station in McKeesport , PA , near Pittsburgh .
He quickly moved to a bigger station in Pittsburgh , where he worked as " Jeff Christie " , and then to Kansas City , where he used his real name .
Several times over several years he was fired for making too many , too rude political comments .
Frustrated at his lack of success , he left radio , and took a job selling tickets for the Kansas City Royals baseball team .
Limbaugh 's radio career was revived by Norm Woodruff , a San Francisco radio executive who urged friends at Sacramento 's KFBK to hire him at a time when he was essentially unknown in the radio business .
Woodruff even took Limbaugh shopping for clothes , improving his appearance to make a better impression on KFBK brass .
The station decided to take a chance , putting Limbaugh on in what had been Morton Downey , Jr. 's time slot .
His ratings were better than Downey's , putting Limbaugh 's career back on track .
In telling the story of his success , Limbaugh occasionally mentions Woodruff 's help , but he never mentions that Woodruff was openly gay , and died of AIDS in the 1980s .
Limbaugh 's biggest break came in 1987 , when the Federal Communications Commission repealed its Fairness Doctrine , a rule that had required radio and television stations to provide equal time to both sides of political debates .
Freed from any requirement to air rebuttals to provocative opinions , Limbaugh 's radio style suddenly looked much more profitable , and within months he left Sacramento and signed with the ABC Radio Network , which syndicated his show from New York .
Limbaugh is now syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks , which is owned by Clear Channel Communications .
He is heard on about 600 stations nationwide , with little room for further growth -- there is no major market area where his program cannot be heard .
When substituting for Pat Sajak in a 1990 episode of Sajak 's ill - fated late night talk show , he was heckled and booed by the studio audience after he made anti-gay comments , until the auditorium was emptied , leaving Limbaugh to finish the show in front of hundreds of empty seats .
He had his own half - hour syndicated TV show from 1992 - 96 , produced by Republican operative and later CEO of Fox News Roger Ailes and filmed in front of studio audiences pre-screened to be friendly to his conservative perspectives .
Limbaugh backs conservative causes without any exceptions -- he supports capital punishment , opposes abortion , claims that global warming is a lie , etc .
Callers are pre-screened ; few who disagree with the host are allowed on the air .
There are rare guests -- occasionally Vice President Dick Cheney or other Republican officials drop in for a interview .
For three hours daily , five days a week , Limbaugh weaves his opinion with a sense of humor , sarcasm , and a confident voice that sounds accurate and authoritative , even if the facts he recites are often far from correct .
He has claimed , for example , that no -one was indicted in the Iran - Contra scandal ( 14 were ) , that America has more forest land now than in 1492 ( according to US Forest Service estimates , about 250,000,000 acres have been cut ) , that 75 % of Americans who earn minimum wage are teenagers on their first job ( in reality , the vast majority of minimum wage workers are over the age of 20 ) , on and on .
He has also given occasional credence to fringe conspiracy theories , claiming , for example , that Vince Foster was murdered instead of committing suicide , and that the crime took place in an apartment leased to Hillary Clinton .
Limbaugh has also accused German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of being a member of Germany 's Red Army Faction , a communist guerilla group blamed for more than 30 murders .
Limbaugh came to manhood in an era when the nation had a military draft for the Vietnam war .
He avoided service by having his physician certify his medical unfitness due to an " inoperable pilonidal cyst " and " a football knee from high school . "
He played one year of varsity football in high school , and his coach , Ryland Meyr , said later he remembered no injuries to Limbaugh .
Those who loathe Limbaugh sometimes describe his pilonidal cyst as " a boil on his butt " , but that is an oversimplification .
A pilonidal cyst is a chronic collection of pus or an abnormal draining passage leading to an abscess , located in the opening between the buttocks muscles .
It is susceptible to infection , which can be dangerous on a war front , so severe pilonidal cysts have long been ( and still are ) legitimate grounds for exemption from military service .
The peculiar thing is that Limbaugh denies he ever had a pilonidal cyst , dismissing it as " internet bull " , though the record is plain .
But Limbaugh reaches ordinary Americans , because he sounds like an ordinary American .
Sometimes he sounds like an ordinary working stiff , as he complains about the wealthy elite who control America : " All of these rich guys -- like the Kennedy family and Perot -- pretending to live just like we do and pretending to understand our trials and tribulations and pretending to represent us . "
Limbaugh 's current contract pays him $ 45 - million per year , and he has spoken of friends who make $ 180,000 per year and " do n't consider themselves rich " .
He has said of the official poverty line , " $ 14,400 for a family of four ?
That 's not so bad . "
Commenting on corporate outsourcing and layoffs , Limbaugh once wondered , " Why is it that whenever a corporation fires workers , it 's never speculated that the workers might have deserved it ? "
Limbaugh 's impact on America has been huge .
Talk radio was a very minor niche when his program was first syndicated , and stations that aired a conservative - tilted program almost invariably balanced that with a liberal - tilted program .
Now , talk radio is almost exclusively conservative , and Limbaugh has spawned many imitators , including Sean Hannity , Michael Medved , and Tony Snow -- all of whom got early exposure guest - hosting on Limbaugh 's program .
In 1994 , Limbaugh was widely credited as Republicans were elected to control of Congress , with several newly - elected Congressman openly calling themselves " the Dittohead caucus . "
In his book The Way Things Ought To Be , Limbaugh wrote , " I believe that strong , wholesome family values are at the very core of a productive , prosperous , and peaceful society . "
So what are Limbaugh 's family values ?
His first wife , Roxy Maxine McNeely , was a sales secretary at a Kansas City radio station .
She was granted divorce under grounds of incompatibility after almost three years of marriage .
His second wife , Michelle Sixta , was an usher at the Royals ' ball park .
They divorced after about five years .
He met his third wife , aerobics instructor Marta Fitzgerald , through CompuServe 's dating service , and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas performed their wedding ceremony .
According to the Palm Beach Post , Limbaugh and Fitzgerald maintained separate houses during their marriage .
She divorced Limbaugh at his request after ten years of marriage , at about the time Limbaugh began dating then - CNN anchor Daryn Kagan .
In 2003 , Limbaugh was forced to resign as a football commentator at ESPN amid allegations of racism , after he said in a telecast that Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb was overrated , and given extra attention because the league and the media wanted a black quarterback to be successful . [ 1 ]
So is Limbaugh a racist ?
On his show , he routinely pronounces " ask " and " asked " as " axe " and " axed " , he routinely calls light - skinned African - Americans like Halle Berry and Barack Obama " Halfrican - Americans " , and he has frequently described President Obama as " an immature childish manchild " and " essentially a primitive , indigenous guy . "
He once told a black caller to " take that bone out of your nose and call me back " , and asked , " Have you ever noticed how all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson ? "
When his comments are taken as offensive , Limbaugh seems to enjoy the added attention .
Among his more famous lines , he described the abuse at Abu Ghraib , where prisoners were stacked naked , sexually taunted and beaten while blindfolded , as the equivalent of " hazing , a fraternity prank " .
He called 13 - year - old Chelsea Clinton " the White House dog " , and eulogized Kurt Cobain as " a worthless shred of human debris . "
In 2006 , when it was revealed that Republican Congressman Mark Foley had sent sexually explicit emails to an underage Congressional page , Limbaugh was the first and one of the few media voices to announce the teenager 's name .
He also blamed the boy for leading the Congressman on , wondering on the air if " maybe the page is out there engaged in some kind of chicanery . "
In 2001 , Limbaugh announced on his radio program that he had been losing his hearing , and was " almost completely deaf . "
He then had a cochlear implant installed in his left ear , and said that his hearing was mostly restored .
In 2003 , responding to published reports that he was under investigation for purchasing illegal drugs , he announced that he had become addicted to prescription opiates such as oxycodone as a result of long - term back pain .
Oxycodone is marketed under such familiar brand names as Percodan , Percocet , and OxyContin , and hearing loss is a well - established side effect of oxycodone addiction .
Limbaugh , of course , has always called for harsh penalties for drug abusers , arguing that " if people are violating the law by doing drugs , they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up . "
After admitting his own addiction , he took a month off his radio show to undergo rapid rehab .
He then spent the next several years battling Florida investigators who sought his medical records to investigate him for " doctor shopping " -- the crime of obtaining the same prescription from more than one doctor , since Limbaugh 's use of oxycodone had been far in excess of the amount any doctor would plausibly prescribe .
Claiming a right to privacy , he was assisted in his courtroom appeals by the American Civil Liberties Union , a group he has often criticized before and after accepting their help .
In a 2006 plea bargain , charges were dropped in exchange for Limbaugh 's payment of $ 30,000 , agreement to undergo 18 months of drug abatement therapy , and his agreement to submit to random drug testing .
In June 2006 , Limbaugh had further drug problems when a bottle of Viagra was found in his luggage at the Palm Beach Airport .
The prescription was not in Limbaugh 's name , but no charges were filed against Limbaugh , who was returning from a vacation in the Dominican Republic with four male companions .
In October 2006 , responding to television ads showing a shaky Parkinson 's - afflicted Michael J. Fox pleading for voters to support candidates who would fund embryonic stem cell research over Republicans who oppose such research , Limbaugh said Fox was simply faking his symptoms .
" He is exaggerating the effects of the disease , " Limbaugh said .
" He is moving all around and shaking and it 's purely an act ...
This is really shameless of Michael J. Fox .
Either he did n't take his medication or he 's acting . "
Since Limbaugh 's Sacramento days , his show 's theme song has been an endless bass - beating loop snipped from a 1984 song by The Pretenders , " My City Was Gone . "
The song , though , has potent and openly liberal lyrics , written by Chrissie Hynde to protest over - development : " I went back to Ohio / but my pretty countryside / had been paved down the middle / by a government that had no pride . "
Limbaugh never sought permission to use the music , never paid royalties , and Hynde , living in England , heard only occasionally about her song 's hijacking .
She had no comment until 1997 , when Limbaugh answered a reporter 's question about the song by explaining that it was " icing on the cake that it was [ written by ] an environmentalist , animal rights wacko and was an anti-conservative song .
It is anti-development , anti-capitalist , and here I am going to take a liberal song and make fun of [ liberals ] at the same time . "
Upon reading that , Hynde had her representatives contact Limbaugh and demand payment .
At Hynde 's request , Limbaugh 's royalty checks for using her song are now made payable to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) .

( CNN ) -- Archaeologists in Israel have discovered what they believe is the bust of a Roman boxer from the second or third century .
The figurine is small -- about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide -- but very detailed , archaeologists say .
" It seems that what we have here is a unique find , " the two directors of the excavation said in a statement released Monday by the Israel Antiquities Authority .
The figurine , made of marble , comes from a time when " the art of Roman sculpture reached its zenith , " Doron Ben - Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets said .
It 's tiny -- only about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide , Ben -Ami told CNN .
" That 's why it is so impressive .
It 's so small , but still you can see every little detail on the marble , " he said .
The archaeologists believe a merchant family from the eastern part of the Roman Empire most likely passed down the " precious object " through the generations until the fourth or fifth century , when an unfortunate family member had it with him at a public building , perhaps a hostel -- and an earthquake struck .
A team has been digging up the building in the City of David , part of Jerusalem .
The object is part of the " silent testimony of the drama that occurred in this impressive structure prior to its collapse , " the Israel Antiquities Authority said .
The " short hair style , the prominent lobes and curves of the ears , as well as the almond - shaped eyes suggest that the object most likely portrays an athlete , probably a boxer , " the statement said .
Little bits of the sculpture have broken off .
It is missing part of the nose and mouth , Ben - Ami said .
" The high level of finish on the figurine is extraordinary , " Ben -Ami and Tchekhanovets said in their statement .
They added : " To the best of our knowledge , to date no similar artifact made of marble ( or any other kind of stone ) bearing the same image that was just found has been discovered in excavations elsewhere in the country . "
A few similar artifacts made of bronze have been found " at different sites in the country and they have been found in large numbers in different places throughout the Roman Empire , where the overwhelming majority of them date to the third century CE ( the Roman period ) . "
Two tiny holes in the figurine suggest it was used as a suspended weight together with a balance scale , the archaeologists said .
Last month , the excavation team at this same site discovered " one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever found in Jerusalem , " the Israel Antiquities Authority said .
" It consists of 264 gold coins and was found at about the same time as a gold earring , inlaid with expensive pearls and remarkably well preserved . "
" Every single object has a story behind it , " Ben - Ami said in an interview with CNN .
" Behind every object there are people .
And , for us , the most important thing is to try to tell the stories behind these items . "

Talking about the process of shooting Golden Galaxy - winner Slumdog Millionaire , director Danny Boyle reveals that they shot parts of the movie using a " a Canon stills camera , which takes 12 frames per second . "

They used the still cameras to shoot crowd scenes , since they did n't use actors , just waves people flowing by , and they wanted to get " in the middle of everything " while preserving a natural , unscripted energy : " If people see a stills camera , they do n't think it 's recording live action . "
He does n't get any more specific about what camera he used , unfortunately .
I would think it 's one of Canon 's pro point - and - shoots , like a PowerShot G10 or SX10 .
But just think what he could 've done with a 5D Mark II .

Somalia 's increasingly brazen pirates are building sprawling stone houses , cruising in luxury cars , marrying beautiful women — even hiring caterers to prepare Western - style food for their hostages .
And in an impoverished country where every public institution has crumbled , they have become heroes in the steamy coastal dens they operate from because they are the only real business in town .
" The pirates depend on us , and we benefit from them , " said Sahra Sheik Dahir , a shop owner in Haradhere , the nearest village to where a hijacked Saudi Arabian supertanker carrying $ 100 million in crude was anchored Wednesday .

As one might expect in a credit crunch , default risk is rising .
One measure of that risk is corporate bond yields .
Let 's take a look and see how various grades of bonds are performing .
Click on any chart in this series to see a sharper image .
Bloomberg AAA Rated Industrial 10 - Year Bond Index
Bloomberg A Rated Industrial 10 - Year Bond Index
Bloomberg BBB Rated Industrial 10 - Year Bond Index
Bloomberg B Rated Industrial 10 - Year Bond Index
The above charts are courtesy of Bloomberg sent to me by Chris Puplava at Financial Sense .
The idea for this post came from Bennet Sedacca who posted one of the above charts on Minyanville .
As you can see , only AAA rated bonds are performing well .
This is strong evidence that we are not in a period of " disinflation " as some claim .
In a disinflationary environment , one would expect risk premiums to drop not rise .
Action here is consistent with rising default risk , which is what one should expect in deflation .
Those harping about prices of consumer goods , food , services , etc. , are missing the boat about what deflation is and what one should expect in deflation .
Trillions of dollars of debt are being wiped off the books via bankruptcies and foreclosures while inflationistas worry about the price of eggs going up by 35 cents .
It is truly mindless .
Baa to 3 Month T - Bill Spread
Click On Chart For Sharper Image
The above chart sent by my friend " BC " is quite telling .
It shows risk premiums of Baa rated bonds over 3 - Month T - Bill rates going all the way back to 1934 .
This spread is at an all time high .
Otherwise , the highest points on the chart are during the Great Depression and the stagflation period in the 70's and 80s ' .
So which one is it , Stagflation or Deflation ?
This is where it pays to evaluate more than one indicator at a time .
To resolve the question , one needs to look at other factors such as the treasury yield itself .
30 Year Bond Yields
Click On Chart For Sharper Image
The idea of stagflation is simply not consistent with falling treasury yields , especially 30 year bond yields near 4 % .
Disinflation is consistent with falling treasury yields as is deflation .
However , as noted above , rising corporate bond yields are not consistent disinflation .
And finally , inflation is not consistent with collapsing 30 year bond yields .
One cannot cherry pick data , one needs to look at all of it and see where the preponderance of the evidence is .
In addition to the above charts one must also consider collapsing commodity prices and a collapsing stock market , both of which are consistent with deflation .
Periods of disinflation are where the equity markets make the greatest gains .
Inquiring minds should also consider Parents Pull Kids From Day Care ( And Other Deflationary Topics ) for a look at base money supply and how that supports the deflation thesis .
Thus the data are crystal clear .
We are not in a period of inflation , we are not in a period of stagflation , we are not in a period of disinflation .
If you exclude all the options proven to be impossible , the remaining option no matter how unlikely it may seem at first glance , must be the correct answer .
That answer is deflation .
We are in it , and have been for some time .

( CNN ) --
" Sometimes you can forget about the preciousness of life , " hospital spokesman Allen Poston thumbed onto his Blackberry after peering into an operating room where a team of 15 doctors and medical staff separated conjoined twins in six hours in surgery .
Two - month - old twins Preslee and Kylee Wells required surgical separation .
" I 'm standing here in the operating room looking at the exposed beating heart of Preslee Wells , " he wrote as he walked the halls at the Children 's Hospital of Oklahoma University Medical Center .
On Monday afternoon , 2 - month - old Preslee and her conjoined sister , Kylee , rolled onto their own backs for the first time , he said .
Poston , who updated friends and relatives on the surgery with constant posts from his hospital blog , snapped photos of each girl and showed them to friends and family who had been in the hospital waiting room since early Monday .
The news of the operation 's success prompted a gush of emotion , breaking the silence that had once filled the room , Poston said .
After two months of waiting , the two girls were surgically separated .
" We waited because we wanted the organs to get a little bigger , a little stronger , " Poston had told CNN over the phone earlier Monday .
" The primary concern was cardiac connection . "
After cardiac imaging , doctors determined there was " very little [ cardiac ] connection , " but they remained concerned about a " liver bridge " connecting the twins .
That bridge , Poston said , posed the greatest operational risk because of its dual use by the twins .
Born October 25 in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , to Stevie Stewart and Kylie Wells , the twins are being monitored in the hospital 's neonatal intensive care unit .
They are listed in critical condition .
" Today , they leave the OR in two different cribs , one following the other , still close in proximity , but might as well have been a mile apart , " Poston wrote .
" And that is exactly what everybody was hoping for . "

Inorganic Phosphates In Processed Food Linked To Lung Cancer Risk
New research in an animal model suggests that a diet high in inorganic phosphates , which are found in a variety of processed foods including meats , cheeses , beverages , and bakery products , might speed growth of lung cancer tumors and may even contribute to the development of those tumors in individuals predisposed to the disease .
The study also suggests that dietary regulation of inorganic phosphates may play an important role in lung cancer treatment .
The research , using a mouse model , was conducted by Myung - Haing Cho , D.V.M. , Ph.D. , and his colleagues at Seoul National University , appears in the first issue for January of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , published by the American Thoracic Society .
" Our study indicates that increased intake of inorganic phosphates strongly stimulates lung cancer development in mice , and suggests that dietary regulation of inorganic phosphates may be critical for lung cancer treatment as well as prevention , " said Dr. Cho .
Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in the world and is also the most frequently diagnosed solid tumor .
Non–small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) constitutes over 75 percent of lung cancers and has an average overall 35 - year survival rate of 14 percent .
Earlier studies have indicated that approximately 90 percent of NSCLC cases were associated with activation of certain signaling pathways in lung tissue .
This study revealed that high levels of inorganic phosphates can stimulate those same pathways .
" Lung cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cell proliferation in lung tissue , and disruption of signaling pathways in those tissues can confer a normal cell with malignant properties , " Dr. Cho explained .
" Deregulation of only a small set of pathways can confer a normal cell with malignant properties , and these pathways are regulated in response to nutrient availability and , consequently , cell proliferation and growth .
" Phosphate is an essential nutrient to living organisms , and can activate some signals , " he added .
" This study demonstrates that high intake of inorganic phosphates may strongly stimulate lung cancer development by altering those ( signaling ) pathways . "
In the study , lung cancer - model mice were studied for four weeks and were randomly assigned to receive a diet of either 0.5 or 1.0 percent phosphate , a range roughly equivalent to modern human diets .
At the end of the four - week period , the lung tissue was analyzed to determine the effects of the inorganic phosphates on tumors .
" Our results clearly demonstrated that the diet higher in inorganic phosphates caused an increase in the size of the tumors and stimulated growth of the tumors , " Dr. Cho said .
Dr. Cho noted that while a moderate level of phosphate plays an essential role in living organisms , the rapidly increasing use of phosphates as a food additive has resulted in significantly higher levels in average daily diets .
Phosphates are added to many food products to increase water retention and improve food texture .
" In the 1990s , phosphorous - containing food additives contributed an estimated 470 mg per day to the average daily adult diet , " he said .
" However , phosphates are currently being added much more frequently to a large number of processed foods , including meats , cheeses , beverages , and bakery products .
As a result , depending on individual food choices , phosphorous intake could be increased by as much as 1000 mg per day . "
" Although the 0.5 percent was defined as close to ' normal , ' the average diet today is actually closer to the one percent diet and may actually exceed it , " Dr. Cho noted .
" Therefore , the 0.5 percent intake level is actually a reduced phosphate diet by today 's scale . "
Dr. Cho said future studies will help refine what constitutes a " safe " level of dietary inorganic phosphate , with recommendations that will be easily achievable in the average population .
" The results of this study suggest that dietary regulation of inorganic phosphates has a place in lung cancer treatment , and our eventual goal is to collect sufficient information to accurately assess the risk of these phosphates , " he said .
John Heffner , M.D. , past president of the ATS , stated that this line of investigation in animals addresses the complex interactions between host factors and the environment that underlie cancer in man .
" We know that only some patients who smoke develop lung cancer but the reasons for this varying risk are unknown .
This study now provides a rationale for funding case - control studies in humans to determine the potential role of dietary phosphates in promoting cancer . "
Every taxpayer in the country has lost almost £ 40,000 since the onset of the credit crunch , as plunging house prices and the savage sell - off in stock markets have obliterated £ 1.2 trillion of Britain 's national wealth .
The combined impact of the property downturn and the slide in share prices has wiped out the equivalent of a full year 's economic output , according to research by analyst Dharval Joshi at City bank RAB Capital , £ 38,700 for every one of Britain 's 31 million taxpayers .
" We 're only halfway through ; there 's more destruction to come before we stabilise , " said Joshi , predicting that as much as £ 2 trillion could be knocked off the value of assets .
Even by the end of 2008 , just six months into what many analysts believe will be a prolonged recession , he calculates that £ 700 bn has been lost in the housing market since the downturn began , plus £ 500bn from Britons ' pension pots and share portfolios .
With public anger at senior bankers , regulators and politicians growing as the scale of the damage becomes clear , Gordon Brown will use a speech tomorrow to demand tighter international regulation of banks .
He will argue that the crisis was exacerbated because no regulators , no ministers and startlingly few banking executives knew what assets had been sold to whom .
The prime minister will try to build a consensus around curbs on irresponsible banking practices later this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos , the annual gathering of tycoons and politicians .
The Commons Treasury select committee will also seek to hold the industry to account over short - selling bank shares when it cross -examines five leading hedge fund managers
on Tuesday .
The Conservatives seized on Joshi's research yesterday to accuse the government of failing to protect consumers .
Philip Hammond , shadow chief secretary , said : " Gordon Brown said he 'd ended boom and bust , but he 's presided over the biggest asset bubble in living memory and now we are all paying the price .
Confidence in Brown 's economic management has evaporated at home and the relentless decline of the pound shows that the rest of the world thinks the same . "
Sterling declined sharply on the foreign exchanges last week , amid fears that the government 's insurance scheme to protect banks against losses on ' toxic ' assets - details of which are still being finalised this weekend - could expose the taxpayer to billions of pounds of additional liabilities .
Official figures revealed on Friday that the economy contracted by 1.5 % in the final three months of 2008 , underlining the severity of the downturn .
Lord Myners , the City minister , said the economy was undergoing a " correction " .
" We know that there were elements of a bubble , not just in credit markets and share prices , but also in things like art and jewellery .
There 's a correction back towards an equilibrium .
That 's why we 're taking the action that we are to support those who are most exposed . "
But Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the government should have warned the public earlier that the housing market in particular was in the grip of an out - of - control boom .
" They failed in their responsibility by failing to recognise the seriousness of the problem .
We were rushing towards the edge of the cliff . "
Rapid declines in wealth alarm economists , because consumers tend to respond by cutting spending , exacerbating recession .
Danny Gabay of City consultancy Fathom said consumers had previously boosted their spending power by borrowing against their houses , but by the last quarter of 2008 mortgage borrowers were actually paying down equity , with a potentially devastating impact on spending .
" If you bought your house for £ 100,000 and some bloke in a pinstripe suit tells you it 's worth £ 200,000 , then you feel like you 're being conservative if you only borrow an extra £ 25,000 , " said Gabay , who is concerned that the knock - on impact of the housing crash on families ' spending habits has only just begun .
Joshi said Britain 's housing boom and resulting bust meant the economy was likely to take longer to recover than America's , where consumers have more of their savings tied up in shares , which tend to see recovery faster .
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has warned residents not to panic ahead of storms expected later today .
The weather bureau says thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected to cross the Darling Downs and arrive in the Brisbane area by about 4:00 pm AEST .
But Ms Bligh says the storms will not be nearly as bad as those earlier in the week and she has urged residents to stay at home and listen for warnings .
" The storm is looking like it will be a strong storm but not of the magnitude that we 've seen , " she said this morning .
However we understand how quickly that can change and we will be providing advice on a very regular basis . "
The Bureau of Meterology has issued a severe weather warning for damaging wind gusts in the south - east coast district .
The bureau released its latest Brisbane forecast at 11:10 am AEST .
It reads : " A mostly fine , windy day .
Chance of a shower or thunderstorm this afternoon or evening .
Moderate to fresh NW to W winds , with stronger gusts at times in the afternoon and evening . "
Earlier the bureau said any storm cells would be fast - moving , with strong winds rather than heavy rain posing the greatest threat .
A deep low pressure system off the New South Wales coast is pushing gusty south - westerly winds across the border .
Forecaster Craig Mitchell says residents should secure their houses and stay out of the strong wind .
" This will be more in line for the higher ground and up on top of the sort of the hilltops and the ridges whereby we could be looking at potentially damaging winds of up to about say 90 to 100 kilometres per hour developing through the afternoon and into the early evening , " he said .
The State Government has set up two evacuation centres in Brisbane 's north - west , at The Gap State High School and the Gaythorne RSL .
Some 389 SES volunteers are working to repair storm damage from earlier in the week , including 188 who arrived from New South Wales and Victoria today .
Travis Bell from the SES says more are on standby .
" We 're ready for whatever might come , " he said .
There have been no plans to cancel the Rugby League World Cup final at Lang Park and the cricket Test at the Gabba .
Meanwhile , Queensland 's Department of Communities says the heavy rain has been playing havoc with septic tanks in rural areas west of Brisbane .
The department 's Brooke Winters says residents in Ipswich , Laidley and Rosewood are still trying to dry out their homes , and localised flooding is still affecting residents of Goodna and Bellbird Park near Ipswich .
Ms Winters says the heavy rain has caused some septic tanks to back up .
" A lot of those have been flooded and when people are using their facilities now , what 's happening is that some of the sewage is actually backing up through the pipes , " she said .
" People have to be very careful of that and they do have to contact council and SES to seek assistance with that . "

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Thursday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown says Obama was right to express outrage at news of $ 18 billion in Wall Street bonuses .
( CNN ) --
A lot of us were outraged to read new details today about the big bonuses going to those Wall Street bankers .
You know , the guys whose companies we are all bailing out at the moment .
Despite the enormous damage created by the Wall Street failures , we now know Wall Street rewarded itself with $ 18 billion in bonuses for 2008 .
We would normally take this moment to take a shot at them , but frankly , the president did it for us today , and said it pretty well .
President Obama :
" When I saw an article today indicating that Wall Street bankers had given themselves $ 20 billion worth of bonuses , the same amount of bonuses they gave themselves in 2004 , at a time when most of these institutions were teetering on collapse and they are asking for taxpayers to help sustain them and when taxpayers find themselves in the difficult position that if they do n't provide help that the entire system could come down on top of our heads -- that is the height of irresponsibility .
' No Bias , No Bull '

" It is shameful .
We 're going to be having conversations as this process moves forward directly with these folks on Wall Street to underscore that they have to start acting in a more responsible fashion if we are to together get this economy rolling again .
" There will be time for them to make profits and there will be time for them to get bonuses .
" Now is not that time . "

( CNN ) -- Honda have confirmed they are pulling out of Formula One , unless a buyer for the team can be found by the end of the month , blaming the global financial crisis for their decision .
Jenson Button , left , and Rubens Barrichello could be out of a job following Honda 's withdrawal from F1 .
Chief executive Takeo Fukui announced at a news conference in Tokyo that the company would be willing to sell the team and will withdraw from the 2009 competition if no buyer is found by the end of Decemebr -- ending the Japanese car giant 's nine - year involvement in the sport .
" We , Honda Motor Co Ltd , have come to the conclusion that we will withdraw from all Formula One activities , making 2008 the last season of our participation , " said Fukui .
" This difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry , brought on by the sub - prime problem in the United States , the deepening credit crisis and the sudden contraction of the world economies .
" Honda must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economies around the globe continue to mount .
A recovery is expected to take some time , " he added .
It is understood the 600 members of staff at Brackley , near the Silverstone circuit in England , were told job losses would be likely , even if a buyer was found for the team .
The news also leaves drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello facing an uncertain future , with spare places in rival teams few and far between .
Honda 's demise would also reduce the F1 grid to just 18 cars ( nine teams ) and would see them become the second team to fold this year following Super Aguri 's closure early in the season .
Despite a huge operational budget of $ 300 million , Honda have under - achieved in the sport , finishing ninth out of 10 in the constructors ' standings with Barrichello 14th and Button 18th out of the 20 drivers .
Honda Motor Corporation are dealing with faltering sales worldwide and the Formula One team is not the only casualty .
On Thursday , 490 temporary employees were told they would be laid off at the end of January , while last month 270 temporary employees were informed their contracts were not being renewed .
Max Mosley , president of Formula
One 's governing body , the FIA , said Honda 's withdrawal had confirmed his " longstanding concern that the cost of competing in the world championship is unsustainable . "
Read more about Mosley 's past warnings
Mosley sent a letter to the remaining teams urging them to accept cost - cutting moves including smaller , more fuel - efficient engines , which he estimated would shave up to $ 60 million off the expense of running a team beginning in the 2010 season .
" In the FIA 's view , the global economic downturn has only exacerbated an already critical situation , " Mosley said .
" What has happened to Honda is very sad because obviously it involves a lot of jobs and they are a key player in Formula One , but I have to say it was not entirely unexpected , " he added .
" I 've been expecting one of the major manufacturers to stop for some time because even before the current situation the costs were completely out of control .
Now it 's difficult to imagine how any manufacturer could stay in the sport unless we make really substantial reductions in costs . "
Meanwhile , Honda team principal Ross Brawn remains confident a suitable new owner could still be found .
The former Ferrari technical director told BBC Radio Five Live : " It 's a fantastic opportunity for someone to step into what will be a very competitive team next year .
" The facilities here are one of the best in Formula One , the workforce is definitely one of the best in Formula One and we have got a great car design for next year .
" I think it would be unfortunate for Formula One if this had a domino effect on other teams .
I hope that does n't happen but all the teams are having to face up to this economic environment .
" Formula One unfortunately has a certain inertia and it is difficult to change things quickly because of the regulations .
If a car factory gets into difficulty it can close down for a few months , stop production .
We can't do that .
We have races to go to and schedules to meet .
" It is very difficult to turn the tap off in Formula One overnight but I think the things that are being done now can really make a difference next year and in 2010 . "

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Blu-ray Disc player sales were strong through the holidays , and even the season ’s so - so disc sales went well enough to sustain industry hopes that the format can still become a next - gen cash cow for the studios .
Television images are reflected on a sign for Blu-ray Discs at the 2007 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nevada January 9 , 2007 .

That ’s the broad , instant analysis of how Blu-ray hardware and software fared during the fourth quarter .
Industry trade organization Digital Entertainment Group is expected this week to release detailed breakdowns of 2008 Blu-ray and DVD sales as well as projections for the high - def format and its traditional - disc forebear .
Two elements loom large :
-- Industryites hoped holiday gift purchases of Blu-ray players and discs helped the format gain a firmer market hold .
--
The global economic crisis put a crimp on consumer spending .
Happily for Blue - ray proponents , player prices were slashed dramatically for the Black Friday kickoff to the holiday shopping season -- in many cases as low as $ 200 , long considered a key price point for consumer acceptance of such technology .
That was a little late in the game to bolster high - def disc sales , but Blu-ray machines fairly jumped off store shelves once retailers dropped prices on the hardware .
On Monday , Adams Media Research said fourth - quarter player sales went so well that the research firm was raising its estimate of Blu-ray households in the U.S. from a previously projected 2.9 million to 3.1 million by year ’s end .
“ On the hardware front , things went exceedingly well , ” said Tom Adams , president of the Carmel Valley , Calif . - based research firm .
“ On the other hand , it all happened so late in the year that it did n’t drive software sales as much as we had projected . ”
Adams Media had been expecting studios to sell about 30 million Blu-ray discs during the holidays but ended up selling “ probably only in the mid-20s , ” Adams said .
Studio execs began reining in their own projections at the outset of the fourth quarter , with the pullback in consumer spending already evident .
But DEG announced a $ 25 million marketing campaign to push Blu-ray amid the challenging conditions , and there is a prevailing sense that Blu-ray ’s holiday campaign went OK , all things considered .
“ Blu - ray sales were strong enough throughout the year , and particularly in the fourth quarter , to bolster confidence that this will be the next - gen disc format , ” said Scott Hettrick , editor of the Blu-ray blog HollywoodInHi-Def .
“ Set - top player sales were very slow to take off .
But in the late third quarter and early fourth quarter , especially after Black Friday , sales of Blu-ray players really took off .
That ’s probably the most encouraging aspect of the Blu-ray market right now . ”
Meanwhile , Blu-ray disc sales remain a sliver of the overall home entertainment market , contributing perhaps 5 % of sector revenue in 2008 .
Yet with DVD revenue now dipping , studios are desperate to find a replacement for the vital cash flow traditional disc sales have generated .
That would be Blu-ray -- eventually .
Blu -ray ’s current installed base is less than one - fourth what many feel is needed to sustain disc sales and sufficiently replace diminishing DVD revenue dollar - for - dollar .
Adams Media projects 15 million Blu-ray households in the U.S. by the end of 2010 , which by no coincidence Adams believes also could be the first year high - def disc sales manage to make up completely for the annual decline in DVD sales .
Of course , there are already titles that do notably well in Blu-ray .
Big sellers over the holidays included Warner Bros . ’
“ The Dark Knight , ” Paramount ’s “ Iron Man ” and Universal ’s “ Mamma Mia ! ”
But overall , no one is rushing to declare a huge victory for Blu-ray software sales this holiday season .
“ The studios expected to turn things around in the fourth quarter with some very strong titles , but it did n’t happen , ” Adams said .
“ We think sales will be down at least in the single - digit percentages when we total everything up . ”
But there ’s also no sign of anyone giving up the hope the Blu-ray will develop into a lucrative home entertainment format .
“ I do n’t think any of this impacts the big picture of Blu-ray ’s taking over from DVD , ” Adams said .
“ This is just a sign of how bad things were economically in the fourth quarter . ”

Industry Insights : From The Industry Side Condensation of All Game Fiction by lizard
April 18 , 2002 April 18 , 2002 lizard 's backstory I should probably stay out of this , for the simple reason that I tend to hate in - game fiction of more than a paragraph or two in length .
A pithy quote or a single paragraph at the start of a chapter adds mood ; more than that , and I feel like it 's padding .
I especially hate it when vital game - world information is contained in the fiction , since I tend to skip the fiction entirely until the third or fourth reading .
[ 1 ]
Thus , I can only give you advice on what NOT to do , via the following " Condensation of All Game Fiction " . [ 1 ]
Yes , I know many people on this list write it , and are good at it .
I know the customers expect it , and like it .
I know a lot of people who write it are proud of it .
None of this changes my opinion .
It does n't matter how well - played a football game is , how skilled and dedicated the players are , how much time and effort they put into training and practic , how complex and intricate the strategies are -- if you do n't like football , you do n't like football , and that is that .

Almost 22 years after her murder , Dana Ramm 's sisters is still holding out hope detectives will find her killer .
" This has been an emotional roller coaster , " Carla Ramm told NBC Bay Area recently .
A passerby found the bloody body of Dana Ramm off Andrade Road in remote Alameda County on Dec. 29 , 1986 .
That 's how long the Ramm family says they 've lived without answers .
Dana Ramm was with friends that night , but no one has given detectives any usable leads .
Now , those detectives are all - in on a deck of cards .
The cold case unit of the Alameda County Sheriff 's Office is handing out thousands of playing cards to jail inmates .
On one side of those cards , the picture of Dana Ramm , and of several other victims of unsolved murders or kidnappings from Alameda County .
On the other side is an anonymous tip - line along with a cash reward .
The hope is an inmate will recognize one of the featured victims .
Or detectives hope an inmate heard about one of the cases through a cell mate , and can finger the suspect .
" Understand that you will pay , either in this life or you will pay in the next life , but you will pay , " an emotional Georgia Ramm said recently about her daughter 's killer .
" And if it was me , I 'd rather pay in this life , " Ramm said .
Detectives will unveil the program late Tuesday morning at the santa Rita Jail in Dublin .
They 'll be joined by the Ramm family , along with the families of Ilene Misheloff , Jennifer Lin , Kellie Jean Poppleton , Angelo Ravella , Mark Espinal , Kente Jones , Elsie Winston , and Gary Jones .
Their hopes now lie on the memories of jail inmates , convicts who might have the answers they 've been desperately searching for .
Thirteen victims are featured in the cards , men and women who've ' disappeared , or been killed .
Each one appears four times in every deck .
Families met the news with reserved hope .
" The last couple years have been the hardest times we 've had as a family , " said Traci Fuqua , who lost a family member .

Ohio TV station : Was Connell crash an accident or murder ?

The death of Republican " IT guru " Mike Connell last Friday in a fiery plane crash has been the subject of intense speculation online about whether it might have been murder -- but very little of that speculation has made it into the national media .
Now one local TV station in Connell 's home state of Ohio is acknowledging that there are questions about his death .
" Well , this sounds like a made up story , " Scott Taylor of 19 Action News in Cleveland began .
" One man rigging state elections to help his boss , President George Bush .
After it 's done , power players in Washington say ' Get rid of the guy . '
Do I believe it ?
No -- for now . "
Taylor noted that " bad weather could have played a part in the crash " but " some in Washington have a different opinion . "
" Some say Connell was about to reveal embarrassing details involving senior members of the Bush Administration , " Taylor explained , " including their involvement in destroying incriminating emails and rigging elections .
Connell died on impact , and was only 3 miles from the Akron - Canton Airport .
He was an experienced pilot .
Was it an accident , or murder ? "
Connell had played a central role in two separate Bush administration scandals .
He had created the website for the Ohio secretary of state 's office which some have linked to suspected election fraud during the 2004 presidential race .
He also set up the domains which White House staff used for their off - the - books emails concerning the firing of US Attorneys , emails which are now said to have been destroyed .
In a press release cited by 19 Action News , the website Velvet Revolution revealed that " a person close to Mr. Connell has recently been discussing with a VR investigator how Mr. Connell can tell all about his work for George Bush .
Mr. Connell told a close associate that he was afraid that the George Bush and Dick Cheney would ' throw [ [ him ] under the bus . '
A tipster close to the McCain campaign disclosed to VR in July that Mr. Connells life was in jeopardy and that Karl Rove had threatened him and his wife . "
19 Action News also reported on Sunday that Connell had previously been warned by a friend that his plane might be sabotaged and had canceled two flights because of suspicious problems .
BradBlog notes that although the Velvet Revolution press release has appeared on the New York Times website , that paper has not offered any comment of its own on Connell 's death , nor have US media in general reported on the growing speculation -- although even the British press has mentioned it -- which makes the Action News coverage all the more striking .
" Was it an accident -- or murder ? "

Transcript from 19 Action News :
What prompted conspiracy theorists in Washington , D.C. to say that an Ohio man with White House connections was actually murdered this weekend ?
Here 's Scott Taylor to tell us if it 's true or not .
Taylor : " Well this sounds like a made up story , one man rigging state elections to help his boss , President George Bush .
After it 's done , power players in Washington say ' Get rid of the guy . '
Do I believe it ?
No .
For now .
45 year - old Michael Connell died Friday night after his plane crashed into this vacant house near Union Township in Stark County , Ohio .
Connell was a political power player in Washington , D.C. , and in the White House .
He was the vision behind President George Bush's , and John McCain 's internet sites .
Initial reports say bad weather could have played a part in the crash .
Hartville resident Mary Lou Lankford : " I guess the plane just flew apart . "
Taylor : Some in Washington have a different opinion .
The website ' Velvet Revolution ' believes someone sabotaged Connell 's plane .
It appears he was trying to land the plane here , he hit a large flag pole and then , he struck the house .
Velvet Revolution claims to have been tipped off that Connell 's life was in danger .
Who was threatening Connell ?
According to the website , a senior advisor of President George Bush , Karl Rove .
Some say Connell was about to reveal embarrassing details involving senior members of the Bush Administration , including their involvement in destroying incriminating emails , and rigging elections .
Connell died on impact , and was only 3 miles from the Akron - Canton Airport .
He was an experienced pilot .
Was it an accident , or muder ?
Harville resident Ron Lankford : " It 's really hard to believe .
I really do n't know the full story , and I 've just heard ... and what I 've seen in the paper , and on the news . "
Taylor : I spoke to Michael 's family today in person .
They are grieving .
A visitation is planned for tonight .
Many in his neighborhood say this was a good man who devoted his time to the worldwide community , and loved his family very much .
19 Action News ' investigation concludes that the plane crash that killed GOP operative Mike Connell was probably not a conspiracy .

Abstract
This article shows a concrete and easy recognizable view of a cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) .
Photograph views of the search tabs on dictionaries are used to increase students ’ understanding and facility with the concept of a cumulative distribution function .
Projects for student investigations are also given .
This motivation and view helps the cdf become a bit more tangible and understandable .
1. Introduction
Images of bar charts , histograms , stem - and - leaf diagrams , frequency distributions , and probability density functions can all be introduced and explained via an intuitive , constructive motivation .
We imagine blocks , beads , or digits stacked or piled up in defined bins .
For categorical data the bins are named categories in the data .
The stacked up objects display the data as a bar chart .
Higher stacks indicate the categories that appear more frequently .
For continuous or discrete quantitative data , the stacks are built on bins that fall along a number line .
For equal sized bins the height of a stack is proportional to f( x ) , the density or relative frequency of occurrence of numbers in a bin around the real number x .
Between these two extremes of named categories and the real number line , lie ordinal data .
These are categorical data ordered in a logical or well accepted way .
Ordinal data have long been illustrated with course grades ( A , A- , B+ , B , etc. ) or levels of satisfaction or agreement ( very strongly agree , strongly agree , etc. ) .
The alphabet also provides a well understood ordering .
A frequency distribution of the usage of letters can be represented in an alphabetically ordered bar chart .
For example , a bar chart of the tiles in the crossword game of Scrabble shown in Figure 1 , roughly mirrors the occurrence of the letters used in the English language .
The letter " E " is most frequent , with twelve occurrences out of 100 tiles , yielding a relative frequency of 0.12 .
This closely matches the occurrence of the letter " E " in English .
Other letters such as " S " were deliberately underrepresented in the design of Scrabble .
The relative frequency of " S " in English is about 0.063 , but too many " S " letters in Scrabble would make it too easy to form the plurals of nouns used in the game .
To make this less likely , the Scrabble " S " is represented with a relative frequency of only 0.04 .
Other letters are also underrepresented as shown in Richardson et al. ( 2004 ) .
Figure 1 .
A photograph of Scrabble letter tiles stacked to see their frequency distribution ( not shown are two blank tiles )
These images of frequency distributions seem natural and easily understandable .
In contrast , the cumulative distribution function has been more difficult to visualize in a natural way .
Given the frequency distribution f( x ) for a discrete quantitative or ordinal variable , we define F( x ) to be the cumulative relative frequency count of all measurements less than or equal to x .
For the Scrabble example , x Î{A , B , C , … , Z} , and F ( x ) represents the cumulative relative frequency of all tiles with letters occurring at or before x .
For example , if x = " E " , then F ( " E " ) is the cumulative count of the frequencies of all the letters " A " , " B " , " C " , " D " , " E " out of the 100 Scrabble tiles .
That is , F ( " E " ) = 0.27 , or , 27 % of all Scrabble letters occur at or before the letter " E " in alphabetical order .
The entire cumulative frequency distribution is shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 .
The cumulative distribution function for the letters in the Scrabble crossword board game .
To many students this construction of cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) seems artificial and more contrived than the simpler view of the frequency distribution .
We are not as familiar with cumulative distribution functions because they do not occur routinely in much of our experience .
Further it seems that work has to be done to convert a density function into a cdf .
But for a continuous random variable , we know from probability that the cumulative distribution function is the more fundamental quantity .
The frequency distribution is derived from the cdf through differentiation .
But as it is presented in many elementary textbooks , we have to process the frequency distribution to produce the cdf .
Thus even though mathematically we know it works in reverse , to some it seems that a cdf is a derivative of the density , in the literal meaning that the cdf must be derived from the frequency distribution .
A cumulative distribution function does not appear to be the more fundamental idea from which a density function is derived .
It is the purpose of this article to provide instructors and students with a concrete and easy recognizable , visual example of cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) .
2. A Dictionary Cumulative Distribution Function
Figure 3 shows a cumulative distribution function that can be seen and understood with relative ease .
This is a side view of the pages of the paperback version of the Oxford Advanced Learners ’ Dictionary .
Small colored squares for each letter are shown on the edge of each page .
These colored squares act as tabs running from the top of the page for letters early in the alphabet to the bottom of the page for those letters that come later .
These printed alphabetical marks on the edges of the pages help speed the look up of words and their definitions .
This is really one of the first search engines .
When the dictionary is placed on its side , these colored tabs produce a cumulative distribution function for words from the English language .
We have a visual and understandable image ( Figure 3 ) of a cumulative distribution function .
We can quantify this by noting , for example , that 93 pages of this dictionary are devoted to the letter " A " , so 93 pages have tabs colored to act as guide tabs to words starting with " A " .
The last page number of each letter ’s tab indicates the number of pages devoted to words that begin with letters occurring , in alphabetical order , before that tab .
Let G( x ) denote the page number of this last page for each letter x Î{A , B , C , … , Z} .
These are the cumulative counts of pages for words beginning with each letter in the English alphabet , shown in Table 1 .
The maximum of G( x ) , call it M , is just the number of the last page of the dictionary for the letter " Z " . Define F( x ) to be G( x ) / M.
Then F( x ) represents the cumulative relative frequency of letters of the alphabet .
This is the alphabet ’s cdf .
Table 1 . Oxford Advanced Learners ’ Dictionary
x=Letter F( x ) = Cumulative Frequency Cumulative Relative Frequency Frequency Relative Frequency A 93 0.052 93 0.052 B 207 0.116 114 0.064 C 381 0.214 174 0.098 D 479 0.269 98 0.055 E 543 0.305 64 0.036 F 634 0.356 91 0.051 G 694 0.390 60 0.034 H 766 0.430 72 0.040 I 825 0.463 59 0.033 J 840 0.472 15 0.008 K 855 0.480 15 0.008 L 921 0.517 66 0.037 M 1009 0.567 88 0.049 N 1043 0.586 34 0.019 O 1087 0.611 44 0.025 P 1231 0.692 144 0.081 Q 1239 0.696 8 0.004 R 1336 0.751 97 0.054 S 1558 0.875 222 0.125 T 1656 0.930 98 0.055 U 1690 0.949 34 0.019 V 1710 0.961 20 0.011 W 1770 0.994 60 0.034 X 1771 0.995 1 0.001 Y 1777 0.998 6 0.003 Z 1780 1.000 3 0.002
Figure 3 . A photographic side view of the Oxford Advanced Learners ’ Dictionary .
Inserted below is a photo manipulation showing the frequency distribution of the dictionary ’s letters .
So what can we learn from Figure 3 and this table ?
The alphabet begins with a few large tab regions , rising vertically .
This indicates that the first few letters of the alphabet begin many words .
The middle of the alphabet is not so well represented .
The letters of " I " , " J " , and " K " begin many fewer words with their collective contribution of colored tabs not extending vertically to any great extent .
Big jumps at " P " and " S " indicate that many words start with those letters .
They bracket a thin tab of very few words beginning with " Q " .
The tail of the alphabet is so thin that the final three letters are combined into a single colored tab representing " X , Y , and Z " together .
The " S " tab spans the most pages , indicating more words in English start with " S " than with any other letter .
From our consideration of Scrabble , recall that the letter " E " is most frequently occurring letter in English , but keep in mind that dictionary tabs consider only the first letters of words .
As first letters , the letter " S " is most frequently occurring in English .
From the table we can find the number of pages devoted to the letter " S " .
This comes from subtracting G ( " R " ) , which is the value that represents the cumulative count just prior to " S " , from G ( " S " ) .
This is G ( " S " ) – G ( " R " ) = 1558 – 1326 = 222 pages devoted to words that start with the letter " S " .
We can divide these frequency counts by the maximum frequency count , M , resulting in relative frequency counts .
Both frequency and relative frequency counts for each letter are also shown in Table 1 .
Photo manipulation software also allows us to visually collapse the cdf and place the tabs side - by - side to see the histogram of alphabetic frequencies , shown in the insert of Figure 3 .
Here we can easily see that after the letter " S " is most frequently used and that the two next most frequent starting letters in English are " C " and " P " .
Of course what this shows is that more pages are devoted to the letter " S " than to the letter " K " , for example .
This is most certainly because more English words start with " S " than " K " .
But what about other pairs of letters , say " G " and " H " ?
Do more words start with " G " or more with " H " ?
Perhaps the definitions of the words starting with G are longer than those for " H " .
This would give " G " more pages than " H " with perhaps fewer words .
If we make the simplifying assumption that more pages mean more words , rather than more pages mean longer definitions , then the size of the letter tabs will be proportional to the frequency of words beginning with each letter of the alphabet .
This image represents a snapshot of the words in the English language .
We can quickly see which letters begin more words than others .
This is , of course , just one dictionary .
How reliable is this representation of the English language ?
I examined five other large dictionaries : Microsoft Encarta College ( 2001 ) , New Oxford American ( 2001 ) , Merriam - Webster Collegiate ( 1998 ) , Random House Webster ’s College ( 1995 ) , and Newbury House Dictionary of American English ( 1999 ) .
Table 2 shows the cumulative counts for the smallest and largest of these English dictionaries : a small paperback edition ( Newbury House ) and a more comprehensive reference ( Merriam - Webster Collegiate ) .
Although minor editorial discretions are evident , the cdfs in Figure 4 are nearly identical .
The cdfs for the others ( not shown ) are also nearly identical .
A consensus image of the English language emerges from these cumulative functions since there is a great deal of common overlap for each dictionary .
Table 2 . Cumulative frequencies ( page numbers at the end of lettered tabs ) of two English language dictionaries are shown along with cumulative relative frequencies .

Figure 4 . Cumulative Relative Frequencies for the two English Language dictionaries shown in Table 2 .
Notice the near identical cdfs .
A formal test of the equality using the discrete Kolmogorov - Smirnov statistic can compare two dictionary cdfs .
Let F( x ) represent the cdf of the most comprehensive Merriam - Webster Collegiate dictionary .
This will be taken as a standard .
For another dictionary of n pages , let H n ( x ) represent this other dictionary ’s cdf .
The Kolmogorov - Smirnov statistic tests the null hypothesis that a sample cdf H n ( x ) is equal to F( x ) .
A statistic D = max n1/2 | H n ( x ) - F( x ) | measures the discrepancy between two cdfs , where the maximum is taken over the 26 letters of the alphabet .
The p-values for testing each of the cdfs of the English dictionaries discussed above were all greater than 0.57 , indicating no significance difference .
3. Other Languages
Figure 5 . A photographic side view of the Oxford Spanish Language Dictionary
How does the English cumulative distribution function compare with other languages ?
Figure 5 is a side view of the Oxford Spanish Dictionary .
The upper portion of the dictionary is for translating English into Spanish .
It is another representation of the English cumulative distribution function that we saw earlier .
Notice the second tab , for the letter " B " .
The " B " tab extends halfway into " A " and also into " C " .
The editors of this dictionary have not confined the tabs to each letter as before , but they have a larger extent of overlap spanning the letter positions on either side .
Although the jumps from one letter to another remain correct , the inked contribution of each letter ’s tab is spread out over a range of neighboring letters resulting in a more connected and smoother cumulative distribution .
The bottom portion of this dictionary is for translating Spanish into English .
In this bottom portion , we have a similarly smoothed cumulative distribution function for Spanish .
The most frequent first letter in Spanish is " C " .
Notice how the Spanish cumulative distribution function builds up more rapidly than English early in the alphabet , only to have English include more frequent words starting with later letters .
The cumulative counts are given in Table 3 and a more precise plot in Figure 6 .
The p-value for the discrete Kolmogorov - Smirnov statistic comparing the English and Spanish cdfs results in a p-value < 10 - 4 , indicating a significant difference .

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has threatened to stop peace talks with the Israelis if the strikes continued .
The UN Security Council is to meet shortly to discuss the crisis as calls grow for an end to the violence .
Israeli air strikes on Gaza have continued for a fifth day , while more Hamas rockets have landed in Israel .
The town of Beersheba was hit , the deepest penetration by rockets so far .
Map : Gaza and Israel violence
In pictures : Day five of strikes Shockwaves in Beersheba
In the last five days , Israeli jets and attack helicopters have hit Hamas targets , including security compounds , government buildings , smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt and homes belonging to militant leaders .
Palestinian officials say 391 Palestinians have died in the Israeli air strikes ; four Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza , which is under Hamas control .
After meeting his cabinet , Prime Minister Olmert said conditions were not right for a ceasefire , but he did not rule one out in the future .
" If conditions will ripen , and we think there can be a diplomatic solution that will ensure a better security reality in the south , we will consider it .
But at the moment , it 's not there , " he was quoted by aides as telling the cabinet .
Any ceasefire with Hamas had to be permanent , he said , adding that there was international consensus that Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel had to stop .
In particular the hospitals have been depleted and stretched to the maximum because of the closure imposed

Aid worker diary : Part four Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , meanwhile , said he " would not hesitate to stop " peace talks with the Israelis " if they go against our interests and offer a support to aggression " .
He called the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip " barbaric and criminal aggression " .
International appeals Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha told AFP news agency that his group was open to any ceasefire propositions as long as they meant an end to the air strikes and a lifting of the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
The BBC's Middle East editor , Jeremy Bowen , says that if Hamas is open to a ceasefire , it will increase international calls for talks to at least investigate what is possible .
But Israel 's leaders are not yet ready to stop their attacks because they need to show that they have won a permanent end to rocket fire from Gaza , adds our correspondent .

International appeals for Israel to end its bombing campaign against Gaza have been mounting .
A European Union statement called for an " unconditional " halt to Hamas rocket attacks .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged an " immediate and urgent ceasefire " to stem a " humanitarian crisis " in Gaza .
But US President George W Bush repeated earlier statements that Hamas should take the first step to ending hostilities by halting rocket fire into Israel .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Mr Bush had been assured by Mr Olmert that only Hamas sites in Gaza were being targeted and that " appropriate steps " to avoid civilian casualties were being taken .
Hospitals depleted While Israeli air raids continued on Wednesday , rockets fired by Palestinian militants landed in and around the southern Israeli town of Beersheba , about 40 km ( 24 miles ) from Gaza .
Although no serious casualties were reported , this is the deepest that Palestinian rockets have penetrated inside Israel - something that will only increase Israeli public support for continued military action , observers say .

Palestinian medical officials say more than 1,700 people have been injured , overwhelming Gaza 's hospitals .
" In particular the hospitals have been depleted and stretched to the maximum because of the closure imposed , " the Red Cross spokesman in Gaza , Iyad Nasr , told the BBC .

Israel has massed forces along the boundary with Gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone " .
Correspondents say this could be a prelude to ground operations , but could also be intended to build pressure on Hamas .
A statement by Hamas has warned any invasion would see " the children of Gaza collecting the body parts of Israeli soldiers and the ruins of tanks " .
The Israeli air strikes began less than a week after the expiry of a six - month - long ceasefire deal with Hamas .
Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but has kept tight control over access in and out of Gaza and its airspace .

The American consumer ’s long - running love affair with debt appears to be on the rocks .
But like a lot of soured romances , the reasons are open to debate .
What ’s known is that the debt held by U.S. households shrank in the three months ended Sept. 30 .
That ’s the first time that has happened since the government began keeping records more than 50 years ago , the Federal Reserve said Thursday .
Economists say consumers appear to be curbing their spending and displaying a healthy prudence about taking on new debt -- something financial planners have been admonishing Americans to do for decades .
What economists do n’t know is whether people are bringing down their debt voluntarily or whether it ’s being imposed on them through foreclosures or the denial of credit .
Advertisement
“ While it ’s good that households are beginning to save , it ’s much more likely that this is being imposed on them by the unavailability of credit than any desire to sustain their balance sheets over the long run , ” said Vincent Reinhart , a former senior Fed economist who is now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
Household debt declined 0.8 % in the third quarter , mostly as a result of a 2.4 % decline in mortgage debt , the Fed reported .
Other consumer debt , which includes credit card debt , rose a modest 1.2 % .
The Fed also noted that household net worth continued to decline in the same quarter , largely because of shrinking home equity .
Homeowners ’ equity as a percentage of the value of their homes has fallen to just 44.7 % .
Until this year , that percentage had not fallen below 50 % since 1945 .
“ You do n’t have the house to borrow from anymore , ” said Joel Naroff , president of Naroff Economic Associates in Holland , Pa .

“ The fact that net worth is going down means that people are feeling poorer and poorer and are cutting back by saving rather than borrowing , ” Naroff added .
“ The question is whether this is a long - term change in philosophy ” or just short - term austerity .
But it ’s also true that Americans are saving more .
The savings rate , a meager 0.2 % in the first three months of the year , rose to 1.1 % for the third quarter .
With the nation in recession and unemployment rising , many people are simply cutting back as a precaution .
“ I have to be careful with money because of what ’s going on in the economy , ” said Marsha Phillips , 48 , a single mother who works as a janitor at the YMCA in Burbank .
“ I ’m on a budget . ”

Phillips said she had cut back on such luxuries as eating out and buying DVDs .
Now she goes out no more than once a month .
“ My bills never got paid on time , and they racked up , ” Phillips said .
“ I ’m on an even keel now . ”
Adam Ziegler , a 26 - year - old graphic designer from West Hollywood , said he was planning to spend $ 30 or $ 40 for each person on his holiday shopping list , down from $ 50 or so in years past .
He ’s eating out less and spending less time in nightclubs .
“ I ’ve been only going out a little bit and not drinking as much , ” Ziegler said .

Ofelia Cruthirds , 43 , of Fontana is also slashing her holiday gift budget .
With eight sisters and five brothers , Cruthirds said she had usually spent $ 1,000 a year on Christmas gifts for her siblings and her dozens of nieces and nephews .
She plans to spend less than $ 500 this year .
“ I ’m not buying anything with a credit card -- we ’re trying to get the debt down , ” she said .
“ The economy wo n’t get better soon .
Too many people are losing their jobs . ”
In a survey by the Pew Research Center , 73 % of Americans said they had cut back on holiday spending .
Of those , 28 % said they were doing some belt - tightening because their economic situation had already deteriorated and 59 % said it was because they feared their economic fortunes would get worse .
Bad economic news continues to mount , stoking such fears even more .
The government reported Thursday that the number of new jobless claims from U.S. workers hit a 26 - year high last week , and the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly worsened despite lower costs for imported oil .
Advertisement
“ The widening trade deficit shows just how much the global slowdown is hurting U.S. exporters , ” Naroff said .
“ The picture of the economy just keeps getting uglier . ”
Economists are now predicting that the economy , which has been in a recession since last December , will show a steep decline in gross domestic product of 5 % or more in the fourth quarter .
The last time the country had a recession this deep was the early 1980s .
“ People overbought during the last expansion .
That ’s clear , ” said Gus Faucher of Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ People need to better align their incomes and their spending , and this is part of that process .
But it ’s going to be trouble for the economy in the meantime . ”
Faucher said economists talked about the “ paradox of thrift ” -- meaning that for the economy to grow over the long term , consumers needed to save and accumulate assets .
But when the economy falters , an increase in consumer saving tends to deepen the decline because the economy is so dependent on consumer spending .
Advertisement
When banks begin lending again , Faucher said , he expects consumer spending to pick up .
But he does n’t think consumers are going to return to their habits of spending more than their incomes -- what economists call “ negative savings ” -- on the expectation that the value of their homes would grow fast enough to more than make up the difference .
“ We have a kind of permanent shift taking place in household behavior , ” Faucher said .
“ We think the savings rate is going to become positive and stay positive . ”

So Why Are Obama ’s Drug Cops Already Making Pot Raids ?
By Paul Armentano
Pot -reform activists have swarmed Obama ’s Change.gov , and huge majorities voted for pot reform in election ’ 08 , but no change yet from Obama .
This past August , House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , during a live interview with CNN , did something quite remarkable .
She spoke candidly and openly about her support for marijuana - law reform .
But rather than demanding her colleagues in Washington take the necessary steps to end the federal government ’s seven - decade war on weed , she instead called on the public to act .
“ We have important work to do outside the Congress in order for us to have success inside the Congress . ” Pelosi said .
“ [ W]e need peoples ’ help to be in touch with their members of Congress to say why this ( marijuana law reform ) should be the case . ”
As the saying goes , “ Ask and ye shall receive . ”
In the past few months , the public has expressed its support for marijuana law reform in unprecedented numbers .
The election of former pot smoker , Barack “ I inhaled frequently ; that was the point ” Obama , coupled with a sagging economy , has stimulated tens of thousands of Americans to demand their government stop spending its limited state and federal law enforcement resources on efforts targeting , arresting and prosecuting marijuana smokers .
For example , in December the question : “ Will ( President Obama ) consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar - industry right here in the U.S. ? ” beat over 7,300 public - policy issues to claim the top spot in Change. gov ’s inaugural “ Open for Questions ” poll .
( Change.gov , now WhiteHouse.gov , was the official Web site of President Obama ’s transition team . )
The first - place finish was hardly a fluke .
The public ’s demand to “ legalize the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana ” also finished first in a two - month - long Web poll hosted by the liberal - leaning social - networking Web site Change.org and Washington ’s Case Foundation — finishing some 5,000 votes ahead of the next most popular idea .
More recently , 26,000 visitors cast their vote in a CNBC online poll asking , “ Do you favor the decriminalization of marijuana use ? ”
More than 97 percent of those who voted said yes .
Perhaps most impressively , in a follow - up poll conducted by the Obama administration — commissioned under the guise of creating a Citizens ’ Briefing Book for the new president — the public ’s call to “ stop imprisoning responsible adult citizens ” finished first out of 44,000 policy proposals .
But that was far from the only marijuana - related question to resonate with the public .
Amazingly , a separate question calling on the new administration to “ stop using federal resources to undermine states ’ medicinal marijuana laws ” finished in third place .
Critics of the recent poll results are quick to note that online polls are not scientific and that arguably more Americans are concerned about other pressing social issues — such as rising unemployment , for instance — than care about reforming the United States ’ pot policies .
But those who interpret these results so superficially are missing the bigger political picture .
As the popularity of the marijuana issue in these polls indicates , there is a significant , vocal and identifiable minority of American society that wants to see an end to America ’s archaic and overly punitive marijuana laws .
Politicians , particularly progressive politicians , would be well - advised to acknowledge this interest group and respond accordingly .
Further , a majority of the American public is ready and willing to engage in a serious and objective political debate regarding the merits of legalizing the use of cannabis by adults , even if their elected officials are not .
One only has to log on to the thousands of public comments , both for and against , marijuana legalization on the message board of Change.gov and Change.org to see that Americans are pining for , if nothing else , an honest review of our nation ’s so - called war on drugs .
So is the new administration listening ?
Apparently , not yet .
In response to the Change.gov poll , the administration posted a curt , one - sentence response , “ President Obama is not in favor of the legalization of marijuana . ”
The reply , though disappointing to some , was hardly unexpected .
In 2004 , Obama voiced support for decriminalizing pot ( a policy that replaces criminal sanctions with the imposition of fines only ) , but fell short of endorsing legalization .
( Although as a candidate for president , Obama renounced his support for decriminalization . )
Less expected , however , were the actions of the Justice Department last week when U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials raided the office of a California medical marijuana provider , as well as two medical grow houses in Colorado .
( The possession of marijuana for medical purposes is legal in both states , and nonprofit organizations may legally dispense marijuana to authorized patients under California law . )
The busts outraged many drug - law - reform advocates , who were quick to point out that the new president had pledged on the campaign trail not to use Justice Department resources to circumvent state medical marijuana laws .
Many news outlets also were quick to voice criticism toward the new administration for continuing with the federal raids , noting that these aggressive actions possess little to no public support .
Of course , it is not yet known whether Obama directly authorized the DEA raids .
( Both the DOJ and the DEA are staffed , in large part , by holdovers from the Bush regime . )
That said , there ’s also no indication that anyone at DOJ or DEA has been admonished for their behavior either .
Obama ’s silence on the issue so far may be telling .
It may also be politically detrimental .
Rather than ignore the public ’s calls for drug - policy reform , the new administration ought to be embracing it .
After all , many of the same voters that put Barack Obama in the White House also voted by wide margins in November to liberalize marijuana laws in two states — Michigan and Massachusetts — and in nearly a dozen municipalities nationwide .
In fact , historically , marijuana - law reform has been a proven winner at the polls .
Voters in 10 states and the District of Columbia have approved ballot measures legalizing the medical use of marijuana .
( By contrast , only once — in South Dakota in 2006 — have voters rejected such a measure . )
Municipal ordinances mandating law enforcement to make the prosecution of minor pot offenses its “ lowest priority ” have enjoyed similar success — passing in more than a dozen cities across the country , including Denver , Seattle , Oakland , Calif. , Santa Barbara , Calif. , Missoula , Mont. , Colombia , Mo. , and Fayetteville , Ark .
These results should n’t be surprising .
According to a national poll commissioned by CNN and Time magazine , 80 percent of Americans support the physician - supervised use of cannabis , and some 3 out of 4 say that adults should be fined , but not jailed , for using pot recreationally .
In short , marijuana - law reform should no longer be viewed by legislators as a political liability .
It is n’t .
Instead , for the new administration and for 111th Congress , it is a political opportunity .
The sooner our federally elected leaders recognize this fact , the sooner we , and they , can begin to undo the damage caused by America ’s longest and costliest war , the so - called war on drugs .
Remember that " secret " Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule ?
The one that would make it tougher to protect workers from hazardous chemicals and toxic substances ?
Well , according to the New York Times , the Bush administration is rushing to finalize the rule before the Obama administration takes office , severely limiting Obama 's legal options to do anything about it .
As we 've notedmany times before , and as the Washington Postfirst reported in July , the rule would make it harder for OSHA to regulate toxins .
The rule increases the amount of scientific analysis necessary to start regulating a worker 's exposure to certain chemicals .
It would also open more opportunities for industry and other interested parties to comment on the scientific evidence as the agency develops its regulation .
The rule would add two years to what is already an eight - year - long process , according to Margaret M. Seminario , the director of occupational safety and health for the A.F.L. - C.I.O .
Labor groups , health and safety experts and the medical community widely oppose the rule , which they say would make an already cumbersome process practically impossible .
In proposing the rule , the administration wrote that it would force " agencies to follow a consistent , reliable , and transparent set of procedures when conducting risk assessments , " and improve public access to the regulatory process .
Health and safety advocates have long blasted the Bush administration OSHA , which has put an increased emphasis on voluntary , business - friendly programs .
In the past eight years , OSHA has issued just one significant health standard .
It did so under court order .
The Bush administration is not alone in passing last - minute OSHA rules .
Clinton 's OSHA passed an ergonomic standard in its waning days .
Ultimately the rule was overturned by the Republican - controlled Congress after Clinton left office .
Republicans in Congress used the little known and rarely used Congressional Review Act to roll back the regulation .
The next Congress may have the opportunity to vote down Bush 's OSHA rule in the same fashion .
Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have said they are considering the use of the Review Act to shoot down other controversial rules that the administration wants to finalize .
The Obama administration could try to rescind the rule itself .
But as we reported last month , that is n't so easy .
It would require restarting the rulemaking process and could face legal challenges from industry .
Obama has written to the Department of Labor asking them to abandon the proposal .
The rule is one of 30 midnight regulations we are tracking through the rulemaking process .

How low will Sirius XM ( SIRI ) go ?
The satellite radio company closed at $ 0.14 today , down 14 % on the day and down 30 % from Tuesday , when it closed at $ 0.20 .
Why ?
No Sirius - specific news , again , but more general doom and gloom , and bad news from the auto industry , where Sirius gets most of its new subscribers .
At least one financial analyst is now even comfortable being quoted using the " B " word -- bankruptcy .
CNNMoney : " The outlook for Sirius XM has grown increasingly worrisome and at the current time looks bleak , " said Frederick Moran , an analyst with Stanford Group .
" At this point , you have to question whether Sirius XM will survive 2009 in its current structure .
There is a likelihood that it could enter bankruptcy . "
As my colleague Henry Blodget said Tuesday , yes , Sirius could go to zero .
( We 've updated the numbers as Sirius ' market cap has had $ 200 million wiped off in the last two days . )
Mel Karmazin 's company currently has an equity market capitalization ( value of the stock ) of $ 455 million .
It also $ 360 million of cash and $ 3.3 billion of debt , so its " enterprise value " -- the implied value of the business itself -- is about $ 3.5 billion .
The only thing that has to happen for Sirius ( SIRI ) stock to go to zero is for the market to conclude that the company is worth less than $ 3 billion .
This would wipe out the company 's stock value , leaving the company in the hands of the debt - holders .
Why might the market soon conclude that Sirius is worth less than $ 3 billion ?
Because it 's running out of cash .
In the first 9 months of this year , Sirius had negative free cash flow ( cash from operations - capex ) of $ 300 million .
$ 360 million of cash wo n't last long at that burn rate .
Sirius 's stock is now low enough that it will be hard to raise capital by selling stock , and we can't imagine who would be willing to lend the company money right now .
That means the company 's cash cushion is likely to get dangerously low , perhaps forcing Sirius into a highly dilutive equity deal that will put additional pressure on the stock .
So it 's not hard to see how the stock could go to zero ( or close to it ) .

Praise Solar : California Church Installs 150 Solar Panels
December 18th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Even institutions devoted to God can use a little human intervention every once in awhile .
That ’s why Bethel Lutheran Church in Cupertino , CA , recently installed a 150 panel solar system with assistance from Akeena Solar .
The panels will generate 34,000 kWh each year , and should save the church between $ 900 and $ 1200 each month .
The new panels will also give children in the church ’s school the opportunity to learn about solar energy , as a website that shows the congregation ’s energy usage will teach the kids about its importance .
And in a move that benefits the entire town of Cupertino , Bethel successfully petitioned the city council to lower solar permit scheduling fees for non-profits from $ 5700 to $ 1500 .
According to Pastor Randy Pabst , this is just the beginning of the church ’s plans — the congregation wants to double or triple its present solar capacity in the future .
Why solar ?
“ We ’re being good stewards of the world God has given us , ” said Pabst .

DECEMBER 2-- A group of teenagers working at a Minnesota nursing home abused and sexually humiliated elderly residents suffering from Alzheimer 's disease and dementia , prosecutors allege .
The six young female caregivers were named yesterday in criminal complaints charging them with a variety of cruel behavior at the Good Samaritan Society nursing home in Albert Lea , a city in southern Minnesota .
Only two of those charged -- Brianna Broitzman , 19 , and Ashton Larson , 18 - - are named in the complaints since they were not minors when the alleged abuse occurred .
According to District Court complaints filed against Broitzman ( pictured above left ) and Larson ( above right ) , nursing home residents were spat upon , spanked , improperly touched , and tormented by the teenagers earlier this year .
Excerpts of the misdemeanor complaints can be found here .
Broitzman allegedly poked one resident 's breasts , spit into the mouth of another elderly person , and " put her bare butt " in the face of a Good Samaritan Society resident identified as " S.W. "
Larson once " inserted her finger into a resident 's rectum , " spit water on another " vulnerable adult , " and would deliberately bathe a resident in a rough manner so the elderly man would get an erection .
The minor caregivers are identified in the complaints by their initials and dates of birth .
Broitzman , charged with 11 criminal counts , and Larson , charged with 10 counts , face a year in jail or up to a year in jail on each of the raps .

THQ has announced it has cancelled the PlayStation 3 version of the upcoming title , Destroy All Humans !
Path of Furon , over " development issues " , but said the title would make its release date on December 1 for the Xbox 360 .
The company 's confirmation , that the title would now be an Xbox360 exclusive , was given to Shacknews after earlier reporting that the trailer for Sandblast 's game no longer made reference to the PS3 version and a number of online retailers had removed the title 's listing from their catalogues .
This is the second PlayStation title cancellation for the series this year , with the PlayStation 2 version of Destroy All Humans : Big Willy Unleashed scrapped in January .
Sandblast saw an unspecified number of staff axed from the development studio earlier this year , alongside 30 jobs cuts at THQ's Rainbow Studios .

Registered nurses ( RNs ) help make preliminary assessments of a patient 's condition , gather medical histories and symptom information for physicians , and work with patients to ensure that institutional and out - patient care needs are met .
RNs often serve as the primary liaison between doctors and patients , and they can work in multiple levels within a healthcare institution .
Regardless of their level of training -- e.g. , an associate degree in nursing ( ADN ) or a bachelor of science in nursing ( BSN ) -- all RNs must pass the NCLEX - RN exam .
What separates ADN holders from BSN holders is the increased level of responsibility enjoyed by bachelor 's graduates in terms of specialized and independent assessment and care , as well as more potential management opportunities .
Without a BSN , career advancement can be difficult .
Earning a BSN also opens career opportunities outside of hospitals or general practice offices ; for example , these professionals can pursue government positions in public health or work at drug and alcohol addiction treatment centers .
If you aspire to become a department manager or a manager of RNs , then you must earn a bachelor 's degree ( or higher ) .
Why Should RNs Earn a BSN Degree ?
The principal benefit to earning a BSN is increased mobility and flexibility -- a bachelor 's degree enables workers to move into higher positions .
The longer time commitment of a bachelor 's program translates into more specialized training and the chance to hone leadership and analytical skills .
In a part - time BSN program , associate holders can take advantage of their working knowledge to earn a more advanced degree and increase their chances of professional success .
Furthermore , as healthcare continues to evolve , so too do its educational requirements .
According to the Institute of Medicine , " the proportion of nurses with baccalaureate degrees [ will ] be increased to 80 % by 2020 . "
Therefore , future nurses will need a BSN to remain competitive on the job market .
Beyond flexibility , a BSN can lead to increased earning potential .
Higher - level positions in hospitals or institutional administration , government advising , and advocacy receive more lucrative salaries .
Increasing your level of education can impact your earning potential significantly .
Furthermore , a BSN opens pathways into specialized professional careers .
Individuals with a four - year degree can become administrators in patient care or financial departments .
They can also consider pursuing nurse anesthesiology or midwifery positions .
Furthermore , with a graduate - level education , workers can even become advanced practice registered nurses and create their own private practices .
Advancing Your Career Through an RN - to - BSN Program
RN - to - BSN programs are designed for registered nurses who have passed the NCLEX - RN exam and hold a nursing license .
Bachelor 's programs also require students to complete liberal arts coursework to advance their writing and analytical skills .
Additionally , many programs promote cultural sensitivity by delving into the racial , religious , and socioeconomic influences affecting modern medicine and healthcare and government systems .
In terms of science classes , a BSN track covers biology and microbiology , chemistry , physics , sociology , and psychology .
Depending on your school and program , you may also pursue specialized coursework in personal areas of interest , such as anatomy and physiology , global healthcare development , nutrition and diet , and ethics in nursing .
If you plan to earn a master 's degree , courses in OBGYN nursing , pediatrics , and anesthesiology may also be important .
All RN - to - BSN programs involve a certain level of hands - on training , which is typically carried out at your educational institution or through your employer .
RN - to - BSN programs are offered both on school campuses and online .
WASHINGTON 
Two white plaster masks appear next to each other in a display case at the National Portrait Gallery here .
One shows a middle - aged face with a firm , grim look  perhaps because the subject had to control his breathing as the sculptor waited for the substance to harden .
The plaster eyes are scooped out , but you can glimpse the interior man in the subtle musculature of the jaw , the high cheekbones , the expansive , smooth brow .
He is determined , vigorous and ( we know ) ambitious .
The other mask is of the same man ’s face , about five years later .
It seems more of a death mask than one taken from life .
Those years  between 1860 , when this man , Abraham Lincoln , was beginning his campaign for president of the United States , and February 1865 , when he was just two months away from being murdered  seem to have carved the flesh from his cheeks , hollowed out the eye sockets more decisively than any sculptor ’s thumb , and dug lines and pockets in aging , sallow flesh .
This modest exhibition of 30 images of Lincoln at the Portrait Gallery  “ One Life : The Mask of Lincoln ”  may turn out to be an understated highlight of Lincoln ’s coming bicentennial year , which promises a full harvest of academic conferences , exhibitions , the reopening of Ford ’s Theater and scores of new books , many offering revelations from freshly plumbed archives and analyses of figures major and minor .
But the juxtaposition of these masks may remain one of the most potent , graphic images of the effects of the crucial years they frame .
They suggest , too , how closely our conceptions of Lincoln ’s public greatness are connected with our conception of his inner life , his empathy , his personal suffering .
It is as if , in resuscitating the Union after the grievous bloodshed of the Civil War , Lincoln had bodily absorbed the nation ’s suffering  prefiguring the posthumous Christian iconography that developed after Lincoln ’s assassination on Good Friday .

Enlarge By Michael Schwartz , Gannett News Service Gen. David Petraeus , commander of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq , testified in April before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations .
DROP IN DEATHS DROP IN DEATHS Petraeus : Level of violence in Iraq tapers toward ' normal ' U.S. combat deaths in Iraq appear headed to the lowest monthly total since the start of the war as the top U.S. general there said overall violence is declining toward " normal " levels .
Gen. David Petraeus cautioned , however , that the progress still could be reversed .
Suicide attacks Monday in Iraq killed more than 50 Iraqis .
" If you could reduce these sensational attacks further , I think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence , " Petraeus said in a phone interview Monday from Iraq .
" The fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two - and - a - half months … indicates there is a degree of durability , " Petraeus said .
There have been six U.S. combat deaths so far in July , according to a USA TODAY database .
The lowest monthly number was eight in May 2003 , slightly more than a month after the invasion .
Iraqi civilian deaths also have dropped .
Although suicide attacks along with other violence has been declining , al - Qaeda retains the ability to bomb civilian targets and wreak havoc .
Monday 's attack was the deadliest in more than a month .
" Al - Qaeda , although significantly degraded … still can strap a suicide vest on an individual and push him or her into a crowd of Iraqis , " Petraeus said .
The ability of U.S. and Iraqi forces to sustain low levels of violence is considered a key condition for allowing a further drawdown in American forces .
The last of five extra brigades sent to Iraq in 2007 left that country this month , bringing U.S. troop levels to about 140,000 .
Petraeus is expected to make a recommendation in late August or early September about future troop levels .
Violence levels have continued to drop as the extra brigades have departed .
The lower levels have been maintained for more than two months .
Daily attacks during the past two months have averaged about 25 to 30 , down from about 160 to 170 a little more than a year ago , Petraeus said .
" What we 've got to do , of course , is figure out how to keep it there while , over time , further reducing our forces and … trying to further degrade the networks that carry out the sensational attacks , " Petraeus said .
Iraqi security forces have been growing in numbers and effectiveness as threats from al - Qaeda and Shiite militias have decreased , Petraeus said .
About 70 % of Iraq 's combat battalions are leading operations in their areas .
" There is a degree of momentum across the board , " he said .
" Certainly there have been very tough days and tough reversals . "
The progress in Iraq comes as there is increasing pressure to shift U.S. troops to Afghanistan , where violence is growing .

" Some might call it prostitution .
I call it a ' mutually beneficial arrangement ' that pays for my killer wardrobe . "
We just call it bizarre : a college student justifies her life as a professional mistress on The Daily Beast .
Her verdict ?
Beats waitressing !

" Melissa Beech " is a college student from a privileged background .
" I was blessed to have been raised with class , sent to the best schools , and taught to be well read , well spoken and well traveled . "
Yet the world of higher learning proves a rude awakening !
But when I got to college , I spent the first two years straining for financial independence .
I tried working , but in retail , surrounded by temptation all day , I spent more than I made .
Waiting tables was exhausting .
I went on several job interviews , but all of the internships were unpaid .
As my years in college wore on it was evident that the job market was sliding into decline .
When the economic climate grew worse , my friends panicked that their resumes and high GPAs would n't be enough to give them a leg up on the competition , and my goal became getting my foot in the door before everyone else .

What 's a girl to do ?
She goes on an interview and the guy - " in his early thirties , single and successful " - offers her a job as his mistress instead .
Turns out the dude's in this businesslike world of mistresses and sugar - daddies where , as in 18th century London , these arrangements are understood .
There 's even a social networking website that connects sugar daddies and their beneficiaries .
This man told me about it : SeekingArrangement.com .
He had been referred to it by a close friend who was a hedge fund manager .
At his urging , I logged onto the site and looked at his profile .
It did n't have a picture , for privacy reasons .
But it did contain information : his marital status ( single ) , the industry he worked in ( media and communications ) , and - a key element - his salary ( seven figures ) .
I was encouraged by the fact that the website vets its clients and offers only Certified Sugar Daddies , whose tax returns have been carefully examined so you know that you 're getting .
I also learned that he was attracted to bright , smart women - he was n't in the market for the dumb bombshell .
His profile said he wanted more of " a Jackie Kennedy than a Marilyn Monroe . "
I fit the type .

Basically , she 'll be his girlfriend , and he 'll support her .
She asks that they wait to get to know each other before sleeping together ; he accedes .
As for the allowance , he does n't just cut me a check .
He simply ensures that I need never worry about expenses .
I rent a $ 1,600 apartment in the city , for which he pays the rent in full .
I carry an AmEx Black card in both our names , and use it for things like shopping , spa trips , manicures , and tanning ; the bill goes to him .
And the company car I drive costs him around $ 700 a month for the lease and the insurance .
I 've even managed to build up a little nest egg over the past year – at his insistence – putting away around $ 12,000 .
All in all , he probably spends in the ballpark of $ 5,000 a month on my lifestyle .

It seems hard to believe that this scenario could actually inspire moral outrage , even from those who consider it to be prostitution : neither party is married , and the arrangement is , as she says , mutually beneficial .
( And if she and her benefactor are suffering from the now - official recession - as many mistresses apparently are - she gives no indication . )
More than anything , it seems odd and unsatisfying - a bloodless compromise between a relationship and a business transaction .
But whatever one thinks about her choices , her justifications ring false to any young woman who 's been strapped for cash in college - which is to say , most of us .
Retail tempted her ?
Waitressing exhausted her ?
Please .
These easy rationales lose her a lot of sympathy pretty quickly .
And her defensive claims that although " he did n't hire me for the internship position , but because of him I have had several internships at well - known PR companies , and have plenty of networking opportunities , shoring up my future prospects for when I graduate this spring " do n't win much sympathy , either .
If this was all some plan to bolster her resume , it seems like there are more direct ways - and this can't bring much comfort to the qualified young women who failed to obtain the same jobs because , while they may have been restrained enough to work a retail job , they did n't have the prescience to nab a sugar daddy .
If she wants to be some emotionally disconnected rich guy 's mistress , it 's her prerogative - it's not like couples have n't been doing this for centuries - but attempting to justify it on professional grounds is an insult to the rest of us .

Earlier : Girly Golddiggers Are Reeling From The Recession
What 's the most recognised logo in the world ?
It would probably be Google 's if only they could stick to one .
Yet as the world 's most popular search engine tries out a new favicon , Craig Smith says the old branding rulebook is being rewritten .
It 's not the size that matters , it 's how often you use it .
So the thinking goes at Google , which has just revealed the design of its latest favicon - the tiny logo that shows any web user , on any web browser , anywhere in the world , precisely whose internet " real estate " they are currently residing upon .
An example of a favicon can be seen at the top of this page ( so long as you are using an up - to - date enough web browser ) .
Just in front of the URL http://news.bbc.co.uk/...
there is a small BBC logo .
That 16x16 pixel square is the size of the favicon in question , if not the scope .
Google 's changing masthead 1998 ( top ) and now Now consider that , at the website owner 's discretion , the logo appears on every single one of its pages that the world 's web population loads .
For Google that amounts to upward of 1 , 200 million individual searches .
Every day .
Add to that its Google News , Google Images , mobile search and multitude of other online services .
Suddenly the favicon takes on an importance that belies its fingernail - sized dimensions , and the motivation for Google to roll out its third design in less than a year , as it attempts to get its favicon right , becomes clear .
Google 's journey to this latest multi-coloured graphic identity charts a course through some of the unique challenges of favicon design , and through those of logo design in general .
The world 's leading search engine , whose very name has been adopted as the generic term for finding pages on the web , has achieved web domination without ever having had an actual logo .
Magic Eye style
Think of Google visually and you will probably picture the letters that make up the word Google , picked out in bright primary colours .
In the designer 's lexicon , rather than being a logo , Google has a logotype - albeit a very successful one around which it is famed for creating ever - changing topical " doodle " themes .
DESIGN A FAVICON
What makes a good favicon ?
Here , BBC designer Mick Ruddy suggests four key points 1 . Keep it simple ­- use basic shapes 2 .
Use a limited colour palette 3 .
Avoid fine detail or lots of gradients 4 . Keep it sharp ­- keep an eye on blurring
Design a favicon for us What Google has so far lacked is the sort of universally recognised icon that identifies a Mercedes - Benz car at distance or , in technology terms , the Apple computer or Yahoo web page - all logos that these brands use as their own favicon , not least because they fit the diminutive dimensions .
The word Google , by contrast , would not reduce and still be legible .
Cue the new Google favicon - a rainbow of differently shaped blocks .
A bit like one of those " hidden " Magic Eye pictures popular in the 1990s , not everyone will immediately see that the Google favicon blocks interlock to form a " g " shape .
That hardly matters .
The design makes best use of favicon limitations and is a marked evolution of Google 's previous iterations - a small blue " g " on a white background since June of last year , and a capital " G " before that .
While the old branding rulebook would discourage such regular , radical overhauls , reeking as it does of indecisiveness and inconsistency , in the digital world such rules are temporary , at best .
Steve Plimsoll , of brand consultancy FutureBrand , says the traditional rules on corporate identity are starting to look a little tired .
Mighty morphin logos " Logos are set to become fluid , ever - changing , customisable , even personalised entities and Google is the first global brand that understands this , " says Mr Plimsoll , who is head of digital .
" We are going to have to get used to the idea of our brands changing frequently , and when we do , every three months will seem like the dark ages . "
Remind you of anything ?
If you do n't like the new look , then , you can wait or , more proactively , send the company your own design .
When Google unveiled the small ' g ' last year , the company 's head of search products & user experience , Marissa Mayer , hinted at a transitory solution , saying " by no means is the one you 're seeing our favicon final ; it was a first step to a more unified set of icons " and inviting users to contribute ideas .
The new favicon is based on a design sent in by André Resende , a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Campinas in Brazil .
It may sound indecisive , even amateurish , but the fast - changing nature of Google 's digital world dictates it .
While the billions of pages of Google 's branded " real estate " is the headline figure , its real focus is to keep pace with users ' mobile phones , computer task bars and web bookmarks in such a way as to keep directing them effortlessly back to Google - using the favicon as their guide .
For the world 's biggest search engine , the world 's smallest signpost is one of its most valuable assets .
Craig Smith is a marketing author and editorial director at publishing agency Velo You 've read about Google 's new favicon - now design one yourself - either a personal favicon or one to represent the Magazine , and send it to us .
It 's easy to do .
You can either use one of the many online favicon generators such as favicon.cc , DynamicDrive , Favicon Generator and Galleryor Antifavicon , or just shrink an image down to 16x16 pixels .
Do n't forget to think about what makes a good icon at such a small size - see Mick Ruddy 's tips in the factbox near the top of this story
Once you 've got your favicon - e-mail it to us at yourpics@bbc.co.uk with the subject line " favicon "
Include some personal details - your name , where you are from etc .
And a brief sentence about your favicon .
We 'll publish some of them on this page later .
Some of your Magazine favicon designs , so far : Tried to incorporate the BBC reddish news colour .
It 's supposed to show a " magazine " with the covers forming the letters N ( for news ! ) and M ( for ... oh you can figure it out ! ) .
The background is transparent , so would show white on a browser bar .
Michael Fordyce , Sheffield Keeping in line with the existing BBC favicon design this version will keep users content that they are looking at the same site .
It also uses a simple design for easy recognition .
James Battersby , West Moslesey , Surrey
You said " keep it simple " so here 's the standard BBC favicon with ' MAG ' written underneath on the Magazine 's masthead colour .
Karl Johnson ,
Thetford , Norfolk I 've opted for a colourful reworking of the BBC initials against a black background - vaguely inspired by the BBC test card .
Tom Kennedy
Tried to incorporate your masthead colours and used the same font as the BBC logo .
I think it 's rather fetching !
Carl Dersley , Ipswich Grabbed the banner colours and replicated their structure from the page .
Added an ' M ' .
Steve , Woking
This uses the design of the site and the site 's main colours ( black , dark red , teal , white ) .
Leo , Milton Keynes
Although it chops off some of the BBC logo , it is much clearer I think , and has your corporate news colours .
It also makes better use of the footprint .
I use it to replace the BBC one in my Firefox browser .
Stephen Daniels , Edinburgh Just a few minutes " doodling " after reading the article - does it fit the bill ?
Gill Jennings , London Quite simple but effective , I guess ...
Guilherme Silva , Porto , Portugal
Wow , there 's not much room to work with .
I tried to incorporate a folded corner ( to represent a magazine leaf ) , but it did n't work .
Steve , Birmingham I used the page graphics and layout to design this simple icon , and added the BBC favicon to the black space .
Diane Bay , Wheaton , IL Here is my take on a favicon for the Magazine section .
It seemed pretty obvious to me as to what elements you have in your brand - white text on blue , rotated M in another blue - so used these to make something very simple but hopefully encapsulating all your branding .

So I 've never pretended to be an expert on the mind of the adolescent female , and I hate to sound like an out - of - touch old man , but I really do n't get this Tokio Hotel thing .
Last night at Phooson , they prompted a wave of shrieks at almost every turn , being topped only by Fall Out Boy 's Pete Wentz , who is , of course , a well - established heartthrob who 's had naked pictures circulated online and knocked up a semi-starlet .
Tokio Hotel , though ?
It 's very odd , indeed .
The lead singer of the band , Bill Kaulitz , is n't so much androgynous as completely feminine and the rest of the guys just look like the sort of dirtballs who somehow manage to schedule nothing but shop classes their senior year .
I really can't pretend to understand , and neither could my plus one , who shared her own memories of screeching for the dreamy Gavin Rossdale at the radio shows of her youth , but was shocked to see the band all the girls interviewed on the radio were talking about .
So let 's examine some photos ...
Yes , this is the band the girls were going crazy for .
Again , I 'm not even sure these clothes are fashionable -- though certainly the bar is a little lower for Germans than the rest of us -- but , really , I can't imagine them being compared favorably to , say , My Chemical Romance , who almost caused a stampede at last year ' Tempe Music Fest , when singer Gerard Way was being interviewed in a booth to the right of the stage .
To my untrained eye , these guys look more like the sort of emo dandies the Hot Topic girls love .
So , yeah , I 'd be happy to hear someone explain this to me .
I mean , I 'm not suggesting the girls out there have a crush on Lil Wayne or something , but , really , this Bill guy looks a lot more like Boy George than he does any other singer who 's ever had modest success thanks to MTV exposure .
Maybe I 'm too young , but I do n't remember girls crushing on him .
Call me an insufferable 90 s 'ist -- or point out that as a straight guy I do n't get a vote on this -- but I 'll take good ol ' Gavin over that any day .
I will be the first to admit that I completely underestimated the underground network and grassroots efforts of the Mouse Community .
“ Tom and Jerry ” cartoons projected the notion that Jerry worked alone and it was every mouse for himself in this cat - eat - mouse world .
Not until the recent salmonella - infested peanut butter products were recalled did I realize that “ Tom and Jerry ” was propaganda homespun by the Underground Mouse Network .
Why those dirty rats ; I thought I had smelled something .
Before the King Nut Companies recalled its peanut butter products a few weeks ago , I had been baiting my mouse traps with peanut butter , which proved successful .
That was before the “ Peanut Butter Scare ” media blitz hit and now mice wo n’t touch my peanut - butter - baited traps with a 34 - and - a - half foot pole .
The mice knew .
Peanut butter could kill you — one way or another .
But how they knew remains a mystery .
The night the recall announcement was made felt like a déjà vu of Christmas Eve : Nothing stirred , not even a mouse .
I had no other choice but to either use new bait or buy a better mouse trap .
And believe me you , given the plethora of ways you can kill or catch a mouse these days , the latter is no easy task .
The French , in an attempt to help Americans – namely PETA members and Mickey Mouse Club alumni – whitewash their consciences , have developed a line of feel - good Catch & Release traps .
If you ’ve never seen one of these , they work something like this .
You set the trap , which is usually baited with some type of perfumed scent that begins with L’eau ( the water ) .
Once the mouse , who thought he was about to get lucky and score at the local meat - market , is trapped and the abduction process begins .
Captors are instructed to throw a washcloth over the caged mouse , so they become disoriented and throw them in the trunk of your car , which will transport the rodent to an undisclosed location .
While driving , captors should crank up a classic rock station , further disorienting the mouse as a means of deprogramming its homing instincts .
To ensure the abducted rodent ’s homing mechanisms are completely sabotaged , captors should cross at least two rivers before dropping the mouse off in a ditch along a rural dirt road in an area that has been designated by the R.C.L.U. ( Rodent Civil Liberties Union ) as a safe haven for un-naturalized rodents .
Because these areas have been designated as no-fly and no-slither zones , mice and their rodent ilk will be protected from their second - tiered predators ( hawks , eagles , snakes , etc. ) .
Critics argue that this type of Catch - and - Release Program is not only inhuman but has concerns about creating a safe - haven for rodents , when there is a need to fill the jobs in the food chain that nobody else wants : Low - end Prey .
On the other hand , Rodent Abolitionists have adopted a much harsher eye - for - an - eye ( or piece - of - cheese - for - your - life ) stance when it comes to illegal rodents invading our homes .
They prefer catching the mice , putting them on trial , then killing them , so they are no longer pose a threat to our society .
The problem with the plan is that it is a costly undertaking , not to mention the process will take too long because of all the bureaucratic trappings .
Personally , I ’m not about to wait for a series of appeals , stays of execution , and for the mouse ’s DNA results to make sure it matches the droppings inhaled from the tip of my sinus sprayer , which I believe the accused was using as a makeshift bidet .
By the time the mouse if formally executed , I could have bought 100 new mouse traps and bred several colonies of mice .
Some rodent hardliners have suggested building walls around our homes to keep the mice out , but if Jerry has taught us anything it ’s : “ If there is a will there is a way . ” Just ask Tom
No thanks , I prefer an old - fashioned mouse trap that quickens the entire process .
For now , I will bait the traps with the traditional lure of L’eau de Cheese , at least until the Salmonella Peanut Butter Scare dies down — thus placating the grassroots efforts of the Mice Network .
( Note : All thoughts of violence toward mice not included in this post were bottled up , transported across two bodies of water and released into the wild , where they are sure to procreate and exponentially breed little thoughts of violence toward mice . )

Magic mushrooms are big business in the Netherlands
A ban on the sale of hallucinogenic or so - called " magic mushrooms " is coming into force in the Netherlands .
The Dutch government says the fungi , which contains the hallucinogenic ingredient psilocybin , can cause life - threatening behaviour .
Last year , a French girl jumped to her death from a bridge in Amsterdam after allegedly eating such mushrooms .
Owners of the shops that sell the fungi argue that their trade should be regulated , not banned .
The Dutch Association of Smart Shops fears the ban will put its members out of business .
It says there is not enough evidence to prove that the fungi are a danger to public health .
Mushroom - related incidents , requiring the emergency services , have doubled in the past few years , with most cases involving foreign tourists , mainly from Britain .
Many mix magic mushrooms with alcohol and cannabis .
Scientists have identified a relationship between two proteins in the brain that has links to both nicotine addiction and autism .
The finding has led to speculation that existing drugs used to curb nicotine addiction might serve as the basis for potential therapies to alleviate the symptoms of autism .
The discovery identified a defining role for a protein made by the neurexin - 1 gene , which is located in brain cells and assists in connecting neurons as part of the brain ’s chemical communication system .
The neurexin - 1 beta protein ’s job is to lure another protein , a specific type of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , to the synapses , where the receptor then has a role in helping neurons communicate signals among themselves and to the rest of the body .
This function is important in autism because previous research has shown that people with autism have a shortage of these nicotinic receptors in their brains .
Meanwhile , scientists also know that people who are addicted to nicotine have too many of these receptors in their brains .
“ If we were to use drugs that mimic the actions of nicotine at an early time in human brain development , would we begin to help those and other circuits develop properly and thus significantly mitigate the deficits in autism ?
This is a novel way of thinking about how we might be able to use drugs to approach autism treatment , ” said Rene Anand , associate professor of pharmacology in Ohio State University ’s College of Medicine and principal investigator of the research .
“ It would not be a complete cure , but right now we know very little and have no drugs that tackle the primary causes of autism . ”
The drugs in question are known as cholinergic agents , which interact with the brain to counter nicotine addiction .
Anand said the medications could be retailored for use in children in an effort to increase the level of neurexin - 1 beta protein in the brains of people with autism .

More neurexin would in turn not only enhance the presence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , but also a host of other proteins that are important for the proper formation and maturation of synapses .
Proper synapse function is critical to the nervous system ’s ability to connect to and control other systems of the body .
“ Now that these associations have been made , we believe that nicotine in smokers ’ brains possibly increases the level of neurexin - 1 and , as a consequence , helps bring more receptors to the synapses and makes those circuits highly efficient , reinforcing the addiction .
In autism , we have the opposite problem .
We have a lack of these receptors , and we speculate that neurexin levels are lower , ” he said .
Anand presented the research November 17 at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington , D.C .
Autism symptoms include impaired social interaction , problems with verbal and nonverbal communication , and repetitive or severely limited activities and interests .
An estimated three to six of every 1,000 children are diagnosed with autism , and boys are four times more likely than girls to have the disorder , according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .
Anand and colleagues were studying drug abuse and addiction when they discovered the neurexin - 1 beta protein ’s relationship to a certain type of nicotinic receptor .
The timing of the discovery was key , as it built upon two other research groups ’ previous observations :
The brains of people with autism and other neurological disorders that were examined after their death showed a 60 - percent to 70 - percent decrease in specific nicotinic receptors , and some patients with autism have mutations in the neurexin - 1 gene that suggest the gene ’s improper functions could play a role in the disorder .
advertisement
“ These have all been ‘ association studies . ’
None has been able to prove what causes autism , ” Anand said .
“ And then we accidentally discovered that neurexin - 1 and nicotinic receptors tangle .
So we knew that there was a genetic link to the process leading to synapse formation , and we had nicotinic receptors that had disappeared in the brains of autistic patients .
Our finding filled a gap by saying there is a physical and functional association between these two things occurring in the brain . ”
Neurexin has implications for tobacco addicts , as well , Anand said .
Yet another group of researchers recently found that people with a mutation in the neurexin - 1 gene were more likely to be smokers , meaning changes in the gene ’s functions that lead to excess levels of the nicotinic receptors might make people more susceptible to nicotine addiction .
“ Our research reveals how changes in the functions of neurexin could affect the guidance of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to their functional destinations in nerve cells , perhaps increasing receptors in tobacco addicts while decreasing them in autistic individuals , thus increasing susceptibility to these devastating neurological disorders , ” Anand said .
The finding also has implications for nicotine addiction because drugs known to alter neurexin ’s guidance of nicotinic receptors within nerve cells could be used to suppress tobacco addiction .

Bush officials authorized torture of US citizen , lawyers say John Byrne
Published : Friday January 30 , 2009
Print This Email This Attorneys for US citizen Jose Padilla -- who was convicted of material support for terrorist activities in 2007 -- say that high - level Bush Administration officials knew their client was being tortured during the time he was held an enemy combatant in a South Carolina brig , because of the command structure and that then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld employed in approving harsh interrogation tactics .
Rumsfeld approved the harsh interrogation techniques early in Bush 's presidency .
In Iraq , a cheat sheet titled " Interrogation Rules of Engagement , " revealed that some of them required the Iraq commanding general 's approval .
Among those requiring approval are tactics Padilla 's mother and lawyer say he was the victim of : " Sleep adjustment , " " Sleep management , " Sensory deprivation , " " isolation lasting longer than thirty days " and " stress " positions . "
It would n't be a shock if military guards went beyond the traditional treatment of a US prisoner , given Rumsfeld 's approved techniques and that Padilla was is legal limbo as an enemy combatant and eligible to be held for years without charge .
Padilla and his mother filed suit against the US government last year alleging a litany of harsh interrogation practices they said were tantamount to torture .
His lawyer also says he was held in isolation for years while held at the South Carolina brig .
" They knew what was going on at the brig and they permitted it to continue , " Tahlia Townsend , an attorney representing Padilla , told the Associated Press Thursday .
" Defendants Rumsfeld and [ Deputy Paul ]
Wolfowitz were routinely consulted on these kinds of questions . "
The Justice Department is attempting to get the case dismissed .
Padilla 's suit alleges mistreatment and that Padilla 's being held as an enemy combat was unconstitutional .
Dismissal might quietly shut the door on a troubled case that drew broad attention because the Bush Administration had deemed a US citizen an enemy combatant , the quasi-legal terminology used to hold suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay .
Padilla , a US citizen , was arrested in 2002 and accused of plotting with al - Qaida to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb " in a major U.S. city , but those charges were dropped .
He was declared an enemy combatant after his arrest , and held at the brig from June 2002 until January 2006 , again without charge .
In 2008 , Padilla and his mother , Estela Lebron , filed a lawsuit accusing the government of mistreating and illegally detaining Padilla while he was held near Charleston , South Carolina .
Padilla suffered " extreme isolation , sensory deprivation , severe physical pain , sleep deprivation , and profound disruption of his sense and personality , all well beyond the physical and mental discomfort that normally accompanies incarceration , " according to the lawyers ' claim .
Such treatment bears the hallmarks of harsh interrogation techniques approved by then - Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and used by interrogators of other enemy combatants held at the US ' Guantanamo Bay and Iraqi prisons .
In particular , they singled out then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and then Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz .
Padilla has alleged he was shackled in painful " stress positions , " a technique used at Guantanamo Bay that a bipartisan U.S. Senate panel ruled last year was the direct result of Bush administration detention policies , not individual guards or interrogators .
The original charge leveled at Padilla when he was arrested in 2002 was that he was part of a " dirty bomb " al Qaeda plot .
By the time he was charged five years later , government lawyers had dropped the charge .
The following are excerpts from Padilla 's 2006 motion ( PDF link ) which describe the claims of torture in more detail :
####
A substantial quantum of torture endured by Mr. Padilla came at the hands of his interrogators .
In an effort to disorient Mr. Padilla , his captors would deceive him about his location and who his interrogators actually were .
Mr. Padilla was threatened with being forcibly removed from the United States to another country , including U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where he was threatened his fate would be even worse than in the Naval Brig .
He was threatened with being cut with a knife and having alcohol poured on the wounds .
He was also threatened with imminent execution .
He was hooded and forced to stand in stress positions for long durations of time .
He was forced to endure exceedingly long interrogation sessions , without adequate sleep , wherein he would be confronted with false information , scenarios , and documents to further disorient him .
Often
he had to endure multiple interrogators who would scream , shake , and otherwise assault Mr. Padilla .
Additionally , Mr. Padilla was given drugs against his will , believed to be some form of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) or phencyclidine ( PCP ) , to act as a sort of truth serum during his interrogations .
....
It is worth noting that throughout his captivity , none of the restrictive and inhumane conditions visited upon Mr. Padilla were brought on by his behavior or by any actions on his part .
There were no incidents of Mr. Padilla violating any regulation of the Naval Brig or taking any aggressive action towards any of his captors .
Mr. Padilla has always been
peaceful and compliant with his captors .
He was , and remains to the time of this filing , docile and resigned B a model detainee .
....
In sum , many of the conditions Mr. Padilla experienced were inhumane and caused him great physical and psychological pain and anguish .
Other deprivations experienced by Mr. Padilla , taken in isolation , are merely cruel and some , merely petty .
However , it is important to recognize that all of the deprivations and assaults recounted above were employed in concert in a calculated manner to cause him maximum anguish .
It is also extremely important to note that the torturous acts visited upon Mr. Padilla were done over the course almost the entire three years and seven months of his captivity in the Naval Brig .
For most of one thousand three hundred and seven days , Mr. Padilla was tortured by the United States government without cause or justification .
Mr. Padilla=s treatment at the
hands of the United States government is shocking to even the most hardened conscience , and such outrageous conduct on the part of the government divests it of jurisdiction , under the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment , to prosecute Mr. Padilla in the instant matter .

The long Permarachne spinneret now known to be a tail ( centre bottom )
The species once described as the world 's oldest spider is a more primitive version of the web - spinning modern spider , scientists have found .
The parts of the Attercopus spider 's described as spinnerets - the appendages that allow web - spinning - were not spinnerets after all .
That means that the oldest " true " spider may have arrived 80 m years later than previously thought .
The results appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Paul Selden of the University of Kansas and his colleagues first described Attercopus fossil remains in 1989 .
Most of what the group initially found among fossil remains belonged to a group of extinct arachnids called trigonotarbids , but one bit seemed to have the modified hairs called spigots from which spider silk emerges , as well as the external , flexible appendages known as spinnerets that facilitate web - spinning .
That led the group to believe they were looking at the world 's oldest known spider .
Tell - tail However , also present in the mix of material from the rock was a tail - like structure , which the researchers could not identify .
What you 've got is a jigsaw puzzle , with half the pieces and no picture on the box lid
Paul Selden
The analysis stopped there until more material from the site was recovered and analysed .
This time the researchers found a piece of Attercopus abdomen , with a tail attached .
The existence of such a tail was also relevant to the more recently discovered Permarachne genus , whose tail was originally described as an " elongated spinneret " .
The finding prompted the team to return to their original samples , which on further study showed that the spinnerets they had earlier identified were in fact rolled - up pieces of cuticle , the animals ' external skeletal material .
Puzzling result
It seems that Attercopus is a missing link , capable of producing silk but not of weaving it .
" The thing that had been called the oldest known spider we have now shown is in fact more primitive than a true spider , " Professor Selden told BBC News .
The oldest " true spider " , like the ones seen today , dates from the late Carboniferous period that ended about 300 m years ago , though Professor Selden says that true spiders may have existed earlier but have not yet been discovered .
The ' smoking gun ' : a tail attached to Attercopus abdomen
The process of identifying the fossilised spider parts started with solid rock that was dissolved in acid , leaving behind organic matter that was sifted through to determine which belong to animals or plants .
" They 're all microscopic fragments .
What you 've got is a jigsaw puzzle , with half the pieces and no picture on the box lid , " Professor Selden said .
" You do n't know what it 's going to be if you have n't got all the pieces , so having these additional pieces means it changed the idea of what it was . "
The finding is important for evolutionary biologists trying to unravel the origin of spider silk .
" The puzzle about silk was this : we knew that it was n't used for making webs initially , for catching insects , because there were no flying insects when the earliest spiders were around , " Professor Selden said .
" Here we clearly have a spider - like animal that could produce silk but did n't yet have these flexible spinnerets for weaving it into webs ; we think that this sort of spider would leave a trail of silk as it moved along , using it to find its way back to its burrow . "
To clean up the incomplete record of different species , the team has suggested a new order be instituted , containing the Attercopus and Permarachne species .

BEIJING ( AP ) 
China cut key interest rates for the third time in six weeks on Wednesday in a bid to spur growth amid fears of a global recession that would hit its vital exports .
China trimmed the rate on a one - year loan by 0.27 percentage points to 6.66 percent , adding to official efforts to revive slowing economic growth and help struggling exporters .
The country ’s central bank also said in a statement that it had lowered the rate on one - year fixed deposits to 3.60 percent , from 3.87 percent .
Both cuts will be effective on Thursday .
The cuts come as the Federal Reserve and European central banks scramble to cut rates to shore up investor confidence .
Coral reefs around the world are in serious trouble from pollution , over - fishing , climate change and more .
The last thing they need is an infection .
But that 's exactly what yellow band disease ( YBD ) is — a bacterial infection that sickens coral colonies .
Researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) and colleagues have found that YBD seems to be getting worse with global warming and announced that they 've identified the bacteria responsible for the disease .
Just as a doctor can diagnose a child with chicken pox by the small , round bumps on her skin , you can tell a coral with yellow band disease ( YBD ) by its own characteristic markings .
This affliction etches a swath of pale - yellow or white lesions along the surface of an infected coral colony .
The discolored band is a mark of death , indicating where the bacterial infection has killed the coral 's photosynthetic symbionts , called zooxanthellae .
The coral host suffers from cellular damage and starves without its major energy source , and usually does not recover .
In a paper published in the November 2008 issue of the Journal of Applied Microbiology ( JAM ) , lead author James Cervino , a guest investigator in the WHOI Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry department , and his colleagues report isolating the bacteria that cause YBD : a group of four new Vibrio species , which combine with existing Vibrio on the coral to attack the zooxanthellae .
This is the first demonstration that the same bacterial culprits are to blame for the disease throughout the Caribbean as well as half way around the world in Indonesia .
The broad distribution of the core group of Vibrio also helps explain the expanding incidence of YBD throughout the world 's tropical oceans , Cervino says .
The JAM study documents YBD infection in Indonesia , Thailand , and the Philippines .
According to Cervino , " In the U.S. Virgin Islands , Florida , the Caribbean , YBD is one of the most threatening coral diseases . "
The Vibrio bacteria that cause YBD are part of a family with a reputation for disease .
" What we have are coral pathogens that are genetically close to shellfish pathogens , " Cervino says .
For example , one of the Vibrio bacteria found in corals also causes infections in prawns , shrimp , and crabs .
The bacteria are also distantly related to Vibrio cholera , the pathogen that causes human cholera epidemics .
There is no known danger to humans from YBD , however .
Cervino and colleagues grew Vibrio pathogens together with healthy coral .
They found that YBD infection occurs at normal ocean temperatures , but that warmer temperatures made the disease even more virulent .
Cervino explains , " Contrary to what many experts have assumed , this disease occurs independently of warming temperatures . "
However , when the temperatures go up and the corals are already infected , the infection becomes more lethal .
" Thermal stress and pathogenic stress are a double - whammy for the organism , " emphasizes Cervino .
With the Vibrio core group occurring in tropical oceans all over the world and water temperatures on the rise , he says , the prognosis for corals and the spread of YBD is rather grim .

" I WAS DRIVING home after work , ” David reported .
“ Things had been very stressful there lately .
I was tense but looking forward to getting home and relaxing .
And then , all of a sudden — boom !
My heart started racing , and I felt like I could n’t breathe .
I was sweating and shaking .
My thoughts were racing , and I was afraid that I was going crazy or having a heart attack .
I pulled over and called my wife to take me to the emergency room . ”
David ’s fears turned out to be unjustified .
An emergency room doctor told David , a composite of several therapy patients seen by one of us ( Arkowitz ) , that he was suffering from a panic attack .
The current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM ) defines a panic attack as an abrupt and discrete experience of intense fear or acute discomfort , accompanied by symptoms such as heart palpitations , shortness of breath , sweating , trembling , and worries about going crazy , losing control or dying .
Most attacks occur without obvious provocation , making them even more terrifying .
Some 8 to 10 percent of the population experiences an occasional attack , but only 5 percent develops panic disorder .
Contrary to common misconception , these episodes are n’t merely rushes of anxiety that most of us experience from time to time .
Instead patients who have had a panic attack typically describe it as the most frightening event they have ever undergone .
Research has provided important leads to explain what causes a person ’s first panic attack — clues that can help ward off an attack in the first place .
When stress builds up to a critical level , a very small additional amount of stress can trigger panic .
As a result , the person may experience the event as coming out of the blue .
Some people may have a genetic predisposition toward panic , as psychologist Regina A. Shih , then at Johns Hopkins University , and her colleagues described in a review article .
The disorder runs in families , and if one identical twin has panic disorder , the chance that the other one also has it is two to three times higher than for fraternal twins , who are genetically less similar .
Although these findings do not rule out environmental factors , they do strongly suggest a genetic component .
Panic disorder imposes serious restrictions on patients ’ quality of life .
They may be plagued by a persistent concern about the possibility of more attacks and may avoid situations associated with them .
To receive a diagnosis of panic disorder , patients must also worry that they might have another attack where it would be embarrassing ( say , in a public setting such as a classroom ) , difficult to escape ( such as when one is stuck in traffic ) , or difficult to find help ( for example , in an area with no medical facilities nearby ) .
Panic disorder accompanied by extensive avoidance of these situations results in a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia ; in extreme cases , sufferers may even become housebound .
From Normal Anxiety to Crippling Fear
What are the roots of such incapacitating attacks ?
Psychologist David H. Barlow of Boston University , who has conducted pioneering research on understanding and treating panic disorder and related disorders , and others believe that panic attacks result when our normal “ fight or flight ” response to imminent threats — including increased heart rate and rapid breathing — is triggered by “ false alarms , ” situations in which real danger is absent .
( In contrast , the same response in the face of a real danger is a “ true alarm . ” )
When we experience true or false alarms , we tend to associate the biological and psychological reactions they elicit with cues that were present at the time .
These associations become “ learned alarms ” that can evoke further panic attacks .
Both external situations and internal bodily cues of arousal ( such as increased breathing rate ) can elicit a learned alarm .
For example , some people experience panic attacks when they exercise because the physiological arousal leads to bodily sensations similar to those of a panic attack .
Why do some people experience only isolated attacks , whereas others develop full - blown panic disorder ?
Barlow has synthesized his research and that of others to develop an integrated theory of anxiety disorders , which states that certain predispositions are necessary to develop panic disorder :
A generalized biological vulnerability toward anxiety , leading us to overreact to the events of daily life .
A generalized psychological vulnerability to develop anxiety caused by early childhood learning ( such as overprotection from our parents ) that the world is a dangerous place and that stress is overwhelming and cannot be controlled .
A specific psychological vulnerability in which we learn in childhood that some situations or objects are dangerous even if they are not .
Panic disorder develops when a person with these vulnerabilities experiences prolonged stress and a panic attack .
The first attack activates the psychological vulnerabilities , creating a hypersensitivity to external and internal cues associated with the attack .
As a result , even medication containing a mild stimulant can provoke an attack .
Still , there is good news .
Two findings in particular can provide reassurance for those with panic disorder .
The first is that all panic attacks are triggered by known events , even though the sufferer may be unaware of them .
This knowledge can reduce the anxiety associated with the sense of unpredictability .
Second , it can be reassuring to learn that a panic attack is a misfiring of the fight - or - flight response in the absence of danger .
Basic research not only has helped us understand panic disorder but also has led to effective treatments .
In particular , Barlow and his associates developed panic - control treatment , described in their 2006 book Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic .
It involves education about panic disorder and somewhat gradual exposure to the internal and external cues that trigger panic attacks , along with changing the catastrophic interpretations of bodily cues so that they no longer trigger the attacks .
This treatment has in most instances surpassed drug therapies for the disorder over the long term .

A Denver police officer who is accused of repeatedly slamming the face of a 57 - year - old man into the pavement near Coors Field has been formally charged with second - degree assault .
According to the charges file Friday , the alleged victim , John Heaney , suffered serious bodily injury at the hands of officer Michael Cordova .
Cordova , 32 , was on duty but wearing plain clothes when the altercation took place .
According to Lynn Kimbrough , spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney ’s Office , Cordova is accused of intending to cause serious bodily injury to Heaney by using a deadly weapon — specifically the pavement .
According to court papers filed by Denver police Sgt. Paul Jimenez , members of the department ’s vice unit were conducting an undercover ticket - scalping operation near Coors Field on the day of the incident .
Jimenez said that after Heaney rode his bike through a red light at 20th and Blake , Cordova approached Heaney .
Police claim that Heaney punched Cordova in the face with a closed fist .
Jimenez said that video footage of the incident shows Cpl. Cordova forcing Heaney ’s face into the pavement .
As a result , said Jimenez , some of Heaney ’s teeth were broken .
The incident was recorded by sports TV producer Greg Prinkey .
The tape shows Heaney ’s face being slammed into the pavement .
Heaney , who said he did n’t know the undercover officers were policemen , has told 9NEWS that he only flipped Cordova ’s Rockies hat off his head .
The television station also interviewed three witnesses who said Heaney did not hit the officers .
Lonn Heymann , Heaney ’s lawyer , did not return calls for comment .
During the course of the investigation , Cordova has been working at a desk job .
With the filing of charges today , the Denver Police Department suspended Cordova without pay .
Cordova has been released on a $ 5,000 bond .
He is scheduled to appear in Denver County Courtroom T on Jan. 2 , to be formally advised of the charges .

To all anarcho - capitalists , Libertarians , Ron Paulites , Randroids and whoever else comes here to defend your idols and your ideologies , take heed of what I write here so that our discussions will be pleasant .
I have had enough twisting of truths , covered insults , elitism and outright lies to last me a lifetime so the buck stops here .
Either shape up and follow the reasonable rules I lay here , or GTFO .
Lies
This is a big no - no , alright ?
The last thing I want to do is correct your blatant disregard for ( historical ) facts when you wish to make a point .
This quote is sample of this cancer .
History has proven me correct in both instances .
The freest country on earth became the most prosperous and every country that ever had communism or socialism has suffered great losses in productivity and the rise of authoritative forces .
What has happened to Cuba since the revolution ?
What happened to Russia and China .
Each of these countries was once considered wealthy and then they became communist .
The systems broke down .
I can live with honest mistakes that come from simply being ignorant of some historical facts but phrases such as the above are unacceptable .
The fact that it is painfully easy to verify its falsity only means that you are being deliberately dishonest in order to propagandize .
And I do not care for that .
If that ’s what you ’re after , go find out some Ron Paul drones to talk to .
Outright lies such as the above will be served with a warning the first time , and a ban the second .
And even the warning is too much but I ’m prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt in that you ’re simply that ignorant .
But be aware that if you are really so ignorant , you ’d better get a clue .
Quickly .
Finally get it into your thick heads that Correlation does not equal Causation
Yes I know that you think that everything good comes from Capitalism and everything bad from Socialism and the government but you have to understand that the world is a complex place .
Your arguments simply boil down to “ Any place that prospers must be because of Anarcho - Capitalism and any place that falters must be because of the government ” and then look for facts to support this .
I have seen this more than enough times and I ’m not impressed .
Especially when someone points out a nation with a neoliberal policy which you ’ve been praising for the last couple of years which when it failed , now suddenly you find out that the government did it .
Why did n’t you say anything before ?
This applies to the reverse of course , when you rush to blame Socialism ( or whatever the fuck you think Socialism is ) and the government for any failure , disregarding any and all external factors .
Dictatorships in Africa ?
It has nothing to do with the US funding the dictators and everything to do with Socialism .
US Economy failing ?
It has nothing to do with the last 30 years of neoliberal economics and all to do with Socialism / The Fed / The Government / Any other boogeyman .
You ’re not convincing anyone but yourselves .
If you ’re going to make such an argument , you ’re better off not commenting at all .
Read what I write , not what you think I mean .
When I say that Communism requires no government , I do not really mean “ Communism requires government ” .
If you cannot understand how something might work without a government or another authority then ask !
Do not assume that in this or that argument I must mean the government , jump to that conclusion and then accuse me in the same breath of being an authoritarian .
I have had enough of this shit .
If you show a failure to grasp this simple concept , once again you will get a warning and then a ban .
I do not care to repeat myself all the time to someone who is unwilling to even read what I write in favour of his own preconceptions .
Know thy enemy
If you come here with the purpose to argue against Communism , you ’d better have a clue on what it actually is .
I have no intention of educating you as I go and there are quite a few books you can read .
If all you ’ve read is the Communist Manifesto , a propagandistic piece with as much detail as the Declaration of Independence , then you do not know Communism .
If you do display a blatant lack of knowledge of this aspect , I will most likely direct you to an article on my Misunderstanding Communism series that hopefuly dispels your misunderstanding or at least gives you my take on this issue .
If you come after that and use the same goddamn argument you should have just read my refutation of , then you will get a warning .
If you do not want to read what I ’ve written on this subject , then you ’re not here to discuss or learn , but to evangelize and you should GTFO !
I laugh at your courtier ’s replies
When I criticize any argument you or one of your idols might make , I do not attempt to argue against your whole worldview .
I simply refute what has been laid in front of me .
If you then start quoting books that I should read before I can argue , I will just ignore them .
I can just as well suggest that you read anything I have in order to be able to argue with me , but this is simply absurd and we would never be able to converse .
If you think an argument I make I wrong , point out the errors , do not suggest books and claim that they will convince me .
I will not look at them .
The only way you can get me to possibly look at a book is to make coherent arguments which actually make sense so that my interest in raised in this topic .
Then you can suggest a book that goes into detail on this matter and I will have an reason to check it out .
Finally
Since all of the above seem to be the bread & butter of anarcho - capitalists , a link will go to the Comment Policy to hopefully stop the inanity that has been spreading around here lately .
If you do not like them , feel free to GTFO as you would n’t be adding anything to the conversation anyway .
If you choose to ignore them in order to evangelize , then your hypocricy knows no bounds , you stalwart protectors of private property .

As the economic crisis worsens , public officials have resorted to ever more nonsensical statements to describe what they are doing or propose to do in response to it .
The dollar is not the only currency that is depreciating ; the medium of communication , the English language , is taking a beating , too .
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson last Saturday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , urging speedy government action to bail out the Detroit automobile companies , said : “ A healthy automobile manufacturing sector is essential to the restoration of financial market stability , the overall health of our economy , and the livelihood of the automobile sector ’s work force . ”
One need not be a master linguist to appreciate that this statement does not make good sense .
Speaking as an economist , I would say that it makes highly unwarranted claims .
Does “ restoration of financial market stability ” really require “ a healthy automobile manufacturing sector ” ?
Why does it ?
Can the U.S. economy not enjoy prosperity without GM , Ford , and Chrysler as they currently exist ?
Why ca n’t it ?
Are the workers now employed by these companies incapable of working in any other capacity ?
What makes them so hyper - specialized ?
Does it make economic sense to prop up companies that have demonstrated that they cannot compete effectively and probably cannot operate in the long run without incurring chronic losses ?
You ’d think that someone skilled in special pleading could have written a more compelling pitch .
On another bailout front , where the Treasury is now steering several more shiploads of dollars to AIG ( the whole bailout package for this giant company is now valued at $ 152.5 billion ) , an unnamed Treasury official was quoted as saying : “ The Treasury determined AIG was a systemically significant institution .
Bringing more equity to the company puts AIG in a better position to dispose of its assets , and it was done to protect the taxpayer . ”
“ Systematically significant institution ” ?
Why ?
If AIG were to receive no more taxpayer money , would that cutoff entail the end of civilization ?
And how exactly does giving the company assets ( cash ) help it dispose of its assets ( rotten securities ) ?
It sounds more like trading something for nothing .
To say that this make - believe “ investment ” will in any way “ protect the taxpayer ” only insults our intelligence .
Everyone can see that the taxpayers are being ripped up one side and down the other in these emergency government actions and that the Treasury and the Fed are bailing out and inflating as if there were no tomorrow .
If they keep up these horrendous overreactions to a largely bogus crisis much longer , they may eventually ensure that there wo n’t be one .
5 Extremely Dangerous Cars to Own
Sure you may have a good insurance plan , and maybe the person you get into an accident with has a good insurance plan too but the fact of the matter is , it does n't matter how good of insurance you have if you die or are brutally injured in a car accident .
It is highly recommended that you avoid buying any of the following vehicles if safety is any sort of concern as they are considered to be five of the most dangerous vehicles on the road to be in an accident in .
You can get insurance , but try getting any auto insurance quotes that will bring your loved ones back to life after a fatal accident .
5. Toyota Yaris
While the price tag and fuel economy offered by the Toyota Yaris may be very attractive the car itself is quite dangerous .
The ' 07 - '08 four door model only received a three star NHTSA rating for side - crash tests as well as a poor rating from the IIHS .
To make things even more dangerous , the car handles very poorly in emergency situations as the car is quite tail - happy causing drivers to easily lose control of the vehicle .
* added 01-20-09 :
The ' 08 - '09 models now come standard with side impact airbags and have now receive a good rating from IIHS .
4. Ford Escape / Mercury Mariner
The '07 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner share the same chassis as well as a very poor rating .
They both received the lowest possible score from the IIHS .
The poor rating was due to bad ratings in the side impact crash test .
The car has a very high risk of rollovers and lacks any stability control .
In 2008 Ford updated their models to include stability control as well as front side and side curtain airbags to dramatically improve the safety of the vehicle .
My recommendation ?
Stay away from 2007 and earlier models of the Ford Escape and the Mercury Mariner .
3. Nissan Frontier
The '07 Nissan Frontier , while a relatively nice looking truck is an overall failure in most all of the safety departments .
The Nissan Frontier , only received a three star NHTSA rating for rollovers .
The King Cab model also received a three - star NHTSA rating on the frontal crash - test rating which makes this another vehicle you probably do n't want to be in if you get hit head on .
Finally , the Frontier also received a poor rating by the IIHS for rear impacts , the lowest rating available .
To put the nail in the coffin , the Frontier does n't come equipped with side or curtain airbags .
The overall verdict , you do n't want to be in an accident while in this car from any angle !
2. Ford Ranger / Mazda B- Series
While the '07 Ranger seems like a relatively safe vehicle , the design has not evolved much over the years and neither have the safety features .
Side airbags and curtain bags are not options and there is no model including a stability control option .
To make things worse , the Ford Ranger and Mazda B - Series only received a three star NHTSA rollover rating .
This means that if you get in an accident you run a 20 - 30 % risk of having your vehicle roll over .
This makes the Ranger / B- Series one of the highest risk vehicles for rolling in the auto industry .
1. Buick Rendezvous
The '07 Buick Rendezvous was supposed to be a blend of a blend between a luxury car , an SUV and a mini van .
Aside from a little fame thanks to an ad campaign featuring Tiger Woods , the Buick Rendezvous was quite the failure .
The car received horrible ratings and only received 3/5 stars on a front impact rating by NHTSA .
This is one car you do not want to be in if you get in a head on collision .
Buick put the rendezvous to rest after the 2007 replacing it with the Buick Enclave in 2008 .

Mozilla has rushed out updates to plug a few critical holes in versions 2 and 3 of its popular open source Firefox browser .
Firefox 3.0.5 fixes three critical security flaws in the browser , while 2.0.0.19 stitches four critical vulns .
Mozilla said that XSS vulnerabilities in SessionStore , XSS and so - called JavaScript “ privilege escalation ” and crashes that could cause memory corruption have been repaired in Firefox 3.0.5 .
The bugs in the browser could have been “ used to run attacker code and install software , requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing , ” said Mozilla .
It also once again urged users to upgrade from Firefox 2.0 because version 2.0.0.19 is the final release of updates for the browser .
The company “ is not planning any further security and stability updates for Firefox 2 , and recommends that you upgrade to Firefox 3 as soon as possible ” .
It added that Mozilla ’s “ Phishing Protection ” service would no longer be available in Firefox 2 .
In other words , it wo n’t be supporting the browser against future online scams and attacks .
Mozilla ’s security updates today follow on from Microsoft having to push out an emergency security patch for Internet Explorer on Wednesday , addressing a critical security hole currently being exploited in the wild .
The latest zero - day vulnerability stems from data binding bugs that allows hackers access to a computer 's memory space , allowing attackers to remotely execute malicious code as IE crashes , said a red - faced Microsoft yesterday . ®
Astronomers use high powered laster pens for star pointing
High powered laser pointers have been seized by trading standards officers at a container port in Suffolk .
Sixteen boxes headed for a premises in north London were found at Felixstowe Docks earlier this week .
The seized pointers are illegal in the UK as their power rating of 5 milliWatt ( mW ) is more than the 1 mW allowed .
Imports of laser pens that astronomers use for star pointing , have also been targeted by officials after reports of them being used in a dangerous manner .
Last month an Ipswich teenager received a 20 - week prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , for using a green laser pointer to dazzle the pilot of a police helicopter .
Britain 's largest pilots union BALPA has warned people misusing these pointers that they are " playing Russian roulette " with the lives of hundreds of passengers .
The organisation has suggested that some laser pens should be classified as weapons .
Suffolk 's portfolio holder for public protection , Joanna Spicer said : " These are not the laser pens or pointers you sometimes see in conferences or presentations .
" These items are way more powerful than is legally allowed in this country .
" We have heard in the past week alone what damage can be done to pilots and aircraft when these powerful instruments get into the wrong hands . "

More prominent economists have declared that the U.S. is facing a depression that may be even worse than that of the 1930s .
Noting that current efforts to rescue the mortgage industry are less successful than those used during the 30s , Edward J. Pinto , former chief credit officer at Fannie Mae has warned that the current crisis could be worse .
Mr. Pinto said that , while the subprime crisis was often compared to the Depression , there were differences that made the current problem more acute .
The Depression - era collapse in housing prices did not generally put homeowners at risk of owing the bank more than their house was worth .
That is not the case today .
In addition , hedge fund manager and billionaire philanthropist George Soros has warned that the current crisis outstrips that of the 30s :
The bursting housing bubble “ acted like a detonator that exploded a much larger bubble , ” he said .
“ The economies of the world are falling off a cliff .
This is a situation that is comparable to the 1930s .
And once you recognize it , you have to recognize the size of the problem is much bigger , ” he said .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Pinto and Soros join the IMF ’s top economist , Olivier Blanchard , and Professor Peter Morici , a former chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission , who have both concluded that a depression is looming .
These summations dovetail with the analysis of renowned financial publication The Economist , which reported earlier this month that , based on the characteristics of the current financial crisis , the U.S. is in a depression , not a recession .
More and more prominent analysts are now saying what people like Alex Jones and Peter Schiff were being called doomsayers for predicting over a year ago , that the U.S. faces a crisis on the scale of the great depression , if not worse .
The following headlines , all from the last 24 hours , speak volumes about the current situation :
US new jobless claims up , continued claims a record

While fiscal conservatives such as Ron Paul have called for cuts in spending and liquidation of debt , The House has passed Obama ’s $ 819 billion stimulus package , at a cost of $ 6700 more debt to each and every American .
As if that was n’t bad enough , hundreds of billions of the proposed stimulus is scheduled to be spent on unrelated items , such as climate change studies and digital TV converter box coupons , that will provide little to no stimulation of the real economy whatsoever .
Astoundingly , there are already reports of handing another $ 2 trillion of taxpayer money to the banks !
The insanity continues .

Free pots of probiotic yoghurt are being handed out
Pots of the probiotic yoghurts are being handed out at Addenbrooke 's hospital in Cambridge .
They are being given to patients on wards where there have been higher cases of Clostridium difficile .
Dieticians at Addenbrooke 's have said evidence suggested the yoghurt might cut the risk of contracting C.diff .
Caroline Heyes , dietetic services manager at Addenbrooke 's hospital , said : " Probiotic yoghurts may play a role in preventing C.difficile infection so we have been running a pilot on three of the care of the elderly wards for six months .
" It 's early days and the research is not complete yet but the evidence is that it has a role to play in reducing C.diff infection . "
' Safe foodstuff '
Year - on - year cases of C.diff at Addenbrooke 's have gone down from 54 to 24 , a reduction of more than 50 % .
" We can't say for sure how much of that benefit is down to the yoghurt and how much they are down to a whole range of infection control procedures that the hospital has in place such as the deep cleaning programme , the bare - below - the - elbow programme , and the increased isolation procedures , " Ms Heyes said .
" But probiotic yoghurts may have a role to play .
The patients like them , they are a safe foodstuff and they improve the patients food and fluid intake so it really makes sense to give them a try .
Addenbrooke 's hospital will decide whether to continue the pilot scheme in March .
In January , scientists said they had hard evidence that foods containing " friendly bacteria " did have a tangible effect on the body .
The journal Molecular Systems Biology reported that mice fed probiotic drinks had different levels of key chemicals in their blood and urine .
The Imperial College London research - which was part - funded by food giant Nestle - also suggested they could change fat digestion but dieticians said this would work only for relatively small numbers of people .
Probiotics , meaning " for life " , are products that contain live strains of bacteria incorporated into yoghurts , fruit juices or freeze - dried powders , which boost levels of the bacteria in the gut .

We can use an application of blood spatter trigonometry to study the correlation of this blood to Talma 's probable position within the box .
Blood Spatter Trigonometry » A moving droplet of blood will eventually hit a surface .
At the initial instance of contact , the spherical droplet will be tangent to the intercepting surface .
The type of spatter the blood droplet leaves on the surface strongly depends on its direction and speed ( its vector ) .
In the diagram , the instance of contact is shown for the red spherical droplet .
A Dandelin cone based on the vector approximates the elliptical spatter pattern the blood will leave behind .
Note that the initial tangent point is one of the foci of the underlying ellipse .
The speed and viscosity will further deform the elliptical pattern .
CHARLIE ( cont'd )
We were able to analyze the pattern of the blood droplets , along with the angle and velocity of impact to determine , with high probability that Talma suffered a real injury .
It could have been accidental , or it could have been the result of a struggle ... ( takes out Penn 's card ) I 'd like to consult a couple of experts who might have an idea which it was .

New York City workers and students speak
“ The bailout is for the rich , we are the ones who pay for it ”
By a reporting team
17 December 2008
The World Socialist Web Site recently spoke to workers and students around New York City about the impact of the economic crisis on their living conditions and their views on bailout of the banks by the federal government .
The WSWS spoke to people who were paying their utility bills at the National Grid office in downtown Brooklyn .
The lines were long , and the atmosphere was fraught with a mixture of anxiety , boredom , and frustration .
Many people were paying their bills in person so that their utilities would not be shut off .
Some of the most recent statistics show that in September , more than 9,000 New Yorkers had their utilities shut off , a 13 percent increase over the same period in 2007 .
Mrs. Goodman , a conductor for the New York City Transit Authority for 12 years , said : “ The utility bills are getting higher and higher .
I am here to pay both National Grid for my gas and Con Ed for my electric .
I am a renter , and pay for the gas for my stove .
“ The electric bills are really hurting me .
It has gone up about 30 percent over the recent years .
I am still able to pay the bills , but I have friends that who have fallen seriously behind .
The price of food is going up , especially for items like bread and milk .
Due to the fact that the price of gas has gone up , I drive my car less and less .
I just fill up my tank when I get paid every two weeks .
“ The bailout is for the rich .
When their companies go bankrupt , they still get their bonuses , and we are the ones who have to pay for it .
When we go bankrupt , nobody helps us out .
For the foreseeable future , it will get worse for us . ”
A housekeeper , Mrs. Xavier , told us : “ I just paid my gas bill , and I came here to get my receipt as proof that I paid .
I have fallen behind more than once , and I just use gas for my stove .
I also had trouble paying the light bill .
More than once , I have had to tell them please do not turn off the lights because I need more time to pay .
“ In addition to utilities , the price of food is too high .
When I go shopping , I have to make sure that I have a list and stick to it , because if I go over that list , then I will have paid more money than I can afford .
I had to give up my car about seven years ago .
I had a good driving record , but despite that , the cost of insurance was just too much for me .
“ Fortunately , I live in a city where there is public transportation , but the problem is that the fare is too high .
It might be $ 2 a fare , but it adds up , and my money just goes like that .
After they just raised the fare , they are talking about raising it again .
I also pay a lot for my rent for just one person .
I am constantly thinking about how to save money . ”
At the unemployment center
We also went to the unemployment center nearby , a grim , dirty building .
It houses agencies that deal not only with unemployment benefit applications , but with other necessary social services , such as food stamps and other forms of public assistance .
Many people said that they could not speak with us as they were leaving because they were too angry or upset at what they had just experienced inside .
We stopped a young man , an immigrant from Africa , and asked him to tell us about his life .
He said that that he was homeless and desperate for work .
“ Some people run and go back to their country .
Me , I have no place to go .
This is my country .
Now I ’m staying at the Bowery Mission .
You can stay there as long as you call first .
If you do n’t call , you ca n’t stay .
They give us food two times a day .
But it ’s not just food I ’m looking for .
I want to have my own family .
I want to have my own house and my own car .
“ I know that if I have a good job , I will work hard .
Now I get nothing but temporary jobs .
I do n’t want to hear the world ‘ temporary . ’
I want a full - time job .
They pay me $ 7.75 an hour .
I need a $ 10 or $ 12 an hour .
Everything is expensive now .
If I want to cut my hair , it ’s $ 15 . ”
We also spoke to Christina as she left the building .
“ I ’m unemployed right now , ” she said .
“ But I have my GED [ general equivalency diploma ] .
I live with my partner of 32 years and my son .
My son ’s working right now .
He works for a messenger service , six days a week .
He works very hard and he gets paid very , very little , barely $ 200 , $ 300 a week , depending on how busy it is .
“ You feel overwhelmed sometimes .
I sure do .
I pray to God every day that things will work out .
I am somebody that wants to work , but doors do n’t open . ”
We asked Christina what she thought about the government bailout of the billionaires .
“ It ’s amazing how they want help from the government , and meanwhile there are a lot of ordinary people that need help .
I ’m not well educated in what ’s going on , but I know that something ’s not right .
Who is [ the bailout ] really going to benefit ?
What happens to the people who do n’t miss a day of work , who go in sick ? ”
At City College
We visited the City College of New York in Harlem and spoke to students in the Student Center about unemployment , the cost of tuition and living standards in New York City .
Nearly everyone we spoke to was angry and disturbed at the living conditions in New York .
We asked Lonnie from the Bronx what she thought of the vote by Democrats and Republicans in the State Assembly to cut funds for the state and city higher educational systems .
“ I think it ’s really unfair because a lot of students are getting financial aid as it is , ” she said .
“ Many families ca n’t afford to pay for education , and it sets a lot of people back .
People are having problems with rent and high prices .
There ’s a big recession happening .
It ’s not going to benefit anybody to increase tuition . ”
Alex , a student from Brooklyn , told us , “ At an educational facility , they should make it easier for us , not harder .
Books can cost over $ 100 a piece already .
To go to CUNY [ City University of New York ] , people have to take loans out .
That used to be unheard of .
It ’s a city university . ”
When asked about the role of the Democrats and Republicans in voting for cuts in education , Alex said , “ It ’s politics , it ’s the rich taking money from you and me because they have the power .
The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer .
It ’s a wider gap . ”
It Was a Bad Week for Modern Medicine So National Institutes of Health Launches ‘ Inquisition ’ Into Use Of Dietary Supplements and Alternative Therapies
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
Oh , it was a bad week for modern medicine .
But Tara Parker Pope of the New York Times did n’t think so .
She wrote an article entitled " News Keeps Getting Worse For Vitamins . "
( Nov. 20 , u201808 NYT )
But then again , we could slip a fast one by Tara any day since she does n’t know how to read the pseudo - science now being used to denigrate dietary supplements .
Hey , Tara , you did n’t say whether YOU take vitamins pills .
Never mind surveys show the most educated are more likely to take vitamin pills , or other studies which show the typical American diet leaves most Americans deficient in vitamins C , D , E , B12 and folic acid .
Breast cancer cooking machines
The zinger was the report showing breast cancers just disappear if you leave them alone , stop clamping breasts in mammogram machines , stop zapping women ’s breasts with radiation machinery ( mammography ) and stop lancing breasts with biopsy needles .
( Archives Internal Medicine Nov. 24 , ’08 ) .
Yep , the body ’s immune system just engulfs these developing tumors .
But modern medicine is not going to live this one down easily .
To be sure , the human immune system is not greater than the best oncologist .
Women need an oncologist to care for their breasts with treatment that befits a torture chamber .
The women who chose to pass up bi-annual mammograms had 22 % less breast cancer !
But , with all this dose of reality , thousands of gullible American women , driven largely by the greater fear of cancer than the fear of treatment , will submit their breasts to the torture arena , over and over .
A Chicago Tribune blog space revealed this : " In four Norwegian countries , breast cancer rates increased significantly after women there began undergoing mammography every two years . "
( Chicago Trib Nov. 28 , ’08 )
Do you think American medicine is covertly cooking breast cancer in those radiation machines and naïve women never figure this out ?
Ah , come on , the doctors would n’t do that , would they ?
The water pills create disease
Then there was the revelation by Johns Hopkins researchers that diuretics ( water pills ) used to treat high blood pressure induce diabetes , probably by washing out essential nutrients like potassium from the body .
( Hypertension Nov . ’ 08 )
Now here we have the perfect drug — it substitutes one disease for another .
Say , how many diabetics are prescribed potassium ?
I ca n’t recall any that I know .
Yet this study certainly reveals a low potassium level will induce diabetes .
The report did n’t mention that diuretics also wash out vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) and induce heart failure , and doctors frequently overlook this .
But hey , who cares , the goal of modern medicine is not to cure but to create perpetual disease requiring perpetual treatment .
Will ANY American taking diuretics have the gumption to stop taking them ?
Probably not .
The world still spins in the same wrong direction , regardless of what is reported .
Universal debt for universal healthcare
While the public has high hopes its doctor and hospital bills will now be paid by a rich uncle named Sam , who is secretly adding these bills onto their collective credit card called the national debt , pharmaceutical companies are jumping up and down with glee over the prospect of universal health care .
Now they get cut into more of the public treasure chest and the public is no healthier .
Europe caught on this week , pinning the tail on the pharmaceutical donkey for the industry ’s dirty tricks in Belgium .
The European Competition Commissioner noticed that it often takes months for a generic version of a drug to become available after a successful drug patent expires .
The Belgium commissioner reports that drug companies apply at once for as many patents in as many European countries as possible .
That way a single drug may garner as many as 1,300 patents .
This keeps competitors busy a long time sorting it all out .
Another trick is to sue a competitor who is planning to bring out a cheap generic version of a drug .
The maker of the generic drug is usually cleared of any wrongdoing .
But the trial can take years .
In the meantime , the cheap generic drug ca n’t be sold in the marketplace .
So what happened to the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. that is supposed to ensure competition in the marketplace ?
But , oh , OPEC ( oil producing countries organization ) does this all the time with impunity .
They rig supply against demand to always create near shortages .
So what ’s to say the FTC is going to do anything to stop the drug companies ?
Government and industry are in league to gouge Americans , not create true competition .
In this very bad week , Pfizer also took it on the chin as Nigerian officials demand $ 8.5 billion for illegal drug experiments on Nigerian children .
Pfizer is soon facing doom as its $ 12 billion Lipitor drug patent is soon to expire , so it did n’t need this public relations nightmare .
Pfizer is offering $ 150 million in what really appears to be extortion money .
Essentially , Pfizer continues to experiment on unwitting Americans since Lipitor has never been proven to lower mortality rates for heart disease .
Americans submit themselves to the cholesterol - lowering liver - toxic drug emanating from their created phobia over cholesterol .
Never mind the same number of Americans die every year from heart disease despite 25 million Americans taking statin drugs .
The inquisition over vitamin pills begins
In this turbulent healthcare arena , which can no longer proceed in the direction it is going , the government inexplicably wants Americans to " confess " to taking dietary supplements .
Yes , this is a quiet inquisition , in the privacy of your doctor ’s office .
Herbal heretics will be routed out soon !
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) has conducted a survey showing 60 % of Americans take dietary supplements or submit to alternative therapies and most do not tell their doctors they are taking them out of fear their doctors will get mad or lose respect .
The NIH , in league with the drug companies , does n’t like Americans spending $ 40 billion a year on alternative care .
( Prayer is at the top of the list of alternative therapies , and even though it is free , it looks like it is being belittled and banned as well . )
So the NIH is issuing its " Time To Talk " kits to doctors , encouraging patients to " fess up " as one news reporter described it .
( McClatchy - Tribune Regional News , Dec. 1 , ’08 )
Real reform ( have we heard this before ? )
Meanwhile , there is mumbling of some major reform in health care , given the realization that the problem is n’t a shortage of money .
Americans spend ga-zillions to braggingly produce " the best healthcare in the world , " at prices no one can afford .
American medicine needs to see a shrink .
A dose of reality therapy will do .
The U.S. ranks 29th in infant mortality , 48th in life expectancy and 19th out of 19 industrialized nations in preventable deaths .
So , George Halvorson , Kaiser healthplan chief , concedes that " Not only is U.S. health care inefficient and wasteful , much of it is dangerous . "
( Washington Post Dec. 1 , ’08 )
A new President is taking office who promised he would reduce Americans health care bill by $ 2500 a year ( Americans now pay about $ 7500 for health care or health care insurance annually . )
The stated idea is to realign financial incentives to reward success , and encourage prevention , says the Washington Post article , which goes on to say " the most daunting but perhaps most important , saying no to expensive , unproven therapies . "

Paper lanterns were used to represent the passing of time .
A colourful parade of hundreds of people carrying home - made lanterns through Brighton 's streets has marked the winter solstice .
The Burning of the Clocks is described as an antidote to the commercial excesses of Christmas and a celebration of daylight hours getting longer .
More than 1,000 people paraded through the resort 's streets to the seafront .
Paper and willow lanterns were then burnt on a ceremonial bonfire and fireworks lit .
The event , co-ordinated by local community arts group Same Sky , is in its 15th year .
The procession was accompanied by live music , while paper lanterns were used to represent the passing of time .
Thousands of spectators lined the streets to watch the event .
At the moment , I use a Sony Ericcson k750 i as my phone .
It ’s solid , has good reception and audio and battery life .
It has an easy - to - use camera with a flash which is important for me because that ’s how I record and store whiteboard sessions .
It has bluetooth for file transfer ( of the whiteboard photos ) and hands - free headsets ( it ’s illegal in Ireland to drive while using a mobile phone , so the headset – and the voice recognition dialing – are quite useful ) .
It has an FM radio and an MP3 player for when I ’m on the train .
I ’ve got Opera Mini installed on it so I can even check my email and websites , though writing anything with T9 is something a sane person only takes on in extremis .
It ’s even red 😀
It ’s been a very good phone for me and I have almost no complaints about it .
But it ’s time for a change .
Why ?
Well , the most cosmetic thing is that it ’s not exactly shiny anymore .
I ’ve had it for two years now , and two years living in my pocket next to keys , tools , pens and general lint has taken its toll .
The lens is still fine , the sliding cover was a good design idea and more phones should use one , but the facia around the keypad is almost paint - free and is coming loose and while the joystick is still functioning , it is starting to finally show glitches .
A friend who had the k750 i before me had the same problem – and it very quickly stopped working alltogether .
There ’s also the issue of SMS messages .
For those not in Ireland , you have to understand that SMS messaging in Ireland is enormous , it ’s almost as big as email and in large swathes of the market it ’s bigger than voice .
So when this phone , with 2 Gb of storage , tells me it ca n’t store more than a hundred or so 140 - character messages , I get irked .
I do n’t need them stored on the SIM card , I just need them stored .
Stick them on the memory card , I do n’t mind !
But there ’s no option to do that .
There ’s also no searching , no threading , etc , etc .
And there ’s the whole mobile broadband aspect as well .
After a year in dotMobi , it ’s plainly obvious that mobile broadband is inevitable , though the final devices probably wo n’t look like anything we have now .
Between convergence and new interface technologies and materials , not to mention changing fashions , what we have by the time that we get widespread mobile broadband wo n’t look like anything we have now , or are predicting now .
But until then , it ’d be nice to have access to what is there and that means a larger screen and a 3G phone .
I did have a 3G phone before the k750i , a Nokia 6680 , and I was quite happy with that as well .
Unfortunately , so was the git who smashed my car window and cycled off with it .
Plus , Meteor tell me I ’m due for an upgrade .
So why not ?
The way the economy is going , we ’re at the last hurrah right now , I might as well go into the dark ages with some fun toys …
So what phone ?
Well , my inital thought was the E70 because it was the same kind of form factor and I liked the fold - out keyboard which gave you both a numeric and a qwerty keyboard ( big hands are a major disadvantage with modern smartphones , and the e70 ’s keys looked nice and large ) .
But Meteor do n’t stock them and the off - the - shelf unsubsidised price is nearly €500 on eBay .
Too rich for my blood .
Why not the iPhone ?
Because it ’s a lousy phone .
I ’ve used the iPod Touch with Fring and a microphone for VOIP phone use , and I just ca n’t get used to the lack of a keypad , nor can I stand the – not to put too fine a point on it – oily gunky residue that builds up on the device when held in contact with your face during a phone call .
You ’re constantly having to buff the thing up when you use it , and I do n’t tend to be overly gentle with phones – a scratch on a normal phone is okay , a scratch on an iPhone is like a dent in a Ferrari .
Besides .
Seriously .
No cut and paste ?
I want to trade up , not sideways .
The Palm Pre looks like it has a lot of promise .
I think I ’ll hold off until someone who does n’t work for Palm is allowed actually hold one though …
Android … look , Google ’s certainly big in internet land , but they ’re not even a blip in telephony .
Seriously .
Nokia are n’t the 900 pound gorilla in the room , they ’re the planet the gorilla evolved on .
If Nokia has a bad day , the Finnish GDP has a bad day .
Android ’s nice PR .
It has one phone so far and the second to the market just pulled out .
If Android was a technological marvel , that ’d be one thing , but it ’s just another iPhone / Palm Pre / WinCE smartphone .
So stuff it .
The larger the userbase , the better the user experience , in general .
Blackberry ?
Well , the curve looks nice , and those who use it are great fans , but ( a ) all my email is done through IMAP and I mostly use the standard gmail interface anyway ; and ( b ) Meteor do n’t support it , you have to go to O2 to get one in Ireland .
Too much hassle .
So I ’m thinking N95 or E71 .
The N95 is nice , but , well , somewhat brick - shaped .
A small , stunted brick , yes , but nonetheless , mortar enough together and you ’d have … well , a very expensive and not very sturdy wall .
But you know what I mean .
Still though , the GPS is nifty .
How long can it take before we have geographical alarms as well as temporal ones ?
Seriously , have your phone go off when you walk past the bike shop to remind you to buy a new rear light , or have it go off when you ’re within a few miles of a friend you ’ve not seen in a while to remind you to drop by .
That sort of thing would be handy .
On top of which , handheld GPS in a country where folk tend to think hillwalking is harmless ( and also tend to die of exposure or have to call out mountain rescue rather a lot ) is a good thing .
So , what about the e71 ?
Well , it looks snazzy :
But at € 180 even when subsidised , I would n’t mind trying before buying … and it turns out , I can 😀
We ’re doing some development on the S60 platform at the moment and we have two e71s for testing , and only one in use .
So for the last few days I ’ve been trying it out .
Now , I have n’t spent much setup time here .
No nice themes , no fancy voice recognition , etc , etc .
And frankly , its integration with Linux is appallingly bad .
But it does have a lot of promise .
And I ’ve actually been able to compose a few short emails and posts on boards .
ie using it without having to break my fingers in fustration .
I ’m going to keep on using it for a few more days , but I ’m about 70 % sold on buying one at the moment , and that figure keeps rising .
It ’s solid .
Metal construction , but it ’s also light .
To be honest , I prefer a bit more heft in my hand , but it ’s nice that it wo n’t tear off your shirt pocket I suppose 😀
It does have a habit of turning in your trouser pocket and poking you in an awkward spot when you sit into the car , but then , it should n’t be in my pocket when I sit into the car , it should be sitting somewhere on the dash !
Its reception is at least as good as the k750 i ’s was , though it sadly is n’t any better .
Audio is a little worse , I have to admit , but it ’s exactly the same when you use a headset , and anytime I ’m in a noisy area , I ’m using a headset anyway .
It has a lot of storage ( up to 8 Gb ) which is often more useful than you ’d think ( storing files when you forget your USB key for example ) .
It ’s a damn pity they did n’t use the standard mini-USB connector , but I can live with that ( and the micro - USB may well catch on soon enough anyway ) .
The bluetooth works , the camera works ( though I miss the sliding protective cover , and as camera ’s go , it ’s a pretty good phone – but look , it only has to record whiteboards for me to be happy ) .
The keyboard is excellent ( it does take a bit of getting used to after a standard phone keyboard , but not too much ) , the threaded SMS ( through the Conversation App ) is neat , I must never let the “ read SMS messages out loud ” option on at any time :D , the way it says a contact ’s name when they call is darn nifty and useful ( far more so than custom ringtones , which are fun but a lot more work to set up ) .
The GPS is excellent , the wifi is darn useful at home , I love that it has a HSDPA modem you can use for the laptop ( although I already have a contract with 3 for that ) , and it even has IRDA as a fallback .
The standard web browser is fine , which is good because I ’ve not managed to successfully install Opera Mini yet .
Nor Facebook Mobile nor Twitter , but then I was just curious with those , I do n’t microblog .
And it has chess , so that ’s good too .
The menus are a bit unfamiliar ( not that Sony ’s were any better ) , and I ’ve not yet got all the shortcuts memorised yet , but what I ’ve seen so far is downright pleasant .
The battery is apparently some form of radionucleotide - based system .
It took five days of hard use to shut the phone down , using wifi and voice and data .
That ’s a lot more than the k750i , and that ’s a pleasant change – I ’m used to upgrades meaning less battery life .
The speaker ( I find it easier to listen to voice messages on speaker , at least when I ’m on my own ) is wonderfully loud and clear enough for me .
And apparently a lot of people like the phone too .
Another few days without bad surprises and I ’m going to wander up to Meteor during lunch and buy one .
FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - German utility RWE AG plans to build its first offshore wind farm , a 2.8 billion euro ( $ 4.03 billion ) project , one that adds it to the ranks of would - be operators off Germany ’s North Sea coast .
RWE ’s renewable energy arm , RWE Innogy , said in a statement on Friday it had acquired project company Enova Energieanlagen with a view to installing about 1,000 megawatts ( MW ) of wind power generation capacity 40 km north of the island of Juist .
The initial preparation work could start in 2010 , provided approval was obtained in 2009 , and first production could begin from 2011 , it said .
The plan would be completed in 2015 .
Chief Executive Juergen Grossmann called it “ the single largest renewable energy project that RWE has embarked on so far .
“ Especially in the finance crisis , RWE Innogy consciously aims at high - speed investment . ”
European utilities are expanding into renewables to complement thermal power capacities , which rely partly on imported fuels and contribute to carbon dioxide emissions , for which polluters must pay under EU climate protection targets .
Another incentive for renewables is subsidizing schemes under German legislation .
However , financing for new projects has dried up in the finance crisis .
Germany ’s world - leading wind industry so far has only operated onshore but has to look offshore as the potential for new onshore sites is limited .
Higher wind speeds out at sea and bigger turbines promise higher production , although getting permission for offshore wind parks is beset by red tape , a lack of long - term experience with the equipment ’s performance , and environmental concerns .
Coal - biased RWE , Europe ’s largest emitter of CO2 , started the new pan-European Innogy unit only in February , while some competitors are further down the road in the renewables sector .
RWE Innogy separately is pursuing offshore projects in several other European countries .

See capsule reports on journalists in jail as of December 1 , 2008
New York , December 4 , 2008 –Reflecting the rising influence of online reporting and commentary , more Internet journalists are jailed worldwide today than journalists working in any other medium .
In its annual census of imprisoned journalists , released today , the Committee to Protect Journalists found that 45 percent of all media workers jailed worldwide are bloggers , Web - based reporters , or online editors .
Online journalists represent the largest professional category for the first time in CPJ ’s prison census .

In its annual census of imprisoned journalists , released today , the Committee to Protect Journalists found that 45 percent of all media workers jailed worldwide are bloggers , Web - based reporters , or online editors .
Online journalists represent the largest professional category for the first time in CPJ ’s prison census .
Abdel Karim Suleiman , an Egyptian blogger , is one of 56 online journalists jailed worldwide .
( Reuters )
CPJ ’s survey found 125 journalists in all behind bars on December 1 , a decrease of two from the 2007 tally .
( Read detailed accounts of each imprisoned journalist . )
China continued to be world ’s worst jailer of journalists , a dishonor it has held for 10 consecutive years .
Cuba , Burma , Eritrea , and Uzbekistan round out the top five jailers from among the 29 nations that imprison journalists .
Each of the top five nations has persistently placed among the world ’s worst in detaining journalists .
At least 56 online journalists are jailed worldwide , according to CPJ ’s census , a tally that surpasses the number of print journalists for the first time .
The number of imprisoned online journalists has steadily increased since CPJ recorded the first jailed Internet writer in its 1997 census .
Print reporters , editors , and photographers make up the next largest professional category , with 53 cases in 2008 .
Television and radio journalists and documentary filmmakers constitute the rest .
“ Online journalism has changed the media landscape and the way we communicate with each other , ” said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon .
“ But the power and influence of this new generation of online journalists has captured the attention of repressive governments around the world , and they have accelerated their counterattack . ”
In October , CPJ joined with Internet companies , investors , and human rights groups to combat government repression of online expression .
After two years of negotiations , this diverse group announced the creation of the Global Network Initiative , which establishes guidelines enabling Internet and telecommunications companies to protect free expression and privacy online .
Yahoo , Google , and Microsoft have joined the initiative .
Illustrating the evolving media landscape , the increase in online - related jailings has been accompanied by a rise in imprisonments of freelance journalists .
Forty - five of the journalists on CPJ ’s census are freelancers ; most of them work online .
These freelancers are not employees of media companies and often do not have the legal resources or political connections that might help them gain their freedom .
The number of imprisoned freelancers has risen more than 40 percent in the last two years , according to CPJ research .
“ The image of the solitary blogger working at home in pajamas may be appealing , but when the knock comes on the door they are alone and vulnerable , ” said CPJ ’s Simon .
“ All of us must stand up for their rights –from Internet companies to journalists and press freedom groups .
The future of journalism is online and we are now in a battle with the enemies of press freedom who are using imprisonment to define the limits of public discourse . ”
Imprisonments by Media
Antistate allegations such as subversion , divulging state secrets , and acting against national interests are the most common charge used to imprison journalists worldwide , CPJ found .
About 59 percent of journalists in the census are jailed under these charges , many of them by the Chinese and Cuban governments .
About 13 percent of jailed journalists face no formal charge at all .
The tactic is used by countries as diverse as Eritrea , Israel , Iran , the United States , and Uzbekistan , where journalists are being held in open - ended detentions without due process .
At least 16 journalists worldwide are being held in secret locations .
Among them is Gambian journalist “ Chief ” Ebrima Manneh , whose whereabouts , legal status , and health have been kept secret since his arrest in July 2006 .
From the U.S. Senate to the West African human rights court , international observers have called on authorities to free Manneh , who was jailed for trying to publish a critical report about Gambian President Yahya Jammeh .
Nowhere is the ascendance of Internet journalism more evident than in China , where 24 of 28 jailed journalists worked online .
China ’s prison list includes
Hu Jia , a prominent human rights activist and blogger , who is serving a prison term of three and a half years for online commentaries and media interviews in which he criticized the Communist Party .
He was convicted of “ incitement to subvert state power , ” a charge commonly used by authorities in China to jail critical writers .
At least 22 journalists are jailed in China on this and other vague antistate charges .
Cuba , the world ’s second worst jailer , released two imprisoned journalists during the year after negotiations with Spain .
Madrid , which resumed cooperative programs with Cuba in February , has sought the release of imprisoned writers and dissidents in talks with Havana .
But Cuba continued to hold 21 writers and editors in prison as of December 1 , all but one of them swept up in Fidel Castro ’s massive 2003 crackdown on the independent press .
In November , CPJ honored Héctor Maseda Gutiérrez , who at 65 is the oldest of those jailed in Cuba , with an International Press Freedom Award .
Burma , the third worst jailer , is holding 14 journalists .
Five were arrested while trying to spread news and images from areas devastated by Cyclone Nargis .
The blogger and comedian Maung Thura , who uses the professional name Zarganar , was sentenced to a total of 59 years in prison during closed proceedings in November .
Authorities accused Maung Thura of illegally disseminating video footage of relief efforts in hard - hit areas , communicating with exiled dissidents , and causing public alarm in comments to foreign media .
Eritrea , with 13 journalists in prison , is the fourth worst jailer .
Eritrean authorities have refused to disclose the whereabouts , legal status , or health of any of the journalists they have imprisoned .
Unconfirmed online reports have said that three of the jailed journalists may have died in custody , but the government has refused to even say whether the detainees are alive or dead .
Uzbekistan , with six journalists detained , is the fifth worst jailer .
Those in custody include Dzhamshid Karimov , nephew of the country ’s president .
A reporter for independent news Web sites , Karimov has been forcibly held in a psychiatric hospital since 2006 .
Here are other trends and details that emerged in CPJ ’s analysis :
In about 11 percent of cases , governments have used a variety of charges unrelated to journalism to retaliate against critical writers , editors , and photojournalists .
Such charges range from regulatory violations to drug possession .
In the cases included in this census , CPJ has determined that the charges were most likely lodged in reprisal for the journalist ’s work .
Violations of censorship rules , the next most common charge , are applied in about 10 percent of cases .
Criminal defamation charges are filed in about 7 percent of cases , while charges of ethnic or religious insult are lodged in another 4 percent .
Two journalists are jailed for filing what authorities consider to be “ false ” news .
( More than one type of charge may apply in individual cases .
Print and Internet journalists make up the bulk of the census .
Television journalists compose the next largest professional category , accounting for 6 percent of cases .
Radio journalists account for 4 percent , and documentary filmmakers 3 percent .
The 2008 tally reflects the second consecutive decline in the total number of jailed journalists .
That said , the 2008 figure is roughly consistent with census results in each year since 2000 .
CPJ research shows that imprisonments rose significantly in 2001 , after governments imposed sweeping national security laws in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States .
Imprisonments stood at 81 in 2000 but have since averaged 128 in CPJ ’s annual surveys .
The United States , which is holding photographer Ibrahim Jassam without charge in Iraq , has made CPJ ’s list of countries jailing journalists for the fifth consecutive year .
During this period , U.S. military authorities have jailed dozens of journalists in Iraq–some for days , others for months at a time –without charge or due process .
No charges have ever been substantiated in these cases .
CPJ does not apply a rigid definition of online journalism , but it carefully evaluates the work of bloggers and online writers to determine whether the content is journalistic in nature .
In general , CPJ looks to see whether the content is reportorial or fact - based commentary .
In a repressive society where the traditional media is restricted , CPJ takes an inclusive approach to work that is produced online .
The organization believes that journalists should not be imprisoned for doing their jobs .
CPJ has sent letters expressing its serious concerns to each country that has imprisoned a journalist .
Number of Journalists in Prison Each Year since 1998
CPJ ’s list is a snapshot of those incarcerated at midnight on December 1 , 2008 .
It does not include the many journalists imprisoned and released throughout the year ; accounts of those cases can be found at www.cpj.org.
Journalists remain on CPJ ’s list until the organization determines with reasonable certainty that they have been released or have died in custody .
Journalists who either disappear or are abducted by nonstate entities , including criminal gangs , rebels , or militant groups , are not included on the imprisoned list .
Their cases are classified as “ missing ” or “ abducted . ”
But with every new and potentially revolutionary technology comes great responsibility ( and a host of moral dilemmas that protesters and media spinsters are just waiting to sink their teeth into . )
With the ability to alter the flow of time , even on an atomic level , we will be forced to consider the implications of most , if not all of our actions .
Does pushing an atom back in time half a second interrupt the original process of doing so , therefore proving to the scientist that it can't be done , simply because every time he has attempted it , it has failed ( and for the same reason ? )
Does randomly pushing atoms out of phase with reality constitute a risk to our past , or are we safeguarded against the potentially serious danger of temporal contamination until we start working with , say , objects that can actually be seen with the naked eye ?
With future improvements , making trips to the past or the future as easy as a trip to another country , what kind of guidelines will need to be put in place ?
We can't just let whole herds of tourists ( complete with a spouse , two kids , a camera , and a dog ! ) swarm unchecked into 14th century Europe , snapping pictures of the peasants and royalty alike , buying up everything within reach at the marketplace , or teaching the locals tricks , modern slang terms , and dirty limericks !
And what about bringing people back to ‘ our ' present ?
Is it okay to bring someone from the future to the present day and wrong to bring someone from the past foward , or vice versa ?
Will there be laws against both ?
What about the risk of exposure to diseases long since wiped out ?
Will the advent of Time Travel ( in the classic sense ) mean a sudden epidemic of smallpox , polio , and tuberculosis ?
Even with laws and a resurgence in vaccines , what 's to stop a person infected with a disease from the present or future to accidently cause a devastating epidemic in say , the 12th century B.C. ?
These and a thousand more questions , at one time raised only by writers and filmmakers , will doubtless be on the minds of lawmakers and concerned citizens the world over as soon as this technology becomes viable .
And so we come back to our original question : is Time really something we can manipulate ?
Can it be harnessed and bent to our will , allowing us to access alternate realities , dimensions , and universes , to make instantaneous transportation from point A to point B a reality or create the ultimate tool in the future of espionage ?
Not with our current technology , ( and our understanding of physics could probably use a little work too ! ) but who knows - with Quantum Physics gaining support and being acknowledged as a different , yet very accurate way of looking at the structure and as - yet mysterious workings of the universe , who knows what the future will bring !
Once , humans were convinced that not only was the world flat , but that the sun revolved around the earth , and mankind would never manage to break the sound barrier but , in each of these cases , we know otherwise now .
Who knows , maybe someday humans will look back and laugh at how backward we were , wondering at how we could live such primitive , slow , and boring lives in the years before mankind " woke up " and discovered just how to harness the power of time .

( Adds political reaction and rates poll )
OTTAWA , Dec 5 ( Reuters ) - Canadian employers cut 70,600 jobs in November , the most in any month since June 1982 , fueling expectations of a big interest rate cut next week and likely adding spark to the parliamentary crisis in Ottawa .
Statistics Canada said on Friday the biggest job losses were in Ontario , the country ’s manufacturing heartland and home to its auto industry , where the U.S. economic downturn has forced layoffs .
“ The great reckoning for Canadian workers begins , ” said Sal Guatieri , senior economist at BMO Capital Markets .
The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.3 percent from 6.2 percent in October .
Markets had forecast 25,000 job losses in November and a jobless rate of 6.4 percent .
The news , followed by equally dismal U.S. jobs data , drove the Canadian dollar lower and prompted a renewed promise of more fiscal stimulus by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty .
Flaherty said the report was evidence the economy faced “ enormous challenges . ”
“ More needs to be done and we will take further measures to stimulate the economy , ” he said .
The currency CAD= slipped to C$ 1.2924 to the U.S. dollar , or 77.38 U.S. cents , from C$ 1.2826 previously .
The shakedown of global labor markets had not arrived on Canada ’s doorstep in full force until now , with a net gain of 133,000 jobs in the first 11 months of the year compared with almost 2 million shed in the United States .
U.S. employers axed payrolls by 533,000 in November for the weakest performance in 34 years .
The Canadian numbers will worsen too in coming months , analysts said .
“ Unfortunately , I think this is the start of a wave of job losses in Canada , ” Guatieri said .
The bad news came the morning after Prime Minister Stephen Harper suspended Parliament until late January to defuse an opposition revolt over his handling of the economic crisis .
The three opposition parties have joined forces and vowed to replace Harper ’s minority Conservative government as soon as possible .
They accuse him of partisan jabs aimed at hurting the center - left parties in Parliament at a time when they say he should be working with them to deliver a quick stimulus package and auto sector bailout to soften the impact of a recession .
The opposition Liberals cited the job losses as reason for Harper to reconvene Parliament and draft an emergency aid plan that would cross partisan lines .
“ A ‘ lockout ’ is the last thing Canada needs .
Cooperation among parliamentarians , and action is what Canadians expect and deserve , ” said Liberal legislator Scott Brison .
RATE CUTS
The soft labor market heightened expectations that the Bank of Canada will cut its key overnight lending rate next Tuesday by at least 50 basis points to 1.75 percent .
“ Obviously , the weakness in the employment report will probably put a little bit more pressure on the bank in terms of expected rate cuts next week , ” said George Davis , chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
Eleven of Canada ’s 12 primary securities dealers , surveyed by Reuters on Friday , expected the bank to cut its key rate by 50 basis points and one expected a 75 basis point cut .
The central bank has reduced its key overnight lending rate by 225 basis points since December 2007 to 2.25 percent , compared with the U.S. comparable rate of 1 percent , and has signaled its intention to ease further .
But the severity of the November Canadian data , the weakest in 26 years following three straight months of surprisingly resilient job numbers , likely reflects the start of a recession in the fourth quarter , as widely expected .
The province of Ontario suffered the steepest decline and its unemployment rate jumped to 7.1 percent .
Factory job losses in Ontario totaled 42,000 while the net employment drop in the sector nationwide was 38,000 .
Hourly wages of permanent employees rose 4.7 percent in November from a year earlier , up from 4.2 percent in October .

Women should go for the broccoli when the relish tray comes around during holiday celebrations this season .
While it has been known for some time that eating cruciferous vegetables , such as broccoli , cauliflower , and cabbage , can help prevent breast cancer , the mechanism by which the active substances in these vegetables inhibit cell proliferation was unknown — until now .
Scientists in the UC Santa Barbara laboratories of Leslie Wilson , professor of biochemistry and pharmacology , and Mary Ann Jordan , adjunct professor in the Department of Molecular , Cellular , and Developmental Biology , have shown how the healing power of these vegetables works at the cellular level .
Their research is published in this month 's journal Carcinogenesis .
" Breast cancer , the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women , can be protected against by eating cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and near relatives of cabbage such as broccoli and cauliflower , " said first author Olga Azarenko , who is a graduate student at UCSB .
" These vegetables contain compounds called isothiocyanates which we believe to be responsible for the cancer - preventive and anti-carcinogenic activities in these vegetables .
Broccoli and broccoli sprouts have the highest amount of the isothiocyanates .
" Our paper focuses on the anti-cancer activity of one of these compounds , called sulforaphane , or SFN , " Azarenko added .
" It has already been shown to reduce the incidence and rate of chemically induced mammary tumors in animals .
It inhibits the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells , leading to cell death .
" Azarenko made the surprising discovery that SFN inhibits the proliferation of human tumor cells by a mechanism similar to the way that the anticancer drugs taxol and vincristine inhibit cell division during mitosis .
Mitosis is the process in which the duplicated DNA in the form of chromosomes is accurately distributed to the two daughter cells when a cell divides .
Hundreds of tiny tube - like structures , called microtubules , make up the machinery that cells use to separate the chromosomes .
SFN , like the more powerful anticancer agents , interferes with microtubule functioning during mitosis in a similar manner to the more powerful anticancer drugs .
However SFN is much weaker than these other plant - based drugs , and thus much less toxic .
" SFN may be an effective cancer preventive agent because it inhibits the proliferation and kills precancerous cells , " said Wilson .
It is also possible that it could be used as an addition to taxol and other similar drugs to increase effective killing of tumor cells without increased toxicity .
" " I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is Mass Psychology ...
It 's importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda ...
Although this science will be diligently studied , it will be rigidly confined to the governing class .
The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated . "

Risk aversion has been suspended , as higher yielding currencies advance overnight .
European policy makers are touting a recession , will their rate cuts be swifter and deeper this week ?
Global optimism waits for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnewÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ US president to be anointed tomorrow , while Capital markets reluctantly wait for the dreaded NFP this Friday .
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 10 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Have consumers thrown in the towel ?
On Friday , US data affirmed how negative consumerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s actions are becoming .
Consumer spending took another dive in Sept. , and the purchasing managers ’ survey showed the biggest deterioration in 40 years .
New historic records are been made and broken each week .
Personal income rose mildly for the month ( +0.2 % ) , but spending dropped - 0.3 % as the consumer saved more to offset increased layoff fears and financial market uncertainty .
Consumers saved rather than consume , as illustrated by the increase in the savings rate to +1.3 % ( a positive development for the future , just not now ) .
On the other hand , consumer prices accelerated slightly but analysts expect it to ease over the coming months .
Personal income only rose +0.2 % vs. +0.4 % in Aug. , as wages and salary gains have moderated in the current deteriorating economic environment .
The theme of save , save , save , rather than consume will dominate for a long period .
On the inflation front , the headline PCE rose +0.1 % , keeping the y/y rate at +4.5 % ( partly due to the effects of Hurricane Ike ) .
While core - PCE ( the Fed ’s preferred measure ) rose +0.2 % , keeping the core anchored at +2.5 % , y/y .
Analysts do not expect inflation to be an issue for a year at least .
Job losses , higher food and fuel costs , combined with falling property values has brought an end to the longest expansion in Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœUS spending on recordÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and tomorrows Presidential election will be won on themes of change and hope , not just economics .
The collapse in lending and sentiment last month has seen the consumer hunker down and retreat .
Obama a favorite by polls ( for the longest 2 - year job interview ) will provide some global optimism .
But , how much of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgoodÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ news has been priced in the USD and equities already ?
The US$ currently is lower against the EUR +0.67 % , GBP +0.75 % and higher against CHF - 0.04 % and JPY - 0.65 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD + 1.18 % and AUD + 1.75 % .
Interest rate differentials , global equities and commodities propelled the loonie to its biggest gain last week in 4 - decades , but , the month saw the currency posted its worst monthly performance in 6 - decades as commodities slumped .
Canadian fundamentals remain weak .
On Friday , the looniesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range had been manipulated by year end and month end squeezes from both the long and short perspective .
The Canadian GDP could have been worse , but there ’s little comfort in the details , a decline for Aug .
Real - GDP fell - 0.3 % , year - to - date four out of eight months have posted lower figures , one was flat , and only three months were up .
Analysts expect the downside risks to give way to a broader weakness next year .
Digging deeper , one noticed a number of sectors retreated on a price - adjusted volume of activity basis ( mining and energy , construction and manufacturing etc. ) .
While the public sector , with accommodation and food services contributed to growth .
Market reaction has so far been fairly mild , given that the figures were generally as - expected .
The theme of last week , too far , too fast was definitely a concern , traders continue to see better levels to own the currency despite the strength of the one directional play .
Now that the Fed eased 50 bp , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s anticipated that the BOC will need to extend interest - rate cuts ( 2.25 % ) in the face of slowing economic growth .
Expect the employment data to be the highlight of the week .
In recessionary times higher yielding commodity assets suffer and the AUD $ is no exception .
But , in the O/N session the currency advanced as the Australian bourse advanced on anticipation interest - rate cuts worldwide will bolster global economic growth ( 0.6778 ) .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a busy week for rate announcements , but , expect momentum to remain in tact .
Crude is lower O/N ( $ 66.92 down - 89 c ) .
Month end and year end gyrations managed to push oil higher just before the close on Friday .
Traders scrambled to unwind positions on the final day of transactions for the Nov. gas and heating - oil contracts .
The move was not about fundamentals or erosion of demand .
Oil has fallen 33 % last month ( a record monthly decline ) , on signs that the economic slowdown in the US and Europe will spread to emerging markets and curb fuel consumption even further .
The commodity continues to trade close to its 17 - month low print achieved at the beginning of the week .
Fundamental data combined with the recent greenback strength has investors selling oil contracts on rallies .
Expect investors to concentrate on Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdemand destructionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ after last weeks US GDP numbers .
Rate cuts last week by the three biggest oil users , the US , China and Japan , has failed to inspire confidence that a recession can be avoided .
The threat of global equities advancing and OPEC potentially wanting to meet again before Dec. has only been able to provide temporary support .
OPEC indicated that they may call a new meeting if prices fail to react to the - 1.5 m barrel - a - day output cut it announced last month .
Growth fears continue to outweigh any cut in production .
OPEC still produces over 40 % of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil , but there are doubts that they can cut much more , the members also need cash , just like most economies do .
So do not be surprised to see some members Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnotÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ adhere to future cut quotas .
The EIA last week showed that US inventories of crude oil and distillate fuel rose .
Crude oil stocks climbed +493 k barrels to +311.9 m barrels w/w vs. a + 1.55 m barrel gain .
Distillate inventories rose + 2.33 m barrels to 126.6 m barrels vs. an increase of +1.05 m barrels .
While gas stockpiles dropped - 1.51 m barrels to +195 m , ( 1st decline in 5 - weeks ) .
Overall a bullish report as inventories rose less than anticipated .
But , sluggish demand continues to be the catalyst for rising inventories .
Gold fell the most in a week last week as the greenback climbed vs. the EUR on signs that reductions in borrowing costs in Europe will lag behind the US .
In the O/N session , the big dollar has given up some ground and by default investors have found favor with the yellow metal .
The Nikkei closed 8,576 down - 452 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,053 up +67 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,407 up +30 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields backed up 3 bp on Friday ( 3.96 % ) and are little changed O/N .
After the Fed easing last week , the short end of the yield curve had the largest monthly climb since Feb .
A contracting economy and stumbling equities has managed to push investors towards the safety of the FI asset class despite an unprecedented amount of US debt being issued .
The main focus this week will be interest rate decision announcements by both the ECB and BOE .
The globe will be focusing on the US elections on Tuesday and employment data on Friday .
A new month letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s see what ammunition investors have left .

Measuring and rewarding individuals
At the SOL conference some time ago I attended the workshop by the brain researcher Kiti Muller and happened to mention how harmful measuring and rewarding individuals is .
It rose huge interest , so here you have the reference – Robert D Austin : “ Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations , Dorset House , 1996 .
Just to brief some points of the book :
Measuring and rewarding individual performance , especially a knowledge worker , is always distorting the performance , and is potentially dysfunctional .
Dr Austin acknowledges , that measuring organization is essential , and gives advice for constructive measurement too .
Unfortunately it is difficult .
Here a brief of one critical flaw in rewarding based on individual performance :
To create value the knowledge worker does A , B and C .
His / her knowledge of the detail enables balancing these .
The manager is able to :
know and measure A
know B
do n’t even know C
C is truly significant .
There are a zillion small real decisions , that gradually make reality .
With all good intentions the manager measures only A .
He might understand that this is only an indicator .
Result :
People game .
Even some that do n’t game in the beginning , gradually will .
A will get done in excess , even to dysfunctional extent .
There are zillions of cases , even extreme .
Like measuring volume of sales instead of profit .
Just imagine the result .
The working relation narrows from co-operation to trading , degrading commitment .
This kind of power setting suggests , that the manager knows better , and the knowledge worker should NOT use judgement .
Subtle , but very powerful and harmful , reinforcing the command and control culture .
Measuring is necessary , complex and dangerous .
In principle , rewarding teams and organizations based on throughput time , customer loyalty and business is healthier .
Mary Poppendieck has some advice in her books and webpage .

Rock duo sings tribute to Fox 's ' token liberal ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Fox News recently announced that its token liberal Alan Colmes will be quitting Hannity & Colmes at the end of the year , after twelve years playing the foil to the far more aggressive Sean Hannity .
Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart professed to be broken up over the news , saying , " It has been no easy task being the sole liberal voice on the Fox Network .
But through all the tough times , Alan Colmes always had one thing to lean on -- the respect he earned from his colleagues . "
Stewart played a clip of Karl Rove telling Colmes , " Please , you 're just embarrassing yourself , " followed by other Fox figures insulting , belittling , or merely pestering the hapless Colmes .
Stewart then brought on legendary rock duo Hall & Oates to perform a musical tribute to Colmes , to the tune of their 1976 hit , " She 's Gone . "
Anytime you need a token liberal
Nothin ' but a body to fill a chair
The barest shadow of a person
Alan Colmes is always there .
All those years of non-existence
Can really , really run a person down .
Now he 's leaving Hannity forever
Alan , please do n't go !
You 're the only non-douchebag on that show .
By Friday morning , Colmes himself had posted a clip of the performance on his blog , under the heading , " Hall and Oates Reunite On My Behalf , And , Uh , Thanks ? "

A dispute over the naming of a new southern California high school provides a glimpse of the country ’s ethnic future .
During a February 2008 hostage standoff , Los Angeles police officer Randal Simmons was slain by a gunman as Simmons tried to protect the gunman ’s family members ( three of whom the gunman had already killed ) .
During off hours , Simmons , a 27 - year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a member of its elite SWAT unit , had mentored teens in Carson , a hardscrabble industrial suburb south of Los Angeles .
As a minister in the Glory Christian Fellowship , Simmons tried to keep Carson ’s youth away from the city ’s thriving gang life .
This fall , the Carson City Council voted to name a new high school after Simmons in recognition of his service to the community .
Since then , however , Latino residents of Carson have pushed to rescind the vote and to name the new school after César Chávez , the farmworker organizer .
“ I ’m very upset , ” resident Miriam Vasquez told the Los Angeles Daily Breeze .
“ This is a Latino area .
It should be named after Cesar Chavez . ”
Simmons was black , but opponents of the Simmons resolution insist that race has nothing to do with their position .
Rather , they protest that the community was not consulted and that members of Simmons ’s church had railroaded the recommendation through the council .
Without presuming to pass judgment on Cesar Chávez ’s merits , one can’t help observing that he would have had more relevance to Carson if he had organized oil refinery workers rather than field hands .
Simmons , by contrast , worked directly to help Carson parents — many of them Latino — raise law - abiding children .
And the Los Angeles Unified School District , which built and will run the new high school , already has a school named after Chávez .
But Latinos are now the majority in Carson , as in many California cities and suburbs , and they are playing ethnic politics as vigorously as any group before them .
( Dallas is likewise embroiled in a dispute over whether to name a major thoroughfare in a riverfront development project after César Chávez . )
For now , the name of Carson ’s new school rests with the Los Angeles school district .
In the long run , however , the country ’s immigration flows will play a large part in determining who its heroes are .
OAKLAND , Calif .
–In the early hours of New Year 's day , Eric Rivera stood in a train at a subway station , watching with horror as a transit police officer on the platform shot an unarmed man .
What Rivera can only speculate about is whether the officer intended to use his Taser instead of his .40 - calibre handgun .
" What I do n't know is whether that officer drew the wrong weapon , " said Rivera , who was riding the Bay Area Rapid Transit ( BART ) train on New Year 's ay and was on a train that had stopped in the Fruitvale station at the time Oscar Grant , 22 , was fatally shot .
For days , cellphone and camera videos filmed by passersby have been circulating on television and the Internet .
They show transit police officer , Johannes Mehserle , 27 , straddling Grant from behind , pulling out his weapon and shooting Grant in the back .
Yet another video surfaced yesterday , a digitally superior version of the event , that shows Mehserle clearly looking stunned seconds after the shooting , as if just realizing what 's happened .
The shooting has incited widespread anger toward the police in a city where there has been a long and an uneasy relationship between police and residents .
The fury erupted Wednesday night as protestors stampeded through the city burning cars and smashing storefronts .
Police clad in riot gear responded with tear gas and batons , arresting up to 120 people .
" I 'm not paranoid but frankly I do n't trust the cops , " said Camari Williams , 20 , who had known Grant since he was 9 years old .
" I do n't know anyone in my circle of friends and family who trust the cops .
It 's that bad .
You mention the cops and everyone has a story . "
In his last moments of life , Grant , the father of a 4 - year - old daughter , struggled against being handcuffed and asked several times for police not to shoot .
After amateur videos showing Grant 's shooting began to circulate , Mehserle and his family were forced into hiding .
They have received death threats and the city has been rent by violent protests .
Grant 's family is suing BART for $ 25 million .
John Burris , the lawyer representing the family , said if the officer did not have a Taser , the shooting was intentional and the officer should be charged with second - degree murder .
However , " if he thought he was reaching for a Taser and pulled a gun , that 's negligent .
That would be involuntary manslaughter , a negligent homicide , " Burris said .
BART police officers began carrying the Taser in early December .
Burris told reporters there was nothing on the video to suggest the officer was reaching for anything other than his handgun .
" They keep those Tasers on the opposite side of their gun hand , or in the middle , pointed the opposite direction so you have to turn your hand to get it . "
Police trainer Dave Smith said there are clues in the video that Mehserle could have mistaken a Taser for his handgun .
Describing the transit officer 's movements , Smith notes : " He 's in non-traditional firing stance .
His feet are n't squared , he 's off - balance .
He shot him exactly where he would have shot if it was a Taser .
If I train you in one skill that involves thousands of repetitions , it 's going to be a habit . "
Smith suggests Mehserle , who was not used to a Taser , reached automatically for his handgun through force of habit .

Although the two weapons feel different , the mistake is not uncommon .
On Wednesday night , hours after it became public that Mehserle , a two - year veteran of the force and the father of a week - old baby girl , had resigned , emotions boiled over in the downtown riots .
Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums went out that night to calm residents , reminding them that only a few weeks ago they were celebrating the election of Barack Obama .
" Do n't let these few weeks ... rip that hope from your chest , " he said .
" Stay hopeful and we can not be victims . "
The next night , Oakland police were out in full riot gear breaking up small groups that gathered in the city 's downtown .
The victim 's mother , Wanda Johnson , pleaded for calm .
" Oscar would not want to see the violence and the fires , " she said .
" I 'm asking you please , please stop it and let justice prevail . "
Keith Snodgrass , who rides the train daily from the Fruitvale station to his job in San Francisco , said he believes the protests are helping residents deal with long - standing frustrations .
Dressed in a suit jacket and lace - up shoes with a fedora , the clean - shaven Snodgrass said no matter how well he is dressed , he has been pulled over by police near the train station many times and questioned even though he 's done nothing to draw attention to himself .
" There is an inner-city cop mentality that it 's us against them .
People of colour get harassed , get searched , more than white people , " said Snodgrass , a union representative for the city of San Francisco .
" It 's like a volcano and there 's an active community here who is getting the idea that they have to heat up in order to get changes . "

The Sichuan quake was one of several disasters to strike Asia in 2008
The past year has been one of the most devastating ever in terms of natural disasters , one of the world 's biggest re-insurance companies has said .
Munich
Re said the impact of the disasters was greater than in 2007 in both human and economic terms .
The company suggested climate change was boosting the destructive power of disasters like hurricanes and flooding .
It has called for stricter curbs on emissions to prevent further uncontrollable weather scenarios .
Although there were fewer " loss - producing events " in 2008 than in the previous year , the impact of natural disasters was higher , said Munich Re in its annual assessment .
More than 220,000 people died in events like cyclones , earthquakes and flooding , the most since 2004 , the year of the Asian tsunami .
Meanwhile , overall global losses totalled about $ 200 bn ( £ 137bn ) , with uninsured losses totalling $ 45bn , about 50 % more than in 2007 .
Climate change has already started and is very probably contributing to increasingly frequent weather extremes and ensuing natural catastrophes
Torsten Jeworrek
Munich Re
This makes 2008 the third most expensive year on record , after 1995 , when the Kobe earthquake struck Japan , and 2005 , the year of Hurricane Katrina in the US .
Torsten Jeworrek of Munich
Re said the pattern continued a long - term trend already observed .
" Climate change has already started and is very probably contributing to increasingly frequent weather extremes and ensuing natural catastrophes , " he said .
Uninsured Asia was the continent worst hit by natural disasters in 2008 , Munich Re reported .
The year saw five major hurricanes in the North Atlantic Cyclone Nargis in Burma killed an estimated 130,000 people and devastated much of the low - lying Irrawaddy Delta region , while the earthquake which struck China 's Sichuan province in May left an estimated 70,000 dead and millions homeless .
Munich
Re said the losses of $ 85 bn made Sichuan the second most expensive earthquake after Kobe .
Although Nargis and the Sichuan quake brought the biggest cost in terms of human lives , the economic losses were mostly uninsured .
The most expensive single event in 2008 was Hurricane Ike , which brought $ 30 bn in losses .
It was one of five major hurricanes in the North Atlantic over the year , which saw a total of 16 tropical storms .
In addition , roughly 1,700 tornadoes across the US caused several billion dollars of damage , as did periods of low pressure weather activity in Europe .
If we delay too long , it will be very costly for future generations
Mr Jeworrek Munich Re quoted World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) figures showing that 2008 was the 10th warmest year since reliable records began , meaning that the 10 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 12 years .
" It is now very probable that the progressive warming of the atmosphere is due to the greenhouse gases emitted by human activity , " said Prof Peter Hoppe , head of Munich Re's Geo Risks Research .
" The logic is clear : when temperatures increase there is more evaporation and the atmosphere has a greater capacity to absorb water vapour , with the result that its energy content is higher .
" The weather machine runs into top gear , bringing more intense severe weather events with corresponding effects in terms of losses . "
The company said world leaders must put in place " effective and binding rules on CO2 emissions " to curb climate change and ensure that " future generations do not have to live with weather scenarios that are difficult to control " .
" If we delay too long , it will be very costly for future generations , " said Mr Jeworrek .

Well , I do n't need to go into the history as you 've all seen the video , but five months ago a project that had been brewing in my mind for a while started taking form and now I 'm thrilled to announce the first official release of Pinax .
Thanks to Brian Rosner , Greg Newman , Jannis Leidel and Eric Florenzano — the core team — as well as the authors of additional third party apps we used and people who provided translations , bug reports , etc .
There 'll hopefully be a number of big Pinax news items here over the next couple of months , but for now , you can join in the fun and download 0.5.0 from the Pinax Download Page .
CAIRO , Jan. 26 ( UPI ) --
Israel is willing to open Gaza border crossings and free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for a kidnapped soldier , Egyptian media reported .
A report carried Monday in the Egyptian newspaper al - Ahram quoted Hamas negotiator Ayman Taha as saying Israel has offered the concessions in exchange for the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit , The Jerusalum Post said .

Al - Ahram said Taha made the remarks after Palestinian negotiators met with Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman in Cairo Monday .
The Post quoted unnamed Israeli defense officials as telling it Sunday that Jerusalem was indeed considering linking the opening of the Gaza crossings with negotiations for Schalit 's release .
" The ( 22 - day Israeli military assault in Gaza ) has created new understandings between us and Hamas , " the official said .
" Hamas knows that if it renews attacks , we will not be restrained . "
Many NGOs come forward with a healing touch
Another diamond worker committed suicide on Monday .
Around nine cases of deaths have already been registered in the last fifteen days from this labour intensive industry .
So grave is the situation that the NGOs , which were earlier working for HIV / AIDS affected people , have now shifted their focus on counselling the diamond workers on livelihood .
The NGOs maintain that labourers , at present , are worried about their livelihood and are not bothered about health issues .
The NGOs are counselling them , calling them to the Surat Civil Hospital , as well as referring them to doctors so that their suicidal tendencies can be curbed .
For instance , the Sarvangi Vikas Trust , which works for people with HIV / AIDS , has taken up counselling in Katargam , Varachha , Kapodara , Mahidharpura , and Puna gam to provide them " moral support " to fight these turbulent times .
" At this time they are not ready to listen to any health issues , " said Dinesh , a Consultant with the National Aids Control Organisation ( NACO ) .
Navnirman
Trust has been working on HIV / AIDS issues .
But now , they are working on the livelihood issues of diamond workers .
" We counsel them to take up alternative jobs in textile companies , " said Ajaysinh Rajput , president of the trust .
Ekta Yuvak Mandal , another NGO , is also helping the diamond workers .
The diamond industry provides employment to over 10 lakh people in Gujarat .
Owing to the global economic slump , the industry is facing a severe crisis .
It is yet to come out of the extended vacation and the fear of large - scale retrenchment looms large .
Psychologists opine that age , lack of education and lifestyle are some of the reasons inciting the workers to take the extreme step .
" The average age of diamond cutters and polishers is between 15 and 30 years .
Most of them are school dropouts and have no other skills , " said Gaurang Jani , a social psychologist and professor in Gujarat University .

Peak Oil Peak Oil , Falling Oil Prices , and the Global Economic Crisis By Ryan McGreal
Published December 20 , 2008
In a comment yesterday , a regular RTH reader pointed out that we have n't written much about peak oil since oil prices have been falling .
I have been planning to write about this for some time , but a seemingly unending cascade of big news items keeps diverting my attention , including local political events ( our principal mandate at RTH ) , the spiraling economic crisis , and harrowing federal politics .
However , the criticism is valid .
Aside from an update in August , we have n't really covered oil prices .
What are we to make of Peak Oil theory with oil trading below $ 40 per barrel ?
One commenter asked why oil prices were historically low during the 1990s , a period of rapid economic growth , including growth in the sales of fuel - inefficient SUVs and rapid growth in China .
1990s : Strong Growth , Low Prices
There are a few reasons for the comparatively low oil prices of the mid-1990s , but the main reason is that the conventional oil producers still had room to grow their rates of production , i.e. how much oil they could produce within a given time period , or how quickly they could get the oil to market .
Daily oil production was considerably lower in the 1990s .
For conventional crude only ( excluding non-conventional oil ) , daily production increased from about 60 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) in 1990 to a plateau of about 73 mbpd that started in 2004 and has continued ever since .
When " swing producer " countries like Saudi Arabia could still ramp production by an additional 2 mbpd on short notice , confidence remained high among oil traders and futures speculators that supply would continue to be able to meet rising demand .
This allowed prices to fall and remain low for several years after the first Gulf War .
Further , a higher proportion of total oil production was conventional , which is much cheaper to produce , per barrel , than non-conventional oil like deepsea , oilsands , and so on , so oil producers were able to pass their lower production costs on to customers .
2000s : Steady Run-Up in Oil Prices
Starting in 1999 , however , oil prices rose steadily until a peak of $ 147 per barrel in mid-2008 .
This corresponds with a levelling - off and plateau in conventional oil production against contining demand growth .
Now , anyone who has taken first year economics can tell you what happens when the demand for something keeps growing while supply growth slows and then stalls : the price goes up .
One result of higher oil prices this decade is that it has created a market for non-conventional oil - and we see a corresponding growth in production in , e.g. the Alberta Oilsands .
As such , non-conventional oil has increased somewhat as a share of total production , as conventional oil has not been able to keep up with demand by itself .
However , the capacity for the rate of non-conventional oil production to keep increasing is limited .
There 's just no comparison between sticking a derrick in the ground , and shovelling millions of tonnes of greasy sand and injecting them with millions of gallons of steam to melt off the oily kerogen , then catching the kerogen and catalyzing it in a refinery to produce synthetic crude .
Drag on the Economy
Meanwhile , steadily rising oil prices have been an increasing drag on the rest of the economy .
Since oil is a component in the price of nearly everything else , the last few years have been characterized by rising materials and industrial inputs costs ( look at the rise and fall of commodity futures over the past two years - it tracks closely with oil ) , widespread consumer price inflation , and building pressure to increase interest rates .
At the same time , a recklessly deregulated finance industry was busy setting up a multi-trillion dollar land mine in the form of millions of aggressive mortgages at very low - but variable - interest rates that would only represent a sound investment if house prices continued to increase .
The mortgage providers lowered the barrier to entry with zero money down mortgages , negative - amortization ( paying less than the interest on the principal for the first two years ) , and " no- doc " deals for people with iffy credit .
Millions of those mortgages were made to people with poor credit and insecure incomes , who could barely afford them but did n't want to be left out of what seemed like a fool - proof scheme to make money from nothing .
' Zero Accountability ' Finance
This provided cover for an economic " boom " that did not translate into rising personal incomes .
In fact , real ( inflation adjusted ) median household incomes fell and then stagnated starting in 2000 , and consumer spending shifted from income to debt ( at temporarily low rates ) , including home equity lines of credit ( HELOCs ) that allowed people with mortgages to trade their rising house value for cash .
This became a new economic bubble to replace the burst dot com bubble of the 1990s , but with the added dimension that the new bubble was in core consumer assets and essential public infrastructure rather than being confined to the stock market .
Worse , the housing mania became the biggest financial bubble in history .
The new banking rules allowed finance companies to obfuscate and dilute the risk of these mortgages until it did n't seem like anyone was accountable for anything .
Banks rolled up their mortgages and sold them to finance companies , which bundled them into securities and sold them to other finance companies , which sold them to investment funds .
At the same time , they hedged their bets by dealing in " Credit default swaps " , which are a kind of bet on whether a mortgage will default .
And of course , all these transactions were highly leveraged , meaning most of the investment was with borrowed money .
Rising Marginal Price of Oil
Getting back to oil prices , they rose steadily during the 2000s but really took off at the start of 2008 , rising from $ 100 per barrel to peak at $ 147 per barrel in the summer .
Many people at the time blamed futures speculators for driving up the cost , but this hypothesis is n't borne out by the evidence .
A purely speculative price increase should have led to rising oil inventories , but that did n't happen .
Instead , it looks as though the dramatic price increase was due to the rapidly rising marginal cost to produce an additional barrel of oil when the global rate of production was maxed out at around 85 mbpd ( total oil ) .
Unfortunately , the steadily rising price of oil , with its attendant price inflation , drag on the economy , and pressure on interest rates was the stomping foot that set off the land mine planted by the mortgage finance bubble .
Over the past year , the subprime crisis of 2007 gradually morphed into a more generalized global economic crisis , with economic failure across the board : the rapid and catastrophic deleveraging of shaky investments , major finance firms collapsing under the weight of worthless hedge funds and mortgage backed securities , banks tightening credit under a newfound perception of risk , personal assets dissolving , house prices falling , stock prices falling , consumer confidence collapsing , wholesale and retail sales declines , and rising unemployment .
It has become a vicious cycle , a self - reinforcing feedback loop of contracting economic activity .
Itt will receive another big shudder in 2009 as the next wave of negative amortization mortgages resets to much higher monthly payments , driving still more people into foreclosure and dumping more unwanted houses onto an already devastated real estate market .
The result for the economy has been unfolding before our eyes : the finance industry on the verge of collapse , the Big Three automakers teering on the edge of bankruptcy , a steady tattoo of plant closure and layoff announcements , rising retail bankruptcies , stalled development projects , falling government revenues at all levels , and the return of deficit spending .
Peak Oil Predicts Falling Oil Prices
Now is anyone surprised that oil prices have collapsed in the past few months ?
Demand for oil is way down , since people can no longer afford to consume .
Far from contradicting the peak oil theory , falling oil prices are an expected result of the super - spikes caused by demand trying to grow against a flat rate of production .
On May 16 , 2005 , I wrote :
The next five or ten years will offer extreme price volatility for energy , particularly oil and natural gas , as demand bangs repeatedly off the production peak and then crashes under grueling price spikes .
On June 16 , 2005 , I wrote :
Nearly every reserve assessment not based on suspect USGS data puts the peak somewhere between now and 2010 .
In fact , there likely wo n't be a discrete peak per se .
It will probably stretch over several years as volatile prices squash demand periodically .
We appear to be entering that jagged plateau now , as described by analysts at Goldman - Sachs and CIBC World Markets .
... [ T ]he global economy , powered as it is by cheap , abundant oil , will inevitably go haywire as the supply starts to contract .
On August 22 , 2005 , I wrote :
[ I ] f the oil infrastructure can continue bringing oil to market fast enough to meet market demand , then the economy will continue to tick along as it has .
If , however , the rate of oil production maxes out but demand keeps growing , then the price of oil will keep rising until it gets high enough to push demand down to what the industry can provide .
...
So far , rising oil prices have n't brought on a recession in North America , but there are plenty of reasons to suspect that growth here must stall sooner or later .
Can there be any doubt that we are now in the thick of that " extreme price volatility " ( the oil price increased from $ 100 to $ 147 in six months and then fell to less than $ 40 in the next six months ) , or that the economy has gone " haywire " ?
Oil Industry Information Shortage
As a final note , we should not discount the the non-trivial fact that accurate field - by - field reserve and production rate assessments are notoriously lacking , leading to a certain amount of guesswork regarding actual production capacity .
During the 1990s , when countries like Saudi Arabia could " turn on the taps " at short notice and production from the North Sea was still increasing , oil markets experienced a rosy , and even possibly over - confident , sense of oil 's long - term prospects .
OPEC 's quota rules encouraged member countries to overstate their reserves , which looked great on the books and seemed borne out by the industry 's seemingly effortless ability to supply markets .
Further , the economy as a whole was taken up with an irrational sense of " weightlessness " , a myopic sense that the old economic rules no longer applied - as evidenced in part by the dot com bubble that seemed like a magical money machine right until it collapsed overnight .
( I still remember a colleague snapping up Nortel shares at $ 120 each while loudly proclaiming , " It 's going all the way to 200 bucks , baby ! "
Literally a few weeks later , he lost a bundle .
Now , trading at the equivalent of about 2 cents per share - they did a 10:1 stock merge a few years ago - Nortel is finally crawling into bankruptcy . )
As oil prices started creeping up in the early 2000s , analysts started taking a closer , more rigorous look at just how much oil there really is , and just how fast producers can bring it to market .
The picture is still not entirely clear , since many of the biggest oil producers are state - run and keep their numbers to themselves , but the emerging picture - particularly Twilight in the Desert Matthew Simmons ' landmark analysis of Saudi Arabia 's future as a swing producer - has been an industry straining the limits of production .
Unfortunately , even to this day , many analysts and most of the public still does n't understand the role that peak oil has played in this deepening global recession .

My dear American neighbours ,
I see the political crisis in Canada has finally made it into the Washington Post 's Foreign Briefs column .
So , anticipating a flood of interest from all of you at the dog run in the morning , let me try to give you some idea of what 's happening up there .
A few weeks ago , we had an election in Canada , a couple of weeks before yours , actually .
A political party known as the Conservatives won .
Well , sort of .
They did n't win in the sense that most of you understand winning .
I 'll get to that in a second .
They also are n't what most of you would consider conservative .
They support what you call socialized medicine , they believe in protecting a Canadian - controlled banking system , they believe in government as a vehicle for transferring wealth between regions , and they 've actually muzzled party members who tried to make abortion a campaign issue .
In fact , instead of making his Sunday trip to church a photo opportunity , our Conservative leader refuses to discuss his faith in public .
( Like many Americans , he 's an evangelical Christian ) .
Different kettle of fish
So our Conservatives are a bit different from yours .
Down here , you 'd probably call them Democrats .
And fairly liberal ones at that .
But , as I said , they won our last election , which is a pretty low - key affair compared to yours .
The campaign lasted a few weeks instead of two years .
What 's more , they won with only 37 per cent of the vote .
Now , you can do that in Canada because our Parliament has three other political parties :
The Liberals ( again , pay no attention to the name , they tend to adapt their worldview as needed ) , the Bloc Québécois ( a Quebec party that says it wants to break up the country , but has n't actually done much about it for many years ) , and the NDP .
I 'm not quite sure how to explain the NDP .
The other parties like to call them socialists .
Some of their more doctrinaire members would like the government to nationalize or take a large financial stake in things like banks and manipulate the national economy by spending huge amounts of public money .
You know , the sort of thing President George W. Bush has been doing this year .
I know , I know , it 's confusing .
Funny old world , is n't it ?
So .
The Conservatives won our election and formed something called a minority government .
That means the Conservatives can basically be tossed out of office by the opposition parties whenever they feel like it , which usually happens after a year or two .
Then there 's an election .
This time , though , the opposition parties decided to throw out the government before it really even started governing .
But instead of forcing another election , the opposition parties made a deal : they formed a surprise coalition and now they want to take power without consulting voters again .
Americans might have a hard time understanding this sort of thing , but it happens all the time in places like Israel and Italy .
Wait , though .
Uh , wake up .
We 're getting to the really interesting part .
The CBC connection
To take over , the opposition parties have to convince our head of state that they can govern effectively .
President Bush is your head of state , at least until Barack Obama moves in .
But our head of state is n't elected .
It 's the Queen .
And she 's represented up there by someone called a governor general , who is appointed .
Voters do n't have anything to do with it .
Except for not being elected , a governor general is a lot like your vice - president .
Sort of ceremonial .
Our governors general travel a lot , cut ribbons , declare holidays for school kids and try to set a good example .
The current office holder , Michaëlle Jean , used to be a CBC reporter .
Like me .
Actually , the one before her was once a CBC reporter , too .
So were two others in the recent past .
In our country , any CBC reporter can dream of becoming head of state .
Letting a journalist decide
Like your vice - president , sometimes a governor general becomes unbelievably important .
Right now , for example .
Sooner or later , this former TV reporter is going to have to decide who runs Canada .
Now , the Conservatives are n't taking this state of affairs lying down .
They 've been talking about shutting down Parliament for a while until they can think of some way to prevent the opposition parties from throwing them out .
But they can't just do that .
They 'd have to convince the Governor General to let them .
It 's all very dramatic , you have to admit .
Right ?
Do n't you ?
Hello ?
I mean , we Canadians do n't have all those big - mouthed cable anchors that you have , but you can imagine what they 'd do with a situation like this .
It 's the economy
Wait a second .
I forgot to explain why all this is happening .
Bear with me .
You see , Canada 's economy is in trouble .
Just like everybody else's .
So when the Conservatives won , most people expected them to turn on the spending taps , the way every other country in the developed world is doing .
But Prime Minister Stephen Harper , for some reason , decided not to .
In fact , last week he had his finance minister announce that the government intends to run a surplus in its next budget .
Meaning the government intends to take more in taxes from Canadians than it needs to run the country .
( I know President Bush has never run a surplus .
But Canadian governments have , every year for more than a decade , even when the supposedly spendy Liberals were in charge . )
Anyway , in the middle of an economic crisis , Harper 's plan did n't go over well with the three opposition parties and they saw their chance .
So that 's what 's happening .
Actually , if you think about it , our prime minister is doing exactly what President Bush keeps saying he'd like to be doing , instead of authorizing another trillion or so every week in new bailouts .
Maybe it 's not such a funny old world after all .
We recently saw the 75th anniversary of the repeal of Prohibition in the United States .
We know that Prohibition was an attempt by well - meaning Christians to legislate their version of morality , imposing it on their neighbors without regard to whether they shared their beliefs .
We also know that it did little good and was not to be tolerated by the people on whom it had been imposed .
What have we learned from this experience ?
Not a hell of a lot it seems .
I live in a " dry county " in Mississippi .
Many small business owners periodically try to get this on the ballot so it can be overturned .
Imagine running a restaurant and not being able to serve alcohol .
Imagine owning a gas station / convenience store in a town with a university and not being able to sell beer .
As for those of us who do not own such businesses , we would benefit from the increased tax revenue these businesses would generate if they were permitted to sell alcohol .
It would be a boon to the local economy .
Unfortunately , none of this matters because the local churches , most of which are Southern Baptist , are able to mobilize voters who are all too eager to push their religious morality on others .
It is not good enough for them to refrain from using alcohol ; they want to prohibit others from doing so too .
And because there are far more of them who show up to vote , they keep us dry .
Today , many people call for ending another form of prohibition - the war on drugs .
We recognize that this effort has been a dismal and expensive failure .
But again , a large segment of our population believes that drugs are immoral and has no problem with criminalizing drug use .
Even if I drive to a nearby county where it is legal to buy and possess alcohol , I am not allowed to buy beer on Sundays or after 2:00 am .
I must go to a liquor store to buy liquor because grocery stores in my state are not allowed to sell it at all .
I am not allowed to posses even small quantities of marijuana .
These restrictions do not inconvenience me much , especially since I no longer drink alcohol ; however , I am not particularly thrilled with my government wasting money to enforce such laws simply because some religious believers are willing to turn their preferences into commandments and laws they then impose on others .
Vision Statement
A new way of thinking about time .
Our aim is to slow the world down to create healthier , happier and more productive people .
The announcement was made Thursday .
Blackwater provides the majority of protection for U.S. government officials in Iraq , but has been criticized for " cowboy " tactics in the country , leading to what many have said are unprovoked , uncontrolled and uncalled - for killings of innocents .
The most visible example of such action was the September 2007 killing of 17 Iraqi civilians in Nisoor Square .
On Jan 6th , five former Blackwater guards pleaded not guilty in Washington , D.C. federal court to manslaughter and gun charges in that incident .
Blackwater has been operating without an Iraqi government license .
It had recently applied for one , but the request was turned down during the past few weeks by the Iraqi government , officials said .
" They presented their request , and we rejected it , " said Ala ’a Al - Taia , an official with Iraq ’s Interior Ministry .
" There are many marks against this company , specifically that they have a bad history and have been involved in the killing of so many civilians . "
Iraqi officials said Blackwater must leave the country as soon as a joint Iraqi - U.S. committee finishes drawing up guidelines for private contractors under the new security agreement .
" When the work of this committee ends , " Interior Ministry spokesman Maj .
Gen. Abdul - Karim Khalaf said , private security companies " will be under the authority of the Iraqi government , and those companies that do n't have licenses , such as Blackwater , should leave Iraq immediately . "
The State Department issued a statement saying that Iraqi law will be obeyed , meaning Blackwater will be forced to leave .
At the same time , a Blackwater spokesperson said they have not yet been informed of the decision directly .
Please wait for the wall
Now you are
The upcoming inauguration has been getting a lot of attention , including many reviews of past inaugural speeches .
Therefore , I thought it would be appropriate to post economist Milton Friedman 's rebuttal to President Kennedy 's famous 1961 inaugural address :
In a much quoted passage in his inaugural address , President Kennedy said , " Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country . "
From the introduction to Milton Friedman 's 1962 book " Capitalism and Freedom " .
In a much quoted passage in his inaugural address , President Kennedy said , " Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country . "
Neither half of the statement expresses a relation between the citizen and his government that is worthy of the ideals of free men in a free society .
The paternalistic " what your country can do for you " implies that government is the patron , the citizen the ward , a view that is at odds with the free man 's belief in his own responsibility for his own destiny .
The organismic , " what you can do for your ' country " implies the government is the master or the deity , the citizen , the servant or the votary .
To the free man , the country is the collection of individuals who compose it , not something over and above them .
He is proud of a common heritage and loyal to common traditions .
But he regards government as a means , an instrumentality , neither a grantor of favors and gifts , nor a master or god to be blindly worshipped and served .
He recognizes no national goal except as it is the consensus of the goals that the citizens severally serve .
He recognizes no national purpose except as it is the consensus of the purposes for which the citizens severally strive .
The free man will ask neither what his country can do for him nor what he can do for his country .
He will ask rather " What can I and my compatriots do through government " to help us discharge our individual responsibilities , to achieve our several goals and purposes , and above all , to protect our freedom ?
And he will accompany this question with another :
How can we keep the government we create from becoming a Frankenstein that will destroy the very freedom we establish it to protect ?
Freedom is a rare and delicate plant .
Our minds tell us , and history confirms , that the great threat to freedom is the concentration of power .
Government is necessary to preserve our freedom , it is an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom ; yet by concentrating power in political hands , it is also a threat to freedom .
Even though the men who wield this power initially be of good will and even though they be not corrupted by the power they exercise , the power will both attract and form men of a different stamp .

Judy Bachrach .
Vanity Fair .
New York : Feb 2005 . , Iss. 534 ; pg. 86
After constructing a fantasy world of girls , spies , and villains in an MSN chat room , a lonely 14 - year - old was found in a deserted alley with nearly fatal stab wounds .
He survived , only to be convicted of inciting his own murder , in a stunning case that Britain still does n't fully understand
Sometimes , as night falls over Greater Manchester , the ingenious adolescent returns to the place where he was stabbed last year , when he was 14 .
The boy is tall for his age , but slight , with olive skin , a long crooked nose , and dark , intelligent eyes framed by thick black brows poised for flight .
The stab wounds still pain him .
One in the chest - that was the light wound - and another in the abdomen , six inches deep , which pierced his kidney and liver and necessitated the removal of his gallbladder .
It was from this injury that the teenager almost died on the operating table - twice , police tell me .
Blood pooled inside the boy 's body cavity , and this restricted the movement of his diaphragm , which stopped the functioning of his lungs .
For days he lay on a respirator , treated with painkillers and antibiotics , saying little .
In Wythenshawe Hospital , where he spent more than a week , John asked to see a psychiatrist , but this was Britain , home of the dilatory National Health Service .
Despite his mother 's pleas , the teenager was put on a waiting list .
A four - month waiting list .
When pressed by police , the boy would finally concede , reluctantly and only after changing his story several times , that it was his best friend , Mark , who had stabbed him , though John said he had no idea why .
( These are not their real names . )
" I love you , bro , " Mark told his younger friend as he plunged in the knife .
" Mark did it once , stood up , holding me , did it again , " the victim told police .
" He was kneeling on me saying , ' Trust me , ' holding the knife to my stomach ....
There was blood coming out . "
Somehow or other , the boy added , he found himself dragged once again to his feet , then the knife plunged back in .
" Call an ambulance ! " John screamed .
" I 'm dying . "
" Shush ....
People will hear , please be quiet , " the older teenager told him .
" You 've killed me ! " screamed John .
" Do n't say that , " begged Mark .
" Do n't let that be the last thing you are saying . "
And so John crumpled , a drained , pallid figure muted forever , he thought , by the tall , light - haired boy he considered " perfect " and " out of my league . "
Minutes passed , perhaps as many as 20 .
Then Mark pulled out the knife and called an ambulance .
Some madman had attacked his friend , the boy told the police .
Early 20s , wearing a black hooded jacket and black jeans .
An all - points bulletin was issued by Detective Chief Inspector Julian Ross , 43 , a terse , authoritative figure with an iron jaw and a manner to match .
" This was a seemingly unprovoked attack , " he told the media , which were directed to inform the public of the knife - wielding monster , " and we have no idea why this happened . "
To this day , a British media Web site carries a picture of John , his engaging , shy smile shadowed by a tender hint of mustache .
Next to it is the headline boy stabbed .
All this took place on June 29 , 2003 , a very hot Sunday , in a small alleyway in an area that goes by the charming name of Goose Green .
At the time of the stabbing the alley led nowhere ; it was cut off by a 40 - foot drop .
It lies off Stamford New Road , close by a shopping mall in the prosperous Manchester suburb of Altrincham , where random stabbings simply do n't occur .
And as far as the police could see , it had n't occurred , at least not the way the older boy had said .
No madman in a hooded jacket , the authorities quickly realized , would ever be found .
No media alarm should have been raised .
A closed - circuit camera at the base of the alley had recorded all the foot traffic .
As the boys disappeared into the alley , that camera swung around and followed them .
After reviewing the tape , the police arrested Mark for attempted murder .
That same camera follows John whenever he revisits the scene of the crime .
He ducks in and out of the small brick sandwich shops and coffee bars , passing the hair salon and the little metal statue of two geese .
Everything is as it was that June day when Mark carried the six - inch knife they had bought together .
John yearns for strangers to recognize him for the celebrity he almost was .
" That 's the guy that got stabbed , " one might say .
Or , more anxiously , " Are you O.K . ? "
But all he manages to attract is the curiosity of the local police .
And they have had enough of him .
Four months after the stabbing , the charges were amended .
Mark was still accused of attempted murder , to which he ultimately pleaded guilty .
But this time John also was charged - with inciting murder .
His own murder .
This is a legal novelty in Britain , and very likely throughout the world .
" Yes , I 'm not aware of any other case where somebody 's incited somebody to murder themselves , " Nicholas Clarke , the prosecutor , declares in his Manchester office , each syllable clipped with derision .
It is clear he does n't have much sympathy for the boy whose brush with death prompted the unprecedented charge .
" I would say , of the two teenagers , John was the more wicked and more criminally culpable . "
For months John had corresponded in an Internet chat room with Mark , a bland - featured 16 - year - old who possesses as his most striking traits a vast forehead , a tendency to open every sentence with " Ermmm , " and , it would later be claimed , an almost infinite store of credulity .
Every story John spun on the chat - room site , every slithering creation dropped into the ocean of the Internet , Mark avidly reeled in .
Invention was so easy , " the equivalent of taking heroin , " John thought .
The older boy 's gullible nature stirred in him conflicting emotions : love foremost , but very likely also a shade of contempt .
It was " like feeding a dog , " John would later explain .
As for himself , John was a virtual Scheherazade , a gifted fabricator .
" Staggering , " said the judge who would hear his case .
" Skilled writers of fiction would struggle to conjure up a plot such as arises here . "
From John 's laptop emerged what the prosecutor would subsequently describe as " an Internet soap opera moving from one scene to another , each character and story line more fantastic than the last . "
The plots were extracted from what John had seen both in films and in life : thick with treachery , villainy , and betrayal .
They were empty of hope .
John had always been " a very gentle , slightly withdrawn personality , " his lawyer , Jonathan Goldberg , would inform the prominent Manchester judge David Maddison in his courtroom , but harbored , despite his introversion , dreams of someday becoming a barrister himself .
On the whole , Goldberg thought , a teenager who could spin such tales was headed in the right direction .
" Your Lordship may think he would make a very good barrister . "
( His Lordship , as it happened , did not . )
Certainly John possessed the determination and industry necessary for success .
From four in the afternoon to seven in the morning , he typed his inventions into his laptop .
Indefatigably .
When he stopped going downstairs for meals , his slight frame shrank even further .
" I 'd stopped eating in March , " he would later explain .
" Just wanted to be on the Internet , that 's all that mattered . "
He found he was never tired .
He had " a buzz , " he told one of the innumerable experts who would eventually interview him .
" It was like satisfying a craving , you had to be on there , you had to be doing it . "
Perhaps it was " warped " to spend so much time in chat rooms , he reflected , sleepless and typing ceaselessly .
That , however , was not how it seemed at the time .
It seemed normal .
But to the authorities who later analyzed and re-analyzed what was written , none of this was ordinary .
Fifty - eight thousand lines of text were extracted for scrutiny , a fraction of the total .
" The amount of data on those two computers was about 133 gigabytes , masses of data , " Sally Hogg , a police analyst , tells me .
If converted into a paper pile , she adds , " it would stretch , I think , 46,000 feet high . "
Practically everyone I speak to about this singular boy and his case demonstrates toward him a high level of antipathy , with the notable exception of Goldberg , who compares this story to Romeo and Juliet .
The lawyer is distinctly impressed by his client .
" What emerges from this is an extraordinarily persuasive , inventive boy ! "
A person , says the lawyer , whose future may well turn out to be " brilliant . "
Most views are considerably less indulgent .
A " matrix of deceit " is how the prosecution described John 's maneuvers to engineer his own death , inveigling an unsuspecting friend into " a web of deception . "
In contrast to such frightening cunning , the blundering stupidity of Mark - the actual knife wielder - comes as something of a relief .
" I do n't think it 's an exaggeration to say he brainwashed my client , " says David Hatton , Mark 's attorney , who has nothing but compassion for the boy .
The media swarmed all over the case , fighting , in vain , to extract from the principals every last ounce of information .
But here they were thwarted at every turn by the peculiar British legal system .
A court order , citing the age of the culprits , would not permit any media outlet - including Vanity Fair - to identify the boys and required every publication to use the pseudonyms " John " and " Mark . "
The newspapers and television networks , which at the behest of law enforcement had terrified the region with tales of a crazed would - be murderer loose in Manchester , were n't even permitted to correct these false allegations .
Thus , the stories that emerged about John were a feeble compilation of bare - bones facts and judgments spoon - fed by the authorities .
The boy was devious .
Brilliant .
Deceitful .
But more than 500 pages of Internet - chat transcripts , 50 pages of psychological reports , and excerpts from a score of police interviews land in my possession .
These documents sketch a different , complex picture of John , victim and criminal .
If the 14 - year - old painstakingly arranged for his own execution in an MSN chat room and chose Mark for the job , it was n't out of wickedness .
It was out of fear .
In the universe he inhabited , there was , John felt , no one to sustain him - except on the Internet , which he peopled with characters of his own device .
These characters spoke his language , a blend of northern - England vulgarisms and the cheerful adolescent code of chat rooms .
And they shared his mission : to keep Mark perpetually in contact with their creator , John .
Thus , he concocted more than a half - dozen fantasy personas , four of them women .
Much later , after months of wrong turns and huge confusion , the police would be very impressed by his skill .
Threads of plots , no matter how complicated or absurd , were never dropped .
A character 's most improbable revelations would , inevitably , be confirmed by another .
The female creations came across , police decided , as archetypes of femininity , and not simply to a 16 - year - old mind .
It is instructive , for example , to analyze the dialogue of the character John called Janet Dobinson ( No. 3 in the hierarchy of the British secret service , as she informs correspondents ) , on whom John clearly lavished special effort .
Being middle - aged , she is " not with teenage talk , " Dobinson admonishes Mark in the chat room , and she requests communication in more adult language .
Moreover , he was not to stray from her explicit instructions , because : " 4 Agents watching you now ... "
" Each style of conversation was totally different - I really believed it , " marvels Sally Hogg , the police analyst .
" That was the stumbling point for me .
At no point could I find he made a mistake . "
John was careful to find an excuse for a certain character to disappear so a new one could enter the online chat .
" And sometimes it would be a week or a few weeks before that character came back , " always without a hitch , Hogg says .
" The continuity and his memory were phenomenal . "
Nonetheless , there were enough absurdities to warrant re-examination .
Various characters shared the same last name - or , alternatively , although claiming to be siblings , did n't share the same last name .
Two of them ceased writing after meeting up with sorry fates : rape , murder , a coma , a baby born during the coma-plot twists so messy and operatic that police had to provide themselves with stacks of names and huge piles of colored charts to sort things out .
Disaster awaited one young female character , it was noticed , whenever a love - struck Mark attempted to rendezvous with her ( " which could not happen due to her not existing , " as David Boulger , a probation officer , crisply observed in his report ) .
Of these invented creatures , the most passionate and durable was the high - ranking spy Dobinson .
Although evidently preoccupied with problems at the most exalted levels of government ( " Hiya Babes .
Very busy , this thing with the royal party being disturbed , u will know about it ... " ) , she was always available to Mark .
It was she who ordered the teenager to carry out John 's murder .
" The Internet 's a very dangerous place to be , " the prosecutor says mildly .
" In fact , I think MSN themselves should perhaps take some responsibility .
There 's no supervision on a lot of these chat rooms .
You can take any identity you want . "
But for all his facility at invention John wanted for himself no identity at all .
That is what lies at the heart of this story .
His e-mail addresses contain no hint of his real name .
They are proud , existential boasts stuffed with lies : livinitlargelad@hotmail
.com and livinitlargeladdy@hotmail.com .
" I wanted to be dead , " John told his therapist - he finally has one .
' U want me 2 ... kill him ... ?? that 's wot ur askin me ? " an incredulous Mark wrote the British agent Janet Dobinson on June 28 , 2003 .
That was the day before the attempted murder .
" Yes . "
" And jus leave him 2 die ....
Wot shud i say 2 him ?
Stand there a [ minute ] while i stab u ? "
" You love him , " came the response .
" I love him .
But this has 2 be done ? "
" Take him [ to ] a quiet place , " advised the British agent .
Dobinson was , as Mark had been informed , 44 and authoritative .
She liked to issue instructions .
" Buy knife .... Glove . "
" Where can u buy knives frm by the way ? "
" Boots , " typed Dobinson , referring to a drugstore chain which sells many household articles , including , as it turns out , Sabatier kitchen knives .
Dobinson had answers for everything .
And quite a few demands .
Mark , for example , was to stab his friend while saying : " Love you bro ... Make sure he knows you love him . "
John felt himself to be so profoundly unlovable that he entered the MSN chat room not under his own name but as a teenage beauty named Rachel West .
It was through this character that he introduced himself to Mark , who promptly fell hard .
Rachel 's desirability was enhanced by the attachment of a promising photograph - from some source , " although we do n't know who , " Hatton points out .
A great deal of thought went into her gestation .
" He said if he had not created Rachel , then Mark would not have wanted to get close to him , " Dr. Kirsty Smedley , a Manchester psychologist , wrote after interviewing John subsequent to his arrest .
" He said it was important to him to keep Mark as his friend and he was not confident that Mark would be interested in just speaking to John . "
Thus , Rachel was only the beginning of what evolved into an intricate Internet folie six .
Shortly after her appearance , John suddenly emerged in the chat room as himself ( saying that he was Rachel 's brother ) , and these two were followed by still other fantastical alter egos equipped with wild backgrounds but dull , repetitive names : Lyndsey East , Rachel East , Kevin McGregory , Dave McNeil , Janet Dobinson .
A girl in distress , a homosexual blackmailer , a genial schoolboy , a top spy , a rapist , and a murderer - everyone checked in regularly with the alternately enraptured and horrified teenager Mark .
They had desires they expressed frankly , ardently , threateningly , as the occasion warranted .
Mark 's world - until then packed mainly with soccer , passable grades , and admiring schoolgirls - was alight with these passionate intruders .
He was the only child of working - class parents , well mannered and respectful , bound , he thought , for a local business college .
John would later claim that Mark had declared him to be " like a brother " - but , as it turned out , he was a lot more than that .
Behind the laptop screen John was Mark 's own personal deity , industriously enhancing certain elements of suburban life while eliminating others .
Suddenly the " postman , ice cream man , teachers , drivers " were all revealed to be secret agents , checking to see if he , Mark , might be smart enough to join their ranks .
Nothing was impossible .
If Mark played his cards right , wrote John , " by may next year you will be a millionaire . "
As for John , he , too , was getting what he wanted from his friend , as Dr. Smedley would later recount : " He described a feeling of emotional intimacy he had never experienced before . "
Which was n't , unfortunately , saying much .
At age four , John found a book with his birth date in it , next to a different last name .
That was how the child discovered that the man who had been living with his mother was not his father , as he had supposed .
No man in his life had ever meant much to him : he had no recollection of his biological father - who had , John 's mother later told her son's therapist , not only abducted their son when he was a baby but also abused her physically and sexually .
As for the father 's successor , he was , John declared , " bad on drugs . "
Then the stepfather packed up when John was seven , and he , his mother , and his younger sister had to move to a smaller house .
He remembers sitting on the stairs of this more confined house , listening to his mother weeping in the living room .
Feelings of depression overwhelmed him .
He took a cocktail stick and scraped it against his wrist .
School , despite his excellent grades , was equally desolate .
" Paki " and " gay " were some of the names hurled at him - the first because " I think my dad must have been Asian , " the second " because most of my friends were girls . "
About these taunts , which were ceaseless in elementary school , he said nothing to anyone .
Even when John passed his exams ( much to his surprise ) and gained entrance to a prestigious grammar school , the names continued unabated .
" I bottled it in , " he told the Manchester psychiatrist Sue Bailey .
Privately , grief and shame are n't so easy to contain .
He routinely washes parts of his body in a precise , unvarying order , no part cleaned more than once .
He dresses in a manner equally rigid .
One time he tried to depart from this routine , Bailey reported , but " the resulting anxiety was such that he had to go back and dress all over again . "
Objects in his bedroom must be arranged in neat , parallel lines , toiletries and desk items perfectly aligned .
Also , John is certain that people are always talking about him once they believe him to be out of earshot .
" If it is strangers , they are saying I am a Paki and a terrorist , " he says .
His mother , an office manager , also disappoints him , he suggested to therapists .
Two years ago , she found another companion , a plumber who moved in with them , and it seemed to John that this newcomer was receiving more attention than he was .
Eight months later he began spending a lot more time on the Internet , the teenager said .
Sometimes John would approach their bedroom and listen quietly , his ear pressed to the door .
He wanted to hear what his mother and her companion were saying about him .
" He did n't feel part of the family , " his psychiatrist realized .
But what could John do ?
There was , the boy said , " nowhere to go . "
Except to his room .
There he wielded control over everything - especially his laptop .
But it is not a one - way street .
Asked if anyone had ever been able to exert control over his private thoughts , the boy said yes .
The Internet did something like that to him , said John .
Under the keyboard of his computer he kept a kitchen knife .
At 13 , upon receiving a laptop from his mother ( a homework enhancer , she thought ) , John became a habitu of the Internet .
By February 2003 he was contacting 20 to 30 people a night in chat rooms ; within a week he had found Mark .
Once John had introduced himself as Rachel 's brother , the two boys just clicked , John was later to explain .
For instance , both liked Catch Me if You Can , a movie in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays an adolescent con man who effortlessly assumes multiple identities .
Another element the teenagers had in common : a Webcam , which allowed them to view each other and any other chat - room member who had one of the cameras .
By April 3 , 2003 , Mark had grown so smitten with the character Rachel , whom John had equipped with her own e-mail address ( Rachel_@hotmail.com ) , that her creator grew alarmed .
Mark was , he told John , falling in love , ceaselessly trying to arrange a rendezvous with the girl .
Something had to be done to forestall the moment of truth .
John returned to his laptop .
As Mark would discover on the chat - room site , Rachel , along with her " brother " John , were in a state of ceaseless peril , threatened with abduction and rape by a self - proclaimed homosexual stalker named Kevin - John 's fourth character .
To prevent such tragedy , Mark was told , he had to perform sexual tasks in view of the Webcam to gratify the stalker himself .
It is this demand that catches my eye when I open the 15 pounds of chat - room text that I had received .
The character Rachel is writing to Mark :
" Wank ... you wanking on camera for them ? "
" Wot else can i do ? "
" Omg why is he making u wank ? "
" Cos he is gay . "
" You dont have to do anything for me . "
" I do Rach . I ( L ) u ... "
" I ( L ) u 2 . "
This passage incensed Manchester authorities .
" So when he'd gone through the humiliating task of masturbating on the Webcam , ' Kevin ' then abducted his girlfriend .
The trauma for him ! " says Hogg , the police analyst .
Within short order , a devastated Mark was to learn his virtual girlfriend was dead - gang - raped and then murdered by the mythical stalker and his cohorts .
" He manipulated him , " says Hogg .
" To get him to do what ' they ' wanted ! "
John would later concede that he knew exactly how much he had traumatized Mark by engineering the death of Rachel and permitting the ostensible killer to describe her last moments to Mark himself : " Kicked all her stomach .
put her head under water .
Then out .
Freezing cold .... and she stained my sheets when she was bleeding !
U werent there for her .
However much she screamed for u . "
" How cud I have been there when i didnt kno where she woz , " the bewildered adolescent wrote back .
If John was being eaten away by his passion for the Internet world , Mark was devoured .
" Angry and upset " was how he later described his reaction to the news about his " girlfriend . "
Previously acceptable grades at his relatively undemanding high school dropped to C's and F's , Hatton , his attorney , tells me .
His friend John marveled at such a trusting , suggestible nature .
" I was surprised Mark believed it all , " John would later admit .
" I would say things that would n't make sense . "
Mark never noticed .
" It 's a hard life ! " he wrote when told his true love had been raped .
But the problem was Mark was n't the only one in love .
The virtual universe John had so carefully constructed was fast slipping out of control .
The older boy he had " looked up to and wanted for myself , " as John would later express it , had fallen for an imaginary girl .
And not just one .
" John said he invented other personas in the chat room in order to keep Mark interested in him , " one therapist was later to learn .
Into the chat room , therefore , came a new character , Lyndsey East , equipped with all that was required for instant membership - Lyndseyeast2k3@hotmail.com .
But once Mark began expressing interest in her as well , she , too , evaporated , ostensibly killed by the British government on April 27 , 2003 .
As solace , John eventually allowed Rachel to return from the dead , at which time it was explained that she had simply slipped into " a coma , " and had , moreover , despite her previous condition - and the fact that she had never actually met him - given birth to Mark 's baby .
Then she again vanished , to be succeeded by the flashier secret - service agent Janet Dobinson , a doting mother but love - starved , married ( unhappily ) to an ogre from whom she was eager to escape .
" Look at how convincing these personalities are ! " says Goldberg , John 's lawyer .
He might be talking about a particularly apt pupil .
" Brilliant for an e-mail chat ! "
About his bent for invention John was manifestly ambivalent .
On the one hand , the teenager was , as he would later acknowledge , " loving it . "
On the other , he felt completely trapped .
And , on occasion , guilty .
( " Wud u h8 me if i told u that i pretended to be rach 1nite ? " a short - lived character inquires of Mark right after Rachel 's " death . "
It is a spasm of regret that goes unmentioned by police and lawyers alike in my conversations with them .
Nor do the multiple therapists appear to have noticed it . )
" Isolated " was the word John used to describe his existence at this time .
With whom could he discuss the activities of his imaginary heroines and villains ?
Not with his school chums or teachers .
Certainly not with his mother , who noticed that the more time her son spent online the more he was becoming " secretive " and snappish .
Mark , who " liked me loads , " as John realized , would certainly cease correspondence if the truth emerged about his virtual romantic interests .
" Bear in mind this is a love story - that 's why he wanted to commit suicide , " says Goldberg .
" An unrequited - love story . "
But it was n't just the virtual Mark whom John loved .
The two boys were beginning to meet in person .
John saw his friend surrounded by admiring girls .
A new feeling took hold : " Wanting my life to end " was how John described it .
If he were dead , he told his therapist much later , then nothing more could happen to him .
He knew he was addicted , and not just to the Internet .
At school his geography teacher saw a change in her pupil .
" He would become withdrawn .
And he would sit and read a book rather than talk with his friends , " she revealed .
These books " were about mental illness , " the teacher observed .
Stunned and uncomprehending , she reported her observations to John 's mother , who agreed that her son 's behavior had been very strange recently .
Four weeks later , the boy went missing from school , his first act of truancy ever .
John 's mother discovered her son was at the home of an older boy named Mark , about whom she knew nothing .
Around the time of this incident , she slipped into her son's room and checked his laptop , where she found that Mark was a frequent on - screen presence .
Also in evidence were communications to both boys from someone who claimed to be a 44 - year - old top administrator in the British secret service .
John 's mother , a small , plump woman , who had experienced more than her share of life 's anguish , felt a heightened sense of alarm .
This Dobinson woman claimed to have urgent business with a very lofty crowd .
" i got the queen out of bed ! "
" No offence but wot does she do neway ? " wondered Mark .
There was no reply to this question .
What appeared on the screen was a revelation of flattering significance :
" This is the UK 's biggest secret ... i can trust you ... would it be possible to look at you while i tell you ? "
Dobinson , too , was interested in watching sexual activity via the Webcam .
John 's mother wasted no time .
The modem was removed from John 's laptop and the computer itself exiled to her room .
This , however , made little difference ; at night the boy would manage to retrieve and re-assemble the laptop and modem .
The mother also insisted on meeting Mark 's parents , who lived in the middle - class suburb of Stockport , about four miles away .
Then Mark was invited for a sleepover at John's .
John 's family lives in a neat two - story brick house with a white front door ; above it a thread of blue paint edges a six - pointed star composed of leaded glass .
The house , which is estimated to be worth $ 400,000 , lies in a slightly more prosperous neighborhood than the one inhabited by Mark 's family , where each brick structure is an echo of its modest neighbor .
In John 's small bedroom , which overlooks a small garden of aloe and yew , the boys played videos .
( It was not the most felicitous evening : the videos were porn , and the two boys engaged in oral sex that night . )
On the whole , John 's mother honestly could n't see what her bright son saw in his less academically inclined new friend .
Both sets of parents decided there would be no more sleepovers .
One final thing , both mothers told their sons .
There was to be no further communication with the peculiar Janet Dobinson , allegedly of the British secret service .
Ever .
" Could you kill someone close to you ?
You might be tsted on that later on . "
" Erm ... I duno .... I prob wud but i wanna kno y.... I havent really thought about it . "
" Well think please . "
" Yeah i cud .
Theres my answere . "
Young John - as the hopelessly credulous Mark was informed by the spy Dobinson - had a slow - growing but terminal brain tumor .
However tragic for its victim , the condition also had devastating consequences for the British secret service , which needed John dead , she explained , in record time .
Why hasten the inevitable ?
" im now in a position to tell you why , " Dobinson wrote back .
John was worth exactly 568 billion .
At the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean lay a " huge massive safe " containing " the worlds richest jewels . "
Access to that chest was available only through John , who had the combination .
In his head .
" Only he can walk through the door .
It will not allow anyone else . "
" Not even queen ? "
" No . "
" Aint it murder when u kill sum1 ? "
" Not in your case . "
It did n't take the older boy very long to overcome his inhibitions .
For one thing , Agent Dobinson was promising extraordinary rewards for his service to the Crown : 80 million , she estimated , sexual favors , a career in the intelligence service cemented by a contract .
Mark was given the number 47695 and ordered to " terminate " his friend .
( After this , there was to be a meeting between Mark and a grateful Prime Minister Tony Blair . )
For another , John , writing under his own name in a more adolescent style , sent Mark careful confirmation of his supposedly fatal condition : " I got a letter today , from my doc , when i went in a few weeks ago cos i was depressed and shit ... i got a brain thingy tumour but its big . "
" I could n't go home and carry on with this fantasy , " John would later confide .
" My life was on the Internet .
I did n't like it , I could n't undo it , it was all fake , taking someone else in . "
He was , he told his probation officer , " trapped " in the virtual world , with no way out .
To lose that world meant losing his friend .
However much John longed for death at this point , there was evidently a small portion of him that held back : " 6969 abort code ok ?!
must stop st8 away with 6969 , " Dobinson warned Mark , thus neatly uniting her creator 's two major obsessions , sex and death .
If those numbers were uttered on the sunbaked streets of Altrincham , by the shopping center , Mark was told , John would be allowed to live .
But this was just a brief spasm of fear .
( As things turned out , John would never utter the abort code to Mark : " Well I knew that he had to do it because I sort of told him , " he later told police . )
In the meantime , Dobinson added , Mark was to make sure to buy the right type of knife .
He was the kind of teenager who needed every last detail spelled out .
No pocket knives , she told him .
" It has to be big to stab him and make him bleed to death . "
Then Mark should call an ambulance - but " not st8 away . "
He had to wait .
" When will I c u ? " the perpetually besotted Mark asked her .
" At the police station , " Dobinson assured him .
In her line of work , after all , she was expert at assuming all sorts of identities .
Lately , for example , she 'd doubled as an airline stewardess .
When the murder was completed , Mark would , Dobinson promised , be in very good hands : " I will be a ' detective superintendent . ' "
Detective Chief Inspector Julian Ross of the Greater Manchester police force gazed at the mountains of chat - room printouts in utter dismay .
On the one hand , the police were in luck : Mark 's computer contained software that permitted retrieval of much of the chat - room dialogue between the two boys - such sophisticated software is rarely on the home computers of unsophisticated adolescents , and it is possible the boy did n't know of its existence .
In addition , police managed to recover dialogue from " unallocated clusters , " data in storage space the computer is no longer using for active files .
On the other hand , for whom exactly were Ross and his computer experts supposed to be looking ?
A ring of pedophiles ?
Murderers ?
School bullies who had previously targeted the younger boy ?
Precise details of the June 29 stabbing , down to the kitchen knife , appeared on the MSN chat - room site right up until one day before the crime , police noticed .
" And that caused us some major concern , " Ross says .
" We could n't get our heads around it . "
Apparently a girl named Rachel had signed in to the chat room initially .
But was there a Rachel in real life ?
" There was no verification , " Ross says .
" And so if you are talking about safety , that 's one of the big dangers .
There 's no safeguards whatsoever . "
To make matters worse , the police went out and arrested a shop assistant with the same name as one of the characters - only , the poor girl was perfectly innocent .
For three months there would be no major reduction in bafflement .
Sally Hogg , the police analyst , recalls that " there were 193 separate e-mail addresses " culled from the computers .
But " the problem with the MSN chat room is we did n't know whether there were , say , 98 individuals or one person using 98 e-mail addresses . "
Mark was no help at all .
At the boy 's second interview , Ross recalls , Mark finally confessed to the stabbing .
" He said he 'd done it because he'd heard voices . "
An arid pause .
" So we said , ' Fine .
Thanks very much .
Off you go . ' "
Back Mark went to a juvenile - detention center .
Intriguingly , the boy never spoke up at this point to reveal that , as he had stabbed his friend only under orders from the British secret service , he was entitled to release .
There were no demands to see Janet Dobinson , who had sworn that she would engineer his freedom .
No mention of sunken treasure , fatal tumors , or Tony Blair .
And that raises the question :
How much of this elaborately constructed Internet fantasy did Mark really believe , at heart ?
All of it ?
Some of it ?
None of it ?
Hatton ,
Mark 's barrister , concedes that when he first met his client " he did n't find it easy to explain to me why he had fallen for it and been so stupid . "
Nonetheless , he is certain of Mark 's sincerity .
The lawyer suspects that , on being arrested , Mark " was still believing he was acting on behalf of the British secret service , and held a fear if he said anything he might be in danger himself . "
The prosecutor thinks otherwise .
Had Mark been truly convinced he worked for the spy agency , " he would have said it at the outset , " when he was arrested .
John , too , had his suspicions about the degree of his friend 's credulity .
" Mark must have known at some point that these characters were not real , " he later told a therapist .
But he could not say when the moment of enlightenment would have come for his friend .
Indeed , for all his love for Mark , who was languishing in confinement for eight months while John recuperated at home , the younger boy remained rigidly unforthcoming about his own participation in the scheme .
When pressed , he told law enforcers only as much as he suspected they already knew - or might soon discover .
Hogg recalls that the boy " brought into play different people whom we would later find .
He brought into play Janet Dobinson " - a spy , said John .
But that was because police had possession of the computers and were bound to find out about her anyway .
As Hogg sorted for clues through the stacks of transcripts of Internet chat , however , she noticed a repetition of a certain word .
The word was " mybye , " and it was used by John , Kevin , Dobinson , and Lyndsey .
Not a spelling or grammatical error , Hogg decided .
A deliberate stylistic variation of " maybe , " shared by four supposedly different people .
Odd that Dobinson used it .
Who was she really , anyway ?
" The aim of it all was to find Janet Dobinson , " says Ross .
" The penny clicked - and I wo n't forget it - when we said , ' All right .
Let 's just go over again where Janet Dobinson 's been . '
We finally saw that the last person to use the laptop at John 's house [ before the stabbing ] was Janet Dobinson . "
In October 2003 , three months after the arrest and detention of Mark , authorities would discover that someone by the name of Dobinson logged on to John 's laptop with a password at a time when only John was at home .
Sally
Hogg went directly to the prosecutor with the news .
He , in turn , went to Judge Maddison .
There was n't just one teenager to charge in the attempted murder of young John , said Clarke , there were two .
The second was John himself .
That month the boy was arrested by police minutes before setting off for school .
He seemed to have half expected their arrival .
" What 's the charge ? " wondered the judge .
" Incitement to murder , " said the prosecutor .
" And as nobody 's ever been charged with inciting his own murder , it 's a novelty . "
" Bizarre , " conceded the judge .
Mark was in the courtroom , listening to Clarke sketch the full account of the story in which Mark himself was such a major participant - and of which he knew so little .
In the months since the stabbing , he had been working out regularly at the juvenile - detention - center gym ; he had grown muscular , hard .
As Clarke spoke about how John had manipulated the older boy , deploying a stream of imaginary virtual characters to lure Mark into carrying out his murder , he sneaked a look at Mark 's face .
The boy was , no mistaking it , aghast .
The beautiful Rachel West , whom he had loved , wooed , and honestly mourned , was John - as was Kevin , who reveled in the bloody details of her gang rape and murder .
Lyndsey East , who had briefly enchanted him and then disappeared without a word of good - bye , was John .
Janet Dobinson , who had watched him masturbating on a Webcam , and who had promised him a lifetime of wealth and glamour , was John .
The ice - cream vendors and shop assistants engaged in ceaseless surveillance of Mark : all John .
The world he had known was John , written , produced , and directed by John .
" I 've been a fool , " said Mark .
At the end of May , the teenagers , their lawyers , and the press gathered in Judge Maddison 's courtroom , where neither boy so much as glanced at the other .
Both pleaded guilty and received , to their patent relief , probation .
When the sentence came down , Mark winked at his mother , and Sally Hogg , whose work had uncovered the degree of his manipulation by John , wept for the duller , more susceptible boy .
" I just thought , It could have been my son , " she says .
There were conditions made : no unsupervised Internet sessions for either boy , no further contact between them .
Tales were told of instant transformations .
Since seeing a psychologist , John 's mother informed the court , John had been getting along nicely with her live - in companion .
Moreover , added the mother , despite his earlier homosexual leanings , John now had " a girlfriend . "
At which point , one local reporter informs me , " Everyone in the press put down their pens and pads . "
They might as well have burned them .
Only a part of this amazing story was ever revealed to the British public .
Almost nothing consequential came out , as the lawyer representing the Manchester Evening News , the Daily Mail , and The Sun complained .
For example , although the media had named John as a stabbing victim and published his photograph less than a year earlier , no one in Britain would ever be allowed to learn that he had tried to engineer his own execution that hot June day in Goose Green : " As far as the public in south Manchester are concerned there is at large ... a crazed knifeman who murderously attacked a 14 - year - old , " said the newspaper lawyer .
" And the public , in the submissions of the press , are entitled to be told the truth . "
Not in Britain , however .
Even though , thanks to the Internet , anyone who wishes can access all relevant information .
Just a few well - chosen words typed into Google are enough to call up some media stories identifying John as a stabbing victim last year , as well as other articles , more recent , revealing that in fact the victim incited his own attempted murder .
Only in the second instance is John 's real name excised from accounts .
It is a paradox that seems to have escaped the British judiciary .
In the absence of factual press reports , John feels at liberty to craft , for the benefit of his girlfriend , fabulous new tales , starring himself .
He has told his therapist about his lies to his girlfriend .
Someone stabbed him in Goose Green for revenge , he told her , because he , John , had identified a killer on the loose .
Perhaps his girlfriend has access to the Internet ; she does n't believe him , John reports .
The mere thought of Mark reduces the boy to tears .
He misses him terribly , even while recognizing , as he puts it , " the friendship with Mark was fake . "
It was n't John whom Mark loved , the boy knows .
" Because he had the friendship with Rachel and Janet . "
Where does he belong ?
John wonders .
Not at home : " It does n't suit me , being part of a family environment , being sucked in , " he says .
He does n't think he will ever get married , much less have children .
He could n't imagine , he says , being stuck with the same person his whole life .
There were these two boys in England .
One of them , John , started making up characters in msn chatrooms where he met another boy , Mark .
Mark was very drawn to John and his characters ( whom he did not know did not exist ) .
Mark even fell in love with some of the female characters that John created .
John made up a whole world with Mark about secret agent plots and government works in England .
The boys were spending about 15 hours daily on the internet with eachother .
Mark and John became lost in their own world they had created .
At one point , one of John 's characters asked Mark to kill John as part of a secret mission , giving him all the details of how to do it .
So , in the alleyway Mark was instructed to kill John in , Mark stabbed John several times .
John survived the attack and police were stumped for some time until Mark finally fessed up to attacking his friend .
Police then found thousands upon thousands of pages of dialogue and plotting from two very messed up little boys .

In this dudes defence , I 've met the one who convinced his friend to stab him .
I 've got to say this story is appalling and I live in South Manchester myself .
I went throught something similar yet albeit not as violent .
Meeting the guy who did the stabbing was a huge deal from me and I got to ask him a lot .
I would n't have gotten over my experience
If I hadnt talked to him about his motives and reasons .
It really helped me understand the side of bad .
He 's a nice guy now , confortable with himself :) back to top ( Anonymous ) 2011-01 - 12 01:40 am ( UTC ) Rake out of Mechanical Bull Rental Los Angeles ?
Livelihood in the Capital has it's reward although like with all stuff , there is of course a draw back too !
Residing in the focus of the action is of great magnitude , as you should be in the loop .
My chief , Numbers , continuously mentions the problem .
In truth , he uses the better part of the day to think around things similar to the problem .
In spite of this , for my associates Edwardo , Caroline along with Stanford , this Town is the single location to live .
For my person our urban existence is impressive !
I do not stop at the clubs .
I noticeably choose a nice Shed Festivity and with the service of [ url=http://boomerevents.com/index.php]Mechanical Bull Rental Los Angeles [ / url ] it certainly is at all times a unique experience !
Life wants us also everybody here require sometimes some vital amusement , to have the ability to keep up in the midst of our every day stress !!
I am Cliff Alexander and I wish your coming wedding will be a hit !

THE number of people going online has passed one billion for the first time , according to comScore , an online metrics company .
Almost 180 m internet users — over one in six of the world 's online population — live in China , more than any other country .
Until a few months ago America had most web users , but with 163 m people online , or over half of its total population , it has reached saturation point .
More populous countries such as China , Brazil and India have many more potential users and will eventually overtake those western countries with already high penetration rates .
ComScore counts only unique users above the age of 15 and excludes access in internet cafes and via mobile devices .

Children who are left - handed or ambidextrous perform worse at school than right - handers , according to a study of national curriculum test results .
Left - handed girls fare worse than boys : while left - handers from both sexes start off performing worse , girls fail to catch up with their right - handed peers during later school life .
Those who are ambidextrous from both sexes also fail to bridge the gap in performance , according to the study carried out by researchers from the University of Bristol for the Economic and Social Research Council .
The researchers , who looked at the results of more than 10,000 children , reveal that left - handers perform less well in IQ tests and tests for 11 - and 14 - year - olds .
" Left - handed children perform worse than right - handed ones in terms of cognitive outcomes at ages eight , 11 and 14 , " they conclude .
" The gap between left - handed girls and right - handed girls is larger than the gap between left - handed boys and right - handed boys ... there is no sense of catching - up in non -right - handed girls .

" Mixed - handers of both genders do less well than right - handed children across a wider range of outcomes " .
On average a left - hander has test scores 1 per cent below right - handers .
The performance of the ambidextrous students is more troubling .
" Children with ' mixed - handedness ' have lower development , which first appears in the early years but remains present at age 14 , particularly for girls , " the research says .
The study , by Professors Paul Gregg , Carol Propper and Katharina Janke , found that about 10 per cent of children were left - handed and about 7.5 per cent ambidextrous .
One theory put forward for the poor performance of ambidextrous children is that they may have become mixed - handed due to lack of parental awareness of their development and less stimulation .
There is one bright spot on the horizon for left - handed boys : the research indicated there are more boy geniuses amongst left - handers than right - handers .
Left - handed boys dominate the top and the bottom of the ability range .

The creator of The Simpsons also made his star Bart Simpson left - handed .
Bart 's neighbour Ned Flanders is also a leftie .
* Joan of Arc
Was burnt at the stake in 1431 for being a heretic and a witch .

The police believed the killer was left - handed as most of the women killed had their throats slit from left to right .
This would fit a killer attacking from the front but if the victim was ambushed from behind it would be a right - handed killer .
WASHINGTON ( October 31 , 2008 ) – Thousands of factory farms will be exempt from needing permits that limit water pollution thanks to a new Bush Administration rule signed today .
In addition , the Environmental Protection Agency did not adopt improved controls for bacteria and other pathogens that can pose risks to human health and wildlife .
Factory farms , also known as concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) , confine animals on an industrial scale and produce massive amounts of manure and other waste that can pollute waterways with dangerous contaminants .
EPA estimates that these facilities generate three times more waste than people do nationwide .
Moreover , factory farms lack waste treatment facilities comparable to those that treat human sewage .
The new rule :
Creates a loophole allowing facility operators to avoid permits by claiming they wo n’t have a discharge .
Adopts a scheme that allows facilities to avoid certain environmental enforcement .
For instance , if an operator certifies that the facility wo n’t have a discharge , environmental authorities will ignore enforcement action , even if the facility discharges to the nation ’s waters .
Rejects improvements in technology that would reduce harmful bacteria and other pathogens contained in animal waste , missing an opportunity to prevent water pollution and threats to public health .
“ Literally and figuratively , this rule puts the Bush Administration ’s stamp of approval on a load of manure , ” said Jon Devine , Senior Attorney in the Water Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) .
“ Even though Congress specifically targeted factory farms for regulation under the Clean Water Act in 1972 and EPA has recognized the importance of these operations getting pollution control permits , the Administration stepped in it today . ”
“ It ’s outrageous to see the environmental yard sale that marks the Bush Administration ’s final days in office , ” said Jeffrey Odefey , Staff Attorney at the Waterkeeper Alliance .
“ Clearly , industry lobbyists are picking up last - minute deals intended to preserve their right to pollute for years to come .
Instead of offering meaningful protection of our nation ’s waters and communities , EPA has come up with an unworkable muddle that sets the country back by decades . ”
" Clean water is too important to allow polluting factory farms to continue business as usual , " said Ed Hopkins , Sierra Club 's Environmental Quality Program director .
" Yet again , the Bush Administration has put private industry profits before public health . "
Czech artist David Cerny was given £ 350,000 from his government to oversee the creation of a sculpture featuring the work of artists from all 27 European Union nations .
Instead , he got together with his pals and made an eight - ton sculpture called " Entropia " that depicted Romania as a " Dracula theme park , " the Netherlands as being underwater " with only the tops of minarets sticking out , " Bulgaria " as a series of squat toilets , " Sweden as being " packed into an IKEA box " and so on .
I think he should be paid double .
The original intention was indeed to ask 27 European artists for participation .
But it became apparent that this plan cannot be realised , due to time , production , and financial constraints .
The team therefore , without the knowledge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , decided to create fictitious artists who would represent various European national and artistic stereotypes .
We apologise to Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek , Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra , Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and their departments that we did not inform them of the true state of affairs and thus misguided them .
We did not want them to bear the responsibility for this kind of politically incorrect satire .
We knew the truth would come out .
But before that we wanted to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself .
At the beginning stood the question :
What do we really know about Europe ?
We have information about some states , we only know various tourist clichés about others .
We know basically nothing about several of them .
The art works , by artificially constructed artists from the 27 EU countries , show how difficult and fragmented Europe as a whole can seem from the perspective of the Czech Republic .
We do not want to insult anybody , just point at the difficulty of communication without having the ability of being ironic .
Grotesque hyperbole and mystification belongs among the trademarks of Czech culture and creating false identities is one of the strategies of contemporary art .
The images of individual parts of Entropa use artistic techniques often characterised by provocation .
The piece thus also lampoons the socially activist art that balances on the verge between would - be controversial attacks on national character and undisturbing decoration of an official space .
We believe that the environment of Brussels is capable of ironic self - reflection , we believe in the sense of humour of European nations and their representatives .

This wooden Vespa was made by woodmaster Carlos Alberto to show off his skills in the art of woodery .
The entire exterior was constructed of laminated hardwood and , I 've got to admit , it looks pretty damn amazing .
But the question remains : is there a cooler form of transportation than a wooden Vespa ?
And the answer , of course , is yes , all of them .
Including hobbling on crutches .

The Beta for Playstation home is now available to everyone , and now you know what I know : this is what happens when your marketing department tries to make a game .
Here is everything you need to understand about Home , if you should accidentally launch it from your XMB : press and hold the Playstation button in the center of your Dual - Shock or Sixaxis controller .
From the menu that appears , select Quit .
There are things about Home that are simply beyond my understanding .
Chief among these bizarre maneuvers is the idea that , when manufacturing their flimsy dystopia , they actually ported the pernicious notion of scarcity from our world into their digital one .
This is like having the ability to shape being from non-being at the subatomic level , and the first thing you decide to make is AIDS .
If you approach an arcade machine and there is a person standing in front of it , you will not be able to play it .
Likewise , if you see people bowling and think that bowling is something you might like to do , you probably wont be able to .
Unable to play arcade games like Ice Breakers and Carriage Return the first several times we logged on , these games had begun to take on an epic stature in our minds .
These were gushing fonts of liquid fun , habit - forming and dangerous - for the good of our virtual society , the supply had to be controlled .
When we were finally able to play them , we learned that they were the equivalent of browser games .
There is nothing about the experience of using Home to suggest that you are actually moving through a single , contiguous environment .
It is very clearly a handful of walled off zones , where you are confronted by incessant load screens in a desperate search for stimulation .
From the moment you enter one of their ultrahygenic “ amusement regions , ” it ’s clear that all life has been burned away .
You get the sense that this is a place in which no interesting thing could ever happen .
There is already a growing school of Home apologetics , fostered by the same Order of Perpetual Masochism that lauded the rumble - free Sixaxis at launch and suggested , hilariously , that Lair and Heavenly Sword were videogames .
They ’re under the impression that because something is free , this places it on some golden dais beyond censure .
It ’s no virtue to give away something that no - one in their right mind would buy .
Sony has no idea what this world is for , and that ambiguity infuses every simulated millimeter of it .
This is the terrible secret that roils beneath their false universe : it is nothing more than a cumbersome menu , a rampart over which you must hoist yourself to accomplish the most basic tasks .

The Open Veins of Wales
Dr Beeching helped turn the country I ’ve come to love into an outpost of empire .
Now his legacy can be reversed .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 30th December 2008 .
A strange thing has happened to me over the two years since I moved to Wales .
I have become susceptible to a novel and disturbing sensation : pride in my adopted country .
England , the land of my birth , means nothing to me .
The same goes for Britain .
I despise nationalism .
But I have been overtaken by an irrational impulse .
I find myself supporting Wales in rugby , football ( someone ’s got to do it , and we did beat Liechtenstein ) and all its competing claims against other nations .
This impulse arises from a number of observations , viz :
1 . In two years of walking through the valleys and over the hills here , I have never been shouted at .
2 . The café in the local leisure centre serves smoothies in measures labelled “ small ” ( about a pint ) and “ regular ” ( about two pints ) .
3 . When I wrote to a very active councillor , asking his permission to recommend him for a gong , he replied , “ I would prefer not to seek such an honour . ”
Through such observations , I have begun to form the impression that Wales is less socially stratified , less grasping , more liberal than the rest of Britain .
Though I am an outsider , from the colonial power , with an unerring ability to wind people up , I have never been made to feel unwelcome here .
And it seldom rains here , and then only at night .
( That ’s not strictly true , but this is what nationalism does ) .
In this spirit I have to record that something is missing .
Its absence offends my new - found national pride .
It mocks our attempt to become a coherent country .
It means that the Gogs ( of North Wales ) and the Hwntws ( of South Wales ) will forever be at each other ’s throats .
It means that the greenest nation in the UK is locked into unsustainability .
It is also bleeding ridiculous .
As far as I can discover , this is the only country in Europe which you cannot traverse by rail without spending most of the journey passing through another .
The only rail link which allows you to travel from north to south crosses the border near Llangollen and does n’t re-enter Wales until it approaches Abergavenny , 100 miles away .
The railway map of Wales is a classic indicator of an extractive economy .
The lines extend either towards London or towards the ports .
As Eduardo Galeano established in The Open Veins of Latin America , the infrastructure of a country is a guide to the purpose of its development ( 1 ) .
If the main roads and railways form a network , linking the regions and the settlements within the regions , they are likely to have been developed to enhance internal commerce and mobility .
If they resemble a series of drainage basins , flowing towards the ports and borders , they are likely to have been built to empty the nation of its wealth for the benefit of another .
Like Latin America , Wales is poor because it was so rich .
Its abundant natural resources gave rise to an extractive system , designed to leave as little wealth behind as possible .
Just as the railway network was developed largely for the benefit of another economy , it was dismantled for the same purpose .
Wales was hit very hard by the Beeching cuts of the 1960s .
Before that , one of the lines which could have been used as part of a North - South railway was flooded by Llyn Celyn , a reservoir which drowned the village of Capel Celyn in order to supply water to Liverpool .
It was this act of enclosure which inspired RS Thomas ’s famous poem Reservoirs , in which he mourned “… the smashed faces / Of the farms with the stone trickle / Of their tears down the hills ’ side . ”
The dam wall was built across the Bala to Ffestiniog line .
Before Beeching , a handful of minor routes existed , which could have enabled a determined passenger who was prepared to make a few changes to travel from north to south , but there was no line either conceived or used as a long distance railway connecting the nation .
Could such a railway be built ?
Thanks to the efforts of a remarkable man , the idea is beginning to seep into the national consciousness .
Archimandrite Deiniol is the only Orthodox priest serving in North Wales .
Bull - headed , magnificently bearded , he is the spokesman for Yn Ein Blaenau , a group set up to lobby for the regeneration of Blaenau Ffestiniog , one of the country ’s poorest communities .
Unlike many other depressed Welsh towns , Blaenau has a way out : but it is blocked .
It is surrounded – hideously – by the waste from its slate workings .
The British government has a policy of replacing virgin building stone with mining spoil and rubble .
The slate waste around Blaenau would supply Britain with roadstone for years , but it ’s stuck there until the Conwy Valley railway line is upgraded .
Father Deiniol has been negotiating with the byzantine network of railway companies , authorities and regulators , and has so far been frustrated .
But in doing so , he has learnt a good deal about how the railways of the United Kingdom work – or do n’t .
He has also discovered that a railway can be critical to a region ’s regeneration , and that the north - south roads in Wales are close to gridlock .
There are plenty of lobbyists calling for new roads , but Father Deiniol ’s plan is likely to be cheaper and more sustainable .
His survey of the disused railway lines of Wales shows that there is one route – from Rhyl through Denbigh , Rhuthun , Corwen , Newtown , Llanidloes , Rhaeadr and Builth Road to Dowlais – which would require only two miles of new formation to link Holyhead to Cardiff ( 2 ) .
The rest of the way makes use of current and former railways .
He proposes that short feeder lines also be built connecting this trunk route to Mold , Llangollen , Oswestry , Bala , Hay - on - Wye and Brecon ( 3 ) .
The One - Wales Line could not only offer a much faster journey than the current long detour through England , it would also knit the other railways of Wales into a coherent network , as it uses the north coast railway and crosses the Cambrian line and the Shrewsbury to Swansea line .
It would help to regenerate a desperately poor region in the south called the Heads of the Valleys .
The project would look rather like the Western Railway Corridor in Ireland , which is reopening 184 km of disused lines between Limerick and Sligo ( 4 ) .
The least the Welsh Assembly Government should do is to commission a feasibility study and cost - benefit analysis of Father Deiniol ’s plan .
His railway would help Wales looks like a country again , rather than a depot for someone else ’s empire .

Claim : Regulations taking effect 10 February 2009 prohibit the sale of used children ’s products that have not been tested and certified as meeting new standards for lead and phthalate content .
FALSE
Examples : [ Collected via e-mail , January 2009 ]
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act ( CPSIA ) as signed into law will make it illegal for parents to resell or even give away their even gently used children ’s clothing ( this includes books & toys also ) come February 10th , 2009 .
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act ( CPSIA ) as signed into law will make it illegal for parents to resell or even give away their even gently used children ’s clothing ( this includes books & toys also ) come2009 .
The broad scope of the complicated law , and it ’s interpretation by CPSC has effectively made it illegal for parents to resell their children ’s clothing and gear at a garage sale , on eBay , Craig ’s List , through consignment stores or annual children ’s consignment sales .
If donated to a nonprofit like Goodwill or Salvation Army , those organizations can’t legally resell it , as of February 10th .
That ’s right .
Hand - me - down clothing , books & toys , for kid ’s age 12 and under , will be illegal to resell .
It will be a banned hazardous product .
The fines of $ 100,000 , potential jail time and label as a felon for violations are stiff .
Please sign the petition and contact your members of congress to keep used children ’s clothing legal : http://www.rallycongress.com/make-second-hand-kids-clothes-legal-/
Origins : On 10 February 2009 , new requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act ( CPSIA ) go into effect that dictate children ’s products cannot be vended if they contain more than 600 parts per million ( ppm ) total lead .
Also ,
certain children ’s items manufactured on or after that date cannot be sold if they contain more than 0.1 % of certain specific phthalates or if they fail to meet new mandatory standards for toys .
( Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastics more pliable . )
Lead poisoning can lower intelligence , cause mental retardation , memory problems , depression , fatigue , hyperactivity , aggression , hearing loss , liver or kidney damage , osteoporosis , high blood pressure and anemia .
Very high levels can damage the nervous system , kidneys and major organs and even result in seizures or death .
It can also lead to infertility in men and cause spontaneous abortion in women .
In the final stages of lead poisoning , the victim experiences convulsions , paralysis , blindness , delusions , and then coma .
People can and have died of lead poisoning .
Children are especially susceptible to its ill effects .
The new law requires that domestic manufacturers and importers certify that children ’s products sold after 10 February 2009 meet all the new safety standards and comply with the lead ban .
News of this shook the world of those who have children themselves or sell children ’s products ( e.g. , toys and clothes ) .
However , on 8 January 2009 the CPSC issued an important clarification of CPSIA requirements stating that CPSIA testing regulations would apply to all new children ’s items but that used items were not subject to testing and certification requirements ( although those used items still must meet CPSIA standards for lead and phthalate content ) .
As the CPSC said in that release :
Sellers of used children ’s products , such as thrift stores and consignment stores , are not required to certify that those products meet the new lead limits , phthalates standard or new toy standards .
In other words , according to the CSPC used children ’s items offered for resale after 10 February 2009 must still meet the new CPSIA standards regarding lead and phthalate content , but vendors will not have to have such items tested and certified .
Vendors should therefore “ avoid products that are likely to have lead content , unless they have testing or other information to indicate the products being sold have less than the new limit . ”
In response to confusion over CPSIA regulations , on 30 January 2009 the CPSC voted to issue a one - year stay of enforcement for certain testing and certification requirements for manufacturers and importers of regulated products .
The CPSC reiterated in their announcement of the stay that thrift stores and second - hand retailers are “ not required to test and certify products under the CPSIA ” :
The stay of enforcement on testing and certification does not address thrift and second hand stores and small retailers because they are not required to test and certify products under the CPSIA .
The products they sell , including those in inventory on February 10 , 2009 , must not contain more than 600 ppm lead in any accessible part .
A CPSC announcement issued on 6 February 2009 regarding that agency ’s enforcement policy also stated that they would not “ impose penalties against anyone for making , importing , distributing , or selling ” certain specified items , including any “ ordinary children ’s book printed after 1985 . ”
Of course , vendors of second - hand products still face the quandary that even though the CPSC has stated they are exempt from the testing and certification requirements of the CPSIA , they still have to ensure that the items they sell meet the new standards for lead and phthalate content .
Some vendors have responded by discarding inventory from classes of items they are unsure about , keeping track of recall notices , and contacting the original suppliers or manufacturers :
“ We voluntarily did a reduction a year ago , removed all toys from the stores , all painted toys , ” said William Oakley , president and chief executive officer of Goodwill Industries of the Coastal Empire Inc. , which is responsible for 14 thrift stores .
“ We eliminated all child car seats and carriers because we have no way to confirm if they have been in an accident . ”
“ We voluntarily did a reduction a year ago , removed all toys from the stores , all painted toys , ” said William Oakley , president and chief executive officer of Goodwill Industries of the Coastal Empire Inc. , which is responsible forstores .
“ We eliminated all child car seats and carriers because we have no way to confirm if they have been in an accident . ”
Hazardous chemicals that makes plastic soft and squishy may be in certain toys and children ’s shoes and those have been taken from the stores as well , said Oakley , of Goodwill ’s regional office in Savannah .
Each Goodwill store has a computer that is frequently checked for recall notices , the same procedure followed by Salvation Army stores .
“ We are committed to following all the guidelines , ” said Nanette Hamilton , director of the Salvation Army in Camden County .
She said her thrift store began sorting through potentially harmful clothing and toys last year and is relieved that the law will not require thrift shops to certify that children ’s products meet lead - content standards .
“ We do n’t have the means to test or certify .
That would have impacted our sales because we sell a lot of children ’s clothes and toys , ” Hamilton said .
“ The Salvation Army always provides us with a list of recalls and we go through everything in the warehouse before it goes on the shelves .
We are very strong on keeping our children safe . ” [ Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman Scott ]
Wolfson stated that the law was not intended to drive resellers out of business .
“ The target is the manufacturers of defective products , ” he said .
“ We ’re calling for the proprietors of thrift stores to try and go back to the supplier .
Was it tested ?
Was it certified ? ”

All I have to so is imagine picking something up or gripping it and the fingers and thumb move automatically . "
They use necromantic arts to resurrect Macbeth , and he soon embarks on a wild killing spree , turning most of the Scottish court into zombies and raising the corpse of his wife ( Laura Maitland ) along the way .
Macbeth ( Craig Annis ) has been slain by Macduff ( Grant Foulkes ) .
When the newly crowned Malcolm ( Ben Ewing ) refuses to grant the tyrant a Christian burial , it plays into the hands of Hecate ( Pieta Farrell ) and her witches ( Shireen Morris , Brooke Antulov , Erin Oliver ) .
When the cowardly Fleance ( Michael Finney ) assumes the throne , it seems that Scotland 's only hope lies with Macduff , who must quest into the maw of hell itself to stop an undead scourge laying waste to the country .
Remarkably , Mence has written the play in iambic pentameter .
He has a flair for it .
While there 's a lot of groanworthy Shakespearean parody , there 's just as much clever pastiche and occasionally , the sort of vivid and inventive homage that could sustain a scholarly hoax .
Then there are the zombies .
With ghoulish make - up , bits of offal and fake blood , the actors come into their own as the play descends into a schlocky gorefest ( much of it inspired by Sam Raimi 's Evil Dead movies - Macbeth even chops off his own hand and attaches a chainsaw to the stump ) .

A poop tube is a great way to manage your waste when you ’re in nature .
You can save money and make your own tube from a PVC pipe , coupler , cleanout and plug , toilet flange , and PVC cement .
You ’ll need to remove the metal collar of the toilet flange with a mallet , connect the longer tube to the flange with PVC cement , attach the coupler to the opposite end , and glue the coupler to the cleanout and plug .
Wait at least 12 hours for the cement to set before you use your tube .
When you ’re away from a toilet , just poop on a paper towel or plastic bag , wrap it in a sealable bag , and seal it inside your poop tube .
For more tips , including how to coat the inside of your poop tube to help seal the smell inside , read on .
Schwarzenegger Sends Letter To Obama Asking For A Waiver On National Environmental Policy Act Requirements .
On Monday , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger asked President - Elect Barack Obama to waive the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) requirements to help jump start the Nation ’s flailing economy .
[ social_buttons ]
Schwarzenegger met with Obama last month in Philadelphia , where he urged the Federal government to invest in infrastructure .
Something he ’s been peddling alongside New York City ’s Mayor Bloomberg since early 2008 .
The Governor ’s administration has identified four key areas where they “ can work together ” in stabilizing and expanding California ’s economy : investment in infrastructure , energy security , stabilization of the housing market , and assistance to states to help meet the needs of the medically indigent .
>> More on Schwarzenegger ’s environmental policy
During their meeting Schwarzenegger had identified $ 28 billion in infrastructure projects ready to break ground , that number is now $ 44 billion !
The projects are in communities across California and include :
$ 11.8 billion in energy efficiency projects
$ 11 billion in investment of road , transit and rail construction
$ 4 billion in health care investment
$ 1.1 billion in schools
More than $ 5 billion in parks and public safety
This would lead to an estimated 800,000 jobs for the Golden State .
But there is a bit of a rub .
The Governor ’s office requested that the NEPA requirements be waived , or at the very least “ streamlined , ” such that the California Environment Quality Act ( CEQA ) requirements will satisfy NEPA .
From what I can find , it seems that the two acts are not that much different .
But some of Arnold ’s past environmental decisions have made me more than skeptical ( see : Gov. Schwarzenegger Terminates California ’s Endangered Fish ) .
But if he gets his way , Schwarzenegger claims major greenhouse gas emission reductions from these upgrades .
He is also requesting tax credits for renewable energy projects .
For projects placed in service in 2009 , he is asking that accelerated depreciations be refundable .

After spending most of the day in school , children are typically given additional assignments to be completed at home .
This is a rather curious fact when you stop to think about it , but not as curious as the fact that few people ever stop to think about it .
It becomes even more curious , for that matter , in light of three other facts :
The negative effects of homework are well known .
They include children ’s frustration and exhaustion , lack of time for other activities , and possible loss of interest in learning .
Many parents lament the impact of homework on their relationship with their children ; they may also resent having to play the role of enforcer and worry that they will be criticized either for not being involved enough with the homework or for becoming too involved .
The positive effects of homework are largely mythical .
In preparation for a book on the topic , I ’ve spent a lot of time sifting through the research .
The results are nothing short of stunning .
For starters , there is absolutely no evidence of any academic benefit from assigning homework in elementary or middle school .
For younger students , in fact , there is n’t even a correlation between whether children do homework ( or how much they do ) and any meaningful measure of achievement .
At the high school level , the correlation is weak and tends to disappear when more sophisticated statistical measures are applied .
Meanwhile , no study has ever substantiated the belief that homework builds character or teaches good study habits .
More homework is being piled on children despite the absence of its value .
Over the last quarter - century the burden has increased most for the youngest children , for whom the evidence of positive effects is n’t just dubious ; it ’s nonexistent .
It ’s not as though most teachers decide now and then that a certain lesson really ought to continue after school is over because meaningful learning is so likely to result from such an assignment that it warrants the intrusion on family time .
Homework in most schools is n’t limited to those occasions when it seems appropriate and important .
Rather , the point of departure seems to be : “ We ’ve decided ahead of time that children will have to do something every night ( or several times a week ) .
Later on we ’ll figure out what to make them do . ”
I ’ve heard from countless people across the country about the frustration they feel over homework .
Parents who watch a torrent of busywork spill out of their children ’s backpacks wish they could help teachers understand how the cons overwhelmingly outweigh the pros .
And teachers who have long harbored doubts about the value of homework feel pressured by those parents who mistakenly believe that a lack of afterschool assignments reflects an insufficient commitment to academic achievement .
Such parents seem to reason that as long as their kids have lots of stuff to do every night , never mind what it is , then learning must be taking place .
What parents and teachers need is support from administrators who are willing to challenge the conventional wisdom .
They need principals who question the slogans that pass for arguments : that homework creates a link between school and family ( as if there were n’t more constructive ways to make that connection ! ) , or that it “ reinforces ” what students were taught in class ( a word that denotes the repetition of rote behaviors , not the development of understanding ) , or that it teaches children self - discipline and responsibility ( a claim for which absolutely no evidence exists ) .
Above all , principals need to help their faculties see that the most important criterion for judging decisions about homework ( or other policies , for that matter ) is the impact they ’re likely to have on students ’ attitudes about what they ’re doing .
“ Most of what homework is doing is driving kids away from learning , ” says education professor Harvey Daniels .
Let ’s face it :
Most children dread homework , or at best see it as something to be gotten through .
Thus , even if it did provide other benefits , they would have to be weighed against its likely effect on kids ’ love of learning .
*
So what ’s a thoughtful principal to do ?
Educate yourself and share what you ’ve learned with teachers , parents , and central office administrators .
Make sure you know what the research really says – that there is no reason to believe that children would be at any disadvantage in terms of their academic learning or life skills if they had much less homework , or even none at all .
Whatever decisions are made should be based on fact rather than folk wisdom .
Rethink standardized “ homework policies . ”
Requiring teachers to give a certain number of minutes of homework every day , or to make assignments on the same schedule every week ( for example , x minutes of math on Tuesdays and Thursdays ) is a frank admission that homework is n’t justified by a given lesson , much less is it a response to what specific kids need at a specific time .
Such policies sacrifice thoughtful instruction in order to achieve predictability , and they manage to do a disservice not only to students but , when imposed from above , to teachers as well .
Reduce the amount – but do n’t stop there .
Many parents are understandably upset with how much time their children have to spend on homework .
At a minimum , make sure that teachers are n’t exceeding district guidelines and that they are n’t chronically underestimating how long it takes students to complete the assignments .
( As one mother told me , “ It ’s cheating to say this is 20 minutes of homework if only your fastest kid can complete it in that time . ” )
Then work on reducing the amount of homework irrespective of such guidelines and expectations so that families , not schools , decide how they will spend most of their evenings .
Quantity , however , is not the only issue that needs to be addressed .
Some assignments , frankly , are n’t worth even five minutes of a student ’s time .
Too many first graders are forced to clip words from magazines that begin with a given letter of the alphabet .
Too many fifth graders have to color in an endless list of factor pairs on graph paper .
Too many eighth graders spend their evenings inching their way through dull , overstuffed , committee - written textbooks , one chapter at a time .
Teachers should be invited to reflect on whether any given example of homework will help students think deeply about questions that matter .
What philosophy of teaching , what theory of learning , lies behind each assignment ?
Does it seem to assume that children are meaning makers -- or empty vessels ?
Is learning regarded as a process that ’s mostly active or passive ?
Is it about wrestling with ideas or mindlessly following directions ?
Change the default .
Ultimately , it ’s not enough just to have less homework or even better homework .
We should change the fundamental expectation in our schools so that students are asked to take schoolwork home only when a there ’s a reasonable likelihood that a particular assignment will be beneficial to most of them .
When that ’s not true , they should be free to spend their after - school hours as they choose .
The bottom line :
No homework except on those occasions when it ’s truly necessary .
This , of course , is a reversal of the current default state , which amounts to an endorsement of homework for its own sake , regardless of the content , a view that simply ca n’t be justified .
Ask the kids .
Find out what students think of homework and solicit their suggestions – perhaps by distributing anonymous questionnaires .
Many adults simply assume that homework is useful for promoting learning without even inquiring into the experience of the learners themselves !
Do students find that homework really is useful ?
Why or why not ?
Are certain kinds better than others ?
How does homework affect their desire to learn ?
What are its other effects on their lives , and on their families ?
Suggest that teachers assign only what they design .
In most cases , students should be asked to do only what teachers are willing to create themselves , as opposed to prefabricated worksheets or generic exercises photocopied from textbooks .
Also , it rarely makes sense to give the same assignment to all students in a class because it ’s unlikely to be beneficial for most of them .
Those who already understand the concept will be wasting their time , and those who do n’t understand will become increasingly frustrated .
There is no perfect assignment that will stimulate every student because one size simply does n’t fit all .
On those days when homework really seems necessary , teachers should create several assignments fitted to different interests and capabilities .
But it ’s better to give no homework to anyone than the same homework to everyone .
Use homework as an opportunity to involve students in decision - making .
One way to judge the quality of a classroom is by the extent to which students participate in making choices about their learning .
The best teachers know that children learn how to make good decisions by making decisions , not by following directions .
Students should have something to say about what they ’re going to learn and the circumstances under which they ’ll learn it , as well as how ( and when ) their learning will be evaluated , how the room will be set up , how conflicts will be resolved , and a lot more .
What is true of education in general is true of homework in particular .
At least two investigators have found that the most impressive teachers ( as defined by various criteria ) tend to involve students in decisions about assignments rather than simply telling them what they ’ll have to do at home .
A reasonable first question for a parent to ask upon seeing a homework assignment is “ How much say did the kids have in determining how this had to be done , and on what schedule , and whether it really needed to be completed at home in the first place ? ”
A discussion about whether homework might be useful ( and why ) can be valuable in its own right .
If opinions are varied , the question of what to do when everyone does n’t agree – take a vote ?
keep talking until we reach consensus ?
look for a compromise ?
– develops social skills as well as intellectual growth .
And that growth occurs precisely because the teacher asked rather than told .
Teachers who consult with their students on a regular basis would shake their heads vigorously were you to suggest that kids will always say no to homework – or to anything else that requires effort .
It ’s just not true , they ’ll tell you .
When students are treated with respect , when the assignments are worth doing , most kids relish a challenge .
If , on the other hand , students groan about , or try to avoid , homework , it ’s generally because they get too much of it , or because it ’s assigned thoughtlessly and continuously , or simply because they had nothing to say about it .
The benefits of even high - quality assignments are limited if students feel “ done to ” instead of “ worked with . ”
Help teachers move away from grading .
Your faculty may need your support , encouragement , and practical suggestions to help them abandon a model in which assignments are checked off or graded , where the point is to enforce compliance , and toward a model in which students explain and explore with one another what they ’ve done -- what they liked and disliked about the book they read , what they ’re struggling with , what new questions they came up with .
As the eminent educator Martin Haberman observed , homework in the best classrooms “ is not checked – it is shared . ”
If students conclude that there ’s no point in spending time on assignments that are n’t going to be collected or somehow recorded , that ’s not an argument for setting up bribes and threats and a climate of distrust ; it ’s an indictment of the homework itself .
Experiment .
Ask teachers who are reluctant to rethink their long - standing reliance on traditional homework to see what happens if , during a given week or curriculum unit , they tried assigning none .
Surely anyone who believes that homework is beneficial should be willing to test that assumption by investigating the consequences of its absence .
What are the effects of a moratorium on students ’ achievement , on their interest in learning , on their moods and the resulting climate of the classroom ?
Likewise , the school as a whole can try out a new policy , such as the change in default that I ’ve proposed , on a tentative basis before committing to it permanently .
* Principals deal with an endless series of crises ; they ’re called upon to resolve complaints , soothe wounded egos , negotiate solutions , try to keep everyone happy , and generally make the trains ( or , rather , buses ) run on time .
In such a position there is a strong temptation to avoid new initiatives that call the status quo into question .
Considerable gumption is required to take on an issue like homework , particularly during an era when phrases like “ raising the bar ” and “ higher standards ” are used to rationalize practices that range from foolish to inappropriate to hair - raising .
But of course a principal ’s ultimate obligation is to do what ’s right by the children , to protect them from harmful mandates and practices that persist not because they ’re valuable but merely because they ’re traditional .
For anyone willing to shake things up in order to do what makes sense , beginning a conversation about homework is a very good place to start .
RESOURCES
We are awash in articles and books that claim homework is beneficial – or simply take the existence or value of homework for granted and merely offer suggestions for how it ought to be assigned , or what techniques parents should use to make children complete it .

A taxi driver drugged and sexually assaulted a string of women passengers after pretending he had won the lottery , a court heard today .
John Worboys , 51 , preyed on young women he picked up in London 's West End , Croydon Crown Court was told .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He is accused of using date rape drugs dissolved in champagne to " stupefy " his victims before attacking them in the back of the cab .
Prosecutor Johannah Cutts QC said Worboys attacked 14 women during an 18 - month reign of terror until his arrest last February .
She said Worboys cruised the streets of central London late at night in his black cab looking for single women to offer discount lifts home to .
Miss Cutts said : " His primary intent had nothing to do with taking them home .
His primary purpose was wholly sexual in nature .
" His intent was to ensure that they were completely at his mercy and then to sexually molest them .
" Having each girl alone in his cab was a start but this defendant wanted to ensure that there would be no struggle , no difficulty in achieving this aim .
How did he do that ?
He did it by drugging them . "
Worboys employed date rape drugs to render his victims powerless and to make them forgetful , the court was told .
Miss Cutts said : " Mr Worboys made regular use of such drugs , administering them to female passengers in his cab in the hope that they would render them unconscious and thereby unable to resist his sexual advances .

" The additional benefit to him of using such drugs is that these drugs cause what is called anterograde amnesia .
That is memory loss and the forgetting of events and experiences that occurred after the drug took effect . "
The jury was told Worboys would tell passengers he had won a large amount of money either in the lottery or at a casino .
Miss Cutts said the cab driver sometimes showed passengers a carrier bag full of cash to back up his story .
She said : " He would begin by engaging the girl in conversation , asking about her night and the like .
" Once they were talking , he told her that he was glad that he had met her as he had experienced some good fortune that night in that he had won a quantity of cash .
" In most cases he said that this had been at a casino .
Sometimes he said it was by way of the lottery .
" Sometimes he specified the sum that he had won .
When he did so it was generally a substantial sum . "
During the conversation Worboys would invite his victims to share a bottle of champagne and pour them a glass from the front of the cab , the court heard .
Miss Cutts said although some passengers did not want to drink , they felt it would be rude to refuse .
Some just pretended , she added .
She said : " The drink was rarely poured in front of them .
As the defendant often had a drink at the same time as the complainant , it seems likely that he added the drug at the point at which he poured the drink .
" In every case where the drink was consumed in any quantity , it had a powerful effect . "
Worboys would then get into the back of the cab and engage his victim in further conversation , this time of a sexual nature , as he watched the drug take effect .
Miss Cutts said : " In each case he was able to see when his passenger became affected by the drug .
Many of the complainants remember falling asleep or losing consciousness .
" Most have no recollection of what happened thereafter until they got home , or in some cases until the next day .
Many are not able to say whether they were sexually assaulted or not .
" But the defendant 's intent in drugging them was clear .
Some of the complainants did come round a little in the cab having consumed the drink .
" Those that did come round remember the defendant touching them sexually in some way .
One of them remembers him actually having sexual intercourse with her and was powerless to resist . "
Worboys , of Rotherhithe , south east London , denies 23 charges including rape , sexual assault and administering a substance with intent .
When Worboys ' home was searched , Miss Cutts said discoveries were made " which we say showed all too clearly his intent when he went out in his cab at night " .
Pictures shown to the jury included Worboys ' Fiat Punto , which was taken to a police compound and searched .
Inside the boot was found a " tool kit " containing what Miss Cutts said was everything he needed to stupefy and sexually assault a passenger , including four small bottles of champagne .
In a blue bag with Petroleum written on it were gloves , a beret , a map and a torch .
In addition , officers found a large number of plastic gloves , plastic cups and a vibrator in a box .
The vibrator was sent away for forensic tests and the DNA of one of his alleged victims was found on it , jurors were told .
The blue bag contained a further blue carrier bag , inside which was a single Durex condom and a box of mixed flavour condoms .
Also found was a strip of Nytol tablets , which jurors were told contains an antihistamine called diphenhydramine with sedative properties .
Miss Cutts said : " As you would expect , its effects include drowsiness as well as sometimes causing dizziness , fatigue , loss of co-ordination , blurred vision and dryness of mouth .
" Any sedation associated with the use of the drug is likely to be enhanced by the consumption of alcohol at the same time .
Indeed , the tablets carry a warning to avoid alcohol . "
An ashtray and spoon which was found in the bag were washed with solvent and tested , Miss Cutts said .
She said the drug diphenhydramine was found on both items , which was " significant " because traces were found in the urine of two of the alleged victims .
The drug , along with traces of Temazapam , was also found in a half - pint cup at Worboys ' home , jurors were told .
That cup contained the DNA of a further alleged victim and , said Miss Cutts , was one of the drugs used by Worboys to stupefy the women .
Temazapam was found in urine samples provided by two women who had not knowingly taken it .
The Fiat Punto boot also contained wine boxes , bottles of Jack Daniels , whisky , gin and vodka in addition to bottles of wine .
" These too are significant , " said Miss Cutts .
" In every case the defendant began by offering the complainant champagne or home - made wine .
" But he also had other types of alcohol should , we say , the complainant be happy to accept his offer of a drink but not like champagne . "
Miss Cutts said : " The combination of these items , many of which you would not expect together , in the bags in the boot of his car show how prepared the defendant was .
" Everything he needed for his enterprise was there .
" The alcohol - his celebratory bottle of champagne ; the glasses in which to pour it ; the additional alcohol in case it is preferred to champagne ; the drugs - Nytol and Temazapam ; the condoms and the vibrator .
" As we say , Mr Worboys was not opportunistic .
He knew what he wanted and he was prepared . "
The powerful sedatives left Worboys ' victims insensible and with little memory of their ordeal , the court was told .
But one woman remembered being raped , a second woke up to find him with his hand up her skirt and a third said he exposed himself .
Miss Cutts said : " The prosecution say there can be no clearer indication of his intent in administering the drug than from his behaviour with these women . "
Several women contacted police with similar stories , but it was not until last year that Worboys ' " luck began to run out " , the jury was told .
Police identified the cab driver after one woman , who was driven from London Bridge to Twickenham on February 5 , contacted them with her concerns .
They linked her case to four other victims with remarkably similar stories and arrested Worboys 10 days later , Miss Cutts said .
Several more victims came forward to tell police their stories following press reports of his arrest .
Detectives discovered many of the women 's journeys home took considerably longer than necessary .
They found he targeted women who had been drinking and on some occasions dropped off their friends before pouncing , the court heard .
Miss Cutts said : " He always waited until he dropped one off before he began to tell his utterly bogus story of winning cash to the one remaining . "
There were a lot of speculations going around the Internet regarding the upcoming release date of Clash of Clans TH12 update .
For some , it will arrive in 2018 , while others think that it will be no later than 2019 .
Well , here are some reasons why it might not happen any time soon .
Supercell , the game ’s developer , has yet to fine - tune TH11 , as it tries to look on new possibilities for the troops and heroes alike
Troop levels can still be increased , just as the hero and the wall upgrades are imminent in order to distinguish it to TH10’s
Supercell is also looking to bridge the gap between TH11s and TH10s , so it is much more of an improvement rather than bringing in new Town Hall level components
Basically , only a small percentage of players are having maxed out TH11 bases who are eagerly awaiting for TH12 .
In fact , majority of the active players are still in TH8 , TH9 , and TH10 .
Thus , they are working harder than ever to put the game to an end .
Supercell , to the very least , would also want to discourage players to continue playing having the same drive by introducing a new TH level .
Builder Base
Before the max bases of TH11 are ready for TH12 , Supercell is quick to introduce the Builder Base .
Thus , it is obvious that Supercell is giving them something that max TH11s can play separately from the Home Village .
Nevertheless , with rumors regarding the release date of TH12 , you ca n’t help but wonder about the new things that might be introduced to the game .
Final Say
According to people who indulge in analyzing the current trend of Clash of Clans , there is a great possibility that the TH12 update will happen this year .
But the problem is the exact date of release , since there are lots of things yet to be accomplished by Supercell .
The hair is a little thinner and the belt around the waist may have gone out half a notch , but the competitive glint still burns brightly in Pete Sampras ' eye .
If he was still at his peak , the 37 - year - old American was asked yesterday , would he still play the serve - and - volley game that brought him seven Wimbledon titles but has become as outdated as the racket he used to wield ?
" You bet I would , " he replied .
" I would n't change a thing .
That was the way I was taught to play .
And I can tell you right now that it would be successful in today 's game . "
Sampras is back in Britain for the first time since his last appearance at Wimbledon six years ago , when he lost to Switzerland 's George Bastl , the world No 145 , in the second round .
It was a defeat that hastened his retirement , even if he did have one more Grand Slam title in him at the US Open later that summer .
The former world No 1 always said that he would never play on the seniors ' circuit , but this week he is competing at the BlackRock Masters at the Royal Albert Hall , with John McEnroe his first opponent .
" It 's nice to be back in London , even if it is still raining , " he said on his arrival at a venue where he last played 19 years ago , in the world doubles championship .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
So why did the man with a record 14 Grand Slam titles return to the court ?
" Every person who retires takes two , three or four years to decompress , " Sampras said .
" I did n't know what retirement was going to be like – and it 's tricky .
Every athlete who retires at a young age will tell you that they try to find different ways to keep themselves fulfilled .
When you retire at 31 , as I did , it 's difficult .
For three years I did n't do a thing .
I put on some weight and I was n't feeling too good about myself .
I was playing golf , playing poker and other fun things , but you just wake up and think , ' What am I going to do today ? '
To be 31 and retired is great , but at the same time I 've always been a worker , since I was a teenager .
After a few years I needed something more to do . "
Sampras picked up his racket again for an exhibition match in April 2006 and played World Team Tennis , a relaxed format featuring sets of singles and doubles , later that summer .
However , it was not until he spent some time practising with Roger Federer in California early last year – and found that he could hold his own against the then world No 1 – that his thoughts turned to more regular appearances .
He played Federer in three exhibition matches in Asia in the autumn , the Swiss winning in Seoul and Kuala Lumpur and Sampras winning in Macau .
Federer won again when they played in New York earlier this year .
En route to London this week Sampras played exhibitions in Bratislava , where he beat Dominik Hrbaty , and in Prague , where he beat Radek Stepanek , the current world No27 .
" I can still serve and volley reasonably well , " he said .
" My body 's holding up fine , because these are hard matches for me .
I do n't play at this level very often .
It should be a little bit easier this week . "
Married to a Hollywood actress and with two young children , Sampras has no intention of globe - trotting for weeks on end , but he is enjoying the occasional chance to show his talents again , particularly against the likes of McEnroe , Stefan Edberg , Pat Cash and Greg Rusedski , who are all competing at the Royal Albert Hall .
" It 's not as though I feel I have to come here and win the event , " Sampras said .
" I 'd like to , but it 's not like it used to be when I was in my mid-twenties and it was all or nothing .
That being said , people want to see me and all the guys play well and we all take a great pride in our tennis .
I still want to win and play great .
It 's not as easy as it used to be .
I do n't move as well , but I can still do a few things pretty well . "
He added : " I enjoy my lifestyle at home .
Combining it with a light schedule , staying in shape and hitting a few tennis balls makes me a better father and husband .
If I 'm not doing much during the day I lose patience and ask myself : ' What am I doing with my life ? '
I still enjoy playing tennis .
I do n't have to play too much .
I only play every three or four months . "
Federer has become a good friend and Sampras expects him to win the two titles he needs to break the American 's record number of Grand Slam crowns .
" I 'd love the record to stand for ever , but if it is going to be broken then someone like Roger deserves it , " Sampras said .
" He 's a credit to the game .
" We text each other quite a bit .
He tells me how he 's doing and asks what I 'm up to .
We had a week together in Asia and we clicked .
Our personalities are similar .
He 's pretty sarcastic and pretty dry .
We had a great time . "
If Federer were to beat his milestone at Wimbledon next summer , Sampras said he would like to be there " out of respect to both Roger and this record " .
Was he tempted to make the short journey to have a look round the All England Club again this week ?
" I 've been thinking about it .
I might take a drive to check it out and walk on Centre Court one more time .
" I 've missed the place , there 's no doubt .
I 've missed Centre Court .
I 'd love to play there one more time .
I 'd maybe ask the club if they would let me play a practice set or something , though that might be tough .
I miss the place and I hope to be back either this week or at some point over the next few years and take my kids there .
It 's an historic place and it did a lot for my career .
I have a lot of great memories there .
There 's no place like it in the world . "
Sampras believes Federer can win " as many Wimbledons as he wants " , despite losing his world No 1 status and his All England Club crown to Rafael Nadal .
" One thing Roger has over him is that I think it takes him a lot less energy to stay on top than it does Rafa , " Sampras said .
" It takes a lot of work for Rafa to win his matches .
He puts so much effort into each point that eventually something is going to break .
He 's an absolute animal , but as strong as he is , I think the body will take its toll .
There 's a certain grind that he goes through , unlike Roger , who 's a lot more fluid .
His matches are a lot easier . "
Sampras believes that Federer , Nadal , Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray will dominate the game in the next few years .
He says that all Murray needs to win his first Grand Slam title is self - belief .
" He belongs there , but it takes time , " Sampras said .
" It took me time to feel I really belonged .
I could sense watching the US Open final this year that he did n't really believe that he could win that match .
I think if he was in that situation next year he would have a stronger belief . "

Luo , a local villager from Hanshan , China , did not return home from work during lunch as she does on a daily basis .
Her husband , worried for her safety , went to some cotton fields nearby where Luo worked .
While looking for his wife , the husband noticed a large snake trail and immediately became nervous that his wife might have been attacked by a snake .
A few minutes of searching later he came upon a large Python with a belly so full it could not move .
The husband knew immediately that his wife had been eaten by this snake and he ran off to find some local villagers to help .
They returned moments later and shot the snake in the head .
They quickly cut the snake open and found Luo inside the snakes stomach .
Unfortunately they did not find her in time and she did not survive the ordeal .
Two years ago , all it took to bypass airport security was filling out a form :
Grant was flying from Boston to San Diego on Jan. 1 , 2007 , when he approached an American Airlines ticket counter at Logan International Airport and flashed a badge he carries as a part - time assistant harbor master in Chatham , according to federal prosecutors .
Grant , a medical supplies salesman , also filled out a “ flying while armed ” form and wrote that he worked for the Department of Homeland Security , prosecutors said .
[…]
He allegedly did the same on his return trip to Boston three days later .
But this time , according to court documents , he was invited into the cockpit , was told the identity of the two air marshals on the flight , and was informed who else on the plane was armed , which raises security concerns .
Suspend / Resume now works on my ThinkPad R52 with FreeBSD
I have n’t bothered trying to get suspend / resume to work on my ThinkPad R52 for a while .
It has been long enough that I do n’t remember what I tried — so I do n’t know if what I did to get it working this time was something I had tried before and , at the time , did n’t work .
Some software on my system has been updated , and some configuration changed , since then .
As such , it ’s possible that the exact same thing that worked this time did n’t work before .
It ’s also possible that , in the midst of my experimenting and research , I just managed to miss the very easy fix for getting things working on FreeBSD .
Relevant Specs
Hardware : ThinkPad R52 Mobility Radeon X300
Software : FreeBSD 6.2- RELEASE
( yes , I need to upgrade that )
xorg.conf : Driver “ radeon ”
loader.conf : radeon_load= ” YES ”
That ’s it for preëxisting system specs that seem relevant and changeable .
Obviously , there ’s more that might have a bearing on whether this works for you , but I think it ’s all stuff that falls under the control of one of the specs I already brought up ( such as hardware details that are determined by the fact it ’s an R52 ) .
Relevant Config Changes
I added this to my /etc/sysctl.conf : hw.acpi.reset_video=1
I added this to my / boot/loader.conf : acpiibmload= ” YES ”
Any other possibly relevant settings I left at default values .
The defaults involve closing the lid not changing suspend state , for instance — which is what I want , since I tend to close my lid a lot ( after locking the screen ) when I walk away from my laptop for a few minutes , and do n’t want networking interrupted every time I do so .
Another default is having hardware devices turned off when the system is suspended so that less power is used , since I only really need to suspend when I move my laptop from one network to another anyway .
After rebooting my computer once , suspend and resume seem to work flawlessly .
I ’ll be using suspend from time to time now , and checking to see whether any unexpected problems surface , but so far it looks good .
I ’m just amazed at how easy that is , and how annoyingly difficult it is to find information that very clearly lays out the importance of these two configuration file options .
Maybe my discovery will help someone else .
The next revolution in agriculture and greenhouse gas reduction may be a 3000 - year old farming practice of adding biomass charcoal to the soil .
The practice was re-discovered by archeologists who were studying a site in the central - Amazon basin .
Some 1500 years earlier the indigenous tribes had enriched the soil using charcoal from animal bone and tree bark .
The soil remains today some of the richest and most fertile soil yet found .
Scientists from the American Chemical Society have begun a five - year study of the use of biomass charcoal for soil enrichment in order to understand its impact on fertilization , soil carbon changes , crop productivity and any impact on the microorganisms in the soil .
The practice holds promise for several reasons :
Soil need only be fertilized once with this method and the effect lasts for hundreds to thousands of years .
The resulting agricultural method is carbon - negative since the enriched soil traps and holds carbon in the soil , which may offer significant benefits to decreasing global warming from agriculture and reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
The charcoal required would be made from biomass like compost , leaves , wood chips and organic matter resulting in a non-toxic and stable fertilizer .
Smoke generated during the burning process , called pyrolysis , could even be collected and cooled to use as a bio -oil renewable energy source .
The practice could be a low - cost way to enrich soil in the most impoverished areas where poor soil quality and drought have led to high rates of hunger and malnutrition .
Scoring points on the altruism scale , scientists involved say they will not seek a patent on the process if the study is successful .
They want the practice they call “ Black Gold Agriculture ” put into use as soon and as widely as possible .
It ’s a fascinating prospect that an answer to help save our earth would come from that very earth , and was in use for thousands of years .
Currently the only foreseeable downsides to the approach is the cost to transport the biochar mass and the need for different farming tools to spread the product over large areas .

Credit card companies are facing an investigation by competition watchdogs after defying government warnings to improve their lending practices .
An analysis by The Independent has found that the cost of card borrowing has risen over the past three months despite three cuts to the Bank of England base rate .
Cardholders are now facing average interest rates of 17.7 per cent on credit cards , up from 16.6 per cent 12 months ago .
The Business Secretary , Lord Mandelson , had given providers two weeks to come up with fair principles to help cardholders manage their debts following a summit with card providers in November .
By Thursday , the Government is expecting proposals from the industry on how it will implement fair principles on existing debt , responsibly provide credit and support households in difficulty .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Failing to do so could see the card companies facing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) , but so far card providers have made no move to reduce the expensive lending rates which so often plunge debtors into further financial hardship .
One government source said last night : " We are not backing off .
If the companies do n't move , if necessary , we will go down the OFT route . "
Only two cards , those designed to track the base rate , have reduced rates since Lord Mandelson 's ultimatum and Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank have gone ahead with increases to the rates and fees they charge their Gold Mastercard customers .
Halifax and the Bank of Scotland have also increased balance transfer fees .
A spokesman for Clydesdale Bank said : " The changes in our rates were announced in October and our rates remain very competitive .
We fully support the Government 's initiatives for helping people in difficulties . "
Store card debtors are facing even higher rates despite cheaper borrowing for lenders .
The average cost of borrowing is now 25 per cent a year , up from 23.9 per cent this time last year , with no sign of a cut in rates even though the base rate has dropped from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent over the same period .
But based on the industry 's response this week , Lord Mandelson and the Consumer Affairs minister Gareth Thomas are expecting to produce a plan to address the dramatic increases in some cardholders ' bills .
A spokeswoman for the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said : " We 've asked lenders to report back by the end of this week and have been in continuing talks with industry following our summit [ on 26 November ] .
We have every expectation that industry will come back with proposals to stop the pockets of bad behaviour that we have identified in risk - based repricing and will continue to work with them to ensure borrowers are treated fairly , responsibly and consistently . "
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman , said : " The Government has got to get tough with credit card companies determined to make a quick buck out the millions of people struggling to make ends meet .
Tough words are worthless unless they are backed up with real action . "
Alan Duncan , the Conservatives ' business spokesman , accused ministers of pumping out " hot air " .
He said : " The Government 's policy after the banks ' bailout has clearly not reached the credit card sector .
It has done nothing to clamp down on credit card ownership – particularly by the most vulnerable people . "
Industry leaders have been summoned to another meeting with Mr Thomas on Thursday .
Apacs , the UK payments association , denied interest - rate rises were the problem .
" Risk - based pricing is not about the base rate at all , " said a spokeswoman .
" This is about a customer with a card whose APR may go up as a consequence of changes to their circumstances .
It is a feature of credit cards that the interest on this unsecured borrowing may be adjusted .
If the customer can't pay , the provider has no security on getting the money back and may decide to re-price the cost of using the card .
The agreements that were made [ at the summit ] were about breathing space for customers in difficulty . "
Critics of the move believe a half - hearted approach will make little difference to consumers .
Martin Lewis , of Moneysavingexpert.com , said : " This ultimatum is absolute nonsense , and shows that Lord Mandelson has never had any connection to credit cards in his life .
Is he saying that credit card companies should drop their interest rates in line with the base rate drop , from an average of 18 per cent to one of 15 per cent ?
To make this work they would actually have to cut their interest rates by 60 per cent to mirror the real changes in the base rate , so if even if every credit card on the market took 3 per cent off their interest rates it would mean nothing . "
Credit and store card companies have long been accused of employing dirty tricks to boost income .
The order of payments is regularly skewed so that the most expensive debt , with the highest interest rate , is paid off last .

Man navigates obstacles he can't consciously see .
' Blindsight ' can allow people to be aware of their surroundings without consciously seeing .
Punchstock
A man with brain damage that makes him clinically blind can navigate an obstacle course , seemingly by using a primitive part of his brain to perceive the objects in his path .
This remarkable ability , discovered through a chance observation , is shedding light on a curious phenomenon known as blindsight .
The man , known as patient TN , was studied by a multinational team led by Beatrice de Gelder at Tilburg University in The Netherlands and Alan Pegna of the Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland .
The researchers tested TN extensively to confirm that he was completely blind .
They used brain imaging to show that there was no activity in his visual cortex , the part of the brain that processes most of the information coming from the retina .
They then persuaded TN to set his stick aside and walk down a corridor strewn with lab equipment .
He was able to do so flawlessly , despite being unable to consciously see any of the obstacles .
Head down and hands loose by his side , he twisted his body to slalom slowly but surely between a camera tripod and a swingbin , and neatly stepped around a random series of smaller items .
" At first he was nervous , " says de Gelder .
" He said he would n't be able to do it because he was blind . "
The scientists broke into spontaneous cheers when he succeeded .
The results are reported today in Current Biology1 .
Subconscious sight
The 56 - year - old patient lives in Burundi .
He had been a doctor for the World Health Organization before suffering two consecutive strokes in 2003 , which , in an unusual coincidence , sequentially wiped out the visual cortex in each of his brain 's hemispheres .
He had no significant damage to other parts of his brain .
Blindsight requires that a patient 's eyes are not damaged .
Most studies of blindsight in humans have been conducted in people with damage to the visual cortex in just one hemisphere , making them blind on only one side of their visual field .
Tests of blindsight usually involve presenting pictures to individuals ' blind side and asking them to guess aspects of the pictures ' content .
Without being aware of it , they are usually able to discriminate , to a limited extent , characteristics such as colour , the orientation of a rod and emotional expressions on faces .
Scientists believe this happens because a small part of the visual input to the brain from the retina is diverted to more primitive parts of the brain that operate below the level of consciousness .
But such patients seem not to rely on blindsight for navigation , bumping into objects on their blind side .
TN is the first patient reported in the literature to have symmetrical elimination of the visual cortex on both sides of the brain .
Pegna had previously shown that TN is able to recognize whether the expressions on faces he can't consciously see are happy or sad2 , and wanted to extend the study .
De Gelder wanted to test her idea that body language may also be detectable by blindsight .
So in May 2007 , the team of scientists flew TN over to the Netherlands for a week - long series of experiments .
Originally , navigation was not among them .
" But we noticed he seemed to be avoiding objects in his path , so we added another simple experiment to find out if he really was sensing them , " says Pegna .
Unknown signals
Some blind people can use their hearing to assist in navigation , sensing the reflection of sound waves to help them locate obstacles .
" We do n't think this is likely to be the answer [ in TN ] because echolocation is not so efficient for small objects , and he could avoid them with precision , " says de Gelder .
Blindsight pioneer Alan Cowey , a neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford , UK , points out that TN was not blindfolded to block out all visual input at any stage of the test , " so it ca n't be ruled out that he was using the echo of the sound of his own breathing or footsteps " .
But if echolocation is not the answer , then TN 's blindsight ability shows something very interesting about our brains , Cowey says .
" It seems that in the real world , we may be able to use signals in the brain of which we are completely unaware . "
The scientists are planning to bring TN back to Europe for further testing .
" Being a doctor , he is very aware of the interest his case presents for basic scientists , and wants to help , " says Pegna .
Other experiments will include looking in more detail at how emotional stimuli are processed at the subconscious level , he adds .

IT HAS been dubbed the Proteus motor , after the miniature submarine that travelled through the human body in the science fiction movie Fantastic Voyage .
And its Australian creators hope their tiny motor - which is less than the width of three human hairs - will soon power medical nanorobots that can swim through tiny blood vessels into the brain .
James Friend , of Monash University , said that such devices could enter previously unreachable brain areas , unblocking blood clots , cleaning vessels or sending back images to surgeons .
The tech industry is beginning to feel the heat from a financial meltdown that has been burning the rest of the world for months .
Microsoft recently announced that it would lay off up to 5,000 employees -- 5 percent of its work force -- over the next 18 months , starting with 1,400 jobs immediately .
Chipmaker Intel is also reportedly laying off between 5,000 and 6,000 jobs while closing five plants in the U.S. and Asia in response to falling computer sales .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
The announcement came a week after reporting a 90 % dip in profits for the last three months of 2008 .
Facilities to be closed by Intel include its factory in Santa Clara and sister sites in Oregon , Malaysia and the Philippines .
Intel said closing the five plants would not affect continuing investment in its more modern manufacturing facilities .
The two U.S. factories being closed were based on older microchip technology .
Microsoft posted quarterly results far short of analysts ' and its own expectations .
In turn , the company is eliminating jobs in research and development , marketing , sales , finance , legal , human resources and IT .
According to a spokesperson , generous severance and outplacement services are being offered .
( Source : nwsource.com )
In addition to the layoffs , Microsoft will slash travel budgets and marketing expenses , postpone almost all new construction on its campus and reduce the number of vendors and contingent staff .
The changes are expected to cut Microsoft 's annual operating expenses by $ 1.5 billion per year .
Microsoft added a record 12,694 workers during its 2008 fiscal year and had almost 96,000 employees as of late November .
' Netbooks ' that attribute to lower profit margins and use slower chips added to the problem of shrinking computer sales .

Chips based on ARM designs power the majority of smart phones Mobile phone chip designer Arm has announced an alliance with the makers of the Ubuntu open source software .
The deal will produce a version of the operating system for small net - browsing computers known as netbooks .
It marks a departure for Arm , which before now has been best known for designing the chips inside smartphones and feature phones .
The new operating system for Arm- powered machines looks set to be available in April 2009 .
Battery power Rob Coombs , director of mobile marketing at Arm , said he expected to see the first devices running the version of Ubuntu by the time of the Computex show in June .
The devices will be based around the Arm7 architecture and , in particular , the Cortex A8 and A9 processors .
" It 's significant in that it is taking Arm onto larger screen formats , " he said .
The resultant netbooks were likely to sport screens up to 25 cm ( 10 in ) across and be able to run good quality video , web browsers , and the well - known suite of Open Office programs , said Mr Coombs .
Equally , he said , these netbook devices would have the long battery life enjoyed by many mobiles .
" They 'll be for people who want a small internet - centric device , " he said .
In a statement Jane Silber , of Canonical , Ubuntu 's commercial sponsor , said : " This is a natural development for Ubuntu , driven by the demand from manufacturers for an ARM technology - based version . "
Small form - factor notebooks have proved hugely popular with many people looking for a small device that they can use to go online while out and about .
The interest in the market sector is being driven by devices such as the XO laptop from the One Laptop Per Child project and the Eee machine from Asus .
Arm produces chip designs that firms such as TI , Qualcomm and many others turn into processors that power 70 - 80 % of the world 's mobiles .
Arm - designed chips also drive many smartphones such as the G1 - the first phone powered by Google 's Android software .
The tie - up with Arm builds on Canonical 's announcement in May 2007 that it would develop versions of Ubuntu specifically for low - cost note books .

There ’s a new profile in Playboy of Hugh Hefner ’s teenage sons , Marston , 18 , and Cooper , 17 .
The boys live with their mother , 44 year - old former Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad , in a house on the grounds of the Playboy estate but separated by about 100 yards and by large hedges from the mansion .
Conrad and Hefner split up in 1998 after 9 years of marriage , but are technically still married as Conrad refused to grant Hef a divorce .*
The older son , Marston , was also featured in an interview with his dad in the June , 2008 issue of GQ .
Christie Hefner , Hugh ’s 56 year - old daughter from a previous marriage , has announced plans to resign as CEO of Playboy Enterprises on January 31 , 2009 .
Director Jerome Kern is going to serve as “ interim non-executive chairman ” as a replacement is located for Christie .
Judging from all this press it ’s starting to look like
Hef ’s sons will take over the empire once they ’re old enough .
Marston comes across as a thoughtful , smart young guy .
He cares about world affairs and tells GQ he reads Newsweek , Time and The New Yorker .
His ideal woman is someone he can talk to as he ’s been around perfect beauties all his life .
As his mom explains it , “ It ’s like working at Krispy Kreme – you do n’t eat all the doughnuts . ”
Younger brother Cooper has more of his dad ’s enthusiasm for women .
He says he ’s dated a few women at one time and his mom has had to talk to him about it :
“ I ’m not going to have multiple girlfriends — not at the same time , ” 18 - year - old Marston Hefner says in the January issue of Playboy “ I ca n’t imagine that . ”
His brother , 17 - year - old Cooper Hefner , begs to differ .
“ I can imagine doing that .
I do n’t think it ’s an odd thing to do , ” he says .
“ You date around to try to find a connection with some girl . ”
Cooper admits he ’s “ already gotten in trouble ” and had the “ revolving - door conversation ” with his mother , former Playmate Kimberley Conrad .
“ One girl comes in the front door while the other one gets pushed out the back , ” Cooper says , adding that his mother has told him , “ ‘ We do not have a revolving door in this house ! ’
“ She ’s all about one girlfriend at a time , ” he says … .
So do the boys ever want to run Playboy one day ?
“ I definitely want to be involved with the company , ” Cooper says .
“ If I were to take over the company or have a say in what ’s going on , I ’d want the girls to be presented more as they were in the pictorials back in the 1950s and 1960s -— kind of artsy , classy .
I would like to bring back that retro-class feel . ” ‘
[ From US Weekly ]
Marston also has a vision for Playboy ’s future that involves a change of direction for the men ’s magazine .
He says that it should be more multicultural and intelligent , which is much like his ideal girlfriend :
Okay , let ’s say you were to take over the business one day .
Have you given any thought to how you would change it ?
“ As far as the nudity goes , I do n’t think I would change a lot , except maybe make the pictures cool and artsy instead of some really obvious setting .
It ’s usually , like , cowgirl .
You know what I mean ?
I ’d do something tight , like a painted body on a crazy art canvas .
I ’d want to make it cool again .
Not like now , where it ’s some cheesy saying and then a Playboy Bunny on a T - shirt . ”
What about the Playboy aesthetic ?
“ I ’d make it much more multicultural and diverse .
Not so many blonds .
I ’d mix it up .
Just how my dad has his taste , I have my taste . ”
Your dad , I say , he ’s a man with a specific … type .
I ’d say : blond .
I ’d say : surgically augmented .
I ’d say : not exuding a tremendous amount of ( outward ) intellectual ambition .
How different are your tastes ?
“ The ones I find attractive are brunet , blue eyes , and that ’s about it .
An intelligent woman that I can have a conversation with .…
That centerfold in the magazine probably would n’t be my girlfriend , because I would n’t find her attractive .
I do n’t care about fake boobs if the girl has a good personality , but most girls with fake boobs I do n’t find attractive — because of why they got the fake boobs in the first place . ”
[ From GQ ]
Marston told GQ writer Steven Hurst when he asked specifically about it that he ’s never really sought out the mansion during parties or tried to catch people getting naughty on the grounds because “ It ’s my house .
Just knowing people are having sex at my house is uncomfortable . ”
Marston plans to go to college , he had n’t decided where when he spoke to GQ , and Cooper is reaching the age where he ’ll soon do the same .
It may be a few years until we see a more artsy , classier version of Playboy .

A popular Iranian internet dating website that claimed to be helping people find a spouse and start families has been banned for " promoting prostitution " , on the advice of leading Islamic clerics .
Hamsarchat.com , which boasts of having chalked up more than 1.6 m page visits , was also fined and ordered to pay back money collected from clients , after a judge consulted senior ayatollahs - known as " sources of emulation " - following a complaint from Tehran 's public prosecutor .
It has been marketing itself as " Iran 's most complete spouse - finding website " and had promised to link members with " the closest person or persons to your standards " in return for a 25,000 rial ( £ 1.66 ) fee .
Potential clients were required to complete a questionnaire which asked their religion , age , height , weight and occupation .
It also asked how strongly they felt about a partner 's hijab and invited them to state their attitude towards religion , offering " free of religion " as a possible option .
Another question asked if the applicant 's goal was permanent marriage , Islamic temporary marriage or " unknown " .
Hamsarchat - translated as spouse chat - stressed that its aim was to promote marriage rather than mere " friend - finding " .
But Raja News , a fundamentalist website close to the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said the ban had been issued because of the online posting of clients ' pictures and email addresses .

. . .
And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?

I was taught as a child that when you take something without asking for it , that is stealing .
Shall we keep the sabbath ?
Exodus 20:8 " Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy . "
Exodus 31:15
" Whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death . "
Numbers 15:32,36

. . .

" Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight . "

All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
Jesus said unto him ,
If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven . "

There are more pro-slavery verses than cited here .

See also II Kings 20:1 - 7 , Numbers 16:20 - 35 , Numbers 16:44 -50 .
See Genesis 18:23 -33 , where Abraham gets
God to change his mind about the minimum number of righteous people in Sodom required to avoid destruction , bargaining down from fifty to ten .
( An omniscient God must have known that he was playing with Abraham 's hopes for mercy -- he destroyed the city anyway . )
Are we punished for our parents ' sins ?
Exodus 20:5 " For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation . "
( Repeated in Deuteronomy 5:9 )

vs

" Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I frame evil against you , and devise a device against you . "

For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
And a man 's foes shall be they of his own household . "
Luke 22:36
" Then said he unto them , . . . he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . "
Was Jesus trustworthy ?
John 8:14 " Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true . "
vs
John 5:31 " If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . "
" Record " and " witness " in the above verses are the same Greek word ( martyria ) .
Shall we call people names ?
Matthew 5:22 " Whosoever shall say Thou fool , shall be in danger of hellfire . "
[ Jesus speaking ]
vs
Matthew 23:17
" Ye fools and blind . " [ Jesus speaking ]
Psalm 14:1
" The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God . "
Has anyone seen God ?
John 1:18 " No man hath seen God at any time . "
Exodus 33:20
" Thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live . "
John 6:46 " Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God [ Jesus ] , he hath seen the Father . "

" In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up , and his train filled the temple . "
Job 42:5
" I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee . "
How many Gods are there ?
Deuteronomy 6:4 " The Lord our God is one Lord . "
vs
Genesis 1:26 " And God said , Let us make man in our image . "
Genesis 3:22
" And the Lord God said , Behold , the man has become as one of us , to know good and evil . "
I John 5:7 " And there are three that bear witness in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one . "
It does no good to claim that " Let us " is the magisterial " we . "
Such usage implies inclusivity of all authorities under a king 's leadership .
Invoking the Trinity solves nothing because such an idea is more contradictory than the problem it attempts to solve .
Are we all sinners ?
Romans 3:23
" For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God . "
Romans 3:10 " As it is written , There is none righteous , no , not one . "

" If a man vow a vow unto the Lord , or swear an oath . . . he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth . "
Genesis 21:22-24,31 " . . . swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me . . .
And Abraham said , I will swear .
. . .
Wherefore he called that place Beersheba [ " well of the oath " ] ; because there they sware both of them . "
Hebrews 6:13 - 17
" For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself . . . for men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath . "
See also Genesis 22:15 - 19 , Genesis 31:53 , and Judges 11:30 - 39 .
vs
Matthew 5:34 - 37
" But I say unto you , swear not at all ; neither by heaven . . . nor by the earth . . . .
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head . . . .
But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . "
James 5:12 " . . . swear not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath : but let your yea be yea ; and your nay , nay ; lest ye fall into condemnation . "
When was Jesus crucified ?
Mark 15:25
" And it was the third hour , and they crucified him . "
vs
John 19:14 - 15
" And about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
But they cried out . . . crucify him . "
It is an ad hoc defense to claim that there are two methods of reckoning time here .
It has never been shown that this is the case .
Shall we obey the law ?
I Peter 2:13 " Submit yourself to every ordinance of man . . . to the king , as supreme ; Or unto governors . "
Matthew 22:21 " Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's . "
See also Romans 13:1,7 and Titus 3:1 .
vs

How many animals on the ark ?
Genesis 6:19
" And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark . "

" And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : . . .
And the evening and the morning were the third day .
. . .
And God said , Let us make man in our image . . .
And the evening and the morning were the sixth day . "
vs
Genesis 2:5-9
" And every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground . . .
And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food . "
Did Michal have children ?
II Samuel 6:23 " Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death . "
vs
II Samuel 21:8 " But the king took the two sons of Rizpah . . . and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul . "

vs

( For more detail on this contradiction , with a linguistic analysis of the Greek words , see " Did Paul 's Men Hear A Voice ? " by Dan Barker , published in the The Skeptical Review , 1994 # 1 )
Is God omnipotent ?
Jeremiah 32:27
" Behold , I am the Lord , the God of all flesh : is there anything too hard for me ?
Matthew 19:26
" But Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible . "
vs
Judges 1:19
" And the Lord was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron . "

I Timothy 6:15 - 16 " . . . the King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
Who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach . . . "
James 1:17 " . . . the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . "
John 12:35 " Then Jesus saith unto them , . . . he that walketh in darkness knoweth not wither he goeth . "
Job 18:18
" He [ the wicked ] shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world . "
Daniel 2:22
" He [ God ] knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him . "
See also Psalm 143:3 , II Corinthians 6:14 , and Hebrews 12:18 - 22 .
vs
I Kings 8:12 " Then spake Solomon , The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness . "
( Repeated in II Chronicles 6:1 )
II Samuel 22:12 " And he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N reported a worse - than - expected third - quarter net loss on Thursday , as even its wealth management business -- previously a cash cow for the struggling bank -- saw more money leave than come in .
The brokerage house , which last month accepted a $ 50 billion takeover bid from Bank of America Corp , posted a loss of $ 7.5 billion on write - downs and credit losses on complex debt securities .
It also said its wealth management business saw assets under management shrink to $ 1.5 trillion from $ 1.6 trillion last quarter .
When Bank of America Corp's BAC.N Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis announced the plan to buy Merrill Lynch , he referred to its wealth management business as its " crown jewel " but now that is looking shaky .
" The results from the retail brokerage operations were disappointing -- Schwab was much stronger than Merrill was , " said Brad Hintz , analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein , comparing Merrill 's high - net - worth business with the discount model run by Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O .
Schwab -- which reported results on Wednesday -- managed to increase assets under management even during a difficult quarter that saw many investors pulling money out of investment accounts .
“ There ’s the snob factor -- ( Merrill clients ) do n’t want to be a part of Bank of America , ” added Ben Wallace , securities analyst at Grimes & Company in Westborough , Massachusetts .

On a call with analysts , Merrill executives took time to relieve concerns about the future of the wealth management business , noting that the number of advisors climbed by 160 over the quarter to 16,850 .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any deterioration in the franchise , ” said John Thain , chief executive of Merrill Lynch .
It remains the largest brokerage by assets under management and number of advisors , and Nelson Chai , chief financial officer , noted the number of advisors joining has accelerated relative to competitors since the announcement of the deal with Bank of America .
“ I think that is affirmation both of the strategic value of the deal ... as well as the health of the franchise , ” said Chai .
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE
Merrill , like former peers Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and Bear Stearns Cos , has struggled to survive the credit crisis , which has crippled its large mortgage and complex debt businesses .

In July , Merrill sold a $ 30.6 billion portfolio of structured debt securities to private equity firm Lone Star Funds , taking a $ 5.7 billion write - down and raising capital in the process -- but this was not enough to solve its problems .
The company ’s share price continued to fall , and Chief Executive John Thain engineered the speedy sale to Bank of America on the same weekend that Lehman Brothers was forced into bankruptcy .
There had been doubts about the deal going through , and the difference between Merrill ’s share price and the price implied by the deal was initially wide .
But the difference has been narrowing in recent weeks and on Thursday , Merrill shares closed at $ 18.35 , 12 percent below the implied deal price .
The bank posted more than $ 9 billion in write - downs and credit losses in the third quarter , most of which occurred in September .
The bank also said it will issue $ 10 billion of non-voting preferred stock and related warrants to the U.S.
Treasury under the government program that gave Bank of America a $ 25 billion capital injection earlier this week .
Merrill said its third - quarter net loss applicable to common shareholders widened to $ 5.58 per share from $ 2.82 per share , or $ 2.3 billion , a year earlier .
The company posted a loss of $ 5.56 per share from continuing operations .
Analysts ’ average forecast was a loss of $ 5.18 per share , according to Reuters Estimates .

Hu ’s parents were military doctors who had always hoped their daughter would some day become a great surgeon .
During her days in high school when the Cultural Revolution was in full swing , Hu ’s time was all spent either drawing the portrait of Chairman Mao ( after her teacher found out she loved painting ) or studying the Little Red Book .
Finding it all very boring , Hu begged her parents to let her join the army .
They relented , and at age 15 , Hu joined the People ’s Liberation Army , where she would serve another 20 years in various roles as a hospital broadcaster / announcer , a librarian , a projectionist , recreational club director , cultural secretary and nurse .

Here are carefully selected articles about typography and type design that have been published in Smashing Magazine over all the years .
Good typography should n’t have to rely on ornamental crutches to stand tall .
Yet despite all the tools and knowledge available to us , we readily embrace a flourishing , decorative typography , with cheap tricks used in a misguided attempt to make it “ pop ” .
This ancient art may rapidly be gaining popularity , but are we paying it the respect it deserves ?
Lovely examples of modern typographic icons .
Take a snapshot of the visual culture that surrounds you — magazines , movie posters , packaging , websites — how much of it relies on typography ?
How much of the typography around you is actually well considered ?
Chances are you ’ll find a handful of beautifully crafted typographical designs competing with an avalanche of visually “ rich ” , image - heavy creations .
Typography is then relegated to the role of “ necessary evil ” in order to display text , or ill - considered typographic pieces , where the meaning of MS WordArt has been interpreted a smidgen too literally …
Why ?

In this article , I ’d like to reacquaint you with the humble workhorse of communication that is the paragraph .
Paragraphs are everywhere .
In fact , at the high risk of stating the obvious , you are reading one now .
Despite their ubiquity , we frequently neglect their presentation .
This is a mistake .
Here , we ’ll refer to some time - honored typesetting conventions , with an emphasis on readability , and offer guidance on adapting them effectively for devices and screens .
We ’ll see that the ability to embed fonts with @font - face is not by itself a solution to all of our typographic challenges .

Clever graphic designers love to use typography to explore the interaction between the look of type and what type actually says .
In communicating a message , a balance has to be achieved between the visual and the verbal aspects of a design .
Sometimes , however , designers explore the visual aspect of type to a much greater extent than the verbal .
In these cases , the visual language does all the talking .
This article explores when the visual elements of typography speak louder than words .
Cal Swan , author of Language and Typography , makes this point well when he says , “ These two distinct areas often come together in practice as there is clearly a very strong relationship between the conception of the words as a message and their transmission in visible form . ”
In this first of a two - part series , we will look at the powerful effect that typography has in taking control of meaning .
We will discuss a range of examples , from verbal language that inspires and shapes visual treatment to visual language that dominates verbal meaning .
The implications of typographic choices in meaning and interpretation will also be examined .
And we will show how the same message can be presented in a number of ways to convey and encourage a diversity of responses .

A strong understanding of how designers control meaning is essential for anyone interested in graphic design or typography .
In a previous article , we discussed how sophisticated and complex visual and verbal language can get , examining instances that show how type can be used to effectively take control of meaning .
In this article , we ’ll look at the reasons why subtle typographic changes can create considerable effect .
We ’ll refer to one or two linguistic and semiotic examples , as well as design case studies , to get to grips with why subtle changes can make all the difference .

The paradigm shift — wrought by the personal computer , Postscript and desktop publishing — should have had a massive impact on the shapes of our typographic characters , just as the advances of the World Wide Web further changed the way we viewed words ( even though letterforms change at the pace of the most conservative reader ) .
Thus , radical innovations like Kurt Schwitters ’ Systemschrift , ( a phoenetic alphabet from 1927 ) , are doomed to fail .
Our writing , which is derived from either Roman or Gothic forms ( and sometimes both ) , is historic and non-systematic , said Schwitters .
His “ optophoenetic ” approach was to make the shapes of the letters more accurately reflect how they sounded .
But in order for it to work , massive re-education would be required .
Kurt Schwitters ’ “ Systemschrift ” , an attempt at developing a phoenetic alphabet .
Licko was paraphrasing Sir Cyril Burt who wrote , “ almost everyone reads most easily matter set up in the style and size to which he has become habituated . ”
( A Psychological Study of Typography , Cambridge , 1959 , p. 18 ) .
So we do not necessarily respond to “ beautiful ” type .
You may find Centaur elegant , but others will find the spiky serifs distracting .
For this reason , rather dull typefaces ( like Times Roman ) , come to dominate our graphic landscape .
My purpose here is to examine some failed attempts at creating economy , or furthering the cause of legibility .

The beauty of typography has no borders .
While most of us work with the familiar Latin alphabet , international projects usually require quite extensive knowledge about less familiar writing systems from around the world .
The aesthetics and structure of such designs can be strongly related to the shape and legibility of the letterforms , so learning about international writing systems will certainly help you create more attractive and engaging Web designs .
Pick any language you like : Arabic , Chinese , Japanese , maybe Nepali ?
Each is based on a different writing system , which makes it interesting to figure out how they work .
Today , we 'll cover five categories of writing systems .
This may sound tedious and academic , but it 's not .
If you take the time to understand them , you 'll find that they all give us something special .
We 've tried to present at least one special feature of each language from which you can draw inspiration and apply to your own typography work .
We 'll cover : East Asian writing systems , Arabic and Indic scripts ( Brahmic ) .
If you are interested , we will cover Cyrillic , Hebrew and other writing systems in the next post .

The beauty of writing systems is that each has something unique from which to draw inspiration .
Two weeks ago , in the first part of this article , we covered Arabic and East - Asian languages ( Chinese , Japanese , Korean and Vietnamese ) and a few Indic scripts ( Devanagari , Thai and Tibetan ) .
We are now back for the second ( and last ) part , which is a bit different but just as interesting .
You will see that some features of the languages presented here clearly correspond to our Latin - based system , while others are unfamiliar .
The point of this second part is to complete our look at writing systems of the world and to think more generally about what they signify .
We 'll cover Hebrew , Modern European scripts , Mongolian , Inuktitut and International Phonetic Alphabet .

As a Japanese person living in Europe , I ’m sometimes asked : “ Japanese is a difficult language , is n’t it ? ”
Those asking are often surprised when my answer is a simple : “ No , actually , it ’s not . ”
While it is true ( at least to many Westerners ) that Japanese is an exotic language , when compared to learning other European languages , it may seem harder because it has no relation to their own language .
But from my own experiences of learning English and German ( and also from seeing some European friends learning Japanese ) , I can say with confidence that learning spoken Japanese is , in fact , not so difficult .
The grammar is in many ways simpler than most European languages .
Take for example the fact that we do n’t have cases , grammatical genders , nor articles .
However , reading and writing in Japanese is … well , not so simple .
While discussing typography we most often focus on English language problems , which is only natural considering that the majority of design material is written in English .
However , a lot can be gleamed by looking at how other languages are used as part of communication and design — it helps to lend context and a different point of view .

I had thought terms like “ intellectual property ” and “ intellectual theft ” were of fairly recent provenance , so my eye was caught by the latter ’s use in a headline of a 1930 edition of the US trade journal The American Printer .
The article it headed proved to be equally intriguing , a response by the president of American Type Founders ( ATF ) to a June 1929 article in the German journal Gebrauchsgraphik by the designer Rudolf Koch , calling the ATF a “ highway robber of German intellectual property . ”
At issue was a typeface marketed by the ATF earlier in 1929 called Rivoli .

An understanding of typographic etiquette separates the master designers from the novices .
A well - trained designer can tell within moments of viewing a design whether its creator knows how to work with typography .
Typographic details are n’t just inside jokes among designers .
They have been built up from thousands of years of written language , and applying them holds in place long - established principles that enable typography to communicate with efficiency and beauty .
Handling these typographic details on the Web brings new challenges and restrictions that need to be considered .
Below are a few rules of thumb that will have you using typography more lucidly than ever before .

Even with a relatively limited set of options in CSS , typography can vary tremendously using pure CSS syntax .
Serif or sans - serif ?
Large or small font ?
Line height , spacing , font size and padding ...
The list goes on and on .
To find typographic design patterns that are common in modern Web design and to resolve some common typographic issues , we conducted extensive research on 50 popular websites on which typography matters more than usual ( or at least should matter more than usual ) .
We 've chosen popular newspapers , magazines and blogs as well as various typography - related websites .
We 've carefully analyzed their typography and style sheets and searched for similarities and differences .
We have also put together a spreadsheet of the study that displays the websites ' various values ( for example , the ratio between the line height and line length ) .

Choosing a typeface can be tricky .
The beauty and complexity of type , combined with an inexhaustible supply of options to evaluate , can make your head spin .
But do n't be baffled — and do n't despair .
While there are no easy - to - follow rules on how best to choose a typeface , there are many tried - and - true principles you can quickly learn and apply to make an appropriate typeface choice .
If you work systematically through the options below , you 'll have a winning typeface choice in no time .
Let 's get started .
The first thing you have to do in order to choose a typeface is form a strong impression in your mind about how you want your audience to react to the text .
This is your goal , and it will guide the process .
You might provide this impression , or it might be dictated to you by your client , or it may be determined by your audience .

For many beginners , the task of picking fonts is a mystifying process .
There seem to be endless choices â€ ” from normal , conventional - looking fonts to novelty candy cane fonts and bunny fonts â€ ” with no way of understanding the options , only never - ending lists of categories and recommendations .
Selecting the right typeface is a mixture of firm rules and loose intuition , and takes years of experience to develop a feeling for .
Here are five guidelines for picking and using fonts that Iâ€™ve developed in the course of using and teaching typography .
Many of my beginning students go about picking a font as though they were searching for new music to listen to : they assess the personality of each face and look for something unique and distinctive that expresses their particular aesthetic taste , perspective and personal history .
This approach is problematic , because it places too much importance on individuality .

What is it that makes a typeface into a text font , instead of a font for larger sizes ?
The answer differs slightly , depending on whether one aims for print or Web - based environments .
Nevertheless , there are certain features that most good text faces have in common .
Familiarity with these helps to select the right fonts for a given project .
This article presents a few criteria to help the process along .

Creating great typeface combinations is an art , not a science .
Indeed , the beauty of typography has no borders .
While there are no absolute rules to follow , it is crucial that you understand and apply some best practices when combining fonts in a design .
When used with diligence and attention , these principles will always yield suitable results .
Today we will take a close look at some the best practices for combining typefaces â€ ” as well as some blunders to avoid .
By far the most popular principle for creating typeface combinations is to pair a sans serif header typeface with a serif body typeface .
This is a classic combination , and it 's almost impossible to get wrong .
In the examples above â€ ” a typical article layout â€ ” we have Trade Gothic Bold No.2 paired with Bell Gothic on the left side .
They are both sans serif typefaces .
However , they have very different personalities .
A good rule of thumb , when it comes to header and body copy design problems , is not to create undue attention to the personality of each font .
Trade Gothic is arguably a no - nonsense typeface .
Bell Gothic , on the other hand , is much more dynamic and outspoken .

I know what you ’re thinking .
“ Did he just say 16 pixels ?
For body copy ?
Obnoxiously big ! 12 pixels is ideal for most websites . ”
I ’d like to persuade you otherwise .
As usability expert Oliver Reichenstein says in “ The 100 % Easy - 2 - Read Standard ” :
[ 16 pixels ] is not big .
It ’s the text size browsers display by default .
It ’s the text size browsers were intended to display …
It looks big at first , but once you use it you quickly realize why all browser makers chose this as the default text size .
In this article , I ’ll explain why 16 pixels should generally be the minimum size for body copy in modern Web design .
If I do n’t change your mind , perhaps you could chip in at the end and let me know why .
You see , in most cases , if you ’re building websites with the font size set between 10 and 15 pixels , you are costing your clients money .
And I aim to prove it .

The possibility of embedding any font you like into websites via @font - face is an additional stylistic device which promises to abolish the monotony of the usual system fonts .
It surely would be all too easy if there was only one Web font format out there .
Instead , there 's quite a variety , as you will get to know in this article .
This quick introduction to @font - face will lead you towards a guide through the @font - face kit generator .
If you want to make Web use of your already licensed desktop fonts , read up on how to embed them from your own server .
Topped up with some helpful tips , tricks and workarounds , this article will hopefully provide some useful insights .

Even though @font - face was introduced in the CSS2 spec in 1998 , it was n't until this past year that all in -use web browsers added support for it .
This year we 're seeing a wave of web font services being marketed , and this could have a profound impact on web typography .
Web font services , like Typekit and now the Google Font API , have captured a lot of attention .
But in the past 3 months there 's been an explosion of new services ; services like Fonts Live , Fontdeck , Webtype and others with conjugated names involving " Font " or " Type " .
While all of these services are unique , they each provide a tool for web designers and developers to legally display professional fonts on their website .
The guide below compares 10 of these services , breaking down the pros and cons of each .
We hope this comparison will help you make a more informed decision on which service to use when you venture into the ever - growing , sometimes confusing , world of web fonts .

The practice of using a large letter to mark the start of a text has been around for almost two thousand years .
Illustrated caps increased usability by marking important passages and guiding readers through the text .
Unlike their historic counterparts , drop caps on the Web do n’t add value in terms of usability or readability — and they are hard for Web developers to control , often rendering differently across browsers .
Yet , front - end designers and clients often want to use drop caps as decorative elements .
How should we implement them ?
Just as scribes , artisans , and early printers had a variety of methods for creating initial capitals , we Web designers have multiple methods to choose from .
We can use an image of a letter , create a class to enlarge and place a letter , or use a first - child : first - letter to enlarge and place the first letter of the first paragraph .
But which method should we use ?
Which method remains consistent across browsers ?
Which is most accessible ?

The Web font revolution that started around two years ago has brought up a topic that many of us had merrily ignored for many years : font rendering .
The newfound freedom Web fonts are giving us brings along new challenges .
Choosing and using a font is not merely a stylistic issue , and it ’s worth having a look at how the technology comes into play .
This article presents the mechanisms of type rendering , how they were developed , and how and why they are applied by the various operating systems and browsers — so that when it comes time to choose a font for your next project , you know what to look out for to ensure the quality of the typography is consistently high .

Any application of typography can be divided into two arenas : micro and macro .
Understanding the difference between the two is especially useful when crafting a reading experience , because it allows the designer to know when to focus on legibility and when to focus on readability .
This article focuses mostly on a few simple macrotypographic techniques — with a dash of micro— and on how to combine them all to build a more harmonious , adaptable and , most importantly , readable Web page .
We love beautiful typography , and we appreciate the efforts of designers who come up with great typographic techniques and tools or who just share their knowledge with fellow designers .
We are always looking for such resources .
We compile them , carefully select the best ones and then prepare them for our round - ups .
And now it 's time to present a beautiful fresh dose of typography - related resources .
To help you improve the typography in your designs , we 're presenting here useful new articles , tools and resources related to typography .
You will learn the fundamentals of typography , find out how to combine fonts and know what to keep in mind when choosing a typeface .

Web typography has evolved a lot over the last years .
Today we see rich , accessible typography , a plethora of type design choices for the web and a number of remarkable , type - based web designs .
It 's a great time for web design , and it's a great time for web typography .
Still , being as excited as we are , we should not forget about the foundational principles of good type design on the web and use them properly within our projects .
Great choice is good , but , most importantly , we should be making meaningful typographic choices in our designs .
In this post we present an extensive overview of educational resources , tools , articles , techniques and showcases all related to web typography .
Please notice that the overview presents resources which we have stumbled upon , discovered , collected and reviewed over the last six months .
This round - up is quite long , so save some time for a thorough study .

Let 's face it : Web - safe fonts are very limiting .
Maybe a dozen fonts are out there that are widely enough adopted to be considered " Web safe , " and those ones are n't exactly spectacular for much other than body type .
Sure , Georgia , Arial or Times New Roman work just fine for the bulk of the text on your website , but what if you want something different for , let 's say , headings ?
Or pull quotes ?
What then ?
You have a few options .
Many people just opt for more elaborate CSS font stacks , with their preferred fonts up front .
But that still leaves a big chunk of your visitors seeing the same old Web - safe fonts .
Enter dynamic text replacement .
In addition to font stacks , why not replace the heading text with an image , embedded font , or bit of Flash ?
The methods described below are easier than they sound .
And the end result is that the vast majority of users will see the beautiful typography you want them to see .
A word of warning , though : do n't use dynamic text replacement for all of the text on your page .
All that would do is slow it down and frustrate your visitors .
Instead , save it for headings , menu items , pull quotes and other small bits of text .

Wherever we turn online , typography jumps out at us — sometimes literally , with the assistance of some clever coding .
And now more than ever , we are seeing greater focus on this design element and its varied implementations around the Web .
With the growing popularity of font embedding services and @font - face , typography is the talk of the town , but even though it is a regular topic among communities , not all of our typographic efforts are successful .
Sometimes we swing for the fences , only to miss or fall short .
This is what brings us together today .
We have looked around the Web and checked some of the many typographic choices of website owners — some of which are successful , others not so much .
Below is a selection of some elegant and interesting websites .
We will critique the typography on them , in order to explore how we can improve the type on our own websites .
Look through them to see whether you spot any typographical trespasses that you may have committed yourself .

Apple 's next - generation iMacs and Mac minis will adopt the same NVIDIA chipset platform found at the heart of the company 's most recent notebook overhaul , new findings confirm once over .
A member of the InsanelyMac forums was recently rifling through the extension files that ship with the latest MacBooks and MacBooks Pros and discovered references to a " Macmini3, 1 " and " iMac9, 1 . "
Running System Profiler on Apple 's most current iMacs and Mac minis reveal the model number of those systems to be " Macmini2, 1 " and " iMac8, 1 , " meaning the configuration files included with the company 's latest notebooks are for still unannounced models .
Specifically , the extension file of interest pertains to a Mac 's System Management Controller and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext ) .
It includes a variety of information , including strings that identify the supporting chipset of each Mac .
The entries for the unannounced iMac and Mac minis list their chipset as the " CFG_MCP79 , " which is the same exact NVIDIA MCP79 platform employed by unibody MacBooks , MacBook Pros , and MacBook Airs , which are similarly identified in the same file as the MacBook5,1 , MacBook Pro5, 1 , and MacBookAir2,1 .
Also of interest is that the entries for the new iMac and Mac mini are dated 2008 , which may provide evidence to support claims that these systems were originally targeted for a release in the November time frame but were pushed into the first quarter of the year due to unexpected delays .
Kelly Brook is " beside herself " about being axed from Britain 's Got Talent , say reports .
Simon Cowell and Talkback
Thames confirmed the model and actress , 29 , had been removed from the judging panel earlier today .
Brook was only unveiled as the fourth judge on the talent show last week .
" I have spoken to Kelly and she is very upset , " a source told the Daily Mail .
" Her agent broke the news just before she got on a flight with [ boyfriend ] Danny [ Cipriani ] and she was beside herself .
" She feels it is very unfair to do this to her after such a short time as she was just getting into the swing of things .
She started off a bit shakey but she was getting better towards the end of the Manchester auditions . "
Producers claimed that Brook was dropped because operating with four judges made the show too complicated .
However , according to tabloid reports , Brook feels she was used as a " publicity tool " .
" Kelly was given no help whatsoever , " an insider told The Mirror .
" She was effectively hired only hours before she started the job so had no time to prepare .
Nobody bothered to give her any pointers and she felt frozen out by the rest of the team .
They 're very cliquey . "
Brook 's previous TV work includes hosting The Big Breakfast , the first series of Celebrity Love Island and Living 's Dirty Dancing : The Time Of Your Life .
Britain's Got Talent returns to ITV in May .

「 住宅ローンが借りられなくて困っていますどうすればいいのか…」「住宅ローンが通らない時はどうする？」住宅ローンが借りられないとお悩みの方にまずは結論をご紹介します。収入の基準が足りずに住宅ローンが借りられない方にはauじぶん銀行とイオン銀行の住宅ローンがおすすめです。auじぶん銀行の基準は前年度年収200万円以上、イオン銀行住宅ローンは前年度年収100万円以上という門戸の広さで多くの方に借りられるチャンスが広がっています。どちらの銀行も基準が緩く申し込みやすいのに金利や諸費用も安く使い勝手が良い点も見逃せません。
住宅ローン審査基準は、金融機関によってそれぞれ異なりますから、たとえば年収300万円以上あれば通るはず、などと一概に判断することはできません。しかし、おおまかな基準と傾向がわからなければ審査に通らない理由もわからず、対策方法も立てられないので、まずは審査基準に関する全般的な解説をします。
■ 住宅ローン審査の流れは？
一般的には事前（仮）審査と本審査の2回受ける事になります。あなたが申し込んだ銀行による審査と、保証機関による審査の2つががあるため、銀行の基準による事前の仮審査に通ったからといって必ずしも借り入れが可能になるわけではありません。
銀行はCICなどの「個人信用情報機関」に連絡して申し込んだあなたの借り入れ状況など信用情報の調査を行います。ここでは、過去にローンやクレジットカードの延滞や未納、自己破産などの金融事故をおこしていないかをチェックします。個人信用情報にはあなたのこれまでのお金に関する様々な情報が記載されているのです。
それが通ると保証会社による本審査になり、年収や勤続年数、年齢、健康状態から担保となる購入物件の価値評価などが行われ、無事にすべての基準に通ると住宅ローンの融資が受けられます。この間、長い場合には約1ヶ月かかりますので、かなり詳細な調査になると思って下さい。
■ 住宅ローン審査基準は厳しい？
上でも書いたようにそれぞれの金融機関によって下限となる年収額や細かな基準が異なる点に注意が必要です。まず大事なのが、年齢。完済時に何歳か？次に借入時が何歳か？という順で優先されます。一般的には借り入れ時の年齢が40歳を超えてくると完済時には70歳を超えてしまうため、次第に基準が厳しくなる傾向があります。
次に年収や返済負担率があります。銀行によっては年収300万円以上とか、400万円以上という風に具体的な年収額が明示されている場合もあります。ただ、多くの銀行は「安定して継続した収入があること」といった表現で年収いくらから借りられるとは明示していません。
そのため返済負担比率の考え方が大事になります。
返済負担率とは、あなたの現在におけるすべてのローンの返済額が年収の何パーセントに当たるかをあらわしたものです。住宅だけでなく、教育ローン、マイカーローン、キャッシングなどすべての借金の返済額が年収に比較して高くなると返済負担率も上がり審査に通らない大きな理由となります。
次に勤務先や雇用形態、勤続年数も審査に通るための大事なポイントです。これは年収の項でも書いた「安定して継続した収入があること」に大きくかかわってきます。一時的に収入が平均より多くても、それが継続していくのかといったことも問題になります。
さらに、債務状況、健康状態、担保物件の評価と続きます。問題になることが多いのが健康問題によって団体信用生命保険、いわゆる団信に加入することができない場合です。
団信生命保険に加入できない場合、いくつかの例外を除いて住宅ローン審査には通りません。収入や信用情報だけではなく、健康問題までクリアできなければ住宅ローン審査基準が通らないということは覚えておいてください。
■ 審査基準に通るための目安は？
やはり借入時、完済時ともに年齢は若い方が評価は高くなります。ただ、通常は年齢が若ければ年収も低いことが多くその点で基準を通らないことも十分に考えられます。さらに将来的なライフプランもはっきりしない時点で家を買うのも問題が起こる可能性が高くなるため、ある程度収入と年齢のバランス、そして人生設計なども考えたうえで借り入れ時期を検討することをおすすめします。
審査に通る年収は物件にもよりますが、やはり最低300万円は必要と考えておきましょう。フラット35の場合これよりも年収が低くても借りることはできますが、一般的な銀行の住宅ローンの場合には年収の基準は最低300万円～450万円としているところが多くなっています。
勤務先を変えることは難しいですし、逆に転職してすぐの場合には審査にマイナスになります。なるべく安定企業でできれば正社員、勤続年数は3年以上という点は押さえておきたいところ。勤続年数が3年未満だと審査落ちの可能性がぐっと高くなります。
そのほか個人信用情報についてですが、金融事故を起こしてブラックリストに載っていないこと（必須）、クレジットカードやカードローンの借り入れはできるだけ完済しておくこと。過去5年以内にローンの返済遅れや滞納歴がないことも大事です。
ここで注意しておきたいのが携帯電話料金について。機種代金の分割払いなど携帯料金も実はローンの一種ですから毎月の料金支払いが遅れがちな場合にはマイナスになり、最悪の場合住宅ローンが借りられないというケースも報告されています。こういった点について事前に知っておき、十分に注意しておきましょう。また病歴や既往症もできるだけないほうがよいので怪我や健康の問題についても日ごろから注意を払うようにしてください。
■ 審査に通りやすい（甘い）銀行とは？
住宅ローン審査に通りやすい銀行は果たして存在するのかという問題です。どうしてもマイホームがほしい、でも審査通らないという方もいらっしゃると思います。
もしかすると、すでにマイホームの建築が始まっているのにどこの銀行から借りるか決まっていないという方や、希望していたマンションに当選したのに予定していた銀行の住宅ローン審査に落ちたという切羽詰った状況にいる方もいらっしゃるかもしれません。そんな状況であれば審査に通らない場合は本物の悲劇ですからできるだけ通りやすい銀行を探しますよね。
一般に、地元密着型の金融機関、つまり信用金庫や地方銀行は審査が通りやすいとされています。他にもうわさとしてはJAは若干甘いと言われているようです。銀行では、都市銀行よりは地方銀行、地方銀行よりは地元の信用金庫の方が審査甘い傾向にあるといわれていますが、実際のところそれは借りる人によって千差万別。借りたいと思う人誰にでも基準が甘い銀行は存在しないと思ってください。
当サイトがおすすめするのは一般の住宅ローンとは年収などの審査基準が異なるフラット35も視野に入れること。基準が異なるため他で落ちても通る可能性もありますし、年収の下限が決まっているのではなく、返済負担比率が重視されます。過大な借り入れを希望しなければ審査に通りやすい銀行はあるのです。
また健康問題によって団信生命保険に加入できず審査に落ちて困っている方はauじぶん銀行のワイド団信やフラット35をおすすめします。auじぶん銀行の場合金利をプラスすることで健康に問題がある方でも加入できることがある団信を用意しています。またフラット35の場合団信は原則加入という条件があるため、団信に加入しなくても審査に通る場合もあるのです。ただ団信生命保険は万が一の怪我や病気の場合に返済不能になったときの備えですからできるだけ加入することをおすすめします。

This is one of the most difficult questions for Christians to answer .
The “ problem of pain , ” as the well - known Christian scholar , C.S. Lewis , once called it , is atheism ’s most potent weapon against the Christian faith .
All true science and history , if rightly understood , support the fact of God .
This evidence is so strong that , as the Bible says : “ The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God ” ( Psalm 14:1 ) .
Most atheists , therefore , without any objective evidence on which to base their faith in “ no God ” , must resort finally to philosophical objections .
And this problem of suffering is the greatest of these .
That is , they say , how can a God of love permit such things in His world as war , sickness , pain , and death , especially when their effects often are felt most keenly by those who are apparently innocent ?
Either
He is not a God of love and is indifferent to human suffering , or else He is not a God of power and is therefore helpless to do anything about it .
In either case , the Biblical God who is supposedly one of both absolute power and perfect love becomes an impossible anachronism .
Or so they claim !
This is a real difficulty , but atheism is certainly not the answer , and neither is agnosticism .
While there is much evil in the world , there is even more that is good .
This is proved by the mere fact that people normally try to hang on to life as long as they can .
Furthermore , everyone instinctively recognizes that “ good ” is a higher order of truth than “ bad ” .
We need also to recognize that our very minds were created by God .
We can only use these minds to the extent that He allows , and it is , therefore , utterly presumptuous for us to use them to question Him and His motives .
“ Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right ? ” ( Genesis 18:25 ) .
“ Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it , why hast Thou made me thus ? ” ( Romans 9:20 ) .
We ourselves do not establish the standards of what is right .
Only the Creator of all reality can do that .
We need to settle it , in our minds and hearts , whether we understand it or not , that whatever God does is , by definition , right .
Having settled this by faith , we are then free to seek for ways in which we can profit spiritually from the sufferings in life , as well as the blessings .
As we consider such matters , it is helpful to keep the following great truths continually in our minds .
There is really no such thing as the “ innocent ” suffering .
Since “ all have sinned and come short of the glory of God ” ( Romans 3:23 ) , there is no one who has the right to freedom from God ’s wrath on the basis of his own innocence .
As far as babies are concerned , and others who may be incompetent mentally to distinguish right and wrong , it is clear from both Scripture and universal experience that they are sinners by nature and thus will inevitably become sinners by choice as soon as they are able to do so .
The world is now under God ’s Curse ( Genesis 3:17 ) because of man ’s rebellion against God ’s Word .
This “ bondage of corruption , ” with the “ whole world groaning and travailing together in pain ” ( Romans 8:21 - 22 ) , is universal , affecting all men and women and children everywhere .
God did not create the world this way , and one day will set all things right again .
In that day , “ God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain ” ( Revelation 21:4 ) .
The Lord Jesus Christ , who was the only truly “ innocent ” and “ righteous ” man in all history , nevertheless has suffered more than anyone else who ever lived .
And this He did for us !
“ Christ died for our sins ” ( I Corinthians 15:3 ) .
He suffered and died , in order that ultimately He might deliver the world from the Curse , and that , even now , He can deliver from sin and its bondage anyone who will receive Him in faith as personal Lord and Savior .
This great deliverance from the penalty of inherent sin , as well as of overt sins , very possibly also assures the salvation of those who have died before reaching an age of conscious choice of wrong over right .
With our full faith in God ’s goodness and in Christ ’s redemption , we can recognize that our present sufferings can be turned to His glory and our good .
The sufferings of unsaved men are often used by the Holy Spirit to cause them to realize their needs of salvation and to turn to Christ in repentance and faith .
The sufferings of Christians should always be the means of developing a stronger dependence on God and a more Christ - like character , if they are properly “ exercised thereby ” ( Hebrews 12:11 ) .
Thus ,
God is loving and merciful , even when , “ for the present , ” He allows trials and sufferings to come in our lives .
“ For we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are called according to His purpose ” ( Romans 8:28 ) .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The nation 's job market was dealt a savage blow this week as a slew of companies announced more than 34,000 layoffs , and the government reported that nearly 2 million jobs have been lost this year , through November .
On Friday , the Labor Department said that employers hemorrhaged 533,000 jobs in November , the largest monthly loss since December 1974 .
This was much worse than the 325,000 expected by a consensus of economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The annual unemployment rate also increased to 6.7 % in November , from 6.5 % the prior month .
" With the loss of over half - a- million jobs just last month , the U.S. job market is now shedding jobs at a truly alarming rate , a rate that is measurably worse than past recessions , " said Jared Bernstein , senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute , in an e-mail to CNNMoney.com .
The government also revised up its losses for the prior two months , to 320,000 for October and 403,000 in September .
In total , it reported job cuts of 1.9 million for 2008 , through November .
Those losses exceed the 1.5 million job cuts that occurred in a 12 - month span from 1990 to 1991 , according to information from David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor's .
But Wyss said the current unemployment rate pales in comparison to 1982 , when the rate was nearly 11 % .
" I do n't think this is the 1930s , but it 's certainly the worst recession we 've seen since 1982 , " Wyss said in an interview on Thursday .
Job cuts continue to mount in December .
Thursday was particularly bloody , when 11 companies announced 24,914 layoffs , according to Challenger , Gray & Christmas and company reports .
Then on Friday , engine - maker Cummins said it would eliminate at least 500 white - collar jobs by the end of 2008 , and General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) released plans to lay off 2,000 workers next year .
And this is just the latest bit of bad December job news .
On Wednesday , State Street Corp. , Jefferies Group and The Carlyle Group announced job cuts totaling about 3,000 .
On Tuesday , U.S. Steel said 3,500 workers will be " affected " by the " temporary idling " of manufacturing facilities in Keewatin , Minn. , and near Detroit and St. Louis .
The total layoffs announced in the first week of December : 33,914 .
The big 5 Thursday job cuts
AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) , a Dallas - based telecom operator , said it would slash 12,000 jobs , totaling 4 % of its workforce .
AT&T attributed the staff cuts to " economic pressures , a changing business mix and a more streamlined organizational structure " in a news release .
The telecom also said it would take a charge of $ 600 million in the fourth quarter to make severance payments .
It said it would reduce its 2009 capital expenditures from its 2008 levels .
Credit Suisse Group ( CS ) said it would cut 5,300 staff jobs , 11 % of its worldwide work force , as part of a restructuring effort .
The majority of the cuts would be to investment bank jobs , said Chief Executive Brady Dougan .
In addition , the Zurich , Switzerland - based company said it would eliminate 1,200 contractor positions .
DuPont ( DD , Fortune 500 ) , a chemical company based in Wilmington , Del. , said it would cut 2,500 jobs .
DuPont Chief Executive Charles Holliday said his company was making the cuts " in response to current market challenges " and to increase the company 's competitiveness in the coming year .
DuPont said it expected a loss of 60 cents to 70 cents per share for the fourth quarter , including an 40 - cent - per - share charge from the company 's restructuring plan .
Going forward , the company expects full - year earnings to be $ 2.25 to $ 2.75 per share in 2009 .
Full - year earnings of $ 2.75 to $ 2.85 are expected for 2008 , said DuPont , down from its previously announced range of $ 3.25 to $ 3.30 per share .
Viacom Inc. , ( VIA ) an entertainment company that includes MTV Networks and Paramount Pictures , said it would cut 850 jobs , or 7 % of its workforce .
Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman said it was restructuring its company " to adapt to the challenges presented by the current economic environment . "
In addition to the job cuts , New York - based Viacom said it was suspending senior level management salary increases throughout 2009 .
The company expects the restructuring to result in pre-tax savings of $ 200 million to $ 250 million in 2009 , but it will take a pre-tax charge of $ 400 million to $ 450 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 , or 42 cents to 48 cents per diluted share .
Car rental company Avis Budget Group ( CAR , Fortune 500 ) said it has cut more than 2,200 jobs and taken other steps to meet its goal of reducing annual costs by $ 150 million to $ 200 million by the middle of 2009 .
The company will close its claims - processing facility in Orlando , Fla. , as well as its customer contact center in Wichita Falls , Texas .
Avis CEO Ronald Nelson said the company will continue its " relentless focus on cost containment " so that when economic conditions improve Avis can " achieve our ultimate goal of restoring our margins to previous levels . "
In the past weeks , Avis said it has frozen management salaries and downsized its planned fleet .
The Wednesday job cuts
This follows a slew of bad employment news on Wednesday , when State Street Corp .
( STT , Fortune 500 ) said it was cutting from 1,600 to 1,800 workers , or 6 % of its total workforce .
The Boston - based company , which provides financial services to institutional investors , said these job cuts would occur between now and the end of the first quarter of 2009 .
Two - thirds of the cuts will occur in North America , with the rest in Europe , Asia and the Pacific region .
Also on Wednesday , Jefferies Group ( JEF ) said it was shedding 18 % of its work force throughout 2008 , as part of a wider restructuring plan to " restore profitability in 2009 . "
The investment bank said it planned to end the year with 2,150 staffers .
That 's 358 less than it started with .
The company also said it was closing offices in Dubai , Singapore and Tokyo .
The Carlyle Group , a private equity investment firm based in Washington , said Wednesday that is laying off 10 % of its work force , with most of the layoffs occurring in the U.S. offices .
The Carlyle Group , has more than 1,000 workers , according to the company .
" The markets are terrible and we need to adjust accordingly , " said Carlyle spokesman Christopher Ullman .
" We 're making the adjustments to deal with the current realities of the economy . "
The future
Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute , said in an interview on Thursday that the job losses are likely to drag into next year .
But he said it 's difficult to project how long the current recession will last , and when the job market will hit bottom .
" When we see the job losses and the job picture getting worse and worse and worse , it is confirming that the recession is accelerating , that it is intensifying to the down side , but it does n't tell us where were headed in the future , said Achuthan , who focuses on leading indicators .
" The bad news does n't stop with the fact that we 're in an intensifying recession and that it 's going to continue into 2009 , " said Achuthan .
" The risk on the horizon is that the recovery , when it does come , will be a jobless recovery . "

Fans of the cult 1960 ’s TV show The Prisoner are today mourning the death of Patrick McGoohan , who passed away aged 80 after a short illness , but the role embodied by McGoohan as “ Number 6 ″ will live on as an icon of individuality and freedom in an increasingly totalitarian and controlling society .
McGoohan ’s character , who introduced every episode with the cry , “ I am not a number , I am a free man ! ” , railed against the overlords of a beautiful yet oppressive open air prison known as The Village during the 17 episode series as his ceaseless efforts to escape were continually thwarted by the authorities that ruled over the mostly brainwashed and subservient population .
The series was littered with disturbing parallels to what has unfolded in terms of the big brother panopticon that surrounds us more than 40 years after The Prisoner was first broadcast .
McGoohan himself was the creative force behind many of the episodes as well as playing the lead role and he made it clear in interviews that The Village and its symbolism was merely an allegory for the psychological prison of modern society – authoritarian control , mindless consumerism and lack of independent thought , or as McGoohan put it , “ A place that is trying to destroy the individual by every means possible , trying to break his spirit so that he accepts that he is Number 6 and will live there happily as Number 6 forever after , ” adding that the character of Number 6 symbolizes “ the one rebel that they ca n’t break ” .
“ We ’re run by the Pentagon .
We ’re run by Madison Avenue .
We ’re run by television .
And , as long as we accept those things and do n’t revolt , we ’ll have to go along with the stream to the eventual avalanche , ” McGoohan said in a 1977 interview .
“ As long as we go out and buy stuff , we ’re at their mercy .
We ’re at the mercy of the advertiser .
And , of course , there are certain things we need , but a lot of the stuff that is bought is not needed .
We all live in a little village .
Your village may be different from other people ’s villages , but we are all prisoners . ”
The series was decades ahead of its time and predicted the ubiquitous surveillance society that we now find ourselves living in , as well as technological advancements such as the cordless phone , which was unheard of in the mid 1960 ’s , as well as miniature spy cameras .
The rulers of The Village , headquartered within a giant central dome that also served as a CCTV surveillance hub allowing them to track the movements of every citizen , were symbolized by a metallic pyramid with an all - seeing eye at the top , but the viewer only ever met a series of sidekicks called Number 2 , and never discovered who was Number 1 until the very last episode .
McGoohan enraged many viewers with the controversial conclusion of the series , which revealed that Number 1 was Number 6 himself , a metaphor for the fact that ultimately we are wardens of our own prison .
The finale also depicted the prisoner ’s escape , only to reveal his return to another form of prison – society itself .
The intellectual mystique that surrounded the series engendered a cult following that remains decades later and provides a literary alarm bell for the direction in which our world is heading – with freedom , privacy and individuality being crushed and replaced with authoritarianism , bureaucracy , and tyranny as well as an exaltation of the cultural mundane while genuine originality , intellectualism and creativity is shunned .
In the following four part interview , Patrick McGoohan explains the inspiration behind the series and how it was an allegory for modern society .
The spirit of McGoohan ’s creation lives on in all of us as we each in our own small way continue to rebel against the prison planet that has been built around us while attempting to educate the wardens who continue to support the very means of their own enslavement .

Gregory B. Craig , a well - known Washington lawyer who quarterbacked President Bill Clinton ’s impeachment defense , has been chosen White House counsel .
Exclusive : Craig to be WH counsel
Gregory B. Craig , a well - known Washington lawyer who quarterbacked President Bill Clinton ’s impeachment defense , has been chosen White House counsel by President - elect Barack Obama , according to Democratic officials .
Craig is intimately familiar with the president - elect ’s record because he played the role of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) in debate preparations .
Advertisement
The officials said Obama has settled on Craig but were not sure when the appointment would be announced .
The choice gives the president - elect both experience and loyalty .
During the primaries , Craig was an early Clinton alumni defector to Obama .
Columnist Robert D. Novak reported back in the winter of 2007 that Craig had told him he “ was impressed with Obama when he first met him at the home of investment banker Vernon Jordan , an intimate friend and supporter of the Clintons . ”
Craig was an Obama foreign policy adviser during the campaign .
At the start of the Clinton administration , he had been the State Department ’s director of policy planning , the head of State ’s in - house think tank .
He also was senior adviser on defense , foreign policy and national security to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) .
The White House counsel , among the most powerful members of the West Wing inner circle , serves as the president ’s lawyer , giving him legal advice and handling pardons and conflict - of - interest issues .
Craig , 63 , is a partner at Williams & Connolly and a protégé of the late Edward Bennett Williams , the legendary Washington power lawyer .
His selection adds to the surprisingly large number of Clinton White House veterans who are at the top of the Obama roster .
Craig , who had been friends with Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham at Yale Law School , was recruited for the impeachment job by John Podesta , then deputy White House chief of staff and now a leader of Obama ’s transition .
A Washington Post profile in 1998 by Lloyd Grove and John Harris reported : “ Craig brought along his best bedside manner when Clinton summoned him to the White House residence on the night of Sept. 10 — the day after independent counsel Kenneth Starr 's lurid report to Congress was published on the World Wide Web .
On a balcony overlooking the South Lawn , Clinton and Craig sat talking for two hours . ”
Among Craig ’s other high - profile cases : successfully representing Elián González 's father , a Cuban , in his efforts to regain custody of his son ; and representing U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in connection during the Volcker Commission 's investigation of the oil - for - food Program at the United Nations .
From Craig ’s official biography : “ In September 1998 , President Clinton appointed Mr. Craig to be Assistant to the President and Special Counsel in the White House where Mr. Craig served as quarterback of the President 's team that was assembled to defend against impeachment .
Mr. Craig was also a member of the President 's trial team in the United States Senate and presented the President 's defense with respect to Count One during that trial .
“ In 1997 , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appointed Mr. Craig to be one of her senior advisors , and he served the Secretary as her Director of Policy Planning during the years 1997 to 1998 .
“ For five years ( 1984 -1988 ) , he served as Senator Edward Kennedy 's Senior Advisor on Defense , Foreign Policy and National Security issues .
“ Mr. Craig also has taught trial practice at both Yale Law School ( 1975 - 1976 ) and Harvard Law School ( 1981-1984 ) . ”
“ I ’m not creative . ”
“ I wish I could be more creative , but I do n’t have it in me . ”
“ Why are some people creative and others are n’t ? ”
If I had a nickel for every time I ’ve heard those statements or questions …
The truth is that almost everyone has creative potential .
What separates good creatives ( or dormant creatives who get lucky ) is that they ’ve learned how to walk through the creative process .
( Tweet this . )
The irony is that most of them do n’t know that there is a documented process , yet they ’ve developed habits that allow them to walk through it .
On some brute level , they understand the process , though they do n’t know how it works .
A large part of the problem is that there is an air of mystery and mysticism around the creative process .
Because people assume and reinforce the idea that some people have creative potential and others do n’t , those who do harness their potential and work through the process become all the more “ different . ”
And because so few of us see that leveraging our creativity is inextricably linked to how we make money , we let our creative process devolve into a daily crapshoot .
So , let ’s take a few minutes and demystify the creative process .
PRODUCTIVE FLOURISHING
The Four Steps of Creativity
We ’ve known for a long time that the creative process can be broken down into four distinct processes , most of which can be fostered and augmented .
The processes are :
Preparation Incubation Illumination Implementation
I ’ll spend some time on each step .
Preparation
This is the first phase , which most people call “ work . ”
A writer , for example , prepares by writing , by reading , or by revising earlier work .
A musician plays scales , chords , or songs ; a painter messes with paints or visits an art gallery ; an entrepreneur researches problems to solve ; a programmer plays with code .
In each example , the creative is going through relatively mundane processes .
The reason I say most people call this phase “ work ” is that these processes may or may not be inherently enjoyable .
They ’re also fairly mundane and tedious , but the creative has learned that this process is necessary to plant the seeds that lead to …
Incubation
This would be the mystical process , if there were one , because you often do n’t know that you ’re incubating an idea , or if you do know you ’re working on one , you do n’t know when it ’s going to come out .
It ’s during this phase that your conscious and subconscious minds are working on the idea , making new connections , separating out unnecessary ideas , and grabbing for other ideas .
This is the phase that most people mess up the most with distractions and the hustle and bustle of daily lives .
Modern life , with its many beeps , buzzes , and distractions , has the strong tendency to grab the attention of both our subconscious and our unconscious mind , and as result , the creative process stops and is instead replaced by more immediate concerns .
However , from this phase comes …
Illumination
This is the “ Eureka ” moment that many of us spend our days questing after .
When it hits , the creative urge is so incredibly strong that we lose track of what else is happening .
The driving impulse is to get whatever is going on in our heads down into whatever medium it ’s intended for .
The most frustrating thing for me is that the “ illumination ” moments happen at the most inopportune times .
They invariably happen when I ’m in the shower , when I ’m driving by myself , when I ’m working out , or when I ’m sitting in mind - numbing meetings that I ca n’t get out of .
Of course , the bad part is as I said above : the impulse is to get the idea out as soon as possible , so it ’s not at all uncommon for me to stop showering , driving , or working out and run to the nearest notepad – and , in meetings , I start purging immediately anyway .
I ’ve yet to gain enough clout to excuse myself from the meetings , but I ’m working on it .
I was speaking to a friend a few weeks ago , and I told her I was frustrated because I was pregnant with ideas and did n’t have time to get them out .
Keeping with the analogy , when a Eureka !
moment hits , it ’s much like labor – you ’re done with incubating , and it ’s time for …
Implementation
This phase is the one in which the idea you ’ve been preparing and incubating sees the light of day .
It ’s when that written piece comes out , when that song flows , when that canvas reveals its painting , and so on .
It ’s also when a good creative starts to evaluate the idea and determine whether it ’s good or not – but only after they have enough to see where it ’s going .
Most of the creatives I know or work with get really frustrated with others during this phase .
Other people only see the creation at the end , and they do n’t recognize or care much about the process that generated that idea .
This is especially true with some supervisors and bosses who expect the end product on a certain schedule , even though the creative process does not work that way .
Creatives know that for every good idea , there are at least a few that do n’t work out , but they ca n’t know ahead of time what ’s going to work out and what wo n’t .
The creative process begins with work and ends with work .
The take - away point here is that creativity is not just percolating and Eureka : it ’s percolating and Eureka sandwiched between work phases .
Debugging Your Creative Process
Understanding the creative process helps you start figuring out where your bugs are .
My contention here is that everyone is capable of creative thought and originality , but some people are more creative because they ’ve learned either how to let their process work or how to augment the creative process .
Everyone else short - circuits their creative process .
I should add a caveat here which some may find empowering and others may find frustrating .
Intelligence and creativity are loosely related – some really intelligent people are not very creative , and some creative people are n’t all that intelligent in the way that we standardly view intelligence .
Creativity favors intelligence , but that has almost everything to do with two facts : 1 ) the more intelligent creative can prepare more quickly and more broadly than the less intelligent creative , and 2 ) the more intelligent creative generally has managed to secure employment that allows her more autonomy in her schedule .
In case you want numbers , most psychologists conclude that people with an IQ of 120 or above have plenty of potential to pursue creative thinking and lifestyles , and under that , they ’ll struggle .
There ’s also very little correlation between education and intelligence , so do n’t think you ca n’t be creative because you did n’t go to college or grad school .
Some of the smartest people I know never attended college .
In my experience and work with others , the first two steps are where most people mess up their creative process .
Part of preparation is working on things that interest you , and most people have n’t really sat down and figured out what interests and motivates them .
This is especially true since our culture both exalts creatives and hates them at the same time and a lot of people have n’t found their creative outlet .
They think either that they ’re not creative or that creative pursuits are a waste of time .
Another area in preparation where many people go wrong is in not being aware of how social the creative process is .
Few great ideas come from a person sitting and thinking by herself – true , that ’s part of the incubation phase , but the seeds are planted in the preparation phase .
Talking to people who are interested in the same things you are or who are just plain creative helps you become more creative , and this explains why creatives tend to be attracted to areas with a high density of other creatives .
You have to balance creating , connecting , and consuming .
Also , as I discussed above , many people do n’t let their ideas incubate .
Creatives throughout history have always spoken against working for someone else because doing so has a tendency to stop your own incubation process – when your boss tells you to change directions on a project or reassigns tasks , your incubation process is stunted .
Additionally , when you do n’t understand that your well - being and employment depend on your ability to leverage your creativity , you ’re less likely to take this important part of the process seriously .
Hint :
The fact that you work for someone else has little to do with your creativity or the fact that you are employed due to your creativity .
With these two phases of the process short - circuited , it ’s no wonder that people are n’t manifesting their creativity .
It ’s not because they do n’t have the capacity to be creative , and it has everything to do with their creative process being buggy .
Fixing the creative process is not that hard to do , and I ’ll talk more about it in future posts .
Here ’s something I want you to keep in mind and it ’s why I ’m so adamant about your understanding your creative process and understanding that your livelihood depends on your leveraging your creativity : all it takes is one or two good ideas , well executed , for you to live the life of greatness .
Most of the influential creatives throughout history – including present ones – started with one really good idea .
The rest of their life was spent either working on that idea or living off of the fruit of that idea .
You may be incubating that great idea , or you may be one step away from it , and I want you to get it out so we can all enjoy it .

PRODUCTIVE FLOURISHING
Protesters chant ' bailout is a sellout ' as Big 3 execs testify RAW STORY
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Protesters were escorted from a Senate hearing room Thursday , chanting " the bailout is a sellout " as executives from the Big Three automakers requested $ 34 billion in taxpayer funds they said was necessary to prevent collapse .
About 18 people were escorted from the Senate Banking Committee hearing .
" The bailout is a sellout .
The poor are suffering ... the homeless , the hungry , they 're suffering , " the protesters chanted as Capitol Police escorted them from the room .
Before the outburst , Sen. John Thune ( D - MT ) was questioning the auto executives and criticizing President Bush 's policies .
" I hope this does n't count against my time , " he quipped .
It 's unclear who organized the protesters , but none appeared to be dressed in the rosy garb that has been a trademark of Code Pink , the anti-war group that regularly interrupts House and Senate hearings with protests .
Video of the protests will be posted here soon .
Auto execs beg for aid Executives from Ford , GM and Chrysler pressed their case for a bailout .
The executives returned to Capitol Hill two weeks after their initial appeal for a government rescue ended in humiliation at the hands of congressional leaders who ordered them back to Detroit to reframe restructuring plans .
" It 's fair to say that last month 's hearings were difficult for us ... but we learned a lot , " General Motors Corp Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared testimony .
" We 're here today because we made mistakes , and we 're here because forces beyond our control have pushed us to the brink . "
Ford CEO
Alan Mulally also attempted to show contrition before his grilling by the panel of senators .
" Since the last hearing , I have thought a great deal about the concerns you expressed .
I want you to know I heard your message loud and clear . "
Robert Nardelli , CEO of Chrysler , argued his firm 's already advanced restructuring and cost cuts had been plunged into uncertainty by outside economic factors .
" We 're here because the financial crisis that started in 2007 and accelerated at the end of the second quarter in 2008 .
" As consumer confidence fell and credit markets remained frozen , the lowest US auto sales in more than 20 years has put tremendous pressure on our cash position . "
Banking committee chairman Senator Chris Dodd said a failure to take action would amount to playing " Russian roulette " with the US economy .
" We need to act , not for the purpose of protecting a handful of companies .
If that were the extent of the issue -- I would let them fail .
" Inaction is no solution . "
But the committee 's top Republican Senator Richard Shelby , who opposes the bailout , questioned the debt - laden firm 's restructuring plans and asked whether they were ready to use the crisis as an opportunity to change .
" I have my doubts , " he said .
Democratic leaders have raised the prospect of recalling Congress for a vote on a rescue next week but it remained unclear whether there was sufficient support in Congress to pass a rescue plan .
In a belated public relations exercise , the executives , pilloried for swooping into the first hearing in corporate jets , drove more than 500 miles from Detroit in fuel - efficient cars .
Democrats want the White House to tap an already approved 700 billion dollar finance industry bailout to rescue the auto firms .
But the Bush administration insists the money should come from a 25 billion dollars in loans designed to spur development of fuel efficient vehicles .
Wagoner gave fresh evidence of the precarious state of his company , requesting a second four billion dollar loan by January in addition to an already requested immediate four billion dollar rescue payment .
Both payments would come from GM 's request for 12 billion dollars in short - term loans and a six billion dollar line of credit requested by the firm .
On Wednesday , United Auto Workers ( UAW ) president Ron Gettelfinger said his union was willing to delay billions in dollars of payments to a health care fund and suspending provisions of the union 's contract for laid - off workers .
The about - face , after the union earlier ruled out more sacrifices , illustrated the gravity of the crisis with around three million jobs at stake .
GM and Chrysler warn they could run out of cash within a matter of weeks without billions of dollars in low - cost , government - backed loans .
Neither automaker expects they would be able to survive if they were forced into bankruptcy protection and the ripple effects of their failure would be felt across the country as auto supplies and related companies unravel .
Mulally argued Ford 's restructuring program was already working well and said it might pull through on its own and return to profitability by 2011 , but asked for a nine billion dollar line of credit in case the economy worsens .
In its restructuring plan , Chrysler said it needed seven billion dollars by December 31 if it was to survive global credit crisis , falling demand for large vehicles and a global economic slump .
The fate of the key industry is a key early test of the incoming administration of president - elect Barack Obama , who has warned he is not prepared to write the companies a blank check .
With wire reports
Our political web design firm watched and participated in the 2008 elections with great interest and vigor .
2008 was possibly the watershed year for online politics where all candidates finally realized that the Internet was n't just a fad or a gaming platform , but actually serves as perhaps the most powerful and efficient tool to mobilize volunteers and win votes .
There were many success and failures in the 08 cycle , below is the list of the top 10 that we put together .
If you have ideas for other events that we left off , be sure to leave them in the comments .
Also , we invite you to vote in our poll and weigh in on what you think were the most important online political events of 2008 .
In the New Year , we 'll release the final results of the poll and the most popular events that people felt we left off our list .
Enjoy the list and please join the conversation by leaving a comment or voting in the poll !
10 . Mitt Romney 's YouTube Ad Contest - Romney crowdsourced an ad that actually ran on TV .
The campaign gave supporters an opportunity to make their own ad using Jumpcut 's video editing technology .
While Moveon.org and Chevrolet had used similar strategies before , Romney was the first of the 08 candidates to use the technique and it was a great success garnerning 129 impressive submissions and producing this final ad .
9. 5 Friends YouTube Video -
An independent , funny , non-partisan viral video of celebrities urging people to vote .
The video embraced the viral nature of the web and encouraged people to pass along the Google Polling Place Locator to 5 of their unregistered friends .
The video and its sequel garnered more than 5 million views , mentions on hundreds of blogs , and were highlighted by many mainstream media outlets .
8. YouTube Debates -
At first the Republicans were hesitant of having a debate mediated by questions submitted via YouTube , but in the end , both parties hosted fun , but rather non-controversial , YouTube debates .
It was undoubtedly the first time debate questions had been asked in the form of songs and there was added emotion when soldiers in uniform asked about national security plans , which made the debates an interesting and innovative experiment .
Also , as the debates were co-sponsored by CNN and YouTube , it was an interesting and prophetic meshing of new and old media .
7. Ron Paul's Online Fundraising -
While most of the online fundraising attention was directed at Barack Obama , almost more impressive is what Ron Paul was able to do as a longshot candidate that was n't even allowed to participate in the debates .
No backing from the party and little media coverage did n't stop Paul from setting a GOP one - day record for online fundraising by hauling in $ 4.2 million in 24 hours on November 5 , 2008 .
It was all due to an independent grass roots campaign tie to the commemoration of Guy Fawkes Day through YouTube videos , blogs , and social networks .
6. Disorganization of McCain's Online Campaign - While Obama 's campaign will go down as the prototype for a new media campaign , McCain seemed to be stuck in the stone ages .
Obama had dozens of staffers dedicated solely to online operations , while many reports have the McCain campaign dedicating fewer than 5 people to the web campaign .
While Obama 's campaign was busy mobilizing millions of volunteers through the web , McCain was content to go on the record saying he did not know how to e-mail .
The lack of online effort by McCain is almost as significant as Obama 's innovation , as it defined McCain as a candidate of the past that did n't understand today 's generation .
5. Politico.com , HuffingtonPost.com , Fivethirtyeight.com -
In this election , it seemed as Internet news sites had the upperhand on most of their " traditional " counterparts .
By being flexible and quick to update , these sites were the go - to sources for the obsessed campaign watchers that wanted the latest breaking news .
Their style forced media stalwarts to change their style and be more willing to update news on the fly and have permanent blogs on their homepages .
4. Obama Driving Online Signups Through VP Text Promise -
While this event was n't strictly online , there 's no way we could leave it off the list .
Obama 's VP announcement text was able to signup millions of interested voters , many of those registered online or were pushed to the website to further engage with the campaign .
The VP announcement was texted to nearly 3 million mobile devices .
Over the coming months , Obama would use the numbers to push people to the campaign website , have them watch the DNC , and thank them for their support .
3. Hulu , YouTube , Blogs , etc on Tina Fey 's Palin Impression - Fey 's impression of the VP candidate may go down as the most famous impression in history .
The videos have garnered more than 20 million views on NBC.com and YouTube , and more importantly , it let Fey define Palin before the Governor could do so on her own terms .
Without the web , the impression would not have been nearly as ubiquitous and " mavericky " may have never entered our vernacular , however , through video sharing sites , the video was able to reach an audience exponentially larger than a typical Saturday Night Live broadcast .
Not only loved by the public , the impression was also a critical success , leading to Fey being named one of TIME 's people of the year and the AP Entertainer of the Year .
2. My.BarackObama.com -
While other candidates were happy setting up supporter pages on Facebook and MySpace profiles , Barack Obama took it to the next level by hiring one of the Facebook founders and " re-inventing the wheel " by building his own social network , my.barackobama.com ( MyBo ) .
More than 1 million people registered with MyBo , but the power of MyBo was n't just registrants but the tools that the site put at their disposal .
Unlike the other campaigns , Obama used his social network to mobilize volunteers and give them the tools to fundraise and engage friends .
In the end , according to the P2P foundation , more than 1 billion emails were sent from MyBo , over 100,000 events had been scheduled , and hundreds of millions of dollars had been raised .
1. Campaign Websites Finally Come Into Their Own .
This was the first election year in which every Presidential candidate put forth a significant effort online .
In '04 , Dean was the first to really " get it " and use his site as more than just a brochure .
This year , every candidate , specifically Clinton , Edwards , Obama , and Romney embraced the Web by having social networks , active bloggers , flash video , user generated content , and more .
The revolution was n't just limited to these top level campaigns , as many Congressional level and even state races embraced the web as the engaging , efficient , and effective medium that it has become .
That 's our top 10 list .
Let us know in the comments what we left out and be sure to vote in our poll for the most important online political events of 2008 .
Some close runners up were Sarah Silverman 's Great Schlep , the Google Polling Place Locator , and the GOP crowdsourcing their platform .
We 're excited to see the new online political innovations in 2009 ; what this year did most successfully was convey the importance of online efforts to campaigns at every level .

It 's a difficult time for recycling advocates .
I remember in times past , some towns would simply drop their programs until it was again profitable .
Of course , dumping all this in landfills carries its own costs :
Sonoco Recycling , which processes bottles , cans , jars and papers collected from Raleigh homes , sent a truckload of metal cans two weeks ago to a smelting plant in Pennsylvania .
As recently as August , the load would have been worth about $ 7,500 .
Not now , though .
Instead of receiving payment , Sonoco had to pay the shipping to get the plant to accept the cans .
" It cost us $ 240 in freight , and I was giving it away , " said Jim Foster , plant manager of Sonoco 's materials recovery facility in Southeast Raleigh .
" There is no way to win right now . "
People are still putting their bins of recyclables out on curbs .
But the recyclable materials market , which was booming only a few months ago , has dropped sharply , along with the worldwide economy , creating a backlog of materials at processing plants .
Reduced demand for used paper , plastic bottles , glass , and metal cans has caused prices to plummet , surprising even those who have followed the ups and downs of the recycling market .
The Future of Science Fiction ?
We ’re living in it .
Those “ Future History ” charts in the back of every Robert A Heinlein paperback , when I was about 14 , had the early 21st century tagged as the “ Crazy Years ” .
He had an American theocratic dictatorship happening about then .
I hope we miss that one .
Otherwise , I ’m assuming these are those years .
The thing called science fiction that we do with literature will always be with us .
The genre we ’ve called science fiction since about 1927 , maybe not so much .
That ’s something to do with the nature of genres , though , and nothing to …
The lucrative nature of that revenue increase cannot be appreciated without doing something that T - Mobile chose not to do , which is to talk about whether its costs rose as the industry ’s messaging volume grew tenfold .
Mr. Kohl ’s letter of inquiry noted that “ text messaging files are very small , as the size of text messages are generally limited to 160 characters per message , and therefore cost carriers very little to transmit . ”
A better description might be “ cost carriers very , very , very little to transmit . ”
A text message initially travels wirelessly from a handset to the closest base - station tower and is then transferred through wired links to the digital pipes of the telephone network , and then , near its destination , converted back into a wireless signal to traverse the final leg , from tower to handset .
In the wired portion of its journey , a file of such infinitesimal size is inconsequential .
Srinivasan Keshav , a professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo , in Ontario , said : “ Messages are small .
Even though a trillion seems like a lot to carry , it is n’t . ”
Perhaps the costs for the wireless portion at either end are high  spectrum is finite , after all , and carriers pay dearly for the rights to use it .
But text messages are not just tiny ; they are also free riders , tucked into what ’s called a control channel , space reserved for operation of the wireless network .
That ’s why a message is so limited in length : it must not exceed the length of the message used for internal communication between tower and handset to set up a call .
The channel uses space whether or not a text message is inserted .
Professor Keshav said that once a carrier invests in the centralized storage equipment  storing a terabyte now costs only $ 100 and is dropping  and the staff to maintain it , its costs are basically covered .
“ Operating costs are relatively insensitive to volume , ” he said .
“ It does n’t cost the carrier much more to transmit a hundred million messages than a million . ”
UNTIL Mr. Kohl began his inquiries , the public had no reason to think of the text - messaging business as anything but an ordinary one , whose operational costs rose in tandem with message volume .
The carriers had no reason to correct such an impression .
Bokeh is an adaptation from a a Japanese word meaning blur .
In photography this term is used to describe the quality of the areas in the picture which are not in focus .
When referring to Bokeh , we can distinguish some of it characteristics :
– Is the light / dark gradient smooth or sharp ?
– What shape will a small dot of light take what it is in the Bokeh area ?
( mirror lenses for example , create a bagel like Bokeh )
We can play with those two variants to create a special Bokeh .
You will need :
1. Cut and shape the sheet to make a fake lens hood .
The Diameter is made so that it snugly fits on the lens .
2 . In the middle of the filter the wanted bokeh shape is cut out – in out example a heart is used .
I ’m not sure how big a hole the shape can be .
But you can check it right away by just looking through the viewfinder .
On the 50 mm lens @ F1.8 a 15 mm heart gives a metering value equal to F3.2 , so it can probably be a little bigger ( you can use a puncher or cut it by hand ) .
3 . Set your camera to its lowest aperture value ( completely open ) .
Here are two shots to demonstrate this technique – one with a bare lens and the other with the hearted hood .
See more shots here and here ( I leave it as an exercise to tell which is which :)
Here are the parameters for the example shown above :
Lens – Canon 50 mm F1.8
“ Lens hood ” Diameter : 70 mm ( 2.75 inch )
Hole diameter : 15 mm ( 0.6inch )
Here are two more great examples for this technique from RottieLover ( note – there only one “ real ” heart in each picture ) :
Do you have a cool bokeh ?
show off on the comments .
If you like the effect there is also a commercial version available – the Bokeh Masters Kit .

Government Proposes Nationalizing the Automakers
The march into socialism continues , it is too late to stop it .
Say goodbye to the boys .
Today comes word that under the latest bill sent to the president the government would gain a 20 % stake in the auto industry .
Congress and the White House inched toward a financial rescue of the Big Three auto makers , negotiating legislation that would give the U.S. government a substantial ownership stake in the industry and a central role in its restructuring
I am so tired about writing about this bailout bullshit and nobody cares anyway so to hell with it , this IS my last post on this issue .
Too many Americans are unaware of the government takeover that has been happening right under our very eyes .
Nobody can say that I did n’t try to warn you .

Yesterday I was listening to the pre-inaugural concert at the Lincoln Memorial on the radio , and one of the speakers said something that struck me as emblematic of the challenges that Barack Obama faces , though I doubt she realized the ironic significance .
She was praising Theodore Roosevelt ’s conservationist legacy as a model for Obama , with some quotes from him at the Grand Canyon or Yosemite or some other celebrated national park , though she only touched on a small sliver of Roosevelt ’s environmental legacy .
He definitely did cherish the environment ; a timeline of his life shows that in early April 1903 he “ commune [d ] with deer while writing letters in Yellowstone , WY . ”
He was indeed a conservationist , as were many progressives at the time .
But the progressives were also something else – something that today ’s progressives would do well to remember : ardent planners whose plans often had grave unforeseen consequences .
Just after his time communing with the deer at Yellowstone , Roosevelt traveled to St. Louis to address the 1903 Good Roads Convention .
The “ good roads ” movement dated back to before the automobile rose to prominence , and was formed to agitate for improved roads for bicyclists and farmers .
But around the time of Roosevelt ’s speech , the movement was hijacked by the budding auto - industrial complex .
Unwilling or unable to compete on their own against mass transit , the automakers , highway engineers , and road contractors sought for the state to both acquire the rights of way necessary for the roads , and to pay for them to be paved – an advantage the streetcars and railroads did not generally have .
Not wanting to appear to be too blatant in their rent seeking , these interests lobbied the government indirectly , giving organizations like the AAA money in exchange for influence and seats on their boards .
The nascent auto industry was not the only booster of subsidized roads – even the private railroads were not immune to the siren song of the great new progressive future .
They joined the cause in the 1890s with the idea that improved roads would mean more business for railroads , unaware of the threat that the long - haul trucking industry would come to pose to their business .
This new semi-public , semi- private corporatist transportation model suited the progressives as well , who believed in a statist future where “ private ” enterprise was directed and controlled , though not outright owned , by the government .
In the years since the 1903 Good Roads Convention , the idea that government ought to be providing “ good roads ” has fundamentally altered the landscape of the country in ways that Theodore Roosevelt never could have imagined .
The highway lobby gathered strength throughout the first half of the 20th century , eventually culminating in the Interstate Highway System , the widespread suburbanization of America , and the destruction of American cities .
Urban planners like Robert Moses razed neighborhoods and blighted the remaining barren landscapes with highways that have become increasingly congested ever since .
In order to stave off this inevitable overuse , planners flattened America with zoning laws and parking regulations that forced Americans to sprawl away from city centers , to areas reachable only by cars and trucks .
A century later it ’s hard to imagine it happening any other way , and it ’s often forgotten that there was a workable free market urbanism before there was unsustainable sprawl .
Especially in recent decades , the system has acquired the façade of self - sufficiency and thus the illusion of being a market institution , because of the Highway Trust Fund and separate gas taxes and user fees levied specifically on motorists .
But some of the most significant costs – the acquisition of land for rights - of - way – were paid for earlier in the century , when the government ’s power of eminent domain was near absolute .
Furthermore , roads are asked only to recoup their capital and operating costs ( well , most of them anyway ) , though every freshman in Econ 101 ought to know that a profit - seeking entrepreneur seeks to recoup his opportunity costs rather than just his accounting costs .
In other words , not only does he try to make a profit , but the underlying land should n’t earn him any more money were it put to some other use – a test no roads are subject to .
To add insult to injury , the nature of roads and private cars is such that they work best in low density environments , but cannot scale upwards without becoming prohibitively expensive due to the cost of ever - widening roads .
Mass transit is precisely the opposite – it handles high densities well , and is utterly unprofitable at lower ones .
Predictably , America ’s zoning rules and parking regulations are overwhelmingly oriented towards densities lower than what the market would demand in their absence .
Theodore Roosevelt might be more commonly remembered for his conservationist work , but it ’s important for people today to remember the unforeseen consequences of the his other grand plans .
The “ good roads ” path that he helped put America on has shown itself to be an enabler of global climate change , encouraging Americans to live farther apart , travel farther each day , have bigger houses , and fill those houses with more things .
The common telling of the roading of America is that it oiled the gears of commerce and is an integral part of the “ American dream , ” but it ’s impossible to know what sort of advances in mass transit technology would have come about and how we’d be living had the government not favored the automobile and the truck over the streetcar and the train .
Theodore Roosevelt ’s conservationist efforts are indeed praiseworthy , but might both the environment and the economy be in better shape today had the progressives not interrupted the rail - based urbanization of turn - of - the - century America and put us on the car - based sprawling sub - and exurbanization that characterizes America today ?
In calling for the government to fund more mass transit and urban projects , Barack Obama has shown that he sees the problems in America ’s land use configuration .
But in doing so , he ’s shown himself to be ignorant of the root causes of the crisis : government meddling in the transportation and land use industries .
Just as the progressives and futurists failed to use the government to design a more efficient transportation scheme , Obama will likely fail in using the government to fix America ’s energy problems .
Unless he renounces the legacy of the progressives and admits to America that it needs to return to its market - based roots – at least with respect to transportation and land use policy – his campaign promises of reversing our unsustainable ways will go unfulfilled .

Two years after we last picked the web 's cream of the crop , our latest selection finds that location - based services , work - anywhere collaboration and video are prominent
The online world has changed dramatically even since we last drew up a list of 100 useful sites in December 2006 .
In the interim , there has been a revival of the browser wars - with Google 's Chrome and Apple 's Safari making surprising inroads into the Windows monopoly , and offering a new vision of what browsing can be like .
Many of the sites listed here were not available when we did our last list ; although longevity is a mark of pride online , it is difficult for companies set up in the 1990s to reinvent themselves quickly enough to take advantage of new technologies .
Although of course rapid change brings casualties too : it 's possible that with all the economic turbulence going on that some of the sites here wo n't be around in a year from now , or that their now free services will have become paid - for .
That does n't diminish their usefulness , though ; it just underlines their determination to survive .
The biggest changes since 2006 have been in the fields of collaborative online services that let people in different locations work simultaneously on projects .
Collaboration in 2006 was very much focused on words , but now you can create presentations that look as though they were made with expensive packages .
And then you can share those presentations , or look at other work that people have done - and even download them .
You can convert files without needing expensive systems .
Collaborative working has never been easier , even across different platorms .
The web really is becoming the operating system , as the rise of the " netbooks " ( aka ultraportables , aka Liliputers ) emphasises .
The growth of location - based services - particularly those which you can choose to log yourself in and out of , thus protecting your privacy - has been rapid .
A parallel growth has come with the mobile web ; there 's no escaping the fact that Apple 's iPhone has revolutionised how its users , in their millions , think about the internet .
For them , it is no longer something that is experienced well on a computer and then badly on their mobile phone ; the mobile version of Safari has made browsing on the move an altogether more pleasant experience , which it never was before .
That opens up new vistas : location - aware task managers can adjust the order of your to - do list based on what the GPS unit in the phone is telling you , so that while you 're in the supermarket it will remind you about the cereal you need , but in the office it will tell you to send that important memo right away .
Video , of course , is now everywhere .
YouTube was already dominant in 2006 , but now the BBC's iPlayer is taking over .
If it makes its technology available to all , perhaps the UK will become a nation of video makers and watchers .
So here are our 100 revised best sites to see you through the next couple of years .
They 're organised roughly along those lines .

As you 're settling in your summer flings you may be wondering if that special someone loves you back .
Fortunately , science can provide a more determinable answer than gazing into your lover 's eyes ever will .
Simply ask yourself the following questions : " How have his / her kidneys been functioning lately ? " , " What 's his / her current Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) level ? " , and " Has the oxytocin been elevating ? "
Love is not as abstract as romantics like to imagine .
Most of the process can be answered through science .
Even before that first encounter , your body produces the hormone testosterone ( in both males and females ) which causes one to lust and keep an eye out for a potential mate .
Who you find compatible depends on how people 's sweat glands smells or what they look like .
One study , in the University of New Mexico , found people look for symmetry .
If a person produces the right amount of estrogen then their waist - to - hip ratio presents a more attractive figure for the opposite sex .
From the moment you set eyes on someone your body is responding to hormones .
That feeling that your heart 's racing and all that nervous sweating that occurs is all a result of the norepinephrine that your body is releasing .
The amount of love you hold can be measured by the concentration of NGF neurotrophins in your blood .
NGF is thought to be associated with how infatuated someone is .
The study , published in the journal of Psychoneuroendocrinology , found that when people claimed to have " passionate love " the NGF had a higher than normal concentration .
The hours spent day dreaming of your lover and that overall great feeling is inspired by the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine which is the same chemical released when someone 's smoking or snorting a line of cocaine .
If that 's not enough to convince the person they 're madly in love , the body will start releasing serotonin which uses the same chemical receptor when one takes the drug ectasy , MDMA , or psychedelic mushrooms .
This is also the state where people start acting insane and making irrational decisions for the sake of love .
Interestingly , the serotonin does n't always rise in people and sometimes even lowers which will cause certain people to be depressed or anxious while feeling in love at the same time .
All these chemicals in the body do n't stick around for long though .
At a certain point these chemicals need to stop being released if for nothing else but the healthy state of our mind .
The usual drop occurs in about a year .
The NGF levels , which were previously mentioned as the chemical associated with love , was found to drop in only 8 months .
At this point , people will report feeling like they 've lost that initial attraction or state of love and may separate from their partners .
This is also the time when love actually depends heavily on the social aspects of the bond for it to last .
However , even then there are a few hormones which can be detected to help determine how long or strong the bond between two people will last .
Oxytocin is one of the main chemicals that 's released to strengthen this bond .
Without getting too Freudian about it , it 's the same chemical that 's released to create a bond between a mother and child as the child suckles her breasts .
It 's no coincidence that it's also released by both sexes during an orgasm .
Theoretically , the more sex you have , the more oxytocin is released and the stronger the bond becomes .
There 's also vasopressin which is structurally similar to oxytocin , both came from the same genes 400 million years ago .
Vasopressin is provided to patients during heart attacks .
It 's used during septic shock when the chemicals such as dopamine are not working .
Coincidentally , our body uses vasopressin to strengthen the bond between two people when dopamine levels drop .
The French nobleman , La Rochefoucauld , once wrote " True love is like ghosts , which everybody talks about and few have seen . "
This is only true if scientists are among the few who 've seen it .
Google has released a new experimental browser plugin that allows web applications to securely run native code on the underlying platform .
The plugin , which is called Native Client , is distributed under the open source BSD license and is designed to work with all major platforms and browsers .
Native Client provides a sandboxed web - embeddable runtime environment for portable x86 binaries .
It also provides a bridge to facilitate communication between JavaScript and Native Client executables .
This makes it possible for complex web applications to seamlessly leverage native code for processor - intensive computations .
Allowing web applications to run native code has traditionally posed significant security risks .
Microsoft 's COM - based ActiveX technology , which aimed to provide developers with similar capabilities , is widely viewed as one of the most egregious security failings of the Windows operating system and it has become a frequent attack vector for malicious code .
Google believes that its security model has the potential to be far more robust and effective than the code - signing system of trust used by ActiveX .
Google 's engineers explain the differences between the Native Client and ActiveX security models in a paper about the project :
" [ ActiveX 's ] dependency on the user making prudent trust decisions is commonly exploited .
ActiveX provides no guarantee that a trusted control is safe , and even when the control itself is not inherently malicious , defects in the control can be exploited , often permitting execution of arbitrary code , " the paper explains .
" In contrast , NaCl is designed to prevent such exploitation , even for flawed NaCl modules . "
The Native Client framework consists of trusted and untrusted modules that run in their own individual processes and communicate through an RPC system .
Third - party untrusted modules contain application - specific programming and leverage the Native Client container to interact with trusted modules that perform any activities which impact the underlying platform , including networking operations and file system access .
The container will impose security constraints on the behavior of the third - party code and will also give users granular control over the permissions granted to third - party code .
Google supplies a customized GCC build toolchain that can be used to compile portable binaries that are compatible with the Native Client infrastructure .
This makes it extremely easy to port existing code .
As a test , Google ported an H.264 encoder that is about 11,000 lines of conventional C code .
To get the encoder to compile and run in Native Client , they only had to add approximately 20 lines of code and modify the Makefile .
The resulting binaries are completely portable and can run without requiring recompilation on any operating system supported by the Native Client .
" Legacy Linux libraries that do n't inherently require network and disk generally port to NaCl with minimal effort , " Google 's paper says .
" Performance of the original and NaCl versions [ of the H.264 encoder ] were comparable and limited by video frame - rate . "
Google provides several examples to demonstrate how easy it is to adapt a program so that it can be used with the Native Client system .
The simplest example is a little Hello World application that demonstrates how to make a native function that is callable through JavaScript .
#include < stdio.h > # include < string.h > # include < nacl/nacl_srpc.h > /* Return a clever string .
*/ int HelloWorld( NaClAppArg ** in_args , NaClAppArg ** out_args ) { /*
Strdup must be used because the SRPC layer frees the string passed to it . */ out_args [ 0 ] ->u.sval = strdup ( " hello , world . " ) ; return RPC_OK ; } /* Export the method as taking no arguments and returning one integer .
*/ NACL_SRPC_METHOD ( " helloworld : :s " , HelloWorld ) ;
To use this function in a web page , the C file must be compiled into a Native Client executable , which is then embedded in the web page and accessed through JavaScript :
< embed id =" pluginobj " type=" application / x-nacl - srpc " width= " 0 " height = " 0 " xsrc=" srpc_hw.nexe " mce_src=" srpc_hw.nexe " />
// helloworld is invoked when its button is pressed .
function helloworld ( ) { try { alert ( document.getElementById('pluginobj').helloworld ( ) ) ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; } }
One of the most impressive examples provided by Google is a patch for the SDL version of Quake , the classic first person shooter .
I downloaded the source code and data files from the ID web site and compiled it with the Native Client build tools after applying Google 's patch .
I tested it extensively ( playing Quake is a tough job , but somebody has to do it ! ) and was pleased with the performance .
Although running a computer game in the browser ( where have we seen that before ? ) may not be particularly thrilling , Native Client opens up a lot of really exciting possibilities for building rich native / web hybrid applications .
Along with much - needed improvements in JavaScript performance , support for bridging the gap between JavaScript and native code could really transform the web .
Google has made this early technical demo available with the hope that public exposure will help harden the code .
The company has urged security experts and independent developers to rough up the Native Client security model and help find way to improve it so that it can be as safe and secure as possible when it is ready to be deployed to end users .

A former Florida high school student who was disciplined for " cyberbullying " a teacher on Facebook is suing the school principal on allegations of violating her free speech rights .
The case highlights the legal challenges facing courts and school administrators as they grapple with campus civil order and free expression in an online world .
" We 're in the very first generation of this and there 's nothing ripe for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear , " said Frank LoMonte , executive director of the Virginia - based Student Press Law Center .
The lawsuit , filed Monday in a Florida federal court , concerns Katherine Evans , now 19 , who was suspended as a senior last year after creating a Facebook group devoted to her English teacher .
The group was called " Ms. Sarah Phelps is the worst teacher I 've ever met ! , " and featured a photograph of the teacher , and an invitation for other students to " express your feelings of hatred . "
After people 's comments derided Evans for the online stunt , and expressed support for the teacher , she deleted the group .
But Pembroke Pines Charter High School , which did not respond for comment , suspended Evans for three days for " disruptive behavior " and for " Bullying / Cyber Bullying Harassment towards a staff member , " according to the lawsuit , which is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
Evans was removed from her from advanced placement classes " and forced her into the lesser - weighted honors classes . "
The lawsuit alleges the black mark on Evans ' permanent record is " unjustifiably straining her academic reputation and good standing . "
The lawsuit ( .pdf ) is one of about a dozen across the United States that are part of the fallout as schools confront cyberbullying and the explosion of social networking sites .
A Texas high school volleyball coach in September went so far as to declare a ban on student Facebook and MySpace profiles , a decision the Northside Independent School District reversed ( .pdf ) .
Last month , Tennessee State University blocked the online gossip site
JuicyCampus at the school firewall .
In June , Missouri enacted a law against " cyberbullying " in the wake of the Megan Meier suicide tragedy , which was triggered by a hoax MySpace account .
Before the internet , student speech cases usually concerned student newspapers and dress codes .
There 's no bright - line rule on what constitutes free , student speech in the online world .
And as schools start to regulate off - campus student speech on the internet , lawsuits are following .
The U.S. Supreme Court has never addressed the parameters of online student speech , but might soon .
So far , lower courts are following a 1969 high court ruling saying student speech is protected unless it is " substantially disruptive , " though the road map provided by that decision is leading different judges to varying destinations .
In that landmark case , the Supreme Court said students had a First Amendment right to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War .
Generally , the courts have allowed the suppression of student speech , online or off , when it threatens bodily harm and advocates illegal activity , " none of which we have in Ms. Evans ' case , " said one of the teen 's attorneys , Matthew D. Bavaro , of Plantation , Florida .
" She has the absolute First Amendment right to do this , " Bavaro said .
" The question is how far does the school 's authority go to punish off - campus speech they do n't like ?
If Katie had praised the teacher , would she have been punished ?
The school is judging what is appropriate speech . "
But with the explosion of the internet and social networking sites , " The courts are figuring out where the boundaries end and start when it comes to off - campus speech , " LoMonte said .
On Wednesday , the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals , one court level below the Supreme Court , will hear oral arguments in a lawsuit similar to the Florida case filed Monday .
The appeal concerns Justin Layshock , who , as a senior and honors student at a Pennsylvania high school , was suspended for 10 days after creating a mock MySpace profile of his principal .
The profile said the principal took drugs and kept beer at his desk .
A federal judge overturned the suspension , ruling last year that the fake profile was not created at school and did not create a " substantial disruption . "
" Public schools are vital institutions , but their reach is not unlimited , " U.S. District Judge Terrence McVerry of Pennsylvania ruled last year .
Hickory High School appealed .
According to Monday 's lawsuit , Evans used no profanities and stated no threats against the teacher .
The suspension notice from the public school alleged only that Evans " had posted an inappropriate site regarding her teacher on Facebook . "
Evans is demanding that the suspension be removed from her record .
Recession — and social network glut — be damned !
Frank DeRose , managing partner of Ferrata Capital Management , plans to invest at least $ 1 million into Total Prestige , an invitation - only networking site for one of the world 's most underserved internet demographics : the super - and super - duper rich .
The 15 - year - old organization used to just be a Rolodex with 50,000 names — a sort of offline LinkedIn of the Rich and Famous doing introductions in all the non-digital ways .
But it 's now catching up with technology and taking on an online presence with a social network that launched in September , with plans also for a global rollout of quarterly print magazines in some glittering world capitals .
There are currently around 637 members on the site , and an additional
400 high - profile people have decided against creating a public profile but can still view all the content .
Ten members are billionaires .
Most of them come from Europe and the Middle East , and range from royalty and entrepreneurs to entertainers .
To get an idea of what these folks are blogging about :
One recent post seeks advice for avoiding pirates while yachting up the African coastline .
But after - hours activity is not the main thrust — there are several other networks for that out there , including A Small World and Decayenne ( and others mentioned in the comments ) .
This one 's not about play .
" It 's sort of like going to a conference , " DeRose told Wired.com .
" You 're there to network and conduct business . "
The network is invite - only , but DeRose offered Wired.com an exclusive pass into its world to check it out .
Note :
We were n't allowed to show any screenshots to protect the privacy of members .
The site is built on the Ning platform , so it has all of the basic functionality that its other networks have , but DeRose says they will be looking for a developer to update it in the near future .
Of course , the design and platform is irrelevant compared with the exclusivity of the company with which you 're rubbing virtual elbows .
Some names that we had permission to disclose are Princess Elfi
Odu -Dua of Benin , an international trader based in Germany ; Jamal A. Al
Akkad , one of the wealthiest businessmen in the Middle East ; Countess
Vanessa Kosta Pomponi from Monte Carlo , and actor Daniel McVicar from
The Bold and the Beautiful .
The homepage , or " Lobby , " plays classical music entitled " Beautiful Day " and displays online users at the top of the page .
There are also widgets with content from sites like CNN , Golf Digest and Forbes .
" Unfortunately , right now I can't offer you a glass of Champagne or
Scotch for a welcome toast , but I sincerely hope to meet all of you very soon , " Perez writes as a welcome in a sidebar .
There are various sections including " The Lounge " for live voice , video and text chat and a marketplace for buying / selling goods ( some items listed now are luxury cars , jewelry , and a pair of islands in Bora
Bora ) .
There 's also a " Social Diary " tracking events like galas and fundraisers , a link to view the online magazine from within the network as well as a place to blog .
And , of course , there is always the VIP room within even an exclusive club :
A new feature introduced to the site Wednesday offers a premium membership that allows members to write content for the online magazine that can include advertorials and infomercials to share their businesses and products .
( Cost : $ 500 a year for club members and $ 900 a year for nonmembers ) .
DeRose says he has already gotten a slew of e-mails from other interested investors and bankers after reading about the site in the
NY Post and thinks the site will have significantly more members in the coming months .
The first big expansion for the company , currently based in New
York and London , will be in the Middle East , he says , where they 've been especially popular .
A series of quarterly print magazines will roll out in 2009 profiling members and places in major cities , including :
Paris ; Berlin ; Cape Town , South Africa ; Moscow , Rome , Copenhagen , Denmark ; and possibly Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
Amid their planning for the future , DeRose and Perez are also working on organizing a gala in London scheduled for next spring , wherein about 300 members will attend and can get to know one another and conduct business in person .
Think of that as a millionaire 's Meetup .
The investment makes DeRose co-chair with Rose
Marie Perez , a communications veteran who currently runs the operation , and is a first step toward building up and expanding the new global media enterprise .
DeRose is counting on ads ( ad recession be damned ! ) for most of the enterprise 's revenue , targeting folks who want their businesses in front of big spenders .
Is this a business model ?
DeRose compares his site to Facebook , which allows any old person to join and received a $ 200 million infusion from Microsoft .
His target demographic is a stratospheric group of " accomplished professionals . "
" If a business model like that carries a value of a billion dollars , I think this far surpasses Facebook , " he said .
Several folks are reporting odd queries hitting their DNS servers at a steady rate of about two per second .
The queries invariably ask for the name server of the domain " . " ( NS query for a single dot ) .
Since " . " is a query for the root name servers , it has a very short query packet but a pretty long answer .
Our current theory therefore is that this is a denial of service ( DoS ) attack in progress , where the DNS servers are used as " amplifiers " and unwittingly flood the ( spoofed ) source by providing a long answer to a system which never asked .
Update 0118 UTC : Correlations of logs and captures submitted by readers suggests that 69.50.142.11 and 76.9.16.171 are the two IPs from which most queries appear to originate ... which would mean that these two sites are under a DoS attack .
ISC reader Chris used reverse DNS / passive DNS to determine that both IP addresses seem to be associated with porn sites .
Update 0253 UTC : The NOC of one of the netblocks has confirmed to ISC reader Steven that a DDoS attack is in progress against one of their clients .
If you have queries for " . " in your DNS log , best verify by use of a sniffer whether your DNS server actually responds and contributes to the DOS .
Normally , an internet - facing authoritative DNS server should not respond to recursive 3rd party queries , but we have received reports that some servers apparently respond to these " . " queries even when recursion is disabled .
Update 1150 UTC : Several readers wrote in to comment that the answer to a " . " query can come from the root - hints file or from the cache of the server itself .
BIND has several options to control this behaviour ( additional - from - auth , additional - from - cache , allow - query - cache ) .
Update 1520 UTC : 76.9.31.42 , 69.50.142.110 and a couple more IPs are also being spoofed .
Looks like more targets are being added into the fray .
Update 2117 UTC : We now provide an online tool on isc.sans.org that you can use to verify if your DNS server responds to these " . " queries with a full list of root name servers and thus potentially contributes to the ongoing DDoS attack .
You can do this test readily on your own by issuing a " dig . NS @yournameserver " command , but since you need to run this from outside of your network to get the " real " picture , we are providing the online tool to help out .
Update :
If you 're looking for advice on securing your DNS servers , here 's are configuration guidelines for BIND ( thanks for the pointer , Hal Pomeranz ! ) and for Microsoft DNS .
The Mahoning Valley Pride Center in Youngstown , Ohio AKA " The Stonewall Community Center " has opened its doors this week to the LGBT community .

" In a blow to anti-phishing efforts , the famed CastleCops organization dedicated to fighting spam and phishing quietly shuttered its site last week .
The all - volunteer organization investigated phishing and malware scams , and was credited with successfully derailing many of these attacks and phishing sites .
CastleCops itself was also a constant target of distributed denial - of - service attacks and other scams .
CastleCops announced its demise just before Christmas last week with a short post on its Website : " It has been our pleasure to investigate online crime and volunteer with our virtual family to assist with your computer needs and make the Internet a safer place .
Unfortunately , all things come to an end , " the site says .
" Keep up the good fight folks , for the spirit of this community lies within each of us .
We are empowered to improve the safety and security of the Internet in our own way . "
The shutdown came nearly six months after the departure of CastleCops ' founder , Paul Laudanski , who left for a job at Microsoft this summer .
Paul , who still owned CastleCops after leaving its day - to - day operations , and his wife Robin created CastleCops over six years ago .
" I believe CastleCops ' impact was a great and effective one against online fraud , malware , and spam , " Laudanski says .
" CastleCops far surpassed anything I imagined for it , and to that end I , and in fact the community as a whole , are blessed . " "

Josh recently added Rails Metal , which has been getting a fair bit of publicity .
Metal is a great piece of functionality for those rare cases where the speed of your framework actually matters .
However , people have been reporting 25 x speed increase over a regular Rails action , and that just does n’t seem right .
So I decided to do some benchmarking of ‘ Hello World ’ Rails action v/s Metal .
Here are my results :
Rails action
Time per request : 1.244 [ ms ]
Throughput : 800 request / second
Metal
Time per request : 0.386 [ ms ]
Throughput : 3000 request / second
You can find more details about benchmark command / code at http://gist.github.com/38080
Of course , these are not very scientific benchmarks and your results may vary a little from what you see here .
You should also make sure you run your benchmarks in production mode .
Now , if you compare these results , 3000 r/s against 800 r/s , you may think you ’re seeing a 3 x performance increase .
However , that ’d a wrong perception and throughput is n’t the best metric here .
Difference in Time per request is what you should looking at .
In my benchmarks , speed increase I get when using Metal is about 1 millisecond .
And that ’s a constant speed increase I ’ll get over a regular Rails action .
It ’s very important to understand that it ’s a constant speed increase .
It ’ll always be 1 ms for me .
For example , if my Rails action takes 12 ms , when I reimplement it all in Metal , it will take about 11 ms and not 4 ms .
To conclude , I ’ll just quote DHH :

The big theme at this year ’s Macworld Expo is not a product , it ’s a year : 2010 .
Next year ’s conference is touted on banners , information booklets , and even the show badges , which come with an ad for next year ’s event — the first without Apple , its anchor tenant .
But if you want to see what the show will be like in 2010 , sans Apple , come down to the Moscone Center right now .
Actually , do n’t bother .
It ’s a snoozer , because without Steve Jobs , or any big new product launches , Apple might as well have not showed up today .
“ Worst .
Macworld .
Ever. ” said one attendee after the Tuesday keynote .
“ This sucks . ”
This year ’s keynote was an epic yawner .
No new iPhone .
No new iPod .
No new iMac , and — despite lots of pre-show hype , rumor and buzz — no new Mac Mini .
The big news ?
It ’s a battery .
Apple certainly has new hardware offerings in development , but it is n’t announcing them here .
Yet in other slow news years , Apple has shared the stage with some of those developers , even granting Microsoft some time in the spotlight .
This year third - party developers were given exactly zero seconds .
It was almost like the company was trying to go out on a whimper .
Indeed , Apple senior VP of product marketing Phil Schiller , who took over keynote duties from Jobs this year , got in a little swipe at the event itself just after the opening bell .
Noting that Apple Stores now serve more than 3.4 million customers a week , he went on to declare
“ that 's 100 Macworlds each and every week going on in our Apple
Stores . ”
Ouch .
The keynote also ended with a thinly - velied insult : Tony Bennett singing “ I left my heart in San Francisco ” — surely a goodbye middle finger to International Data Group , which owns Macworld Expo .
" We 've done plenty of Macworlds without Apple in other countries , "
insisted Pat McGovern , CEO of IDG , after Tuesday ’s keynote .
" The Mac community has a lot of people exploring all sorts of different interests .
Members of that community and developers will always have a place at Macworld . "
However , the 2010 theme is so pervasive that it almost seems as if
IDG s overcompensating .
And perhaps it is , afraid of what attendance will be like next year without the Apple anchor that ’s normally the big draw .
Analyst Tim Bajarin , president of market research firm creative strategies said Apple spends about $ 25 million on Macworld , money better spent on its chain of retail stores , which attract far more customers than
Macworld ever could .
" It is rational for Apple to pull out of
MacWorld , " Bajarin said .
" Apple is right to spend its money on getting more people into its stores . "
Bajarin said he took Apple 's announcement about Jobs ' health on face value .
It sounded right , he said and if Jobs health were in serious jeopardy , Apple 's board has a serious financial duty to disclose it , he said .
He said he expects to see Steve in the new year , possibly with a new product line .
" For the last decade , if Apple has a new product ,
Steve is the one to announce it .
Yet perhaps it was just as well Jobs stayed away .
As one Twitterer put it : " The Macworld Keynote left me unimpressed .
Maybe that 's why Steve Jobs did n't present today . "
Instead they got Schiller , who launched into his presentation by declaring that the news today was going to be all about Macs , and that he was going to announce three new things .
Only one of these turned out to be about an actual Mac computer : a new 17 - inch MacBook Pro .
The other two major announcements were software suites — iLife and iWork — Schiller proceeded to spend the bulk of his presentation describing them in detail .
The iLife demo showcased some nifty new features in iPhoto — facial recognition and tagging , automated export to Flickr and Facebook , and a geotagging function .
He also unveiled iMovie ’s new editing features , which look incredibly slick , and finished with GarageBand , which now includes celebrity tutorials ( from musicians like Sting ! ) on how to play the piano and guitar .
Next was iWork , where there was no big news .
The product announcements centered around new versions of Pages ( documents ) ,
Numbers ( spreadsheets ) and Keynote ( presentations ) .
Apple also announced iWork.com , essentially a cloud computing version of the desktop software that allows for collaborative editing .
Think Google
Documents , but Apple - fied .
The last of Schiller ’s three talking points was a new 17 - inch
MacBook
Pro with an integrated non-removable battery that the company claims will run for 8 hours and recharges 1000 times .
Finally , after stepping over Steve Jobs ’ traditional “ one more thing ” line ( we ’d wager most in the audience barely heard Schiller mumble it ) he circled back around with a crafty “ one last thing , ” which turned out to be iTunes news .
But instead of the final news being the biggest , as per tradition , this was yet another yawner .
DRM is disappearing from iTunes , bringing
Apple on par with Amazon .
Also of note : songs will have a three tiered pricing scheme with tracks going from $ 1.29 /$.99/$.69 a pop .
Given that Apple has long resisted variable pricing , the backtracking did n’t come across as fantastically awesome as Schiller tried to deliver it .
Topping it off was Tony Bennett who came onstage and belted out a couple of songs nobody under 60 knows .
In short , this was the future of Macworld Expo : one without any exciting news from Apple .

By standing in the way of an auto industry bailout , GOP senators appear to have bitten the hand that fed them .
Over the last decade , General Motors has given $ 1.50 to Republican candidates for every $ 1 it has given to Democrats .
That same pattern has been followed by Chrysler and Ford , which year after year have favored the right side of the aisle , sometimes by more than a 3 - to - 1 ratio in dollar terms .
Since 1990 , the auto industry as a whole -- including suppliers , dealers and manufacturers -- has cut $ 100 million in checks to Republicans , compared with just $ 34 million to Democrats .
On Thursday night , the carmakers discovered just how little loyalty that investment strategy had bought them .
Advertisement
Efforts to get through even a watered - down version of the $ 14 - billion aid package were stymied by Republican senators , many of whom contend that GM and Chrysler -- the most troubled U.S. automakers -- should simply go bankrupt .
“ Carmakers have always leaned Republican , ” said Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia ’s Center for Politics .
“ But it ’ll be interesting to see whether what happened this week changes that pattern . ”
Political giving from the auto industry as a whole -- including carmakers , dealers and suppliers -- has long backed candidates that favor less regulation , lower taxes and looser labor rules , among other key issues .
This year , for the first time on record , Detroit ’s spending slightly favored Democrats .
But since 2000 , overall spending by the Big Three has steered 61 % of contributions , or $ 7.2 million , to Republicans , according to Federal Election Commission data compiled by the Center for Responsible Politics .
Advertisement
Democrats , meanwhile , have looked to the United Auto Workers for support .
Since 2000 , the union has given $ 12.5 million to Democrats compared with only $ 94,540 to Republicans .
GM , the only carmaker that could be reached for comment , downplayed the role that money may have played in the current debate .
“ It ’s highly doubtful that political giving ever played a factor in an individual member ’s position , ” GM spokesman Greg Martin said .
But on Capitol Hill , the cold calculus of money is never too far from any issue .

A study released Thursday by the Center for Responsive Politics suggested that in the House of Representatives , where the bailout passed this week , there was a direct correlation between votes and campaign cash :
Those who voted in favor of the plan received , on average , 8 % more money from the auto industry than those who did not .
In the Senate , other forces may have been at play .
Some of the loudest opponents to helping Detroit were senators whose states are home to car factories of foreign brands , including Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( D - Ala. ) , who has Mercedes , Hyundai and Honda plants in his state but no Big Three facilities .
At the eleventh hour , Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) put forth a bill that sought to wrest new concessions from the United Auto Workers as well as from corporate bondholders .
He has received $ 234,860 from the auto industry throughout his career , but Tennessee is also home to several Nissan plants and the Japanese automaker ’s U.S. headquarters .

“ A part of this is certainly the old adage ‘ Where you stand is where you sit , ’ ” said Norm Ornstein , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research .
Representatives of the two senators could not be reached for comment .
Labor was another issue underlying the tense negotiations .
An action alert circulated among Senate Republicans on Wednesday called for Republicans to “ stand firm and take their first shot against organized labor . ”
In doing so , analysts said , Republicans were planting the seeds for a fundraising appeal to big business -- other than the Big Three , of course -- as they gear up for a major political fight next year over expected legislation that would make it easier for unions to organize .
Advertisement
“ They may lose money from the auto industry , but a union fight will get them a lot of money from the rest of the business community , ” Sabato said .
A final issue was ideological , experts say .
For many conservatives in Congress , the idea of government rescuing any industry is simply unpalatable -- and that trumps any contributions from Detroit .
“ The tension for Republicans is that it ’s an industry that ’s been staunchly in their camp for many years , but this is legislation calling for billions of dollars of government spending , ” said Massie Ritsch , spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ It ’s a conflict between their principles and their longtime supporters . ”

A tidal stream turbine has broken the world record for generating renewable energy , it was claimed yesterday .
Enough electricity for about 1,000 homes was produced by SeaGen at the mouth of Strangford Lough , Co Down , in Northern Ireland .
It works like an underwater windmill and is driven by fierce currents around the bottleneck .
Martin Wright , managing director of developer Marine Current Turbines ( MCT ) , said : " This is the highest power so far produced by a tidal stream system anywhere in the world and exceeds the previous highest output .
" Generating at full power is an important milestone for the company and in particular our in - house engineering team .
" We are very pleased with SeaGen 's performance during commissioning .
It demonstrates , for the first time , the commercial potential of tidal energy as a viable alternative source of renewable energy . "
SeaGen was placed in the lough in May this year and has been undergoing trials since then .
It has reached its maximum capacity of 1.2 megawatts .
It will be active for up to 22 hours a day .
Power is being purchased by Irish energy company ESB Independent for customers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland .
There are plans to produce up to 15 megawatts of energy at a similar project in Canada .
Scotland also has a tidal wave test site .
Mr Wright added : " SeaGen is now running exactly as we said it would , but testing will continue to be carried out , not only to check SeaGen 's performance over extended periods of operation but also to evaluate how components are standing up to the harsh conditions and to determine how the design might be improved .
" This work is vital for SeaGen 's long - term commercial deployment in projects elsewhere in the UK and overseas . "
MCT hopes to build another tidal farm off the coast of Anglesey , north Wales .
It is considering schemes in other parts of the UK , Ireland and north America .
SeaGen began supplying a small amount of electricity to the National Grid in July this year .
It sits 400 m offshore between Strangford and Portaferry .

Begich ahead by 3 votes in Alaska Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) and Democratic opponent Mark Begich are neck - and - neck for Stevens ' seat as Alaska continues counting absentee and early ballots not counted on Election Day .
On November 4 , Stevens led by about 3,000 votes against Begich , the current mayor of Anchorage .
The state 's Division of Elections , reports the Anchorage Daily News , has counted about 43,000 absentee ballots on Wednesday , with 35,000 more expected in the next week .
As of Wednesday evening , Begich was in the lead by three votes , with 125,019 against Stevens ' 125,016 .
Whether 84 - year - old Stevens keeps his seat for long if he prevails is unclear .
On October 27 , he was convicted of seven federal felony counts for false statements made on financial disclosure forms between 1999 and 2006 to conceal over $ 250,000 worth of gifts and services from Alaska oil services contractor VECO , including a remodel of one of his houses .
Regardless of the appeals process , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) said on November 1 , Stevens will face an ethics investigation followed by his ejection from the Senate , where he has served since 1968 .
" I 'd be interested to know who the Republican Party leadership is rooting for , " the Washington Post 's Chris Cillizza told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann on Wednesday night , citing a " taint of corruption . "
" I do n't think they want Ted Stevens to come back , " he said .
" I think they want a clean break with the last eight years ... and they would almost rather -- I do n't say they would rather -- but I think it is a debate whether they want Senator Stevens back or not . "

Maria lived in an age when most people − especially women − received no education at all .
She was a brilliant girl but painfully shy .
After her mother died , Maria had to take over the house and look after all her 20 younger brothers and sisters .
Maria had a fascination with mathematics and gained a reputation as a competent mathematician .
She managed to find time to write a famous book , Analytic Institutions , which brought together the brilliant calculus discoveries of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz .
Being a known sleepwalker , Maria would get up in the middle of the night and write down the solution for a math problem she ’d been struggling with − while asleep !
She would get up the next morning to find her answer waiting for her .
She was also a linguist and could speak French , Italian , Greek , Hebrew , Spanish , German and Latin by the time she was 11 .
At just 9 years of age , Maria wrote and delivered an hour - long speech in Latin on women 's right to be educated .
Always being concerned for those less fortunate than her , Maria would help the poor and needy in her area .
She worked in a small hospital that she ’d set up in her father ’s house until she died at 81 .
Who am I talking about ?
Maria Gaetana Agnesi ( 1718 -1799 ) , a resident of Milan .
In 18th century Italy , women had very limited opportunity for education and found it hard to be taken seriously .
Maria ’s accomplishments are all the more remarkable because of the other duties she had to perform .
Can you imagine trying to write a book with all those kids running around ?
Maria Agnesi's Mathematics
Apart from her book , Maria was famous for a curve known as " The Witch of Agnesi " .
The witch part was just a translation error ( it was supposed to be " turn " ) , but the name has stuck .
She did n’t create the curve , but she studied it .
The Witch of Agnesi is formed as follows .
Take a circle and draw a horizontal line through the top of it .
From a point O directly below the intersection of the line and the circle , draw a segment OP to intersect the horizontal line .
Q is the point where OP intersects the circle .
Draw a horizontal segment QR which intersects the vertical dropped from the point P . Put a ( blue ) dot at R .
Move the point P along the horizontal line and join the bottom of the circle and drop verticals and horizontals as follows .
Put blue dots on each intersection point .
If we draw enough of these and join the blue dots , we get the following curve , the Witch of Agnesi :
If the circle has radius a , then the equation of the Witch of Agnesi is given by :
The shape is quite similar to the bell - shaped normal curve that we come across in probability and statistics .

" It is enough that they know about the Battle of Hastings , without having to memorise that it was in 1066 .

China has warned that it will not keep lending money to the United States .
BEIJING ( AFP ) � China warned it would not keep lending money to the US economy indefinitely , even as new data showed it had consolidated its position as the top buyer of American government bonds .
" China 's increased purchase of US Treasury securities should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the assumption that the US can borrow its way out of the current financial crisis , " the China Daily said in an editorial .
The warning from the state - run newspaper , an English - language daily that mainly addresses a foreign audience , came after the US Treasury Department reported a steep increase in Chinese holding of US Treasury bonds .
China held 652.9 billion dollars of US Treasury bonds at the end of October , up 11.2 percent from 587 billion dollars a month earlier , when China became the largest creditor ahead of Japan , according to the data released Tuesday .
Japan remained in second place , with total holdings of 585.5 billion dollars at the end of October .
The China Daily said that , given the global economic crisis , the consequences would be serious if China and other nations stopped channeling money into the US economy .
" Interest rates in the US would rise to undermine that government 's efforts to bailout distressed financial institutions and companies , " it said .
China was also constrained by a lack of other places to put its money , according to the paper .
" With few options to invest its increasing reserves safely and profitably , China may thus have to buy more US Treasury securities in spite of growing domestic skepticism that such purchases may incur huge losses later , " it said .
However , as China and other nations help prop up the US economy , the United States should use the window of opportunity to undertake necessary reforms , the China Daily said .
" The current strong foreign appetite should not be taken by the US government as solid proof of the long - term value of its Treasury bonds , " it said .
" Instead , it should race against time to undertake painful but critical reforms to revive its economy before such demand peaks any time soon . "

Today is inauguration day .
George W. Bush will officially depart as soon as Barack H. Obama is sworn in .
The Audacity of Hope is the title of Obama ’s campaign book .
As with Bill Clinton ’s A Man from Hope video , the accent is on the positive .
To campaign on hope is a tried - and - true tradition .
Like second marriages , this is hope triumphing over experience .
Also like second marriages , the honeymoons are shorter .
The general public is always optimistic when a President is inaugurated .
Most voters want to believe that things will get better .
If things have been going well , they expect this to continue .
The greatest optimism usually occurs at a first - term President ’s inauguration .
People were optimistic about Clinton in 1993 , Reagan in 1981 , Kennedy in 1961 , and Eisenhower in 1953 .
The one exception was Nixon in 1969 .
The election had been very close , the Vietnam war was a quagmire , and Nixon was widely distrusted as “ tricky Dick . ”
The pessimists had every reason to be pessimistic in 1969 , as things turned out .
But you would not have guessed this in 1972 .
He won in a landslide , despite the recession and the huge back - to - back Federal deficits in 1970 and 1971 , his unilateral annulment of the international gold standard , his unilateral imposition of price and wage controls , the shortages that resulted , the continuing quagmire in Vietnam , and the rumors about the Watergate break - in .
The quadrupling of the price of oil in 1971 was also bad news .
There was brief optimism over Gerald Ford , despite escalating inflation and despite Nelson Rockefeller as the appointed Vice President .
But optimism gave way to pessimism in what became the worst post - war recession .
He was sent packing in 1976 .
Reality usually intrudes .
Eisenhower experienced two recessions , 1953 and 1957 , years of his inauguration .
Kennedy got trapped in Vietnam .
Then he was assassinated , undermining faith on the “ can - do liberalism ” of the pre-Kennedy era .
Johnson ’s disaster in Vietnam undermined liberalism even more .
Nixon gave us serious inflation , a scandal and a resignation , and no resolution of the Vietnam War .
Ford was a fluke .
He never recovered from his pardon of Nixon .
Carter experienced the worst peacetime inflation in American history and then a recession .
To that was added the Iran crisis : the hostages and the failed rescue attempt .
Reagan escaped , just as Eisenhower had escaped .
He was the Teflon President .
Clinton also escaped .
He was the charm President .
He could talk his way out of anything , just as Reagan could .
Reagan ’s 1984 campaign promised “ morning in America . ”
It looked plausible until September 11 , 2001 .
DEFICITS AND FIAT MONEY
Half a century ago , the master humorist and serious political scientist C. Northcote Parkinson coined Parkinson ’s law : “ Work expands so as to fill the time allotted for its completion . ”
He suggested other laws , but that one became his most famous law .
He made a very important point when he discussed government committees in charge of spending .
He said that a committee will wrangle over a few thousand dollars but hardly discuss a bill to spend several million .
( The numbers were lower in the 1950’s . )
Why is this ?
Parkinson offered an answer .
Members of a committee have experience with several thousand dollars .
They know how much can be wasted .
They also know how little it will accomplish .
But they have no personal experience with millions .
They do n’t argue over a huge number because it is merely a number .
They do n’t connect emotionally with it .
Half a century later , the committees spend a hundred billion dollars without worrying about it .
There was that one fine moment in September 2008 , when the House of Representatives voted down the Administration ’s $ 700 billion bailout of the banks .
Three days later , the House passed it .
From then until now , neither political party has blinked about bailouts .
The Federal Reserve System has added $ 1.6 trillion to the monetary base since April 1 , 2008 .
The Federal government has agreed to absorb bad debts in the range of $ 8.5 trillion , after last week ’s deal with Bank of America , the nation ’s largest bank ( this week ) .
Serious resistance to Federal spending is over .
There will be debates over which groups get their hands into the bag of loot , but the bag will surely grow .
The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee do not officially ask , let alone answer , the following questions :
Who will invest in this debt at today ’s interest rates ?
Will these investors be private Americans ?
Will Asian central banks buy this debt ?
( Have they already begun to sell it ? ) Will the Federal Reserve System buy this debt with newly created money ?
How high will interest rates go ?
How soon ?
How will this debt be repaid ?
( Joke ! ) How will the government be able to roll over this debt from now until Doomsday ?
( When is Doomsday ? ) What effect will investment in Federal debt have on the cost of capital in the private sector ?
If the private sector cannot attract capital at low rates , what effect will this have on future production ?
When will these trillion - dollar annual deficits end ?
Because such questions are considered fiscally naïve , the committees do not hold hearings on any of them .
Why are these questions considered fiscally naïve ?
Because they involve two things that Congress rarely considers : ( 1 ) economic cause and effect ; ( 2 ) the long run .
PANDORA’S BOX CONTAINED HOPE
We usually forget this .
The Greeks understood that hope springs eternal .
But the evils in the box are permanent .
We still like to celebrate Pandora ’s optimism on January 20 , every four years .
It is part of the American political tradition .
But then the other escaped evils reassert themselves .
Optimism regarding Obama ’s Administration , as with every new administration , rests on a presupposition : politics trumps economics .
This is another way of saying that legalized coercion trumps voluntarism .
Faith in the means of this triumph is lodged in three institutions : the national government , the Federal Reserve System , and foreign central banks .
No matter how bad things get economically , voters believe in these three institutions , if they actually have heard of central banking , which few have and fewer remember .
Today , the national government is running at least a $ 1.2 trillion annual deficit .
To this will be added whatever the proposed stimulus law will cost .
Estimates run in the range of $ 400 billion a year for two years .
Obama has said that annual deficits in the trillion - dollar range will go on for years .
He has not been specific , rather like his date for a pullout from Afghanistan .
The public does not care .
Optimism is still widespread .
Like a spouse in a second or third marriage , who does not yet know of her partner ’s snoring , the voters expect smooth sailing through treacherous financial waters .
The Bush Administration established the precedents : a $ 700 billion bailout ( plus $ 150 billion in Congressional pork ) , the various bank bailouts , and the nationalization of the mortgage market .
Whatever President Obama proposes will be an extension of existing policies .
There will be no successful opposition .
There will be no turning back .
THE POINT OF NO RETURN
Critics like to say that we have gone beyond the point of no return .
There is no agreement on when this point was reached or what it was .
My view is that it was the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 .
I have written a book on this , Conspiracy in Philadelphia .
Even for me , this book is considered controversial .
You can download it for free .
The case can be made that the war of 1861 — 65 was the point of no return .
But I think it was the election of 1904 , the most forgotten Presidential election of the twentieth century .
Only a handful of historians and political junkies can tell you who lost .
A slightly greater number can tell you who won : Teddy Roosevelt .
Can you name his opponent ?
I thought not .
It was a New York politician , Alton B. Parker .
He was a pro-gold standard politician .
I have written about this election before .
When he lost , William Jennings Bryan was overjoyed .
He said that the Cleveland wing of the party was finished .
He was right .
Bryan got one more shot at the Presidency in 1908 .
He lost for the third time .
Four years later , Woodrow Wilson won .
In that election , three Progressives — statists — ran against each other : Roosevelt , Wilson , and President Taft .
That year also saw a Constitutional Amendment establishing the direct election of Senators .
Another amendment was said to be passed — technically , it was n’t : the income tax .
In 1913 , late in December , the Senate passed the Federal Reserve Act .
No turning back .
No turning back .
The Medicare Act of 1965 made it impossible to avoid a national default .
The numbers are horrendous .
Occasionally , a subcommittee of Congress invites an economist to come and testify on this .
The testimony gets no publicity .
The committee chairman thanks the economist , who then returns to obscurity .
This fiscal year , the combined unfunded liability of Social Security and Medicare will be in the range of $ 75 trillion .
No one in government notices , other than Ron Paul and a few similarly minded House members .
No one cares .
Such numbers are considered naïve .
They are only numbers .
Numbers above $ 1 billion do not register mentally .
Parkinson told us this during Eisenhower ’s Administration .
Nothing has changed .
CONCLUSION
I do not know how long the political honeymoon will last .
I do know this : the magnitude of the Federal deficits and the magnitude of Federal Reserve monetary base inflation will not bring anything like smooth sailing through the financial storm .
We have already seen the monetary base translated into expansion of M1 .
Offsetting this has been an increase in excess reserves deposited by banks at the Federal Reserve .
Last fall , the FED began paying interest on reserves .
That change in policy had been scheduled for 2011 .
It was moved up because of the crisis .
Now the FED pays nothing .
Excess reserves now receive nothing .
Banks must pay interest on all deposits .
Where will they get an even greater rate of return ?
They are losing money on every dollar held at the FED .
The shrinking money multiplier will reverse when banks pull money out of the FED and start buying T - bonds or whatever else will safely pay a positive rate of interest .
The political game will go on .
The economic causes will continue : national debt and monetary inflation .
Historically , this has led to price inflation .
Deflationists tell us , “ This time it ’s different . ”
We shall see .
We shall see before the next Congressional elections .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Intel Corp is slashing prices on a number of its processors , including cuts of up to 40 percent on some of its higher - powered , faster quad - core chips , as the world ’s largest chip maker copes with weakening demand .
The company , which called the changes part of regularly scheduled price moves , is confronting slumping demand brought on by the global economic slowdown , along with new , cheaper chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc .
Intel reduced the price of its Core 2 Quad Q9650 chip , which is used in desktop computers , to $ 316 from a $ 530 list - price in December .
It lowered prices on other Core 2 Quad chips by 16 to 20 percent .
Quad - core chips have four processors on one piece of silicon .
AMD recently launched its Phenom II quad - core chips , which have a top list price of $ 275 .
American Technology Research analyst Doug Freedman acknowledged that AMD has a “ much more viable product portfolio than they did last year , ” but said Intel ’s move was also an acknowledgment of the tough economic times .
“ I would put it as a standard move with the caveat ... that the marketplace is far from in a standard condition and there ’s a more viable product out of their competitors , ” Freedman said .
“ To think that there is some impact there , yes , but I would n’t be ready to call it the start of round two of a price war . ”
Intel also cut prices on a number of other chips used in desktops , notebooks and servers .
Prices on Pentium dual - core chips used in desktops were lowered by as much as 24 percent , while prices on its Celeron mobile processor were cut by as much as 48 percent .
Prices on Intel ’s Xeon server chips were slashed by as much as 40 percent .
Intel also introduced three new , more energy - efficient Core 2 Quad processors for use in desktops .
Last week , the Santa Clara , California - based company reported a 23 percent drop in fourth - quarter revenue .
Intel said it expects margins to bounce back to “ healthy ” levels by the second half of 2009 , but held back on giving detailed quarterly forecasts when it issued earnings , citing economic uncertainty .
The place called Lumpkin ’s Slave Jail was indeed a jail , but it was much more than that .
It was a holding pen for human chattel .
In Richmond ’s Shockoe Bottom river district , the notorious slave trader Robert Lumpkin ran the city ’s largest slave - holding facility in the 1840s and 1850s .
Tens of thousands of blacks were held in the cramped brick building while they waited to be sold .
Those who resisted were publicly whipped .
“ The individual would be laid down , his hands and feet stretched out and fastened in the rings , and a great big man would stand over him and flog him , ” a clergyman wrote after witnessing the punishment .

On Wednesday , black and white Richmond residents walked together across the rain - slicked cobblestones , excavated this month , that mark the outlines of the old slave jail .
This former Confederate capital ’s announcement that Lumpkin ’s Jail had been found was the latest acknowledgment of its painful slave history .
Since Richmond ’s City Council formed the Slave Trail Commission in 1998 , the city gradually has been confronting both the enslavement of blacks and their contributions to the city .
“ This is a part of our history that was covered up for too long , ” said Charles Vaughan , a retired bus operator and commission member .
A descendant of slaves , Vaughan stood staring at the jail ’s spectral remains Wednesday , wondering whether some distant relative once was imprisoned there .

Richmond , which is 57 % black , long has honored its Confederate past with monuments to Gen. Robert E. Lee , President Jefferson Davis and thousands of rebel soldiers .
But only with its decade - long examination of the slave trail -- which includes the jail , an adjoining Negro Burial Ground , and the slave marketplace and docks -- has it shone a light on its legacy of slavery .
“ It was hushed for so long , ” said Ana Edwards of the Sacred Ground Project , which erected a historical marker for the cemetery , which is covered by a university parking lot .
“ Slavery was not something anybody wanted to address . ”
Blacks called Lumpkin ’s Slave Jail “ Devil ’s Half Acre . ”
Some died there from abuse or disease .
Thousands more were fed and groomed for sale at nearby slave markets , then sent by boat or rail to toil on farms and plantations throughout the South .
“ They were literally sold down the river , ” said Philip J. Schwarz , a professor emeritus of history at Virginia Commonwealth University , standing a few feet from the jail site and gesturing toward the nearby James River .

From 1808 , when the United States outlawed the international slave trade , to the end of the Civil War , an estimated 300,000 slaves were sold in Richmond .
Lumpkin , known as a “ bully trader ” for his harsh treatment of slaves , sold the men , women and children who became slaves in Southern states , where slavery remained legal .
Archaeologists discovered that Lumpkin ’s jail was actually a complex of brick buildings .
In addition to the 20 - by - 41 - foot , two - story jail , there was a kitchen , Lumpkin ’s residence and a boarding house where antebellum slave owners stayed while their slaves were readied for sale .
Digging through 15 feet of muck and fill dirt beneath a city - owned parking lot , archaeologists unearthed cobblestones and brick drains that formed the jail ’s perimeter .

The jail was torn down in the 1870s .
“ We ’re standing on a time capsule of Richmond ’s history , ” Matthew Laird , an archaeologist on the dig , said as he led commission members across the water - logged site .
“ It ’s exciting to find such an intact and well - preserved site . ”
The discovery of the jail site continues the city ’s “ public acknowledgment of Richmond ’s enslaved African Americans , ” said Delores L. McQuinn , City Council vice president and chairwoman of the Slave Trail Commission .
“ Many of us here were trying to work through this without the facts , ” McQuinn said .
She was referring to fellow African American commission members who came of age when Richmond ’s white leadership ignored the contributions of slaves and their descendants on the city ’s past .

Because of the Slave Trail and the commemoration of “ this infamous jail , ” McQuinn said , “ generations to come wo n’t have to do as much work to find out who they are and where they came from . ”
Kathleen Kilpatrick , director of the state Department of Historic Resources , said the jail has national significance .
She called it “ ground zero ” for understanding the slave trade .
David Herring , who heads a local historical conservation group , said the slave trade and the city are inextricably linked : “ Richmond would not be here without the slaves that built this city . ”
The jail site is steeped in slavery ’s history .
Near the jail was a city gallows where Gabriel Prosser , who led an 1800 slave revolt known as Gabriel ’s Rebellion , was executed .

On auction blocks nearby , the family of Henry “ Box ” Brown was sold to a North Carolina plantation owner .
According to some accounts , Brown escaped a similar fate by packing himself into a wooden crate labeled “ dry goods ” that was shipped to Philadelphia and freedom .
When Robert Lumpkin died , he left his jail to his widow -- Mary Lumpkin , a black woman and former slave .
In 1867 , she gave the property to a minister who established a school for freed slaves .
Over the years , the school evolved into what is now Virginia Union University , a historically black college .

During the Inaugural dance - a- thon that took place Tuesday night , it was hard not to notice how in love our First Couple seemed as they spun around the floor , celebrating their historic victory with one another .

On MSNBC , Chris Matthews , who can go from curmudgeon to emo in 2.4 seconds when he 's excited about something , could n't stop gushing about our new First Couple , discussing their romance with Jezebel Girl Crush , Rachel Maddow :
MATTHEWS :
It ’s what my wife calls …
She has a term for it .
I ca n’t think of what it is now .
It ’s different than that .
But I must say something , James Carville said politics is Hollywood for ugly people .
These people , the actors they hired to play them could n’t be better looking .
I can say that of both families today .
This is an incredibly glamourous bunch of people we watched in the reviewing stand today .
Extraordinarily so .
This picture would be hard to beat if Hollywood replicated it …
RACHEL MADDOW :
They are modeling a married romance , that is moving …
MATTHEWS : Looks like two people on top of a wedding cake .
Look at this stuff …
MADDOW : They are teasing each other .
They are tender — beautiful .
MATTHEWS : This is not a political marriage , per se .
No comment further …
At first , I laughed , as it seemed like a very Matthews - in - gushy - mode thing to say .
But Rachel 's comment about " modeling a married romance " really stuck with me , and when I tried to think of another famous couple in recent years that has really presented a believable and natural sense of true love and romance , it was hard to come up with any .

I always feel weird commenting on the President and First Lady in this way : there is a public interest in this presidency that has n't been there in some time : we have a rock star leader , a celebrity , a glamorous pair whose every fashion choice seems to be documented .
There 's a disconnect between the President and his wife and the rest of the celebrity couples out there : celebrity couples often give off a sense of desperation , calculation , and it's hard to believe that any of them will last .
The Obamas have already been together for 16 years , before the campaigns and the fancy balls and the international celebrity .
And unlike Brangelina or some such , where the speculation and the gossip drowns out any sense of reality , one gets the sense that the Obamas truly are in love .
So the notion that the Obamas are , in fact , modeling a " married romance " does n't seem too far off the mark .
Which is a bit sad if you think about it : in this insanely wedding - obsessed culture we live in , the focus seems to be on the ceremony , and not the marriage itself .
We hear all about wedding plans and sappy honeymoons , but rarely do we see an example of a couple who has stood the test of time and still appears to be madly in love with one another , at least not on an extremely public scale .

It 's strange to read comments about the Obamas , in that people seem genuinely moved and excited at the prospect of a couple who are still , quite clearly , in love with one another , who still blush when they are dancing , who still smile as if they just met , who still hold hands in public and hold each other 's attention , even when the entire world is screaming their names .
Perhaps it speaks to a generation such as mine , which was filled with the divorces of many of our parents , that hey !
married people can actually make it , that love does n't necessarily die out or fade away .
And while the Obamas certainly never asked to be the symbol of " married romance " perhaps , without even trying , and just by being themselves , they are once again giving off tiny rays of hope .

Watchdog group : Depth of Bush failures surprised even us Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 10 , 2008
Print This Email This With the Bush administration about to leave office after reaching record - setting disapproval ratings , the nation might be in the mood for some New Year 's resolutions pinpointing mistakes of the last eight years that it never , ever wants to make again .
For example , the country might want to do something about its massive backlogs in various essential government functions -- including 730,000 backlogged patent applications , 760,000 Social Security disability claims , and 806,000 Veterans Affairs disability claims .
The nation might also resolve to avoid a recurrence of the recent losses of hundreds of laptops containing sensitive law enforcement information , or to rethink the decision to keep plowing $ 12.5 billion into a joint civilian - military weather satellite system that is still incomplete and may leave gaps in crucial climate monitoring as older satellites fail .
The most comprehensive guide to these and other Bush administration failures is a new list compiled by the Center for Public Integrity ( CPI ) , a non-profit investigative journalism group which recently " set out to document just how off - track things have gone , " assigning thirteen reporters to document the worst failures of the last eight years .
Working from government investigations , news stories , and suggestions from experts and government employees , the team compiled a list of 250 failures , which it then narrowed down to just 128 " that attracted bipartisan criticism and had major impacts on the lives of ordinary Americans . "
The results of the investigation , which are summarized at CPI 's PaperTrail blog and presented in full at its Broken Government project , are stunning in their scope even for those who have been following the scandals of the last eight years .
According to the CPI , " Some of these problems were in place well before George W. Bushs inauguration , but were exacerbated by his policies or worsened by his administrations actions ( or inactions ) .
Many of the failings are tied to Bush appointees who appear to have been selected primarily on the basis of ideology and loyalty , rather than competence . "
Many of the numbers which leap out from the summary are dollar figures -- such as the $ 300 billion over budget for Defense Department weapons acquisitions or the $ 100 billion lost every year to corporate offshore tax shelters .
There are also examples of ineffective planning , such as the faulty National Security Administration computer system , which carries a price tag of $ 4 billion , or the complete failure of a $ 100 million attempt to create a new system of internal information - sharing for the FBI in the wake of 9/11 .
Items which speak to the obsessions of the Bush administration appear in the list , as well , ranging from the record $ 9.91 billion spent on government secrecy in 2007 to the dismissal of all but 17 out of the 1273 whistleblower complaints filed from 2002 to 2008 .
However , the most haunting entries may be those which document the toll taken on the American people over the last eight years , including pollution that causes 20,000 deaths a year and puts 60,000 newborns at risk of neurological problems . , a two - thirds dropoff in the cleanup of toxic waste sites , and 2.5 million toxic toys recalled in the summer of 2007 .
Kucinich : Israel may be using American weapons illegally RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday January 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Responding to media reports that Israel had bombed a UN school serving as a refuge for Palestinian civilians , Congressman Dennis Kucinich is calling for a Congressional report on Israel 's possibly illegal misuse of US weapons .
His letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice follows .
####
Dear Dr. Rice :
I am writing concerning Israel 's military offensive against Gaza , which began on December 27th .
I support Israel 's security and its right to exist in peace , without the fear of rocket attacks from Hamas .
Moreover , I abhor the violence being visited upon the citizens of our firm ally .
However , no nation is immune from the legal conditions placed on the receipt of U.S. military assistance .
I believe that with the current escalation of violence in Gaza , a legal threshold has been reached , warranting a Presidential examination and report to Congress .
I hereby request an examination of Israels compliance with the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 ( AECA ) .
While neither the AECA nor the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ( FAA ) define internal security  and legitimate self - defense ,  I believe that Israels most recent attacks neither further internal security nor do they constitute legitimate acts of self - defense .
They do , however , increase the possibility of an outbreak or escalation of conflict ,  because they are a vastly disproportionate response to the provocation , and because the Palestinian population is suffering from those military attacks in numbers far exceeding Israeli losses in life and property .
Israels current military campaign in Gaza has inflicted a significant toll on Palestinian civilians and society .
Israels recent aerial and ground offensive against Gaza has killed nearly 600 and injured over 2,500 .
The Associated Press reported : children are paying the price ...
The United Nations has said the death toll includes 34 children ...
But the broad range of Israel 's targets -- police compounds , fire stations , homes of militants , Hamas - run mosques and university buildings -- means most shelling is occurring in residential areas . "
The extensive destruction of such civilian institutions violates Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention , which prohibits the wanton destruction of property and collective punishment of a civilian population .
There have also been reports of bombings of United Nations ( UN ) schools , despite the fact that Israeli Defense Forces were allegedly given coordinates of the facilities prior to the current escalation in violence .
The blockade that Israel has imposed on Gaza since 2006 has further exacerbated the extent of collateral damage , as hospitals and morgues have been unable to cope with the magnitude of deaths and injuries as a result of the current escalation in violence and hospitals lack proper supplies needed to treat the injured .
I believe that Israels use of defense articles provided by the U.S in the current Gaza military attacks may constitute a violation of the AECA .
At a minimum , the conflict is sufficient to warrant an immediate report to Congress as required by 22 U.S.C. § 2753 .
Please contact my office by close of business on January 7 , 2009 with the date the report will be submitted .
Sincerely ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Member of Congress
It is with a very heavy heart we report that Adrian ' The Energizer ' Bromley passed away in his sleep on December 7th , 2008 at the young age of 37 .
He had just celebrated his birthday on November 30th .
To say that Adrian was active in the metal scene is an understatement .
Early in his journalism career he worked at Canada's M.E.A.T Magazine ( along with BW&BK ; 's Carl Begai and " Metal " Tim Henderson ) .
Soon-after , Adrian , along with Gino Filicetti formed one of the world 's first extreme metal webzines called Chronicles Of Chaos .
Adrian went on to create Unrestrained !
Magazine which gained worldwide popularity in the extreme underground realm .
More recently he worked press and publicity at The End Records and moved on to form Ixmati Media , a company that represented the likes of Listenable Records , Blistering Records , Northern Storm Records , Ibex Moon Records , Shadow Kingdom Records among others .
He had also started his new label called Absurdist Records .
BW&BK ; President / CEO " Metal " Tim Henderson had this to say about his passing : " We are in total shock .
We used to joke that BW&BK ; and Unrestrained !
were vicious rivals , but that was totally inaccurate .
I 'd known Adrian since the M.E.A.T. days in Toronto in the late ' 80s as we all were trying to cut it as potential journalists !
Hell , he lived on our BraveBoard !
You wo n't meet anybody in this biz that worked as hard as Adrian , fighting for " the cause " at every waking moment .
And the key was that his heart was in the right place .
He 'd give you his left arm if you needed it .
Always a friendly hand - shake or a heavy metal hug .
Every band and label that Adrian represented felt his presence .
His head was filled with a sea of metal knowledge - underground and above ground .
Virtually every conversation we had was about music - it was his life .
Adrian had incredible vision , always thinking of ideas on how to push the scene to greater heights .
Those of us based in Toronto - take a look around at your next metal show / gathering .
Adrian touched every one of those souls as he helped the scene grow larger than ever .
Damn , it as just over a year ago we lost Ray " Black Metal " Wallace .
Life just ai n't fair .
He will be terribly missed ... "

I 've bashed Chris Matthews for his style of journalism ( which mostly consists of superficial analysis of inane and irrelevant topics ) , but every once in a while , Matthews reveals the real journalist inside of him .
In this substantive debate on the rational for going to war , Matthews batters neo-con Frank Gafney on his lies about the threat Saddam posed to the United States and the rationale for going to war .
Matthews seems genuinely angry , accusing Gafney of trying to sell us a phoney war .
Bravo Chris , please , keep it up :

Z - Pitcher Takes Almost Everything Out of Your Water
November 20th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
For those of you who are n’t lucky enough to live in an area with drinkable tap water , the ZeroWater Z- Pitcher might be worth a look .
While other filters leave contaminants such as lead , antibiotics , and perchlorates in your water , the Z - Pitcher uses a filtration system that removes nearly everything .
The Z - Pitcher system uses five stages of filtration to remove suspended solids , chlorine , and metals like lead , mercury and chromium .
Each $ 40 unit is styrofoam and BPA - free and uses 95 % recycled materials .
ZeroWater is also the first company to offer a recycling program for its filters ( both the plastic cartridge and internal resins ) .
If you want to go the extra mile for water purity , ZeroWater also sells a TDS ( total dissolved solids ) meter that evaluates the purity of bottled , filtered , tap , and well water .
I ’d recommend buying the meter in conjunction with the filter unless you have a masochistic need to know just how filthy your water is before drinking it .

The firm said the equipment , which is sold with evidence bags approved by the Crown Prosecution Service to store material for court cases , can be used to compile " proof " of wrongdoing .
In my last post I discussed the relationship between references and lvalues / rvalues .
It can be summarized using the following binding rules .
references bind to lvalues
const references bind to both lvalues and rvalues , but they do n’t allow the modification of the source
It looks like all the bases are covered , except for references that could bind to rvalues and allow their modification .
But who would want that ?
Why modify something that ’s being discarded anyway ?
The auto_ptr disaster
auto_ptr is an interesting beast .
It ’s a member of the family of smart pointers–objects that subvert value semantics to provide tighter control over reference ( pointer ) semantics .
The need for such controls is related to resource management –making sure that program resources have well defined lifetimes .
One way to manage a resource is to ensure that it has a single owner throughout its lifetime .
auto_ptr is such a designated owner .
On the surface , auto_ptr embodies value semantics .
It is allocated on the stack or as a direct member of another data structure .
It is passed by value to and from functions .
When auto_ptr is passed by value , the object it contains is not copied .
In this respect auto_ptr behaves like a reference .
Also , you can access auto_ptr as if it were a pointer to object using the overloaded member - access operator , -> .
Since auto_ptr is supposed to be the only owner of the resource ( which is a pointer to object ) , when an auto_ptr goes out of scope it deletes the object .
Let ’s look in more detail at how auto_ptr is returned from a function .
Consider this example :
auto_ptr < Foo> create ( ) { return auto_ptr < Foo >( new Foo ) ; } // caller 's code auto_ptr < Foo > ap = create ( ) ;
Notice two things :
The original auto_ptr goes out of scope at the end of create ( ) .
If we do n’t do something special , its destructor will be called and it will destroy the newly created Foo .
.
If we do n’t do something special , its destructor will be called and it will destroy the newly created Foo .
We are returning an rvalue .
The auto_ptr is created on the spot inside create ( ) .
( In fact , every local variable turns into an rvalue right before being returned from a function . )
There is one way to prevent the Foo object from being deleted –nulling the pointer inside auto_ptr .
We need a hook to do that when returning auto_ptr .
The returning of objects by value follows a specific C++ protocol .
It involves copy construction and / or assignment .
The caller ’s instance of auto_ptr , ap , is copy - constructed from the callee ’s instance .
The obvious way to prevent the resource from disappearing is to define an auto_ptr copy constructor that nulls the pointer inside its source .
And here ’s the catch :
If you define the copy constructor to take the source auto_ptr by const reference , you wo n’t be able to modify it .
reference , you wo n’t be able to modify it .
If you define it to take a non- const reference , it wo n’t bind to an rvalue .
Finding themselves between a rock and a hard place , C++ designers came up with some ingenuous hacks ( the infamous auto_ptr_ref object ) .
Unfortunately , some important functionality of auto_ptr had to be sacrificed in the process .
In particular , you ca n’t return auto_ptr < Derived > as auto_ptr < Base > , which makes writing polymorphic factory functions hard .
Rvalue references
What we need is something that can bind to an rvalue and modify it too .
And this is exactly what rvalue references do .
Since it was too late to fix auto_ptr , it joined the ranks of deprecated features .
Its place was taken by unique_ptr .
This new template has a “ copy constructor ” that takes another unique_ptr by rvalue reference ( denoted by double ampersand ) .
unique_ptr::unique_ptr(unique_ptr && src )
An rvalue reference can bind both to rvalues and lvalues and does not prohibit the modification of its source .
Move that looks like a copy
Another problem with ownership passing using auto_ptr is that it sometimes looks deceptively like copying .
Consider this example :
auto_ptr < Foo> pSrc(new Foo ) ; auto_ptr < Foo> pDest = pSrc ; // looks like a copy , but it nulls the source pSrc -> method ( ) ; // runtime error , pSrc is now empty
With a little discipline , such errors could be avoided , but the problem gets virtually unmanageable in generic code .
In particular , the use of auto_ptr in standard containers and algorithms could easily lead to serious trouble .
Some algorithms work with temporary copies of elements , not suspecting that making such a “ copy ” might destroy the source .
Again , intricate hackery was employed to make sure that a container of auto_ptrs does n’t compile .
Fine tuning
It seems like in some cases we want to enable implicit move semantics ( returning auto_ptr from a function ) while disabling it in others ( the example above ) .
How can we characterize those two cases ?
The essential feature is the lifetime of the source .
If the source is no longer accessible after the move , we want the move to be implicit .
But if the source remains accessible , we want to force the programmer to be more explicit .
We want the programmer to say , “ Hey , I ’m transferring the ownership , so do n’t try to access the source any more . ”
This difference translates directly into rvalue / lvalue duality .
Rvalues are the ones that disappear .
Lvalues remain accessible .
But the unique_ptr “ copy constructor ”
unique_ptr::unique_ptr(unique_ptr && src )
binds equally ot rvalues and to lvalues .
Fortunately , it ’s possible to overload functions based on rvalue references vs.regular references .
unique_ptr has a second “ copy constructor ” ;
unique_ptr::unique_ptr(unique_ptr & src )
which binds exclusively to lvalues .
When the source is an lvalue , the compiler is forced to pick that overload .
When the source is an rvalue , the rvalue reference overload is used .
All that remains is to make the lvalue - binding constructor private ( and forgo its implementation ) to prevent implicit moves of lvalues .
So how do you explicitly move an lvalue unique_ptr when you really need it ?
You use a special template function , move , like this :
unique_ptr pSrc(new Foo ) ; unique_ptr pDest = move( pSrc ) ;
Since the move is explicit , there is no chance of confusing it with a copy .
Most algorithms in the Standard Library are being rewritten to use move whenever possible ( actually , swap , which uses move ) .
The ones that require objects to be copyable will not compile for unique_ptrs .
By the way , all move does is to convert an lvalue into an rvalue .
template < class T > typename remove_reference <T>:: type&& move( T&& t ) { return t ; }
In the next installment , I ’ll discuss a totally different solution adopted by D .
El embajador de México ante la Organización de los Estados Americanos ( OEA ) , Luis Alfonso de Alba , aseguró que un muro fronterizo no resolverá los problemas de seguridad ni facilitación de flujos .
Abordado en el marco de la conclusión de los trabajos de la XXVIII Reunión de Embajadores y Cónsules ( REC 2017 ) , expuso que en el marco de la OEA se trabaja el tema de migración y refugio desde una perspectiva más amplia , para que sea visto desde una perspectiva de derechos humanos y de las implicaciones económicas :
Que se reconozca claramente que sus aportaciones no son sólo para el país de origen sino para el país de destino , y reconociendo preocupaciones de seguridad en la fronteras y facilitación de flujos .
Nunca hemos creído que los muros sirvan para esos propósitos , declaró .
El planteamiento general de protección , de promoción de los derechos de los migrantes y , al mismo tiempo , de un desarrollo de flujos ordenados es un planteamiento que nosotros vamos a hacer eco a la OEA , abundó .
Aportaciones de migrantes
En respaldo al pronunciamiento que el secretario de Relaciones Exteriores ( SRE ) , Luis Videgaray , hiciera sobre la aportación de las personas migrantes en Estados Unidos , el embajador Luis Alfonso de Alba reiteró que no son delincuentes , son personas que han contribuido grandemente al crecimiento y a la cultura de los Estados Unidos en forma destacable .
Es de recordar que este lunes el secretario Videgaray indicó a embajadores y cónsules que en relación con Estados Unidos se negociará los distintos temas de la relación bilateral con realismo y ambición , promoviendo siempre el interés de México y los mexicanos .
Disminución del flujo migratorio
Es verdad que durante muchas décadas millones de mexicanos migrarán a los Estados Unidos en busca de una vida pacífica justa y próspera para sus familias , una vida que nosotros , como país , por razones diversas , no pudimos ni supimos darles , también es cierto que ese flujo migratorio ha disminuido notablemente .
Pero quiero dejarlo claro , y haberlo dejado claro en todo nuestro diálogo de cualquier negociación : que esos millones de mexicanos que han emigrado para buscar trabajo no son como se les ha descrito : delincuentes , sino que son gente productiva que representa en la mayoría de los casos lo mejor de México , su contribución al tejido social estadounidense engrandece la historia de tradición de las generaciones de migrantes , una tras otra , que han tenido para el bienestar de nuestra nación vecina , señaló Videgaray durante el arranque de los trabajos de la REC 2017 .
Lo importante son las políticas migratorias
Consultado aparte , el cónsul de México en Orlando , Florida , Juan Sabines , dijo que el muro es un tema del gobierno americano , no del gobierno mexicano (... ) , no nos quita el sueño , realmente lo importante son las políticas migratorias (...)
Se me hace algo absurdo , es una grosería .

There comes a point in every festive season , and for me this happened yesterday , when you need to really sit back and take stock of what you eat and drink , and maybe make a few resolutions for the New Year .
Having spent a whole day following the ' detox plan ' my wife conceived after a bit of Xmas excess , I am now thinking of nothing but decent food and drink , and in the spirit of quality over quantity my thoughts turn to how to celebrate New Year with the best beers I can find .
One of the real beauties of beer is that unlike many other drinks ( wine , champagne , most spirits ) the best it has to offer can be drunk without remortgaging your home ( See ?
You can get the recession into any article these days - in fact it 's hard to get published without mentioning it ) .
I 've got a bottle of King & Barnes Millenium
Ale that I really should have drunk already - as the name suggests it was intended to be opened nine years ago , but hopefully the development in the bottle will mean I get something incredible ( Michael Jackson suggested it would be like ' maderized champagne ' ) .
Knocking around downstairs somewhere are a couple of bottles of Deus that always go down well this time of year - a beer made with the " méthode champenoise " that I have posted about before .
If you 're feeling particularly festive you could try a bottle of Samichlaus - which means Santa Claus in Swiss - German - which is secondary fermented in the bottle for around a year and can reach strengths of up to 15 % ABV , which is n't bad for a lager .
My favourite beers at this time of year though are barley wines , which are memorable for three things - the level of alcohol ( typically 8 - 12 % ) , their density , and their sweetness ( especially the English ones - American ' Barley Wine - Style Ales ' - catchy title over there - are more heavily hopped ) .
This time of year I drink them quite a bit with desserts and cheese , and this year will no doubt be festively polishing off a bottle of J W Lees Harvest
Ale with some stilton .
Do you have any particular drinks you always drink at this time of year or celebrate with ?
Any bottles hidden away that you 'll be devouring over the next few days ?
Or are you just another victim of a detox plan ?
President George W. Bush , Karen Hughes and Karl Rove in the conference room aboard Air Force One. ( Photo credit : Wikipedia )
Well , I do n’t talk that much to them — maybe people think I do .
I know something which is known to few but is not a secret .
Karl
Rove is not a believer , and he does n’t shout it from the rooftops , but when asked , he answers quite honestly .
I think the way he puts it is , “ I ’m not fortunate enough to be a person of faith . ”
I think it ’s false to say that the president acts as if he believes he has God ’s instructions .
Compared to Jimmy Carter , he ’s nowhere .
He ’s a Methodist , having joined his wife ’s church in the end .
He also claims that Jesus got him off the demon drink .
He does n’t believe it .
His wife said , “ If you do n’t stop , I ’m leaving and I ’m taking the kids . ”
You can say that you got help from Jesus if you want , but that ’s just a polite way of putting it in Texas .
Three days later , a Tuesday , Karl Rove summoned [ Don ] Willett [ a former Bush aide from Texas who initially shepherded the program ] to his office to announce that the entire faith - based initiative would be rolled out the following Monday .
Willett asked just how — without a director , staff , office , or plan — the president could do that .
Rove looked at him , took a deep breath , and said , “ I do n’t know .
Just get me a f—ing faith - based thing .
Got it ? ” Willett was shown the door .
“ National Christian leaders received hugs and smiles in person and then were dismissed behind their backs and described as ‘ ridiculous , ’ ‘ out of control , ’ and just plain ‘ goofy , ’ ” Kuo writes .
Implications of Rove's Atheism
Does it matter that Karl Rove is an atheist ?
Yes and no .
In one sense , it should matter greatly to all Americans because the Bush administration has long attempted to equate itself with righteous born - again Christianity .
Bush himself is especially fond of speaking about his god and how he believes he is carrying out the will of his god .
To find out that Rove is an atheist and that Bush is perhaps not far behind should therefore be of great interest .
As Austin Cline notes ,
One of the most prominent and defining characteristics of the Bush administration has been its commitment to the promotion of religion — and not just religion generally , but conservative evangelical Christianity in particular .
It seems that there is tremendous interest in the possibility thatis an atheist .
The recent post in which I quoted , author of God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything , as saying that Rove " is not a believer " generated more hits than any other post in the history of Atheist Revolution .
In this post , I 'll consider other evidence that confirms Hitchens ' statement and discuss the implications of Rove 's atheism .
We start with Christopher Hitchens .
What exactly did he say , and what was the context of his statement .
During an interview with , Hitchens was asked whether he thought an openly atheistic candidate would ever be elected in the United States .
He answered in the affirmative and was then asked whether anyone in the Bush administration has ever disclosed atheism to him .
He replied , Hitchens ' response to the next question was almost as interesting .
The question was , " What must Bush make of that ? "
Hitchens replied , So Rove , and to a a lesser degree Bush himself , may not be the believers the American public thinks they are .
In Rove 's case , it appears that he has been willing to admit his lack of theistic belief to those close to him .
In Bush 's case , it sounds like the whole born - again thing may be little more than a public relations strategy .
While Hitchens ' statements may be new for the majority of the American people , Rove 's atheism may be unsurprising to political insiders . , former second - in - command of Bush ’s Office on Faith - Based Initiatives , wrote a book detailing how the Bush administration has used Christianity to win votes .
In Kuo's , he alleges that Bush created his faith - based office to manipulate evangelical Christians .
An excerpt from the book posted by ThinkProgress in October of 2006 ( update : link no longer active ) states , Kuo 's allegations were also reported by MSNBC ( update : link no longer active ) .
According to MSNBC , Kuo " says some of the nation ’s most prominent evangelical leaders were known in the office of presidential political strategist Karl Rove as ' the nuts .
'" In another sense , whether it matters will be shaped by who you are .
Atheists who despised Rove before are not suddenly going to embrace him now .
We might share a lack of theistic belief , but I 'm fairly confident that this is all we share .
By itself , a lack of belief in gods unites us no more than a lack of belief in Santa Claus .
On the other hand , I would expect this to matter a great deal to Christians , especially those who voted for Bush .
I would think that they might feel betrayed , used , and perhaps even humiliated .
Such feelings would be understandable .
They elected an administration who makes fun of them behind their backs , plays on their fears , makes promises which are not honored , and essentially exploits their willingness to trust someone who claims to be one of them .
Insomniac ’s Resistance 2 had some pretty stellar characters .
However , I argued vehemently ( with myself ) that the alien Chimera managed to steal the show from the game ’s human protagonist , Nathan Hale .
I was pleased this morning to find that a toy company felt the same way .
Corner Store Comics is offering a wicked cheap pre-order for the above set of R2 toys by DC Unlimited .
The package includes a Chimera Advanced Hybrid , a Ravager , Nathan Hale and Swarmer , as well as a Steelhead .
The dimensions of the figures are between 5 - 7 inches and each one has multiple points of articulation and a base for display .
Nathan looks a bit odd , but I believe the rest are spot-on .
Are any of you interested in these or are you waiting for the 6 - foot Leviathan to be revealed ?

Danielle L. , THIS is what happens if you do n't listen to the inspector : Aieee !
Shortly after one of us ( Jared Diamond ) boarded a flight from Hong Kong back to Los Angeles , the passenger in the next seat sneezed .
She sneezed again — and again — and then she began coughing .
Finally she gagged , pulled out the vomit bag from the seat back in front of her , threw up into the bag , stood up , squeezed past , and lurched to the toilet at the front of the plane .
The woman was obviously miserable , but sympathy for her pain was not what I felt .
Instead I was frightened and asked the flight attendant to move me to a seat as far from her as possible .
All I could think of was another sick person , a man from Guangdong province in southern China , who spent the night of February 21 , 2003 , at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong , an upscale establishment with a swimming pool , fitness center , restaurants , a bar , and all kinds of areas where visitors could socialize and connect .
The man stayed a single night in room 911 .
Unfortunately for him and for many other people , he had picked up severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS — perhaps directly from an infected bat or from a small , arboreal mammal called a civet , common in one of Guangdong ’s famous “ wet markets ” that sell wild animals for food , or else from a person or chain of people ultimately infected from one of those animal sources .
In the course of his brief stay , the man initiated a SARS “ super spreader ” event that led to at least 16 more SARS cases among the hotel ’s guests and visitors and then to hundreds of other cases throughout Asia , Europe , and North America as those guests and visitors continued on their travels — just as my neighbor was now traveling to L.A .
The infectiousness of room 911 ’s guest can be gauged from the fact that three months later , the carpet right outside the door and near the hotel elevator yielded genetic evidence of the SARS virus , presumably spewed out in his own sneezing , coughing , or vomiting .
I did n’t end up with SARS , but my experience drives home the terrifying prospect of a novel , unstoppable infectious disease .
Globalization , changing climate , and the threat of drug resistance have conspired to set the stage for that perfect microbial storm : a situation in which an emerging pathogen — another HIV or smallpox , perhaps — might burst on the scene and kill millions before we can respond .
Pathogen Paradox
To grasp the risk , we first must understand why any microbe would evolve to sicken or kill us .
In evolutionary terms , how does destroying its host help a microbe to survive ?
Think of your body as a potential “ habitat ” for tiny microbes , just as a forest provides a habitat for bigger creatures like birds and squirrels .
The species living in the forests of our bodies include lice , worms , bacteria , viruses , and amoebas .
Many of those denizens are benign and cause us no harm .
But some microbes seem to go out of their way to make us sick — either mildly sick , as in the case of the common cold , or else sick to the point of killing us , as in the case of smallpox .
Killer microbes have long posed a paradox for evolutionary biologists .
Why would a microbe evolve to devastate the very habitat on which it depends ?
By analogy , you might reason that there should be no squirrels that destroy the forest they live in , because such a species would quickly go extinct .
The answer stems from the fact that in order to survive over the long haul , any microbe restricted to humans must be able to spread from one victim to the next .
There is a simple mathematical requirement here :
On average , the germ must infect at least one new victim for every old one who either dies or recovers and purges himself of the microbe .
If the average number of new victims per old drops to fewer than one , then the spread of the microbe is doomed .
A microbe can’t walk or fly from one host to the next .
Instead it must resort to a range of nefarious tricks .
What from our point of view is simply a disease symptom can , from the bug ’s perspective , be an all - important means of enlisting our help to move around .
Common microbe tricks are to make us cough or sneeze , suffer from diarrhea , or develop open sores on our skin .
Respectively , these symptoms spread the microbe into our exhaled breath , into the local water supply via our feces , and onto the skin of those who touch us , explaining why a microbe might want to induce unpleasant symptoms in its victims .
Evolutionary biologists reason that keeping us alive and pumping out new microbes would be an excellent strategy for such a bug , which might therefore evolve to be less , not more , virulent over time .
An example comes from the history of syphilis .
When it first appeared in Europe in 1495 , it caused severe and painful symptoms within a few months , but by 1546 it had begun evolving into the slowly progressing disease that we know today .
Yet if keeping us alive is strategically sound , why do some pathogens go so far as to actually kill us ?
Sometimes a microbe ’s deadly rampage through a human population stems from an accident of nature .
For instance , the microbe could be comfortably adapted to some animal host that it routinely inhabits without deadly consequences , but it could be maladapted to the human environment .
The microbe may rarely infect people , but when it does , it may kill the human host , who becomes a literal dead end for the virus as well .
But what of those killer microbes that target humans , making us their primary host ?
Their survival strategy , evolutionary biologists now realize , differs from that of a disease like syphilis but works just as well .
Take the cholera bacterium that gives us diarrhea or the smallpox virus that makes us develop skin sores ; both of these can kill us in days to weeks .
Such virulence may be evolutionarily favored if , in the brief time between our becoming infected and dying , the fatal symptoms spread trillions of microbes to potential new victims .
The fact that we may die is unfortunate for us but an acceptable cost for the microbe .
In the world of evolution and natural selection , anything that the microbe does to us is fair — just as long as at least one new victim gets infected for each old one .
Hence the recipe for a killer disease is for the microbe to achieve a balance between two things : the probability of its killing us quickly once we become infected and its efficiency in leading our bodies to transmit the microbe to new victims .

Those two things are connected .
The greater its efficiency in inducing lethal , bug - spreading syndromes ( good for the microbe ) , the faster the microbe kills us ( bad for the microbe ) .
Following this logic , a pathogen may end up killing lots of people by one of two routes .
In the style of HIV , it can keep the disease carrier alive for a long time , infecting new victims over the course of months or years .
Or in the style of smallpox and cholera , it might kill quickly with explosive symptoms that can spread an infection to dozens of new victims within a day .
Searching for the Source For epidemiologists hoping to stanch such outbreaks , tracking killer germs to the source is key .
Do deadly pandemics arise spontaneously in human populations ?
Or are they “ gifts ” from other species , mutating and then crossing over to make us ill ?
Which ecosystems are spawning them , and can we catch them at the start , before they cause too much damage ?
Some answers can be found in the history of yellow fever , a virus spread by mosquitoes .
The cause of devastating human epidemics throughout history , yellow fever is still rife in tropical South America and Africa .
Biologists now understand that yellow fever arose in tropical African monkeys , which , through the mosquito vector , infected ( and continue to infect ) tropical African people , some of whom unintentionally carried yellow fever with them on slave ships several hundred years ago to South America .
Mosquitoes bit the infected slaves and in turn carried the virus to South American monkeys .
In due course , mosquitoes bit infected monkeys and transmitted yellow fever right back to the human population there .
In Venezuela today , the Ministry of Health keeps a lookout for the appearance of unusual numbers of dead wild monkeys , such as howler monkeys .
Because the monkeys are so susceptible to yellow fever and can act as a reservoir from which the virus leaps to the human population , an explosion of monkey deaths serves as an advance warning system , signaling the need to vaccinate humans in the vicinity .
This pattern of cross-infection from animals to humans is par for the course in emerging infectious disease .
In fact , the big killer diseases of history all came to us from microbes living in other species , overwhelmingly from other warm - blooded mammals and , to a lesser extent , from birds .
On reflection , this all makes sense .
Each new animal host to which a microbe adapts represents a new habitat .
It is easiest for a microbe to jump between closely related habitats , from an animal species with one sort of body chemistry to a closely related animal species with very similar body chemistry .
In the tropics , disease sources have included a host of wild animals , most notably the nonhuman primates .
We can thank our primate cousins not just for yellow fever but also for HIV , dengue fever , hepatitis B , and vivax malaria .
Other wild animal disease donors include rats , the source of the plague and typhus .
In temperate regions like the United States , meanwhile , ticks in suburban neighborhoods and domestic livestock living in proximity to humans have posed threats .
Mammalian reservoirs like mice and chipmunks carry Lyme disease and tularemia ; ticks transmit these diseases to humans .
Cattle probably gave rise to the measles and tuberculosis .
Smallpox is likely to have come from camels , biologists say , and flu from pigs and ducks .
The Next Wave Today , with fewer people tending farms and more living in the suburbs , things have certainly changed .
The principles of infectious disease are the same as they have always been , but modern conditions , including life in proximity to pets and mammal - filled woods , are exposing us to new pathogen reservoirs and new modes of transmitting disease .
One of us ( Nathan Wolfe ) has spent much of the last six years in the tropical African country of Cameroon , studying the kinds of interspecies jumps that such conditions might spawn .
To examine the mechanisms , I worked with rural hunters who butchered wild animals for food .
I collected blood samples from the hunters , from other people in their community , and from their animal prey .
By testing all those samples , I identified microbes inhabiting the animal reservoirs and focused on those that showed up in the hunters ’ blood , making them candidates for firing up human disease .
One evening I asked a group of hunters if they had ever cut themselves while butchering wild monkeys or apes .
The response was incredulous laughter : “ You do n’t know the answer to that ? ”
Of course , they said .
All of them had cut themselves once or more , thereby giving themselves ample opportunity to get infected from animal blood .
On reflection , I should n’t have been surprised .
I ca n’t count all the times I have cut myself while chopping onions .
The difference is that onions are n’t closely related to us humans , and an onion virus has far less chance of taking hold in us than does a monkey virus .
The statistics are telling .
Researchers like Mark Woolhouse , professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland , have found at least 868 human pathogens that infect both animals and humans , although some are not as fearsome as they seem .
Overhyped microbes include anthrax ( famous for the U.S. mail attacks in 2000 ) , the Ebola and Marburg viruses ( which can cause dramatic bleeding and high fever in their victims ) , and the prion agent of mad cow disease ( otherwise known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or BSE ) , which kills people by making their nervous systems degenerate .
These bugs arouse terror because they kill so many of their victims .
For example , in the 2000 Ebola outbreak , which struck the Gulu district of Uganda , 53 percent of the 425 people who contracted the disease died .
The case fatality rate for BSE is 100 percent .
Although spectacularly lethal , these pathogens generally kill just a few hundred people at a time and then burn themselves out .
They transmit from human to human too inefficiently to spread very widely ; 100 percent of a small number of victims is still a small number of fatalities .
There are many reasons why an agent leaping from animals to humans might not affect more individuals .
For example , humans do not normally bite , scratch , hunt , or eat each other .
This surely contributes to the rarity or nonexistence of human - to - human transmission of rabies ( acquired by the bite of an infected dog or bat ) ; cat - scratch disease ( which causes skin lesions and swollen lymph nodes ) ; tularemia ( a disease , often acquired when hunting and cutting up an infected rabbit , that can cause skin ulcers , swollen lymph nodes , and fever ) ; and BSE ( probably acquired by eating the nervous system tissue of infected cows ) .
Some outbreaks , once recognized , are relatively easy to control .
Anthrax is treatable with antibiotics ; after an initial malaria - like stage , the rapid onset and severity of Ebola and Marburg symptoms have made identification and containment straightforward .
In fact , within the last 40 years , only HIV ( derived from chimpanzees ) has taken off to cause a pandemic .
Back to the Future If not anthrax or Ebola , which pathogens might spawn the next deadly pandemic in our midst ?
New pandemics are most likely to be triggered by mutant strains of familiar microbe species , especially those that have caused plagues by churning out mutant strains in the past .
For example , the highest known epidemic death toll in history was caused by a new strain of influenza virus that killed more than 20 million people in 1918 and 1919 .
Unfairly named Spanish influenza , it apparently emerged in Kansas during World War I , was carried by American troops to Europe , and then spread around the world in three waves before ebbing in outbreaks of declining virulence in the 1920s .
Mutant strains of influenza or cholera remain prime candidates for another deadly outbreak .
Both can persist in animal reservoirs or the environment , and both are adept at spawning new strains .
Both pathogens also transmit efficiently , and it is possible that these two important diseases of the past could become important diseases of the future .
A future pandemic could also come from tuberculosis .
New mutants have already arisen through the mechanism of drug resistance .
And the disease lives on in the human population , especially among those with weakened immunity , including patients with HIV .
Also of concern are emerging sexually transmitted diseases , which , once introduced , may be difficult to control because it is hard to persuade humans to change sexual behavior or to abstain from sex .
HIV offers a grim warning : Despite its huge global impact , the AIDS epidemic would have been far worse if the sexual transmissibility of HIV ( which is actually rather modest ) had equaled that of some other sexually transmitted agents , such as human papilloma virus ( HPV ) .
While the probability of HIV transmission varies with the stage of the disease and the type of sexual contact , it appears to pass from infected to uninfected individuals in less than 1 percent of acts of unprotected heterosexual intercourse , while the corresponding probability of HPV transmission is thought to be higher than 5 percent — probably much higher .
Similarly , it could be difficult to control emerging pathogens transmitted by pets , which increasingly include exotic species along with traditional domestic animals like dogs and cats .
Already we are at risk of catching rabies from our dogs , toxoplasmosis and cat - scratch disease from our cats , and psittacosis from our parrots .
Most people now accept the need to cull millions of farmyard animals in the face of epidemics like mad cow disease , but it is hard to imagine killing beloved puppies , bunnies , and kittens , even if those pets do turn out to offer a pathway for a dangerous new disease .
Have Plague , Will Travel
Once a killer disease has emerged , modern societies offer new ways for it to flourish and spread .
Global travel , the close quarters of the urban environment , climate change , the evolution of drug - resistant microbes , and increasing numbers of the elderly or antibiotic - treated immunosuppressed could all aid the next great plague .
For example , rapid urbanization in Africa could transform yellow fever , chikungunya fever ( which causes severe joint pain and fever ) , and other rural African arboviruses ( viruses , including yellow fever , spread by bloodsucking insects ) into plagues of African cities , as has already happened with dengue hemorrhagic fever .
One of us ( Wolfe ) theorizes that this might follow increasing demand in those cities for bush meat .
Like urban people everywhere , urban Africans love to eat the foods enjoyed by their village - dwelling ancestors , and in tropical Africa this means bush meat .
In that respect it ’s similar to the smoked fish and bagels that I eat in the United States , which give me some comforting memory of my Eastern European roots .
But there ’s an important difference :
The wild game that I see served in fancy restaurants in the capital of Cameroon is much more likely to transmit a dangerous virus to the person who hunted and butchered it , or to the cook who prepared it , or to the restaurant patron who ate the meat undercooked , than is my brunch of smoked fish and bagels .
By connecting distant places , meanwhile , globalization permits the long - distance transfer of microbes along with their insect vectors and their human victims , as evidenced not only by the spread of HIV around the world , but also by North American cases of cholera and SARS brought by infected passengers on jet flights from South America and Asia , respectively .
Indeed , when a flight from Buenos Aires to Los Angeles stopped in Lima in 1992 , it picked up some seafood infected with the cholera then making the rounds in Peru .
As a result , dozens of passengers who arrived in Los Angeles , some of whom then changed planes and flew on to Nevada and even as far as Japan , found that they had contracted cholera .
Within days that single airplane spread cholera 10,000 miles around the whole rim of the Pacific Basin .
Consider as well those diseases thought of as “ just ” tropical because they are transmitted by tropical vectors : malaria transmitted by mosquitoes , sleeping sickness spread by tsetse flies , and Chagas ’ disease ( associated with edema , fever , and heart disease ) spread by kissing bugs .
How will we feel about those tropical diseases if global warming enables their vectors to spread into temperate zones ?
While microbe and vector movement can be difficult to detect , modeling suggests that global warming will expand the reach of malaria to higher latitudes and into tropical mountain regions .
The transmission of emerging diseases has also been enhanced by a host of modern practices and technologies .
The commercial bush meat trade has introduced retroviruses into human populations .
Ecotourism has exposed first - world tourists to cutaneous leishmaniasis and other third - world diseases .
Underequipped rural hospitals have facilitated Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa .
Air conditioners and water circulation systems have spread Legionnaires ’ disease .
Industrial food production was responsible in Europe for the spread of BSE .
And intravenous drug use and blood transfusion have both spread HIV and hepatitis B and C .
All this shows that disease prevention and treatment need to be supplemented by a new effort : disease forecasting .
This refers to the early detection of potential pandemics at a stage when we might still be able to localize them , before they have had the opportunity to infect a high percentage of the local population and thereby spread around the world , as happened with HIV .
Already one of us ( Wolfe ) is working through a new initiative , the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( GVFI ) , to do just that .
GVFI works in countries throughout the world to monitor the entry and movement of new agents before they become pandemics .
By studying emerging agents at the interface between humans and animals , GVFI hopes to stop new epidemics before they explode .
Monitoring for the emergence of both new sexually transmitted diseases and pet- associated diseases would be good investments .
The predictions here are admittedly educated guesses — but they are educated by some of the best science available .
The time to act is now .
If we do n’t , then we will continue to be like the cardiologists of the 1950s , waiting for their patients ’ heart attacks and doing little to prevent them .
If we do act , we have the potential to avert the next HIV , saving millions of lives and billions of dollars .
The choice seems obvious .
U.S. military prepares for
failed state in Mexico
( front page )
The commands  Joint Operating Environment 2008  report discusses future wars the U.S. military must be ready to fight .
Its conclusion about Pakistan and Mexico is presented in the documents chapter on weak and failing states . 
Based in Norfolk , Virginia , the Joint Forces Command oversees army , navy , air force , and Marine Corps operations for the Atlantic Ocean geographical region .
Its current mandate includes leading the transformation of U.S. military joint warfighting into the 21st Century ,  according to the commands Web site .
 The Mexican possibility may seem less likely ,  the report states , but the drug wars ravaging Mexico will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state .
Mexico is Washingtons third largest trade partner and its third - biggest supplier of oil .
The intensifying violence and kidnappings organized by capitalists involved in Mexicos drug trade have killed more than 8,000 people over the past two years .
Although the Mexican government has sent some 45,000 federal cops and army troops to fight the drug lords , those raking in cash from the drug operations reach into the highest echelons of the government and local and federal police forces .
In November former top antidrug official Noé Ramírez was charged with accepting at least $ 450,000 a month in bribes from a drug cartel in exchange for information about police and antinarcotics operations .
A month later army major Arturo González was arrested on suspicion that he sold information about President Felipe Calderóns movements for $ 100,000 a month .
Government officials operating out of the federal attorney generals office have been arrested for sending secret information to the Beltrán Leyva drug cartel in exchange for cash , reported the New York Times .
 Any descent by Mexico into chaos ,  the Joint Forces report states , would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone .
The report does not elaborate upon specifics , but the U.S. government has already adopted contingency plans for use of aircraft , armored vehicles , and troops in border trouble spots . 
Outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the Houston Chronicle January 14 that federal SWAT teams along with National Guard and army troops would be called into action if Mexican drug wars cross the border .
Another department official said federal forces were prepared to respond to a number of different contingencies ,  which , according to the Chronicle , include cross - border raids or kidnappings by Mexican drug gangs to refugees storming the border . 

Another day , another post about piracy to fuel the impassioned debate of the principled hordes .
See how we dance for you .
It ’s a particularly interesting piece of piractical news this time , even if you generally avoid the shouting matches around the subject .
Filesharing news site Torrentfreaks have done some mathematical investigative work , casting an eye over a bunch of trackers to come up with what they reckon are the 10 most pirated PC games of the year to date .
Care to bet on what ’s number one before we draw back the curtain ?
Worth noting that , annoyingly , we do n’t know quite what sites Torrentfreaks have monitored for this or what their research methods were .
It ’s more than likely private trackers are n’t included , for instance .
The actual totals could well be far higher than the “ estimated download count ” below , but if their maths is correct it should at least be a reasonable snapshot / average of the year in torrents .
It may be entirely off - base , of course – but it does n’t seem fantastical .
1 Spore – 1,700,000 – Sept. 2008
2 The Sims 2 - 1,150,000 – Sept. 2004
3 Assassins Creed - 1,070,000 – Nov. 2007
4 Crysis – 940,000 – Nov. 2007
5 Command & Conquer 3 – 860,000 – Mar. 2007
6 Call of Duty 4 – 830,000 – Nov. 2007
7 GTA San Andreas – 740,000 – Jun. 2005
8 Fallout 3 – 645,000 – Oct. 2008
9 Far Cry 2 – 585,000 – Oct. 2008
10 Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 – 470,000 – Oct. 2008
I know what you ’re thinking .
You ’re thinking either :
a ) “ but Spore ’s rubbish ! ” .
In which case , shuddup .
We ’ve done all that shouting already .
2 ) “ it ’s because of the DRM !
This is a successful protest against the forces of evil ! ”
In which case , mmmmaybe .
Mmmmaybe not .
That Spore ’s high placing is a direct result of its headline - making crazy - copy protection is certainly the popular theory .
It ’s hard to doubt that it did n’t play some part , thanks to a double whammy of protestors voting with their feet and protest - observers being confused and afraid by all the Chinese whispers about what Spore ’s copy protection actually involved .
Take a look at the number 2 game , though .
That makes me doubt that Spore ’s bittersweet chartopping here is quite as simple as so many will likely presume .
It ’s The Sims 2 – a four year old game , and still significantly more torrented than this year ’s heaviest hitters .
That ’s certainly nothing to do with DRM – that ’s simply demand from a potential playerbase that ’s way larger than most others even dream of .
Given that Spore comes from the same stable as The Sims 2 and transparently chased the same audience , there ’s a pretty strong chance a meaty fraction of its leechers came from that demographic , not the the DRM protest / fear demographic .
I have no figures to back this up , sadly – this is just me raising an eyebrow and saying “ eh? EH ? ” knowingly .
Most likely , Spore ’s king of torrent hill status is a combination of both factors .
The same ca n’t be said for game number 3 , which is really something of a mystery .
From my sagging office chair , it rather seemed as though the PC port of Assassin ’s Creed came and went pretty quietly .
There was some hoo - hah about dodgy performance and ludicrously protracted exit procedures , and there was the hangover of console AssCreed players irate about its comprimises , but it did n’t really seem to inspire either great love or great protest .
So why so high ?
Possible factors : the fact a version was leaked significantly before it hit the shops ; the fact it came out during a relatively quiet time for big - name games , so perhaps enjoyed heightened interest ; the fact it had pretty high system requirements , so may have appealed more to a tech - savvy audience , au fait with torrenting ; the fact it did have something of a bad rap off the back of the console version , which made interested players more reluctant to purchase .
All theories , and there ’s probably one simple answer I ’m too stupid to deduct .
It sure does look weird there , though .
No real surprises otherwise – all big - name sequels , as you might expect .
Only 3 of the 10 are original IPs , in fact .
We can also doubtless expect the likes of Fallout 3 and Far Cry 2 to climb higher once they ’ve been on sale for longer , while GTA IV and COD5 should make their presence known very soon .
Also , San Andreas being so high after three years seems odd , but that ’s most likely down to extreme anticipation for GTA IV .
So , not a complete picture of the year that was in terms of piracy , but it ’s an interesting document of what have been 12 months that seemed to really shake PC gaming .
Or our comments threads , at the very least .
About a week ago , my wife said ( paraphrased ) , “ We use a ton of websites to save ourselves a lot of money directly .
Why do n’t you write about those ?
You could just keep track of what sites you visit to save money over a week , how much they save , and whether or not this pays for our internet connection ? ”
A great idea .
So that ’s just what I did .
Here are seven websites I used to directly save money over the last week , my exact purchases and savings , and how much cash they saved me .
I ’m not including banking or investing sites here – just sites I use to literally spend less money .
PaperBackSwap
PaperBackSwap is arguably our biggest regular saver ( and one I ’ve waxed ecstatic about on The Simple Dollar before ) .
My wife and I both spend multiple hours a day reading – it ’s our most constant hobby – but between the library , PaperBackSwap , and my wife ’s use of ManyBooks .
net on her Kindle , we basically have n’t bought a book in ages .
In a nutshell , PaperBackSwap works like this : you sign up , list ten books you ’re willing to trade by mail , and the site gives you two credits .
A book costs one credit – you “ spend ” one of those credits on the site to get any book they have listed sent to you .
Every time you send a book to someone else , you get a credit .
Here are the books I ’ve requested in the past week from PaperBackSwap ( and a nice peek into my current literary tastes ) :
We by Yevgeny Zamyatin
Why I Am Not a Christian by Bertrand Russell
Pattern Recognition by William Gibson
The Human Stain by Philip Roth
A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge
The Shipping News by E. Annie Proulx
… and I also ordered The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion to be shipped to my mother , but I wo n’t count that one .
Assuming each used book is worth $ 2 , that means I ’ve saved $ 12 this week because of PaperBackSwap .
While this is n’t entirely , perfectly accurate ( I likely would have used the library and gotten other books ) , these books are now mine for as long as I like and I can mark up the margins and such as much as I want ( which I often do if I ’m really trying to understand a book ) .
While I love using PaperBackSwap and SwapADVD ( below ) for trading books and DVDs , respectively , there ’s really no similar service for video games .
At the same time , I like to play a wide variety of games for my Wii and for my Nintendo DS , particularly interesting puzzle games that make me think .
Most games , though , intrigue me for a while , then I grow bored with them , so unsurprisingly , I want to trade them off .
I used to take them to used game sellers , but I ’ve started using SwapTree.com instead .
SwapTree is sort of like PaperBackSwap in that you ’re swapping items online .
The only catch is that it actually forces you into a direct one - on - one trade .
If you list an item , someone else must have it already on their wishlist in order for you to trade it .
There ’s no way to get rid of a lot of stuff you do n’t want ( like when you clean out your book collection ) and build up credit on there .
You have to want something right now .
As a result , I prefer other services for trading some things , but this service works really well for video games .
In just the last week , I traded Resident Evil 4 ( a shooting game that bored me to death ) for Zack and Wiki ( an adventure / puzzle game in the Monkey Island / King ’s Quest mold ) .
In essence , this was a free game .
If I had bought it used ( and traded in RE 4 ) , it probably would have cost me $ 5 - 10 , so in that respect , SwapTree saved me about $ 7.50 ( or so ) .
FatWallet.com Forums
The FatWallet.com Forums are the best place to keep an eye out for extraordinary tech deals .
If you need a particular piece of computer hardware , be patient and keep an eye on these forums .
A friend of mine picked up an ultra-portable 7 ″ laptop with solid state storage and ridiculous battery life ( 7 or 8 hours ) for $ 299 .
My story from the last week ?
The MicroSD card in my phone stopped working , meaning I could n’t store many pictures at all on my cell phone .
So I wanted an ultra-cheap MicroSD card to replace it , preferably one at least a gigabyte in size .
Bingo .
I saved $ 3 from about two minutes of web surfing .
If I go on a book tour ( a possibility ) , I might also go for one of those ultra - small ultra - light laptops just for writing while on the road .
Guess where I ’ll be watching for the right deal on it ?
Coupons.com
Coupons.com is the site my wife and I use most frequently for coupons .
My wife is actually the maven here , more than I am – she searches the site a couple times a week for coupons , particularly for ones that match our upcoming shopping list .
For example , she found a $ 3 off Pert Plus coupon that we used to replace the shampoo and conditioner in our downstairs shower ( the one that guests use ) – it was free after the coupon .
At Coupons.com , things are pretty straightforward .
It ’s basically like going through one of those Sunday newspaper flyers online , except you just mark the ones you want and at the end you click on a “ print ” button and the ones you selected pop right out of your printer , easy as pie .
We find it useful to use it after we ’ve got our shopping list ready to go so we can find coupons that match it .
I tried to keep track of the Coupons.com coupons we used in the past week and came up with a total of $ 7 saved – two instances of the Pert Plus coupon , and two $ 0.50 savings on yogurt .
SwapADVD
SwapADVD is a sister service to PaperBackSwap where you can trade DVDs by mail .
When you sign up , you just list ten DVDs you own that you ’re willing to trade and the site gives you a credit , which you can use to request any DVD on their site .
Whenever someone requests one of your DVDs , mail it out , and when they receive it , you get another credit .
You can list as many DVDs as you want .
My DVD collection is tiny , so I ’ve never sent out a DVD via SwapADVD ( yet – I have several I intend to swap soon ) – instead , you can actually transfer extra credits from PaperBackSwap into SwapADVD ( and since I ’ve shipped out quite a few books via PaperBackSwap , I just pulled some of those credits into SwapADVD ) .
I prefer it to Netflix simply because there ’s no monthly fee at all .
Once you have the DVD , just hold onto it as long as you want with no cost , then when you finally do watch it , just trade it again .
Anyway , over the last week , I ’ve requested Road to Perdition , Adaptation , Thank You for Smoking , and Crash , just so that we have a few new interesting films to watch on those rare evenings when the kids go to bed early and we want to cuddle up with a glass of wine and a good movie .
Assuming a used DVD is worth $ 3 , that means SwapADVD saved us $ 12 in the past week .
Home Depot ’s Home How - To Site
I ’m absolutely atrocious at home improvement tasks , but we ’ve been wanting to install a ceiling fan in both my office and in the kids ’ bedroom .
I ’ve been really hesitant to work on the project and wanted to hire someone to do it ( if you ’ll remember , I was trying to talk myself into it just a little over a week ago ) , but I finally bucked down and went for it , using their wonderful guide to installing a ceiling fan , including an excellent summary video .
This guide directly saved me the cost of hiring someone to do it – $ 40 or so , perhaps .
Home Depot ’s Know How section is excellent .
There are useful guides on all sorts of projects , and I ’m trying to build up the courage to use it to replace a toilet .
Almost always , I ’m glad I ’ve done it myself afterwards , but I have a lot of apprehension about it beforehand – guides like these help push me towards the goal .
Upcoming Events Calendars
My family and I are constantly on the lookout for interesting things to do that get us out and about in the community ( and in neighboring ones ) , enjoying new things , meeting new people , and so on .
The problem is finding interesting ones – it ’s easy to go to places that are expensive and have fun , but there ’s always free stuff going on .
That ’s why we hit the community calendars of several area communities to see what ’s going on , particularly the Ames , Iowa and Ankeny , Iowa ones , along with a huge number of community calendars for small towns in Story , Polk , Marshall , Boone , Jasper , and Dallas Counties .
We ’ll even go further for interesting stuff , such as Pella ’s Tulip Festival in the spring .
Community events provide a great deal of our entertainment .
Let ’s assume each community event saves us $ 5 as a family if we choose to do that instead of something else .
In the last week , community calendars saved us $ 20 – it pointed us to a free public fireworks display on the 4th , towards a farmers ’ market , towards a cultural festival in a nearby small town , and towards a free concert , too .
Find and bookmark some community calendars near you and check them out when you ’re planning your weekend .
You might just find some interesting stuff free in the community .
Totaling It Up
Let ’s look at the total savings !
PaperBackSwap : $ 12
SwapTree : $ 7.50
FatWallet.com Forums : $ 3
Coupons.com : $ 7
SwapADVD : $ 12
Home Depot : $ 40
Community calendars : $ 20
We used the web to directly save $ 101.50 in the past week in free ( or vastly reduced ) entertainment , coupons , and home improvement tasks .
This easily pays for the cost we put into it .
What about that time investment ?
Our time investment for this stuff is surprisingly small .
We have all of these sites bookmarked and we only use them when we have a specific purpose in mind ( “ How do I fix that leaky toilet ?
I need to replace that SD card !
My bookshelf is getting thin !
Is there anything interesting to do Sunday afternoon ? ) .
When you know what you ’re going in for , it does n’t take long at all – just a moment or two , and it ’s certainly quicker than doing the equivalent things offline .
Give some of these services a try – I hope you ’ll find them as useful ( and cost - saving ) as we do .
An Old Bridge High School drama teacher was arrested today on charges she had a sexual relationship with a male student that started in February , authorities said .
Lisa Glide , 35 , of Howell Township , Monmouth County , faces a second - degree charges of sexual assault and child endangerment , Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said in a statement issued today .
The prosecutor 's office began an investigation into Glide on Nov. 25 after receiving information about the sexual relationship , Kaplan said .
Investigators determined Glide began having a sex with the boy in February , when he was still a student at the school , Kaplan said .
The 17 - year - old graduated in June , school authorities said .
Glide began working as a drama teacher at Old Bridge High School in 2004 and also served as advisor of school productions and plays , Kaplan said .
Previously , Glide was employed from 2001 to 2004 with the Marlboro School District and from 2000 to 2001 with the Jersey City School District , Kaplan said .
In addition , Glide was a substitute teacher with the Weehawken School District from 1999 to 2000 , Kaplan said .
The investigation remains ongoing .
Authorities asked that anyone with information call Investigator Michael Daniewicz of the Middlesex County Prosecutor 's Office Sex Crimes / Child Abuse Unit at ( 732 ) 745-3600 or Detective Michael Machen of the Old Bridge Police Department at ( 732 ) 721-5600 ext. 3210 .
There are literally thousands of webcams and security cameras that broadcast images of offices , parks , street corners , and other public and private areas over the Internet .
Since many cameras use known protocols to transmit live video streams over the web , it 's quite easy to search for publicly accessible webcams .
Sometime , it 's even possible to control the cameras online .
The following Fox News footage discusses how to hack into security cameras .
Conservative legal scholar and Reagan Solicitor General Charles Fried , who just endorsed Obama , is n’t just a Republican .
He ’s actually one of McCain ’s campaign advisors .
Before they cycle down the memory hole , here ’s Fried on McCain ’s Honest and Open Election Committee and Justice Advisory Committee .
Key to his decision was McCain ’s “ choice of Sarah Palin at a time of deep national crisis . ”
A former Hawthorne man detained in the United Arab Emirates since Aug. 29 has been tortured and ultimately charged with a terrorism - related offense , according to a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California .
Naji Hamdan told his brother during a six - minute call early Tuesday morning that he had been pinned to the ground with his arms and legs twisted behind him and beaten until he passed out , according to an ACLU statement released Wednesday .
The ACLU ’s information was based on the account from Hamdan ’s brother .
Hamdan , a naturalized U.S. citizen , was also beaten on the soles of his feet , kept awake by a spotlight and told his family would be punished if he did n’t confess to his interrogators ’ allegations , the ACLU said .
“ They took out his soul , ” said Hamdan ’s brother , Hossam Hemdan , using a common Arabic expression , in an interview with The Times .

Hemdan , who spells his last name differently , said his brother signed every confession given to him , though he did n’t know what he was signing and did n’t care , in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the torture .
Hamdan , who lived in the Hawthorne area for two decades and still owns an auto parts business in L.A. , faces four charges , including one related to terrorism , Hemdan said .
“ It seems like they are trying to prosecute him using statements he made under torture , ” said Jennie Pasquarella , the ACLU attorney .
The ACLU filed a habeas corpus petition last month against the U.S. government alleging that Hamdan was being held at the government ’s behest .
ACLU lawyers said they were considering amending the lawsuit to include the torture allegations .

“ If the U.S. is responsible for his detainment -- which we believe they are -- they are responsible for this torture , ” Pasquarella said .
A State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs spokeswoman did not return calls for comment Wednesday and a spokesman for the Emirates embassy in Washington said it would be inappropriate to comment on a police and security matter involving a private U.S. citizen .
Hamdan was released from state security custody and taken to a prison near the city of Abu Dhabi on Nov. 26 .
Since his transfer he has not been tortured , Hemdan said .

( CNN ) -- Caroline Kennedy , the 51 - year - old daughter of President John F. Kennedy , has indicated her interest in filling the New York Senate seat being vacated by secretary of state designee Hillary Clinton .
Caroline Kennedy has her eyes on the New York Senate seat .
" I 've talked to Caroline Kennedy and she 's clearly interested , " New York Sen.
Chuck Schumer said at a news conference Monday afternoon .
He indicated that 12 people were interested in the position .
" She 's interested in the position , " New York Gov. David Paterson confirmed .
But at the same time " she realizes it 's not a campaign . "
Paterson , who will name Clinton 's successor , noted that Kennedy had indicated a desire to " sit down and tell me what her qualifications are . "
The Rev. Al Sharpton also released a statement Monday indicating that he had received a call from Kennedy " who expressed to me her interest in [ Clinton 's ] Senate seat . "
Kennedy 's interest in the seat could mean the continuation of a family legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father as the then - junior senator from Massachusetts .
Background : The Kennendys in Politics »
Her uncle Ted Kennedy has represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1963 , and her uncle Robert Kennedy served as New York 's junior senator from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968 .
" Remember , [ Clinton 's ] seat in the Senate was once held by Robert Kennedy , " said Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst .
" [ Caroline Kennedy's ] other uncle , Ted Kennedy , is ill right now .
If Paterson appoints Caroline Kennedy to the Senate , it means there could be a Kennedy staying in the Senate for quite a long time . "
Watch Sen. Schumer on the possible candidates »
CNN reported earlier this month that Caroline Kennedy had called Paterson to discuss the possibility of taking the seat .
Paterson has the power to appoint a replacement , who will then face a special election in 2010 to fill out Clinton 's term .
Paterson confirmed to CNN last week that Kennedy had called and " asked a few questions " about the expected vacancy .
One Democratic source close to the Kennedy family told CNN earlier this month Kennedy was " interested to say the least " in the Senate seat and had asked a tight circle of other family friends and political advisers for advice .
Before this year , Kennedy generally limited her forays into the public sphere to nonpartisan activity , penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father 's legacy .
But in January , she backed a political candidate for the first time , announcing her endorsement of Obama during the Democratic primary season with an op -ed in The New York Times that drew days of the kind of media attention she has spent her life avoiding .
" I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them , " she wrote .
" But for the first time , I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me , but for a new generation of Americans . "
" Apparently , she has acquired a taste for politics , " Schneider noted .
" She wants to be part of this new regime in America , clearly playing a key role in the Senate if she gets that appointment . "
Watch Bill Schneider 's report »
There are a slew of high - profile candidates for Clinton 's Senate seat , including New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , whose last name carries some star power of its own New York , where his father was once governor .
Kennedy 's roots in New York also run deep .
Her mother , Jacqueline Kennedy , relocated to New York after her husband 's assassination in 1963 , with children Caroline and John F. Kennedy Jr .
Caroline Kennedy has also spent most of her life in the city , working there after graduating from Harvard , meeting her husband , Edwin Schlossberg , on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and attending Columbia Law School there .
Her most prominent public roles involved overseeing her father 's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award .
She 's also edited several books , from a volume of children 's poetry and an updated edition of her father 's book " Profiles in Courage " to a collection of patriotic verse ( " A Patriot 's Handbook : Songs , Poems , Stories , and Speeches Celebrating the Land We Love " ) .
Most of her leadership positions have been based in the arts : serving as host of the annual nationally televised Kennedy Center Honors in Washington and serving as the honorary chairwoman of the American Ballet Theatre , as her mother did .
In late spring and early summer she was mentioned as a possible vice - presidential candidate and more recently as a contender for secretary of education in an Obama Cabinet .
But elected office would mark a major shift for Kennedy .
In a 2002 Time magazine interview promoting the updated " Profiles in Courage , " Kennedy would not rule out the possibility of a run for public office .
" I do n't have any plans to do that right now , " she said .
" I do n't plan ahead .
My kids are young , and I 'm really happy to be able to be around .
But I do care about issues , and I 'm interested in them .
So I do n't see that now , but you know , I have a long life ahead of me . "
CNN 's John King , Kate Bolduan , Mark Preston and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report .

For years , architects have gone to great lengths to protect their buildings from marauding skaters .
But as aesthetic trends move toward folded planes that transition seamlessly from wall to ceiling and back to wall , designers have been looking to their former adversaries for a lesson in flow .
" We have this fascination with buildings becoming topography , " says Alejandro Zaera - Polo , a partner at London 's Foreign Office Architects , " and skateboarders have that physical experience . "
So for a park in Barcelona , his firm extended paving stones up the sides of small hills — to shield vegetation from salty sea breezes .
At least that 's what it told city officials .
But skaters got the message .
The resulting quarter - pipe landed on the March 2006 cover of Transworld Skateboarding .
Architect Zaha Hadid shares the love .
She wanted her Phaeno Science Center in Germany to be an all - inclusive venue for pedestrians and skateboarders alike .
Liability issues prevented skate - park designation — though you 'd never guess it from the YouTube videos of pro skaters " visiting " the museum .
" We design spaces that are flowing and continuous , and — just by coincidence — skateboarders look for that kind of continuity , " Dillon Lin , an architect ( and skater ) at Hadid 's firm , says with a wink .
And though the new Oslo Opera House ( shown here ) was inspired by the image of two glaciers colliding , the architects at Snøhetta did n't call on glaciologists to help fine - tune the details .
They enlisted real experts in twisted planes : skateboarders .
" We spoke to them about surface textures and the areas they prefer , " architect Simon Ewings says .
His firm followed up the conversation with a statement in stone .
Snøhetta used different finishes of marble to guide skaters looking for rideable surfaces .
Acoustically sensitive parts , like above the auditorium , got rough marble that 's unpleasant to wheel over .
But other areas silently beckon skaters .
Surfaces rise up all over the place to become ledges , curbs , and benches — like the jagged facets of a glacier ( or skate park ) .
One particularly tempting spot is a 3 - foot - wide railing of smooth stone .
Snøhetta architect Peter Dang is , ahem , absolutely sure it 's skatable .
" Just make sure to fall toward the inside , " he advises .
Tricked Out
The new Oslo Opera House is much more than a temple to the vocal arts .
It 's a palace of thrash , with as many gnarly facets as the best skate parks .
Here are some key features and suggested moves .
Stair Ledge =
50 - 50 Grind
Marble Bench =
Kick Flip
Sloped Plaza =
Bert Slide
Upper Level =
Acid Drop
Pedestrian Ramp =
Downhill Slalom
Walkway Balustrade =
Switch Crook

Hi All DTM Newbies .
This tutorial is going to be all about article marketing .
Admin , you should maybe consider making it a sticky .
Article marketing can be a powerful way to improve search engine rankings , drive targeted visitors to your website , and improve your company 's brand .
Over time , I 've learned a number of important lessons when it comes to article marketing .
Article marketing if free , and , if you like to write , it can be fun .
It is not fast however , as you have to wait for the traffic , and wait even longer for the sales .
Let 's get down to business .
PARTt # 1 : Only Submit to Popular Article Marketing Websites
Not all article directories , websites , and blogs are the same .
Submitting your articles to sites that have a low Google PR ( page rank ) or very few inbound links does n't do a lot to promote your content or pass along any value back to your site .
Consider the sites you submit your content to carefully .
Actually , the only site that I would recommend submitting to is ezinearticles.com .
There are a few reasons why I choose ezine .
1. Resource Box
The resource box is a short paragraph about the author that publishers usually request with article submissions .
It 's included at the bottom of the published article and is an opportunity to brand yourself , your business , and your website .
The minimum it should contain is your name , business name , and web site address .
Space permitting , the resource box should also include a tagline , e-mail address and credentials .
2. Inbound Links
Every time your article is published there should be a live link to your website in the resource box .
This give you one more inbound link to help the search engine ranking of your site .
Be sure to include important keywords in the link text for extra points with the search engines .
3. Building credibility
Published articles help establish your expertise .
You develop a position of authority in your field and recognition with respect to the topics you cover in your writing .
It 's easier to gain a prospective client 's trust when you have the credibility of being a published author .
Prospects who trust you are more likely to make a purchase .
4. Receptive audience
The people who receive the ezines containing your articles have subscribed because they 're interested in that particular ezine 's topics .
Thus , your article and business information are being delivered to people who have voluntarily pre-selected themselves to receive the sort of information about which you write .
Compound this benefit by submitting each of your articles to several ezines .
5. Exposure
When your article is sent out to a publisher 's list , it 's an excellent result of your efforts .
In addition , many publishers place articles from the current issue on their homepage , and then archive the articles .
Visitors often refer to the archives before deciding whether to subscribe , and so the exposure you receive from each article extends beyond the initial publication date .
6. Leverage
You have content that you can leverage when you write articles .
Whatever you write can be used for multiple purposes .
For example , develop an article into a seminar presentation , and expand the material to make an ebook .
At the very least , publish the article on your own website .
Search engines look favourably on new content .
7. Viral marketing
Allow ezine publishers to include your articles in their free ebooks , as long as your resource box is included .
Since these are being given away , your ad multiplies .
Also , submitting articles to publishers that have a free content directory on their site will allow visitors to republish your article intact , again multiplying your exposure .
Conclusion :
If you could benefit from any of these seven reasons for writing articles , then the time for action has arrived .
Go to any search engine , and type in a phrase like �ezine publishers� .
You could narrow the search by including the topics you 'd write and include the word free .
Once you 've found some publishers , and you know there 's an audience out there for your subject , write your first article .
Be sure to proof - read your finished article ; your intention is to establish credibility , and to brand your business .
A well - written and polished piece will help you accomplish a favourable result .
Once you 've gotten your first article published , go ahead and do it again , continuing to spread the word about you and your business all over the Internet .
I hope you have learned a lot about ezine articles in this first part , now let 's move on to part two .
PART # 2 - Submit Your Article on a Regular Basis
When I do n't train consistently because of traveling or personal issues , I lose karate tournaments .
If you want to achieve your business goals online , you have to consistently write and submit articles .
You have to be in front of your audience on a regular basis .
Otherwise you will lose sales to your competitors .
How do you do that ?
This tip might help you :
It 's simple and you 've probably heard it before .
Plan !
The most effective way of getting everything things done is by first ; making a list of the things that you need to get done .
The second step is organizing the list chronologically " when you will do it " .
Writing your daily ( weekly , monthly ... etc ) tasks down is a powerful key to success and relieving stress .
Guru David
Allen teaches that a trustworthy agenda will let your mind rest and not cling to each thing that you have to do - this definitely eliminates stress .
Well , let 's get started right now .
PART # 3 - Manage Through The Ups and Downs
Not every article you write and submit online will be a success .
You will have ups and downs with your article marketing efforts , but you have to keep writing consistently .
It 's the only way you will win in the long term .
The following tips may help you to write better articles :
On the Internet �content is king� , and the real guts of content is the written word .
If you are managing a website you need readable text for your onsite articles , for articles in your promotional newsletter or ezine and for promotional articles to be published on other sites or in other ezines .
While these writing tasks can be outsourced to professionals , it is also possible for you to do it yourself if you follow a step - by - step process that is outlined in the following ten tips .
1 . In the first paragraph clearly state what the article is about .
In standard journalism you would tell who , what , why , when and where an event is happening .
In web articles you oftentimes state a problem , such as �how to get good written materials for your website� , and then explain how the article is going to solve the problem �by showing a simple step - by - step approach to writing� .
2. Organize your material in a point - wise fashion .
Before you begin writing think of the points that your article is going to cover .
You may not necessarily show the points , as I am doing in this article ( calling them ten tips ) , however , for your own outline of the article you should know what you are going to say before you begin writing .
Write down these points and then make sure you include them as you begin the writing process .
3 . Put the reader at ease .
You are not writing for a scientific or literary society , but to your peers on the Internet .
Write in a simple style and if you introduce new terms , define them for your readers .
4. Explain your points in short paragraphs .
Short paragraphs are easier for the reader to follow .
No one likes to look at a long block of solid text .
Three , four or five sentences are usually enough for one paragraph .
5 . Don�t be afraid to spill all the beans !
Tell your trade secrets !
No , I am not crazy , the more you tell , the more the demand you will create for your goods and services .
I once hesitated to write an article on � Tips for Writing Meta Tags � ( http://www.a1-optimization.com/optimization-tips-2.htm) thinking , who will need my search engine optimization services if they read the article ?
I was wrong , the article was widely published and generated several orders for my services .
If you give more information , people will understand that you really are an authority on the subject that you are speaking about .
6 . Give concrete examples and personal experiences to back up your points .
Tell how you faced a problem and how you solved it .
Or give hypothetical examples of the California Widget Company and how its website would , for example need a title tag of � Widgets : electronic widgets from the California Widget Company �
7. Emphasize the benefits of your product or service .
When it comes to selling , it is the benefits that sell , rather than the features .
Sure , you are selling garden supplies , home d�cor , clothing , gifts and jewelry on your website .
These are features .
But the benefits are that people can get these items in one place without shopping around , that they can save time and money , etc .
The gurus of Internet marketing , such as Ken Evoy ( http://myws.sitesell.com/webpromote2.html) all say that you should constantly mention the benefits that you offer to your potential customer .
8. Give resource information to your readers .
Give the addresses of websites where your readers can get more information on the subject that you are talking about .
These may be your own websites or they can be other resources .
In case you are worrying about losing customers , good outgoing links from your website are also helpful to your site�s page ranking and positioning in search engines .
9 . Get another opinion on your article .
Show it to your friends and colleagues , and don�t worry if they criticize you , it is better that your friends find the mistakes than your clientele .
Always remember , a good editor is a writer�s best friend
10 .
Keep your most important information near the beginning of the article and summarize what you want to say at the end .
Editors usually cut things near the end , so keep your most important points and ideas in the beginning of the article .
At the very end of the article you can summarize what you set out to accomplish in your opening paragraph .
You may not win a literary prize , but if you follow the steps that I have outlined above you will be able to produce effective written content for your website and for your promotional outreach via your own newsletters and through articles published on other websites .
These articles could become the key to success in your Internet endeavors .
PART # 4 - Simple Does n't Mean Easy
It took me a long time to become successful at article marketing , and I am still not really ' rolling in the dough . '
However I learned that there are no obstacles that I could n't beat if I consistently persevere .
How many of us secretly wish our success would be handed to us on a silver platter ?
Well , unless you 're investing in hyips and get lucky , Get real .
There is work involved .
The solution is to make the hard work fun by doing what you love to do ( sharing your expertise ) and delegating what you do n't ( the mind boggling , manual article submission . )
PART # 5 - Model Others That Have Succeeded
Find someone who 's already been successful at article marketing .
You will find that individual adapts his or her techniques , forms and strategies to continually improve his success .
When writing your articles , model article templates that work for others and then adapt it to your own writing style .
PART # 6 - Diversify Your Content
Aricle marketing is a great technique for promotion , seo , and other benefits .
However , it 's only one tactic to be used as part of a comprehensive online marketing campaign .
You can easily turn your articles into products like blog posts , white papers , eBooks , and podcasts .
For example , I could turn this GOD LONG article into an entire ebook !
But instead , I wanted to share it with you here at DTM .
PART # 7 - Use the Right Tools
If you 're serious about article marketing , then consider the many tools ( free and paid ) for writing and or distributing your articles .
I used to spend about 5 - 6 hours submitting articles to directories and can now achieve the same outcome in as little as 30 minutes .
I personally do not use an article submitter , since I only submit to one directory .
PART # 8 - Keywords
You need keywords in your articles .
Here are some tips to do so .
Determining keywords is a critical step in writing articles online for effective public relations strategy .
If your articles , blog , eZine , or website do not contain related keywords , surfers will be unable to find your articles when they conduct searches .
According to Sharon Housley the formula is a little tricky - you will need to locate terms that are popular and relevant to your article .
" These terms may or may not be terms that * you * feel are relevant terms , " she says .
The optimal terms in an article should be terms that a potential customer would use when searching for an article with your content that relates to your area of expertise .
In order to achieve success your article should be optimized with terms and phrases that are descriptive , related to your content , and which receive a significant amount of searches .
" The caveat , of course , is that you want to find terms and phrases where there is little competition , so you quickly achieve high ranking in the important search engines , " according to Housley .
She gives this great formula : relevant + popular with searchers but not with competitors = success
" Markets saturated with other sites competing for search terms make it difficult to find quality keywords .
Sometimes it is better to optimize for a less popular term , one that is more targeted at your visitor , as it will likely have a higher conversion rate than a less specific popular term , " she believes .
So how do you go about it ?
Here are 6 easy steps :
Step 1 : Brainstorm a list of logical terms and phrases that relate to your area of expertise , product or offerings .
This should be done by a number of individuals ; sometimes people have very different ideas for search terms and by identifying a variety of people and their search terms you may tap words that had n't occurred to you .
Step 2 : Use free and low - cost tools available online and for download to allow you to expand and research terms that have been brainstormed .
The results typically vary with the tools but overall the tools will assist you in determining where to focus your keyword efforts .
The tools will often assist with pay - per - click engines , creating expanded , related keywords or phrases that can be bid on .

Google Suggestion - The Google Suggestion is a new online tool for webmasters .
As you type into the search box , Google Suggest guesses what you 're typing and offers suggestions in real time .
This is similar to Google 's " Did you mean ? " feature that offers alternative spellings for your query after you search , except that it works in real time .
For example , if you type " bass " , Google Suggest might offer a list of refinements that include " bass fishing " or " bass guitar " .
Similarly , if you type in only part of a word , like " progr , " Google Suggest might offer you refinements like " programming " , " programming languages " , " progesterone " , or " progressive " .
You can choose one by scrolling up or down the list with the arrow keys or mouse .
The tool provides a number that indicates the number of searches a specific word or phrase has had .
http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en
Step 3 : Examine your log files on your own website to see what terms customers are using to find an article or website ,
Step 4 : Visit competitors web sites and articles and examine their meta tags for additional terms ,
Step 5 : Use a thesaurus to find related terms , include misspellings of keywords in your keywords , and optimize for various forms of nouns and verbs , including tenses and plurals .
Step 6 : Measure your success .
Keyword statistics give Internet marketers a way to tap into what is on the minds of Internet consumers .
When you can match your marketing efforts to the various ways people locate their items of interest on the net , Housley says " potential customers will be streamed to your site like ants to a picnic " .
Also measure posts to your blog or new subscribers to your Ezine as other ways to measure how successful your effective public relations strategy has been .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Chastened leaders of the U.S. automobile industry agreed Thursday to accept strong oversight from Washington in return for the immediate government aid they say is needed to keep the industry alive past the new year .
After sending more detailed restructuring plans to Congress earlier this week , top corporate executives from General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC and the leader of the United Autoworkers union testified again to the committee Thursday about the companies ' request for an urgent bailout totaling $ 34 billion .
Top senators on the Senate Banking Committee were empathetic but wary of repeating the same mistakes they say they made when they handed hundreds of billions of dollars to banks without any strings attached .
Refusing the auto industry is not an option , said Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the committee .
Doing nothing would be playing " Russian roulette with the entire economy of the United States . "
General Motors GM , - 2.37 % and Chrysler say they need billions by the end of the year to avoid bankruptcy .
GM wants $ 4 billion immediately and $ 18 billion overall .
Privately owned Chrysler would like $ 7 billion by the end of the year .
The situation at Ford F , - 1.34 % is n't quite so desperate , but it is requesting $ 9 billion in loans just in case .
Read David Weidner on why Wall Street has given up on Detroit .
Senators from both parties said any assistance given to the struggling automakers must come with strict requirements that the companies reinvent themselves to become viable , profitable companies .
Executives of the three auto companies said they'd be willing to take orders from a government oversight board in exchange for $ 34 billion they say they need to avoid bankruptcy .
They said their companies are commited to fundamentally changing the way they do business .
" It would be very helpful for us , whether it 's a board or an individual , to have someone to work with on this , to submit our proposals and then for that person to say , ' OK , do n't agree with that .
You 've got to change this , ' " said GM CEO Richard Wagoner .
" And if that person was to have strong powers to execute it , that would be fine with us . "
Wagoner said his company 's plan " creates a blueprint for a new General Motors . "
Ford CEO Alan R. Mulally said his company will survive 2009 " barring a bankruptcy by one of our domestic competitors or a more severe economic downturn . "
What 's at stake
According to the industry , as many as 2.5 million jobs across the country could be at stake if one or more of the Big 3 is forced into bankruptcy .
The companies say customers would n't buy cars from a bankrupt automaker , and that could force hundreds of suppliers to also shut their doors .
The executives will testify at the House Financial Services Committee on Friday .
" I have my doubts " that the Big 3 can change enough to survive , said Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , ranking Republican on the committee .
Shelby said he opposed any loans to the auto companies .
" The strength of the American economic system is that it allows us to take risks , to create , to innovate , to grow , to succeed and sometimes to fail , " Shelby said .
Auto sales have cratered in recent months .
In November , sales fell to the lowest level in 26 years , and most companies reported declines of at least 30 % compared with a year ago .
See full story .
Dodd said the companies had " done far more " than the banks to prove they deserve the public 's money , but said the big question now is : " Will they be back here within weeks seeking more taxpayer assistance ? "
Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody 's Economy.com , testified that the companies would need $ 75 billion to $ 125 billion over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy .
He said allowing any of the Big 3 to fail would be " catastrophic . "
The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve already have the authority they need to keep the industry alive , said Gene Dodaro , acting comptroller general , agreeing with Dodd 's opinion that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson could authorize loans to the carmakers under the existing $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Dodaro heads the Government Accountability Office , the nonpartisan congressional auditing watchdog .
Paulson disagrees with Dodaro 's opinion , and has rejected the automakers ' request for TARP funds .
Congress could amend the TARP law to force Paulson to lend to the Big 3 , or it could appropriate additional funds .
Dodaro said the Federal Reserve also has authority under current law to lend money to the Big Three , if the Fed Board of Governors determined that the need is urgent and that the loans would be repaid .
However , the Fed has determined that it cannot lend to the companies because the loans cannot be collateralized as required , the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday .
The Fed made a similar determination with Lehman Bros. , which filed for bankruptcy in September .
Economist Zandi urged Congress to provide the $ 34 billion .
" Without any government help , the Big Three will quickly end up in bankruptcy and be effectively liquidated , resulting in hundreds of thousands of layoffs at just the wrong time for the sliding economy , " he said .
Keith Wendell , president of Johnston Controls JCI , - 1.15 % , warned that the bankruptcy of any of the Big 3 would devastate the supply chain .
" Should one of the Detroit 3 fail , a significant number of supplier failures would occur and become unmanageable , " he said .
These companies also supply parts to foreign automakers that assemble cars in the United States .
Stricter oversight urged
Dodaro urged the senators to establish an oversight board over the funds if they decide to grant the automakers ' request .
The board would oversee structural reforms and protect the taxpayers ' interests .
Dodd and Shelby said the Treasury had mismanaged the $ 700 billion financial bailout and has not protected the taxpayers ' interests or required the banks to change the way they do business .
Senators said stricter oversight would be essential in either an auto bailout or in disbursement of the second half of the $ 700 billion for the banks .
Instead of an oversight board , Congress should invest one person with oversight authority , said Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y .
The companies said on Tuesday they 'll restructure their companies , shift to more gas - efficient vehicles and eliminate jobs , factories , dealerships and car makes .
The union said Wednesday it would concede to reductions in severance pay to laid - off workers and to a delay in funding the trust that will operate the workers ' health - care plan .
See full story .
" We are willing to do our part , " said Ron Gettelfinger , president of the United Auto Workers .
If the executives are persuasive enough during the two days of hearings this week , the House and Senate could schedule a vote next week .
Passage in the House seems likely , but the vote in the Senate could be nail - biter , with approval by 60 of 100 senators needed .
Read David Callaway on why Congress will say yes .
Two weeks ago , the same industry and union leaders strode into Washington expecting quick approval of the loans .
However , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told the companies that the lawmakers had no idea about what the companies would do with the money .
The executives were told to go back to Detroit and return with a detailed plan .
The Bush administration and congressional leaders have said they favor some assistance to the automakers , but differ over the source of the funds and over the small print .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said it was too early to assess the companies ' restructuring plans .
She said the Bush administration continues to support giving the auto companies access to funds designated for energy efficiency .
Newswise —
The rhythm of life may beat far deeper than anyone previously thought .
And it may gyrate and pulse in a way that rivals the sensuous choreography of " Dirty Dancing . "
In his Newark laboratory , David Kaback , a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the UMDNJ - New Jersey Medical School , has captured the remarkable and never before seen undulations of " dancing chromosomes , " and his discovery may lead to way to prevent conditions like Down , Turner and Klinefelter 's syndrome as well as lend insight into the causes of first trimester spontaneous miscarriages .
In lectures to researchers and medical and graduate students , Kaback refers to his discovery as " Dirty Dancing , " which he also calls the " Mating Rites of Homologous Chromosomes . "
His work on the process of chromosome pairing has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and the journal Genetics and is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .
Kaback 's research focuses on meiosis , the specific type of division that takes place in sperm and egg cells .
When most cells divide , the result is two new cells , each with 23 pairs of chromosomes .
But during meiosis , sperm and egg cells are left with just 23 single chromosomes .
When a sperm and egg cell combine , the single chromosomes become pairs .
In his laboratory , Kaback attaches green fluorescent protein tags to the chromosomes in yeast cells , which undergo meiosis in a fashion similar to humans .
With the fluorescent tags activated , Kaback and his colleague Harry Scherthan from the Max Planck Institute and Bundeswahr Institute of Radiobiology in Germany are able to capture video of these chromosomes as they moved in spectacular fashion , first seemingly searching for each other during the process of pairing .
Once joined , the chromosome pairs continue to move rapidly around the cell nucleus , with some individual " maverick " chromosomes breaking out of the large pack of chromosomes , not unlike dancing lovers in an elaborately choreographed movie .
The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ( UMDNJ ) is the nation 's largest free - standing public health sciences university with more than 5,600 students attending the state 's three medical schools , its only dental school , a graduate school of biomedical sciences , a school of health related professions , a school of nursing and a school of public health on five campuses .
Annually , there are more than two million patient visits at UMDNJ facilities and faculty practices at campuses in Newark , New Brunswick / Piscataway , Scotch Plains , Camden and Stratford .
UMDNJ operates University Hospital , a Level I Trauma Center in Newark , and University Behavioral HealthCare , a statewide mental health and addiction services network .
It was back in the 1970s that feminist educational researchers first studied the implications of the tendency for girls to play with dolls , and for boys to play with cars .
They found that the way girls played developed their communication skills and emotional literacy , while boys ' toys encouraged them to grow up with better technical knowledge .
The arrival of the national curriculum in the 1980s , and the consequent improvements in the academic achievements of girls , rendered the theories linking toys and potential for learning as unfashionable , and perhaps irrelevant .
But new research suggests that the issue should be revisited because , it seems , there has never been greater gender stereotyping in the production and marketing of toys than now .
" People might think that toys are more androgynous these days , but go into any toy shop and you will find separate aisles , and even separate floors , for girls and boys , " says Becky Francis , professor of education at Roehampton University .
" The packaging is geared towards either boys or girls by colour , wording and the images portrayed on them .
This creates the impression that certain toys are just for boys and others just for girls , and so some toys are completely out of bounds . "
Francis 's study , Gender , Toys and Learning , funded by the Froebel Educational Institute , is thought to be the first in more than 20 years examining the educational value of toys and their impact on learning .
Francis asked the parents of more than 60 three - to five - year - olds what they perceived to be their child 's favourite toy .
( This age group was chosen because it is when children start being aware of gender differentiation in themselves , and in the toys they play with . )
She found that while parental choices for boys were characterised by toys that involved action , construction and machinery , there was a tendency to steer girls towards dolls and perceived " feminine " interests , such as hairdressing .
" The very clear message seems to be that boys should be making things , using their hands and solving problems , and girls should be caring and nurturing , " she says .
" It is likely that many of the boys in the study sleep with a teddy , but this was not noted by parents as a favourite toy . "
The parental preferences revealed in Francis 's study come as no surprise to Diane Daniels , who runs a nursery for three - and four - year - olds in Sheerness , Kent .
" Even very young children come to us with preconceived stereotyped ideas about what they should be playing with , and certainly we know of dads who would not dream of their sons dressing up because they think this is something girls do , " Daniels says .
" They want them to play with cars and other masculine toys .
" We spent a lot of time making sure our pupils do activities that involve a full range of toys , regardless of whether they are for boys or girls , but it can be hard .
It does n't always work as we would wish because parents are the first educators and so have already exerted a lot of influence over the way their children play .
" It is noticeable that girls are terribly ' pink ' at the moment .
Everything geared towards them seems to be pink . "
These early play preferences may not only be the result of socialisation and marketing , however .
A 2005 study looking at the play of young primates , by psychologist Professor Melissa Hines of Cambridge University , found that when offered a variety of toys , female monkeys tended to gravitate towards dolls and soft toys , while males chose toy cars .
" There are certainly genetic factors at work here , and we believe that children 's play preferences may be determined even pre-birth , " Hines says .
" The levels of male and female hormones in an expectant mother may result in children being born predisposed to certain play preferences . "
It is the impact of gender stereotypical play on children 's future subject preferences and job prospects that concerns Francis most .
" While girls have largely caught up with boys when it comes to achievement in maths and science , they are still less likely to be high achievers in these subjects or to study them beyond GCSE , " she says .
" At the same time , they outperform boys in literacy and humanities subjects .
Early play , I believe , has a crucial impact on these trends . "
Drawing on her findings , Francis purchased several of the items that her study found were most popular with the age group , and analysed them in detail for their potential for learning .
She found that , at best , girls ' toys - dolls and teddy bears - made for imaginative and creative play .
Only Baby Annabell , the lifelike doll , offered any kind of learning experience .
" Of the girls ' choices , " Francis says , " the learning potential was limited , and there was little that could be related to skills development that relates to the curriculum , although Baby Annabell provides well - developed information on the needs of a baby and how to meet those needs . "
The play choices for boys , however , were far more diverse and included cars , models of action heroes and popular television characters .
And while dolls and teddy bears were sold with little external packaging , that covering boys ' toys was " busy " , denoting action and speed with strong colours and wording that evoked excitement and machismo .
Instructions for use were often technical , requiring boys to draw on their literacy skills , and provided knowledge and activities around construction and technology .
" Boys are propelled into a world of action as well as technology , and their play is designed to be exciting and stimulating , " Francis says .
We tested her theory about the marketing and packaging of toys at Hamleys toy shop in London 's Regent Street .
The store directory on entry was helpfully colour - coded - floor 3 , highlighted in pink , was for girls , while floor 5 , blue , was for boys .
We stopped first to look at the pre-school ranges .
Toys aimed at babies and very small children had few , if any , gender - specific markings , and were produced in a range of soft , pastel - coloured fabrics and materials to appeal to both sexes .
This changes , however , in toys aimed at children aged 18 months onwards .
Vast swaths of blue - coloured boxes on the display shelves left shoppers in no doubt that these were aimed at boys .
But it was the toys for very young girls that were perhaps the most intriguing .
Even Dora the Explorer , the feisty adventurer who is used to crossing forests and crocodile - infested lakes , could not escape being stereotyped .
In one boxed set she is presented in a nurturing role , as an " older sister " clutching a baby 's feeding bottle , and with two younger siblings in tow .
" This is a classic example of how the toy manifestation of the cartoon character is more gender - stereotyped than the cartoon or show in which they appear , " Francis says .
" Boys who enjoy Dora as a cartoon are unlikely to want to play with her mother - like doll .
" Toy companies are aware of gendered consumer preferences , and develop and market their toys to these trends , so closing down broader options and perpetuating the gendered toy market . "
As might be expected , the girls ' floor at Hamleys is an array of pink packaging and cuddly toys , with a dressing - up section of fairy costumes and sparkly outfits .
There is little to encourage boys to explore here .
On the 4th floor , designated as being for " hobbies " and packed with construction kits , models of action heroes and radio - controlled cars , we ask a shop assistant to point us to the resources for girls .
" Like what ? " he asks - which seems to say it all - before sending us back to the third floor with an assurance that that is where we 'll find " arts and crafts stuff " .
" Toy shops are almost entirely for boys , " Francis says .
" There is little for girls , and even less that can be considered to have educational value . "
Matt Webb , head of marketing at Hamleys , says children are savvy consumers and there is a tendency for boys and girls to gender stereotype themselves in their play , often through peer pressure .
" When it comes to packaging and merchandising , this is really done for the convenience of parents and children , so they know where to go to find what they are looking for , " he says .
" We stock thousands of items , so it makes sense to give people some direction as to where they can find what they want , and to package them appropriately .
This is n't intended in any way to say to people , ' This toy is n't for you . '
There is nothing to stop boys and girls playing with each other 's toys , and this is something we would encourage . "
But Sue Palmer , an early years literacy consultant and author of Toxic Childhood : How the Modern World is Damaging Our Children and What We Can Do About
It , says toy manufacturers are cornering children into gender roles from a very early age .
" Pink is absolutely endemic for girls , " she says .
" Big business is sending out a message to girls and boys about how they should behave .
Instead of capitalising on the best characteristics of toys for boys and girls , and encouraging children to explore with both , we are all quietly colluding by buying these items . "
Professor Jeffrey Goldstein , chair of the National Toy Council , disagrees that it is the fault of manufacturers and marketing .
The organisation monitors trends in toy manufacture and use .
" Parents tend to have traditional attitudes about the gender roles of their children , " he says , " and where buying toys is concerned , they tread the path of least resistance .
" Of course , it is preferable that children are exposed to a wide range of play experiences , because this opens up the world around them , but this is not something we can control or legislate for . "
Several toy manufacturers , including Tomy and Fisher Price , failed to return our calls on the issue .
Melissa Wallace , PR and promotions manager at Lego , admits its core market is currently boys aged five to nine .
However , she says , Lego produces a range for girls , called Belville , with sets containing themes such as " horse jumping " and " royal summer palace " , as well as offering much to interest them in its unisex range .
" Our toys stimulate creativity in both boys and girls , and help to develop hand - eye coordination and motor skills , colour recognition , patience and self - esteem , " says Wallace .
" Girls enjoy playing with Lego , but in a different way to boys . "
She adds that Lego will be exploring new avenues and markets next year - " of which girls may be one " .

WASHINGTON 
The departments of Defense , State , and Health and Human Services have not met legal requirements meant to protect Americans ' civil liberties , and a board that 's supposed to enforce the mandates has been dormant since 2007 , according to federal records .
All three departments have failed to comply with a 2007 law directing them to appoint civil liberties protection officers and report regularly to Congress on the safeguards they use to make sure their programs do n't undermine the public 's rights and privacy , a USA TODAY review of congressional filings shows .
NEW JOB : Ex -ACLU lawyer settles into government role
An independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board set up to monitor the departments has n't met publicly since 2006 ; it no longer has members .
Government missteps such as putting innocent people on terrorist watch lists and misusing administrative warrants , known as national security letters , " might have been dealt with much sooner if we had … cops on the beat to make sure there are standards that are being upheld , " says Caroline Fredrickson , legislative director at the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
The lack of civil liberties officers at State and Health and Human Services is troubling because the departments hold passport and medical records , says James Dempsey , vice president of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" Security of that information is very important , " he says , and these officers should monitor how it 's used and shared .
The Pentagon also has sparked concerns .
Its Counterintelligence Field Activity office was criticized by the ACLU for wrongly tracking anti-war groups — a charge confirmed by the Pentagon in 2006 .
A 2007 law requires eight departments and agencies to have civil liberties officers and file reports .
Justice , Homeland Security , Treasury , the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have done so .
Sens. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , and Susan Collins , R- Maine , leaders of the Homeland Security committee , says departments not in compliance will be held accountable .
Collins says someone must be " tasked with ensuring that agency policies take into account privacy and civil liberties concerns . "
President Obama vowed after his election to give the oversight board subpoena power and make sure agencies meet civil liberties rules .
The board was set up as a White House office in 2004 , but Congress ordered in 2007 that it be revamped as an independent agency by last January .
President Bush did n't nominate new members until August ; none was confirmed .
State and Health and Human Services pledged in statements to work in the new administration to satisfy the law .
A Pentagon statement said its offices already safeguard civil liberties .

Nate Florence of We Are CHANGE Rhode Island ( RIChange.org ) met briefly with former NBC Anchor and journalist , Tom Brokaw , following a speech he delivered at Brown University on April 21 , 2008 .
Nate asked a few short questions regarding 9/11 Truth , to which Brokaw responded .
His vague answers may have indicated a desire to speak out .
However , his dismissal of the outright refusal of the current administration , and of the mainstream media , to adequately investigate questions asked by the victims ’ families regarding what truly happened on that day and in the days after is reprehensible .
Please ask Mr. Brokaw what he meant by these statements when he visits your area , and urge him to lend his voice to this movement .

HONG KONG
GARY CHANG stood in the middle of his apartment on a recent Saturday morning , ignoring a message from his Nintendo Wii on the wall - size screen : “ Are you fidgeting ?
I ca n’t seem to analyze you . ”
He repositioned the game system ’s balance board , stepped on for a second run of downhill skiing and began to shift from side to side , a computer - generated figure swishing in time with him across the room .
Soon enough , having worked up an appetite , he was ready to move on .
He used a remote control to raise the screen , revealing a large yellow - tinted window behind it , filling the room with radiance .
“ Like sunshine , ” Mr. Chang said , though the colorized gray daylight made the view  a forest of apartment towers in Hong Kong ’s bustling working - class Sai Wan
Ho district  look dusky , like an old sepia print .
He grabbed a handle near the wall - mounted television , pulling a section of the wall itself toward the center of the room .
Behind it , a small countertop with two burners , a sink and a spice rack appeared .
Opposite the countertop , on the back of the now - displaced wall , he lowered a hinged worktop made of a lightweight laminate of honeycombed aluminum .
Suddenly , he was standing in a kitchen .
Image A floor plan of the dining area .
This room  the “ maximum kitchen , ” he calls it  and the “ video game room ” he was sitting in minutes before are just 2 of at least 24 different layouts that Mr. Chang , an architect , can impose on his 344 - square - foot apartment , which he renovated last year .
What appears to be an open - plan studio actually contains many rooms , because of sliding wall units , fold - down tables and chairs , and the habitual kinesis of a resident in a small space .
As Mr. Chang put it , “ I glide around . ”
Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon says he is alarmed by reports that thousands of Royal Australian Navy sailors could have been exposed to cancer - causing asbestos .
A risk assessment report prepared by a Defence contractor has found thousands of sailors could have been exposed to chrysotile asbestos in spare parts held in naval stores .
The use and importation of asbestos - containing materials was made illegal in Australia in 2001 , but the Navy has been granted several waivers and exemptions .
Mr Fitzgibbon says that is coming to an end .
" I 'm alarmed by the report .
I 'm alarmed by what I 've been seeing in terms of the culture within Defence since I came to Government a year ago , " he said .
" I 've told Defence that we will not stand for it and I expect the problem to be fixed , notwithstanding the fact that it 's likely to cost Defence a lot of money . "
Mr Fitzgibbon says the Navy has until next year to eradicate the parts which contain asbestos .
U.S. politicians have reportedly agreed on a plan to provide a $ 15 billion US emergency loan to the country 's beleaguered automakers , although it 's less than half the amount of bailout funds the Big Three car companies were seeking .
The White House and congressional Democrats reached an agreement in Washington , D.C. , late Friday night , a senior congressional aide told Reuters .
Another source said that negotiators had " agreed in principle to moving ahead but details have to be worked out . "
The breakthrough was said to have been made after the Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , caved to a condition set by U.S. President George W. Bush that the money come from a $ 25 - billion Energy Department fund , according to officials from both the Republican and Democratic parties .
That fund provides advanced energy technology loans to assist auto companies produce more fuel - efficient cars .
Pelosi had previously demanded the aid come from the $ 700 billion fund created to rescue U.S. financial institutions — a proposal the Bush administration flatly rejected .
In a statement issued Friday , Pelosi suggested she could agree to using Energy Department funds under certain conditions .
" We will not permit any funds to be borrowed from the advanced technology program unless there is a guarantee that those funds will be replenished in a matter of weeks so as not to delay that crucial initiative , " Pelosi said .
In a separate statement , Pelosi said bailout legislation will include " rigorous and ongoing oversight to guarantee that taxpayers are protected and that resources are directed to ensure the long - term viability and competitiveness of the American automobile industry . "
The terms of the aid will include the establishment of a trustee or overseer group to ensure the money is used properly to stave off collapse , according to officials from both parties .
Specific details on the conditions of the bailout loan , however , are still being worked out , likely over the weekend , a source told Reuters .
Many hurdles still to cross
Once it is settled , the automaker assistance plan would require the approval of both houses of Congress .
Votes in the House of Representatives , as well as the Senate , are expected next week , Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in separate statements .
If they pass quickly , the bill could be signed into law by Bush before president - elect Barack Obama takes office .
Democrats , however , said Pelosi 's intention was to have the aid built into an economic recovery bill that lawmakers are expected to prepare for Obama 's approval once he takes office in January .
The $ 15 - billion agreement is less than half of the $ 34 billion auto executives from the Big Three — General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC — requested of Congress this week .
It comes on the same day U.S. data showed employers cut more than 533,000 jobs in November , the biggest monthly loss in 34 years .
" I think it 's fair to say that the jobs report today , this disastrous jobs report , has heightened the interest in doing something , " said Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank , a senior House Democrat .
Both GM and Chrysler have warned of imminent collapse in the absence of government assistance .
The bailout funds are expected to last until March , at which point Obama 's administration will have to decide how to proceed .
President expresses concern
Earlier Friday , Bush expressed deep concern for the fate of the country 's auto giants .
" I am concerned about the viability of the automobile companies , " Bush said .
" I 'm concerned about those who work for the automobile companies and their families .
And likewise , I am concerned about taxpayer money being provided to those companies that may not survive . "
Thousands of employees have been laid off by the automakers in both Canada and the U.S. as they deal with slumping car sales .
The Canadian subsidiaries of GM , Ford and Chrysler on Friday asked the federal and Ontario governments for financial aid that could total as much as $ 6 billion .
The requests were made as the companies provided financial information and details of their restructuring plans that the governments had asked for in return for considering a potential aid package .
Software developers generally use one of three ways to alert and deliver version updates to users : a pop-up prompt when you launch the app , a systemwide refresh tool -- like the App Store for the iPhone and Firefox 's add - on framework -- or nothing at all ( they just hope the user checks their website at some point ) .
But then there 's a fourth option -- one perhaps even worse than the " not tell you " approach .
That 's the standalone program , installed by a company , that looks for all updates to its suite of software .
We see this only in a few cases , when a development house has the audacity to assume you use so much of its software that you need an entirely separate program just to check for bug fixes .
As Google 's recent use of this shows , the execution can be anything but sweet .
For the record , I have no problem with Apple 's Software Update app for the Mac or Microsoft 's Windows Update on PCs .
Obviously , if you 're using a Mac , you have a great deal of Apple software and vice versa .
But Microsoft's AutoUpdate for Mac oversteps the operating system boundary .
AutoUpdate latches on to a system after you install Microsoft Office and will periodically check for updates to those programs .
Companies like this method because it keeps users informed about whatever tweaks the developer wants to throw at them .
( Fortunately , AutoUpdate allows you to disable it in its preferences . )
Google has jumped on the bandwagon , too -- or rather , sneaked onto the wagon with ninja - like furtiveness .
Like AutoUpdate , Google Software Update checks for new versions of Google software in the background , and it pops up a window when it finds something .
I saw it for the first time today .
There I was , composing e-mails , and then , out of nowhere , an alert for ...
Michael Steele served as lieutenant governor of Maryland from 2003 to 2007 and is currently a candidate for chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Michael Steele : Down , not dead
Sure , Republicans have had a hard couple of elections .
But you ’ll excuse me for suggesting that reports of our death have been more than a little exaggerated .
In fact , the electorate shifted only about 4 points from Republicans to Democrats since 2004 .
That year , George W. Bush took 48 percent of the vote against Barack Obama ’s approximately 52 percent in this election .
Now , do n’t get me wrong , that 4 - point shift produced the best vote tally for a national Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson .

But the admittedly major defeat for the home team that resulted from a mere 4 - point shift need not send Republicans to the locker room just yet .
The fact is that despite dire predictions to the contrary , turnout in 2008 was about the same as it was in 2004 .
The real problem was that Republican turn - out pitched down while Democrat turnout surged .
We can get those votes back and then some .
But we have both strategic and tactical improvements to make .
Return to timeless Republican principles .
And include a positive , optimistic message that envisions a new , stronger , more prosperous American future .
Ronald Reagan spoke to our deepest longing as a people .
He gave a voice to principles that are true for all people in all times .
Retool our message , but base it on those proven conservative principles for which our party has always stood :
Our freedom is from God , not government .
Our prosperity comes from a free people in a free market , not overtaxing , free - spending bureaucrats .
We celebrate and protect life , born and unborn .
And our best hope for a brighter future is in the empowerment of individuals and families , not in the constraints imposed by a bloated bureaucracy .
Organize in every state .
Our successes are mostly centered in Appalachia , the South and the Great Plains .
We ’ve been nearly completely shut out in New England , and we ’re only slightly better off in the mid-Atlantic .
Things do n’t look any better in the Rust Belt or the West Coast either .
Democrats have done a great job of outworking us in these areas .
We need a new approach that assures Republicans play in every state ; take nothing for granted .
We may not win everywhere we play , but we certainly wo n’t win if we do n’t play everywhere we can .
Appeal to the forgotten middle class .
Obama beat us in the cities , suburbs and exurbs .
We beat him in the rural areas .
Our message of economic growth , lower taxes , more accountability in education , personal responsibility and fiscal restraint will appeal , but we have to refine it and do a lot better job of getting it out .
Build a broader coalition .
Obama ’s coalition consisted of a broad cross-section of Americans .
Young voters went for Obama 68 percent to 30 percent .
He beat us among Hispanics by a 2 - 1 ratio .
He won the votes of Asians , women , African - Americans and seniors .
This does n’t have to be the case .
We have the message , but we have to improve our credibility with these voters .
Stop the blame game .
We have to stop trying to lay blame for our losses .
It ’s embarrassing to see what unnamed McCain aides are saying about Sarah Palin .
Worse , it ’s not fair , relevant or productive .
Instead , we have to recognize we have all contributed to the problem and it will take us all — working together — to repair it .
Use new communication tools .
Not only was our message stale , the means by which we ’ve conveyed our message has been lackluster — at best .
Television advertising is great , but it ’s not enough in this new age of Facebook , YouTube , bloggers and Twitter .
In addition to updating our message , we have to update the means by which we communicate it .
The Republican Party needs an overhaul not just an adjustment if we ’re to create a new Republican majority .
Once again , we need to speak directly to the hopes , concerns and aspirations of Americans .
So let ’s stop telling Americans what we ’re against and instead articulate a compelling vision of what we ’re for , how we ’ll lead and where we want to go .
And we need to do it in a far more powerful , relevant and credible way .
The result of this election gives us the chance to take a step back , reassess , re-engineer and figure out how to do that .
And that ’s good news .

Amazon has a plan to make revolutionary computing tools available to researchers everywhere by hosting massive amounts of public data on its servers .
As of Thursday , the annotated human genome , US Census data , and countless 3D renderings of molecules are available on the elastic servers .
And users can upload their own boatload of information , without a fee .
But there is a catch :
If you want to crunch numbers on their server , or store the output there , it will not be free .
Although the company will charge for its services , it seems committed to making them available to anyone with an internet connection , even scientists who operate on a shoestring budget .
" For over five years AWS has been working to lower the barriers to entry , level the playing field , and make it possible for our customers to be successful based on their ideas , not on their resources , " Adam Selipsky of Amazon said in a press release .
" Public Data Sets on AWS is the latest of these efforts , and we can't wait to see the discoveries and innovations that could stem from this ecosystem . "
So far , that ecosystem seems to be populated by the elite , rather than the unwashed masses .
Amazon detracted from its righteous message by providing this endorsement from one of their not - so - underprivileged early adopters .
" Public Data Sets on AWS will enable me and many of my colleagues to collaborate with each other by sharing our commonly used data sets , research environments and tools , " Peter Tonellato of Harvard Medical School said in the press release .
" We can set up a controlled environment in minutes , run our computational analysis for a couple of hours , and shut down the environment .
Our results are completely repeatable .
I only pay for the compute time I use , and more importantly I can spend more time focusing on research , not downloading and setting up computational infrastructure . "
If the cost of the service were high , it would seem that Amazon 's goal is to sound noble while cornering an emerging market — selling processor cycles to wealthy universities .
But they appear to be reasonable .
If the company does have an ulterior motive , it may simply be to experiment with and propagate its ideas about cloud computing .
Some experts have dismissed the new brand of information technology as a trend , others can't seem to figure out what it is , but one thing is certain : Researchers are accumulating data at an incredible pace , and they will need versatile web - based tools to do their work .
For that reason , Amazon could have another lucrative business soon .

BEER -SHE­VA , Israel – On Sat­ur­day , Dec. 27 , the war began .
The first bom­bard­ment took 3 min­utes and 40 sec­onds .
Six­ty Israeli F‑16 fight­er jets bombed 50 sites in Gaza , killing more than 200 Pales­tini­ans , and wound­ing close to 1,000 more .
A few hours after the dead­ly strike , Israeli
Despite the ever - increasing loss of Palestinian life , Israel remains the perpetual victim in the collective self - image .
Regardless of what happens , we Israelis are presented as the moral players in this conflict .
Prime Min­is­ter Ehud Olmert con­vened a press con­fer­ence in Tel Aviv .
With For­eign Min­is­ter Tzipi Livni sit­ting on his right and Defense Min­is­ter Ehud Barak on his left , Olmert declared : ​ “ It may take time , and each and every one of us must be patient so we can com­plete the mission . ”
But what , exact­ly , is Israel ’s mission ?
Although Olmert did not say it direct­ly , the ​ “ mis­sion ” includes four objectives .
The first is the destruc­tion of Hamas , a total­ly unre­al­is­tic goal .
Even though the loss of hun­dreds of cadres and some key lead­ers will no doubt hurt the orga­ni­za­tion , Hamas is a robust polit­i­cal move­ment with wide­spread grass­roots sup­port , and it is unlike­ly to sur­ren­der or capit­u­late to Israeli demands fol­low­ing a mil­i­tary assault .
Iron­i­cal­ly , Israel ’s attempt to destroy Hamas using force has always strength­ened the orga­ni­za­tion in the end , thus cor­rob­o­rat­ing the notion that pow­er pro­duces its own vulnerability .
The sec­ond objec­tive has to do with Israel ’s Feb. 10 elec­tions .
The assault on Gaza is also being car­ried out to help the Kadi­ma and Labor Par­ties defeat the con­ser­v­a­tive Likud and its leader Ben­jamin Netanyahu , who was ahead in the polls until the war began .
Whether the dev­as­ta­tion in Gaza will help Livni defeat Netanyahu or help Barak gain votes is dif­fi­cult to say , but the strat­e­gy of com­pet­ing with a war­mon­ger like Netanyahu by beat­ing the drums of war says a great deal about the three major contenders .
The third objec­tive involves the Israeli mil­i­tary .
After its notable humil­i­a­tion in Lebanon in 2006 , the Israel Defense Forces has been look­ing to re-estab­lish its rep­u­ta­tion .
Last spring , it used Syr­ia as its lab­o­ra­to­ry and now it has decid­ed to focus on Gaza .
Final­ly , Hamas and Fatah have not yet reached an agree­ment on how to pro­ceed when Mah­moud Abbas ends his term as pres­i­dent of the Pales­tin­ian Nation­al Author­i­ty on Jan .
9 .
One of the out­comes of this assault is that Abbas will remain in pow­er a while longer because Hamas will be unable to mobi­lize sup­port­ers to force him to resign .
What is miss­ing from this list of Israeli objec­tives is the attempt to halt the fir­ing of rock­ets into Israel ’s south­ern towns .
Unlike the above four objec­tives , the gov­ern­ment presents this one as the operation ’s pri­ma­ry objec­tive , which is mis­lead­ing because Israel could have put an end to the rock­ets a long time ago .
Dur­ing the six - month Israel - Hamas truce that end­ed Dec. 19 , there was rel­a­tive qui­et – a qui­et bro­ken most often as a reac­tion to Israeli vio­lence , such as the Nov. 4 bomb­ing of tar­gets in Gaza or the impo­si­tion of a total block­ade that pre­vent­ed basic goods , like food­stuff and med­i­cine , from enter­ing the Gaza Strip .
Rather than con­tin­ue the truce , which would have stopped the rock­et attacks , the Israeli gov­ern­ment has again cho­sen to adopt strate­gies of vio­lence that are akin to the ones deployed by Hamas .
Only , the Israeli ones are much more lethal .
The log­i­cal fallacy
More than 90 per­cent of Jew­ish Israelis sup­port the assault on Gaza .
They say to them­selves that Israel with­drew from the Gaza Strip three years ago , and that despite the with­draw­al , Hamas has been shoot­ing rock­ets at us .
This expla­na­tion seems log­i­cal , yet it elides some cru­cial facts .
One fact is that Israel main­tains sov­er­eign­ty over the Gaza Strip , despite the with­draw­al .
Anoth­er fact is that the Pales­tini­ans have been liv­ing in a cage .
Pales­tini­ans have not had access to basic food­stuff .
Their elec­tric­i­ty has been cut off , and many do n’t have access to clean water .
When one for­gets these facts , it is only ratio­nal to ask ​‘ Why are they still shoot­ing at us ? ’
This is pre­cise­ly what the media here has been pump­ing the pub­lic with .
By con­trast , if you look at what ’s been going on in the Gaza Strip in the past three years and you see what Israel has been doing to the Pales­tini­ans , you would think that the Pales­tin­ian resis­tance is ratio­nal .
And those are the facts miss­ing in the Israeli and U.S. main­stream media .
Under attack
I am not speak­ing from an arm­chair .
I know what it is like to be under rock­et attack .
For the past 10 days , my two chil­dren – Ariel , 4 , and Aviv , 9 months – have been sleep­ing in a bomb shelter .
After being stuck for 72 hours in Beer - She­va – locat­ed in the Negev Desert , 28 miles east of Gaza – my spouse Cather­ine and I decid­ed to vis­it my moth­er , who lives north , so that our chil­dren could play out­side dur­ing the week­end far away from the rockets .
Once there , I sat to watch TV with my moth­er , who like most Israelis is a devout news con­sumer .
For the most part , the broad­cast was more of the same images and voic­es of suf­fer­ing Israeli Jews , along with the pro­mul­ga­tion of a hyper - nation­al­ist ethos .
One news sto­ry , for exam­ple , fol­lowed a Jew­ish moth­er who had lost her son in Gaza about two years ago .
The audi­ence was told that the son has been a sol­dier and , with his brigade , had pen­e­trat­ed the Gaza Strip in an attempt to save the kid­napped sol­dier Gilad Shalit , who has been held hostage by Hamas since June 2006 .
“ Because mem­bers of his com­pa­ny did not want to hurt civil­ians , ” the moth­er said , ​ “ they refrained from open­ing fire in every direc­tion , which allowed Pales­tin­ian mili­ti­a­men to shoot my boy . ”
When the inter­view­er asked her about the cur­rent Gaza assault , she said , ​ “ We should pound and cut them from the air and from the sea , ” but added , ​“ We should not kill civil­ians , only Hamas . ”
The report end­ed with the inter­view­er ask­ing the moth­er what she does when she miss­es her son , and , as the cam­era zoomed in on her face , she answered : ​ “ I go into his room and hug his bed , because I can no longer hug him . ”
Thus , despite the ever - increas­ing loss of Pales­tin­ian life , Israel remains the per­pet­u­al vic­tim in the col­lec­tive self image .
Indeed , the last frame with the moth­er look­ing straight into the cam­era leaves the aver­age com­pas­sion­ate view­er – myself includ­ed – a bit choked up .
Over the past few years , how­ev­er , I have become a crit­i­cal con­sumer of Israeli news .
I can see how , regard­less of what hap­pens , we are pre­sent­ed as the moral play­ers in this con­flict .
There­fore , this kind of reportage – where the huge death toll in Gaza is ignored and Jew­ish suf­fer­ing is under­scored – no longer shocks me .
What did unnerve me in the broad­cast was one sen­tence from a reporter who cov­ered the entry of a human­i­tar­i­an aid con­voy into the Gaza Strip on Jan .
2 .
My moth­er and I – like oth­er Israeli view­ers – learned that 170 trucks sup­plied with basic food­stuff donat­ed by the Turk­ish gov­ern­ment entered Gaza through the Car­mi cross­ing , on the south­ern part of Gaza .
That the report had noth­ing to say about the con­text of this food ship­ment did not sur­prise me .
Nor was I sur­prised that no men­tion was made of the fact that 80 per­cent of Gaza ’s inhab­i­tants are unable to sup­port them­selves and are there­fore depen­dent on human­i­tar­i­an assis­tance – and this fig­ure is increas­ing dai­ly .
Indeed , noth­ing was said about the severe food cri­sis in Gaza , which man­i­fests itself in short­ages of flour , rice , sug­ar , dairy prod­ucts , milk and canned foods , or about the total lack of fuel for heat­ing hous­es and build­ings dur­ing these cold win­ter months , the absence of cook­ing gas and the short­age of run­ning water .
The view­er has no way of know­ing that the Pales­tin­ian health sys­tem is bare­ly func­tion­ing or that some 250,000 peo­ple in cen­tral and north­ern Gaza are now liv­ing with­out any elec­tric­i­ty at all due to the dam­age caused by the air strikes .
While the fact that this infor­ma­tion was miss­ing from the report did not sur­prise me , I found myself com­plete­ly tak­en aback by the way in which the reporter jus­ti­fied the convoy ’s entrance into Gaza .
Explain­ing to those view­ers who might be won­der­ing why Israel allows human­i­tar­i­an assis­tance to the oth­er side dur­ing times of war , he declared that if a full - blown human­i­tar­i­an cat­a­stro­phe were to explode among the Pales­tin­ian civil­ian pop­u­la­tion , the inter­na­tion­al com­mu­ni­ty would pres­sure Israel to stop the assault .
There is some­thing cyn­i­cal about how Israel explains its use of human­i­tar­i­an assis­tance , and yet such unadul­ter­at­ed expla­na­tions actu­al­ly help uncov­er an impor­tant facet of post­mod­ern war­fare .
Not unlike rais­ing ani­mals for slaugh­ter on a farm , the Israeli gov­ern­ment main­tains that it is pro­vid­ing Pales­tini­ans with assis­tance so that it can have a free hand in attack­ing them .
And just as Israel pro­vides basic food­stuff to Pales­tini­ans while it con­tin­ues shoot­ing them , it informs Pales­tini­ans – by phone , no less – that they must evac­u­ate their homes before F ‑16 fight­er jets begin bomb­ing them .
One notices , then , that in addi­tion to its remote - con­trol , com­put­er game - like qual­i­ties , post­mod­ern war­fare is also char­ac­ter­ized by a bizarre new moral ele­ment .
It is as if the mas­ters of wars real­ized that since cur­rent wars rarely take place between two armies and are often car­ried out in the midst of civil­ian pop­u­la­tions , a new just war the­o­ry is need­ed .
So these mas­ters of war gath­ered togeth­er philoso­phers and intel­lec­tu­als to devel­op a moral the­o­ry for post­mod­ern wars , and today , as Gaza is being destroyed , we can see quite plain­ly how the new the­o­ry is being trans­formed into praxis .
We have to say ​ ‘ no ’
This prax­is is scary .
Israel has been bomb­ing Gaza from the air and mas­sacring peo­ple .
As In These Times went to press , Israel had killed more than 750 Pales­tini­ans , includ­ing more than 200 chil­dren .
In order to stop this mad­ness we need two kinds of pres­sure : Israeli cit­i­zens must pres­sure the gov­ern­ment from below , while the inter­na­tion­al com­mu­ni­ty must pres­sure Israel from above .
As an Israeli cit­i­zen , I still believe in the impor­tance of democ­ra­cy and in the impor­tance of the Israeli peo­ple mak­ing a deci­sion .
But at this point in his­to­ry , we need help from con­cerned cit­i­zens in the glob­al are­na .
We need Amer­i­can cit­i­zens to pres­sure the incom­ing admin­is­tra­tion to raise its voice against the use of vio­lence .
Pres­i­dent Oba­ma has a major role to play but it is unclear that he will do it with­out pres­sure from with­in the Unit­ed States .
Oba­ma , it is impor­tant to keep in mind , has a cru­cial advan­tage over his pre­de­ces­sors .
Sev­er­al years of polit­i­cal nego­ti­a­tions – from the 1991 Madrid con­fer­ence , through Oslo , Camp David , Taba and Annapo­lis – along­side the pub­li­ca­tion of dif­fer­ent ini­tia­tives – from the Gene­va Ini­tia­tive and the Sau­di plan to the Nus­sai­ba and Ayalon plan – have clar­i­fied what it would take to reach a peace set­tle­ment between the war­ring sides .
The two - state solu­tion entails three cen­tral components :
1. Israel ’s full with­draw­al to the 1967 bor­der with pos­si­ble one - for - one land swaps so that ulti­mate­ly the total amount of land that was occu­pied will be returned .
2. Jerusalem ’s divi­sion accord­ing to the 1967 bor­ders with cer­tain land swaps to guar­an­tee that each side has con­trol over its own reli­gious sites and large neigh­bor­hoods .
Both these claus­es entail the dis­man­tle­ment of Israeli set­tle­ments and the return of the Jew­ish set­tlers to Israel .
3 . The acknowl­edg­ment of the right of return of all Pales­tini­ans but with the fol­low­ing stip­u­la­tion :
While all Pales­tini­ans will be able to return to the fledg­ling Pales­tin­ian state , only a lim­it­ed num­ber agreed upon by the two sides will be allowed to return to Israel ; those who can­not exer­cise this right or , alter­na­tive­ly , choose not to , will receive full compensation .
While the con­di­tions that need to be sat­is­fied in order to reach a peace agree­ment are well known and even though most polit­i­cal lead­ers under­stand that the only way to pro­vide real secu­ri­ty for the two peo­ples is by sign­ing a com­pre­hen­sive agree­ment , years of nego­ti­a­tions have pro­duced only lim­it­ed results .
The cru­el irony is that the major­i­ty of Israelis and Pales­tini­ans in the region sup­port the two - state solu­tion but , nonethe­less , the two par­ties can­not reach an agree­ment because siz­able minori­ties in both camps reject this solu­tion .
These minori­ties have man­aged to hijack the respec­tive polit­i­cal are­nas and have suc­ceed­ed in cre­at­ing a dead­lock that can only be over­come if the inter­na­tion­al com­mu­ni­ty , and par­tic­u­lar­ly the Unit­ed States , assumes a more inter­ven­tion­ist role .
With deter­mi­na­tion and polit­i­cal bold­ness , Oba­ma can neu­tral­ize the rejec­tion­ist minori­ties and resolve this bloody con­flict once and for all .
I believe that he can achieve this objec­tive if his admin­is­tra­tion adopts the fol­low­ing strategy :
• First , the White House needs to draft a pro­pos­al using the above­men­tioned guidelines .
• Sec­ond , the draft pro­pos­al should be sub­mit­ted to the two sides so that each one can sug­gest minor alterations .
• Third , the Oba­ma admin­is­tra­tion will have to ham­mer out a final pro­pos­al ( that is , the Oba­ma Plan ) .
Final­ly , this pro­pos­al should be pub­li­cized and brought to a ref­er­en­dum in both Israel and the Occu­pied Ter­ri­to­ries , with the Unit­ed States and inter­na­tion­al com­mu­ni­ty apply­ing pres­sure by declar­ing that the two par­ties will be reward­ed if they sup­port the ini­tia­tive and penal­ized if they do not .
Thus , the major­i­ty of the peo­ple on each side , and not the local lead­er­ship or a rejec­tion­ist minor­i­ty , will decide whether or not to accept the peace plan .
Obama ’s polit­i­cal vision has engen­dered hope , not only in the Unit­ed States , but as his appear­ance in Berlin and the post- elec­tion jubi­la­tions sug­gest , in the var­i­ous pop­u­la­tions of the world .
My expec­ta­tion is that he will make good on his promise for change and intro­duce a coura­geous ini­tia­tive that will bring peace to Israelis and Pales­tini­ans .
He has both an oppor­tu­ni­ty and a respon­si­bil­i­ty to do so .
Obama offers Iran olive branch during his first foreign TV interview as president ... on an Arab station
President Obama has offered an olive branch to Iran as long as it is ready to ' unclench its fist ' .
Breaking yet again with the policies of the Bush administration , Mr Obama said he was prepared to open peace talks with Tehran .
The potential nuclear threat from Iran is likely to pose one of the biggest tests for the new president and he underlined his determination to confront problems in the Middle East head - on by granting his first foreign TV interview since taking office to an Arab station .
See the full interview below
Plea : U.S. President Barack Obama assured the Muslim world that America is ' not their enemy ' in a TV interview with the al - Arabiya channel
And he made clear there would be a radical change in policy in dealing with Muslim countries , saying his envoys had been instructed to ' start by listening , because all too often the United States starts by dictating ' .
His broadcast came just before he headed to Capitol Hill yesterday to seek Republican support for his £ 515 billion plan to revive America ’s crippled economy .
Mr Obama took heavy flak during his election campaign over his pledge to open dialogue with Iran and other countries scorned by George Bush as sworn enemies of the US .
One of his most outspoken critics was former presidential rival Hillary Clinton , who will now be spearheading the new administration ’s more benign foreign policy as Secretary of State .
Speaking to the Dubai - based Al Arabiya network , Mr Obama insisted : ‘ It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran , to express very clearly where our differences are , but also where there are potential avenues for progress .
‘ If countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist , they will find an extended hand from us , ’ he added , echoing a line from his Inauguration Day address .
Mr Obama meets with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Middle East Envoy George Mitchell in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington yesterday
Britain , the US and other western powers have accused the Iranians of secretly building the capacity to make nuclear weapons .
But Tehran adamantly refuses to freeze a programme it says is limited to the peaceful production of electricity .
Mr Obama reached out to the Muslim world , saying : ‘ Americans are not your enemy .
' We sometimes make mistakes .
We are not perfect .
' But America was not born a colonial power and the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago , there ’s no reason why we ca n’t restore that . '
The president noted that he had Muslim relatives and lived in Indonesia , the world ’s most Islamic nation , as a child .
He spent much of his campaign trying to combat attempts to paint him as a Muslim because of his middle name of Hussein , even though he is a church - going Christian .
He urged Muslims to judge him by his actions , pointing to the decision to close Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
He said he also would begin to implement his pledge to withdraw troops from Iraq .

With his new Middle East envoy , former Northern Ireland peacemaker George Mitchell , already in Egypt on a fact - finding trip , Mr Obama reiterated his determination to help broker a solution to the conflict .
He said ‘ the moment is ripe ’ for both sides to return to the negotiating table .
But he said the world had to factor in the wider problems in the region .
‘ It is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what 's happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan , ’ he added .
In Washington yesterday , Mr Obama promised to hear out Republicans disenchanted with his latest bail out plan to pump hundreds of billions more of taxpayer money into public spending projects .
In his first visit to Congress since taking office , he was hoping to shore up bipartisan support on the eve of tomorrow ’s vote on the bill in the House of Representatives .
But analysts say he was likely to be disappointed unless he agreed to sweeten the pill with wider tax cuts to help Americans struggling to keep their homes and jobs in the deepening recession .
Mr Obama said Al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri are ' nervous ' now they no longer have George Bush as a recruiting tool .
He confidently said bin Laden 's ideas were ' bankrupt ' and pointed out they failed to offer Muslims hope .
President Obama added : ' In my inauguration speech , I spoke about : " You will be judged on what you 've built , not what you 've destroyed " .
' And what they 've been doing is destroying things .
And over time , I think the Muslim world has recognised that that path is leading no place , except more death and destruction .
' Now , my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well - being of the Muslim world , that the language we use has to be a language of respect .
I have Muslim members of my family .
I have lived in Muslim countries .
' What I want to communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world , what I 've come to understand is that regardless of your faith - and America is a country of Muslims , Jews , Christians , non-believers - regardless of your faith , people all have certain common hopes and common dreams .
As of two minutes ago , it appears you can now buy music from iTunes from your iPhone over EDGE and 3G , not just Wi -Fi .
Even better : all the music in the store appears to be DRM - free now .
I ’m guessing Phil Schiller will announce it later on in the keynote .
Maybe this is the “ one more thing ” ?
Update :
It ’s official .
Update 2 : During the keynote , Schiller specifically said music was now downloadable over “ 3G networks ” , but I was right — it works over EDGE too .

Yesterday 's press release : Israeli Navy Attacking Civilian Mercy Ship !
TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY !
The Dignity , a Free Gaza boat on a mission of mercy to besieged Gaza , is being attacked by the Israeli Navy in international waters .
The Dignity has been surrounded by at least half - a- dozen Israeli warships .
They are firing live ammunition around the Dignity , and one of the warships has rammed the civilian craft causing an unknown amount of damage .
Contrary to international maritime law , the Israelis are actively preventing the Dignity from approaching Gaza or finding safe haven in either Egypt or Lebanon .
Instead , the Israeli navy is demanding that the Dignity return to Cyprus - despite the fact that the ship does not carry enough fuel to do so .
Fortunately , no one aboard the ship has yet been seriously injured .
There are 15 civilian passengers representing 11 different countries ( see below for a complete list ) .
At approximately 5 am ( UST ) , well out in international waters , Israeli warships began surrounding the Dignity , threatening the ship .
At 6:45 am ( UST ) we were able to establish brief contact with the crew and were told that the ship had been rammed by the Israeli Navy in international waters , and that the Israelis were preventing the ship from finding safe harbor .
We heard heavy gunfire in the background before all contact was lost with the Dignity .
It is urgent that you TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION !CALL the Israeli Government and demand that it immediately STOP attacking the Dignity and endangering the lives of its passengers !
CALL Mark Regev in the Prime Minister 's office at :+972 2670 5354 or +972 5062 3264mark.regev@it.pmo.gov.il CALL
Shlomo Dror in the Ministry of Defence at :+972 33697 5339 or +972 50629 8148mediasar@mod.gov.il BACKGROUND
INFORMATIONThe
Dignity departed from Larnaca Port in Cyprus at 7 pm ( UST ) on Monday 29 December , bound for war - devastated Gaza with a cargo of over 3 tons of desperately needed medical supplies donated by the people of Cyprus .
At our request , the ship was searched by Cypriot Port authorities prior to departure , to certify that there was nothing " threatening " aboard - only emergency medical supplies .
TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY TO STOP THE ISRAELI NAVY FROM ENDANGERING THE DIGNITY AND ITS PASSENGERS !
passengers include , among others , surgeons , journalists , and politicians , including former US congresswoman Cynthia McKinney .
Does jailbreaking your iPhone or iPod touch mean you 're a subversive terrorist bent on bringing down Western civilisation ?
I 'd expect not , unless Osama bin Laden has just received a free upgrade .
Despite the wonderful apps the SDK unleashed , its Apple - imposed limitations restrict what developers can do with it .
So for example , the Last. fm Scrobbler can't actually ' scrobble ' anything you play on the phone as it's not able to access the right information , while the unofficial jailbreak Scrobbler can , over Wi-Fi or 3G for that matter .
Obviously we can take no responsibility for whether or not you decide to jailbreak your iPhone or iPod touch as it will invalidate the warranty .
But the jailbreak community is simply running wild with amazing extensions , tools and handy tweaks .
You 'll surely have your own favourites but here 's our top 10 :
1 . Use your iPhone as a Modem
Your iPhone has an ' unlimited ' data connection , it also has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi as does your laptop .
Put the two together and you 've got a terms and conditions breaching mobile broadband solution !
iPhoneModem is such a ridiculously obvious and helpful thing it almost criminal it's not supplied as standard .
( O2 do ban this specifically in iPhone contracts - beware . )
2 . Get skins and themes
Why wait for Apple to charge you another £ 10 to add this with the next firmware update , when with WinterBoard you can have it now !
With a host of incredibly complete themes already available you can customise everything from the lock screen to your Wi -Fi strength icons .
3. Sync Google Calendar
We 're left incredulous that Google Calendar can't synchronise by default with the built in one .
It beggars belief - especially when the email happily works with Google Mail .
Thankfully NemusSync solves that problem beautifully with two way syncing at the press of a button .
4. Get Google maps offline
Sometimes the ingeniousness of people stuns us .
But with OfflineMaps you can preload Google Maps that have been downloaded on your desktop using GMDL .
It 's not totally straightforward , but once you 've done one it 's easy and lets you access maps offline , though there 's obviously no search .
5 . Make and add ringtones
Free yourself from the tyranny of iTunes !
A massive library of downloadable ringtones exist and neat little tools such as ToneFX can help you create your own and upload them easily to your iPhone , even shuffling them and enabling you to add them to text messages .
6. Read your documents
It seems insane but there 's no direct PDF , text , Word or spreadsheet reader built in or available on the iPhone or iPod touch .
Sure you can email PDFs to yourself , but that 's not always convenient .
Docs is a good stab at bridging the gap and provides a file browser to boot .
7 . Get to grips with all the preferences
Everyone loves tweak tools and BossPrefs offers a host of handy extras , such as quick reboot and locks alongside the ability to hide many of the system status icons .
So you can have your iPhone as busy or uncluttered as you like .
9 . Easily toggle the Wi-Fi on or off
It might seem picky but we like saving seconds and that 's just what WiFiToggle can do .
No need to drill down though the Settings menus any longer , just tap the icon and it'll automatically enable and connect to any known wireless networks .
10 . Go Open Source for media
While it 's hardly perfect , we 're glad to see that someone has got round to porting this Open Source media player to the iPhone .
A touch on the slow side , so it 'll need some work , but it 's another step in the right direction to cutting out annoying and time consuming re-encoding .
This weekend , House Republican leader John Boehner played out the role of Jude Wanniski on NBC's " Meet The Press . "
Odds are you 've never heard of Jude , but without him Reagan never would have become a " successful " president , Republicans never would have taken control of the House or Senate , Bill Clinton never would have been impeached , and neither George Bush would have been president .
When Barry Goldwater went down to ignominious defeat in 1964 , most Republicans felt doomed ( among them the then - 28 - year - old Wanniski ) .
Goldwater himself , although uncomfortable with the rising religious right within his own party and the calls for more intrusion in people 's bedrooms , was a diehard fan of Herbert Hoover 's economic worldview .
In Hoover 's world ( and virtually all the Republicans since reconstruction with the exception of Teddy Roosevelt ) , market fundamentalism was a virtual religion .
Economists from Ludwig von Mises to Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman had preached that government could only make a mess of things economic , and the world of finance should be left to the Big Boys – the Masters of the Universe , as they sometimes called themselves – who ruled Wall Street and international finance .
Hoover enthusiastically followed the advice of his Treasury Secretary , multimillionaire Andrew Mellon , who said in 1931 : " Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , liquidate real estate .
Purge the rottenness out of the system .
High costs of living and high living will come down ... enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people . "
Thus , the Republican mantra was : " Lower taxes , reduce the size of government , and balance the budget . "
The only problem with this ideology from the Hooverite perspective was that the Democrats always seemed like the bestowers of gifts , while the Republicans were seen by the American people as the stingy Scrooges , bent on making the lives of working people harder all the while making richer the very richest .
This , Republican strategists since 1930 knew , was no way to win elections .
Which was why the most successful Republican of the 20th century up to that time , Dwight D. Eisenhower , had been quite happy with a top income tax rate on millionaires of 91 percent .
As he wrote to his brother Edgar Eisenhower in a personal letter on November 8 , 1954 :
" [ T ] o attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it .
The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort , we will lose everything -- even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution .
This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon ' moderation ' in government .
" Should any political party attempt to abolish social security , unemployment insurance , and eliminate labor laws and farm programs , you would not hear of that party again in our political history .
There is a tiny splinter group , of course , that believes you can do these things .
Among them are H. L. Hunt [ you possibly know his background ] , a few other Texas oil millionaires , and an occasional politician or business man from other areas .
Their number is negligible and they are stupid . "
Goldwater , however , rejected the " liberalism " of Eisenhower , Rockefeller , and other " moderates " within his own party .
Extremism in defense of liberty was no vice , he famously told the 1964 nominating convention , and moderation was no virtue .
And it doomed him and his party .
And so after Goldwater 's defeat , the Republicans were again lost in the wilderness just as after Hoover 's disastrous presidency .
Even four years later when Richard Nixon beat LBJ in 1968 , Nixon was n't willing to embrace the economic conservatism of Goldwater and the economic true believers in the Republican Party .
And Jerry Ford was n't , in their opinions , much better .
If Nixon and Ford believed in economic conservatism , they were afraid to practice it for fear of dooming their party to another forty years in the electoral wilderness .
By 1974 , Jude Wanniski had had enough .
The Democrats got to play Santa Claus when they passed out Social Security and Unemployment checks – both programs of the New Deal – as well as when their " big government " projects like roads , bridges , and highways were built giving a healthy union paycheck to construction workers .
They kept raising taxes on businesses and rich people to pay for things , which did n't seem to have much effect at all on working people ( wages were steadily going up , in fact ) , and that made them seem like a party of Robin Hoods , taking from the rich to fund programs for the poor and the working class .
Americans loved it .
And every time Republicans railed against these programs , they lost elections .
Everybody understood at the time that economies are driven by demand .
People with good jobs have money in their pockets , and want to use it to buy things .
The job of the business community is to either determine or drive that demand to their particular goods , and when they 're successful at meeting the demand then factories get built , more people become employed to make more products , and those newly - employed people have a paycheck that further increases demand .
Wanniski decided to turn the classical world of economics – which had operated on this simple demand - driven equation for seven thousand years – on its head .
In 1974 he invented a new phrase – " supply side economics " – and suggested that the reason economies grew was n't because people had money and wanted to buy things with it but , instead , because things were available for sale , thus tantalizing people to part with their money .
The more things there were , the faster the economy would grow .
At the same time , Arthur Laffer was taking that equation a step further .
Not only was supply - side a rational concept , Laffer suggested , but as taxes went down , revenue to the government would go up !

At the Program For the Future event commemorating the 40th anniversary of Doug Englebart ’s “ mother of all demos ” in 1968 , I was privileged to hear an inspired rant by Alan Kay about the unwillingness of people to work hard to learn new skills .
I ’m quoting from memory , so the lines below are not exact , and there ’s no way I can convey the wonderful sense of outrage expressed in Alan ’s voice , but I hope you can imagine it :
If some entrepreneur introduced the bicycle today , no one would fund him .
You have to actually learn how to use it !
… I saw a controller for Guitar Hero that costs a couple of hundred dollars .
You can get a decent electric guitar for that price .
But you ’d have to actually learn something to play it !
There ’s a long arc in computing that teaches us how much we gain through advances in ease - of - use , with the iPhone being the latest breakthrough success .
But it ’s important to remember how much we lose when we think that ease of use is everything .
Many things worth doing are hard , requiring a great deal of practice before you achieve mastery .
Shortly thereafter , I was intrigued to see an interview entitled Bjarne Stroustrup on Educating Software Developers ( via Slashdot ) sounding the same theme :
High schools could teach students to work hard at something ( just about anything ) , to search out information as needed , and learn to express their ideas in writing and orally .
Project - based work is good for that .
Exactly which programming language is used for software is less important , but the aim should not be to make tasks as simple as possible but to challenge students .
And of course , practice , specifically “ 10,000 hours of practice ” during childhood , is one of the themes of Malcolm Gladwell ’s new book , Outliers .
The interview with Stroustrup provoked a great discussion on the O’Reilly editors ’ backchannel .
It was so juicy that I wanted to share it with all of you .
Simon St. Laurent :
“ One aspect of learning programming that often eludes both students and teachers alike is the importance of practice , of actually working through all of these formal structures we teach .
Most of our books , in a way , offer a promise of learning that avoids the slow repetition of practice .
I ’ve worked in other fields where practice really mattered .
I hated to practice exercises on trumpet as a kid , but as I return to it as an adult , I ’m actively seeking exercise books to play .
It ’s the only way to get the skills back , even though I “ know ” how to play all of these things .
In woodworking , it ’s painfully clear that the best way to learn is to do , and do a lot , preferably without taking a long time in between projects .
( And watching little Sungiva figuring things out and trying them repeatedly gives a new sense of the importance of practice . )
In computing , though , we often assume that readers will learn by reading , trying , and a bit of fiddling .
We even assume a whole category of readers who will assemble applications by cutting and pasting code together without much understanding of what they ’re doing and how to smooth the rough edges .
Some of our books incorporate practicing the kinds of thought we ’re teaching .
Head
First even incorporates repetition , though it tries hard to give readers variation as they go over the same territory .
Our Learning books sometimes have exercises , though resistance from authors ( myself included ) and a belief that readers are n’t likely to actually use them limits their value .
The most interesting place I ’ve seen this kind of practice is in the “ homework ” for the O’Reilly School of Technology ’s Java course .
It ’s one detailed exercise per lesson , and then it gets “ handed in ” .
There ’s a lot to think about in each of those exercises , and given the context , learners will actually do them .
“ According to Dizzy Gillespie , it takes ten years of practicing your butt off to achieve Mastery .
His statement has been backed up by scientific research which shows that to reach a very high state of mastery , a task should be repeated about a million times , which takes about ten years .
Better get busy ! ” ( Sound the Trumpet , pp 67 - 68 ) ”
Mike Loukides :
“ That ’s a good point .
One of the things I noticed when [ my daughter ]
Alexandra got
into the 9th grade math class was the emphasis on practice .
I had
been teaching her algebra , but I ’d explain some concept and give her
3 or 4 problems to solve and say , “ Good , you understand that . ”
The Algebra 1 class that she ’s in is doing more or less the same
concepts , but they ’ll do something like solving equations with
absolute values , and she ’ll come home with a homework set of 25
problems .
The next night , there ’ll be 25 slightly more complex
problems .
The next night there ’ll be 25 more slightly more complex
problems , with some simpler problems thrown in for review .
There are a number of things I do n’t like about the way mathematics is
taught , but I think they ’re profoundly right about this .
You ’ve got
to do these things until they become second nature . ”
Beth Freeman :
“ We are actively working on related ideas in Head First now – looking
at ways we can extend the book experience with online experiences that
will include many ways to continue the practice that readers begin in
the books .
And , as you identify , making it fun , making it feel like
playing is an important part of the motivation to get people to
practice .
Game elements can really encourage this – the whole idea of
getting to the next level in a game is basically promoting practice at
that game until you get good enough to get to the next level .
This
idea applies to learning anything , and making those levels explicit in
a way that is fun and motivates people is key .
( e.g. the various
colored belt levels in martial arts ) .
What are the equivalent ways of
measuring competence in programming and technology that encourage and
motivate ( and do n’t feel exclusionary or too hard to even try ) ?
We have a few ways that Head First readers can continue their practice
online at the Head First Labs site now , but it ’s pretty limited .
One aspect of practice that is really important that I think is worth
mentioning is that most true creativity comes from people who have
done a lot of work in their field .
( See Explaining Creativity by
Sawyer and On Intelligence by Hawkins ) .
Most of that work is
“ practice ” – getting to a level of expertise so that we can think more
abstractly about whatever the topic is and combine old ideas in new
ways , which is the heart of creativity .
In other words , if you ’re
focused on learning the little details because you have n’t practiced
enough , it ’s unlikely that you will be able to see the big picture in
a way that will allow you to invent / create new ways of doing or
thinking about that topic . ”
Brett McLaughlin :
“ I think there are two key points that Beth mentioned that , in my
opinion , have to enter any real discussion of practice ( I speak as a
pedagogical fanatic , but also as a musician who still manages two or
three hours a day on his instrument ) :
Practice must be proportional to the goal .
Practice itself is rarely fun , especially in the early days .
I
disagree a bit with Beth that the practice itself is fun ; but where we
do agree is that the goal is crucial .
I will play a lick at a speed so
unwieldy that it stops being music , and play it at that speed until my
entire family is yelling at me …
IF and ONLY if the lick at
performance speed is truly exciting .
So the practice itself is awful ,
and boring , and terrible in many cases , but the end result is
proportionate with the goal .
But with most of us , the goal — passing a class , or getting a better
job , or playing like Jimi or Mayer or Miles or Rachmaninov — has to
be within reach , and attainable , or we ’ll give up .
And yes , practice
is one of the trickiest things to encourage and / or simulate because
repetition is something technology is great at DOING , not PRODUCING .
Think about it : technology ultimately came into being to help us AVOID
repetition .
So it ’s a big problem , and one I have ideas about , but am
still formulating enough to write and speak on .
Practice must , over time , simulate deeper understanding .
Good practice , over time , connects ideas .
Bad practice , over time ,
only creates muscle / mind memory .
Practice structured correctly will
eventually create a fluidity with the mechanical components of [ insert
discipline here ] , and free the mind up to consider the bigger picture .
Practicing a scale in a particular configuration enough reinforces
tones that are appropriate over certain chords , the rhythmic patterns
available , and allows the mind to create melodies and play those
melodies with little forethought .
Repetition without a correct
structure , though , will leave a musician hobbled and trapped within a
pattern , unable to be creative .
Alexandra ’s successively complex problems are creating a mental
landscape of absolute value .
By problem 20 ( or 10 , or 5 ) , she’s
stopped thinking about mechanically solving the problem , but is
instead connecting the methods she ’s using with the methods she used
for the last problem set — and the ones before that — and is
creating a math understanding that ’s deeper than how to solve a
particular problem .
Think about it this way : give a student enough structured binomials to
multiply , with a reinforcing organization , and they will at some point
come up with FOIL on their own .
It ’s simply a fact … if the practice
is correctly structured , and if the repetition is great enough to
allow the mind to wander a bit , and make deeper connections .
Mini-conclusion : Repetition MUST be connected to a deeper understanding
It ’s my opinion that we often think we can reach the second goal
( deeper understanding ) through purely qualitative means : better
writing , better speaking , better visuals .
But there ’s got to be SOME
element of quantitive means , too .
I think we can reduce the number of
repetitions through careful structuring and reinforcement , but that ’s
reduce , not eliminate . ”
Mike Loukides :
“ That ’s a really interesting insight : technology is all about
* avoiding * repetition .
I do n’t write a program until I ’ve done
something a few times , and do n’t want to do it again .
So at some
level , we ’re talking about technology that forces us to do what we
usually use technology to avoid .
Which means we ’re making technology
do what it really does n’t want to do , what it was n’t designed to do . ”
Simon St. Laurent :
“ While there is a fundamental problem there – technology teaches us that repetition is bad – I do n’t think that it ’s a matter of misusing technology . ”
It ’s mistaking facts about technology for facts about us .
It ’s true : teach a program once , and it will do what it does forever , the same way , until the context changes and it breaks .
Teach a person once , and you ’re nowhere near done .
Of course , we tend to adapt better to context …
chromatic :
“ The question is * what * you ’re practicing .
The Art of Agile Development has a
concept of etudes , which should be familiar to anyone who ’s played piano or
recognizes Chopin .
They ’re small exercises suitable for repetition and
reflection as a whole team during a lunch hour .
Unlike the potential ( and
silly ) exercise of writing a for loop or a fold or an iterator a hundred
times , they study how you communicate as a team , how you consider design
problems , and how you prioritize and reflect .
You could consider the retrospective portion of agile development — performed
each week at the end of an iteration — an opportunity to reflect on the
week ’s practice and make the higher connections more explicit .
In one sense ,
reflective iterations are a way to turn the often unorganized and chaotic
activity of software development into structured practice .
That ’s not a
coincidence .
Beth Freeman : “ This is a great way to describe Design Patterns , which are essentially
patterns that emerge after a lot of experience solving similar
problems in similar ways ( ie , practice ) . ”
Scott Gray :
“ So , I think we ’d all agree that you ca n’t learn to program without actually programming .
Just like you ca n’t learn to drive without actually driving .
You ca n’t learn math without doing math .
Yet , one of the hardest things to accomplish in teaching is to get students ( end users ) to actually program or do math or work on the skill it is they are trying to acquire .
Of course , there is a set of people who who inherently understand that they need to program and practice in order to learn .
Evidently some or most of O’Reilly ’s book customers understand this .
If they are buying the book but not actually working on a computer then I guarantee they are n’t learning to program …. they might be learning something , but it is n’t programming .
Until they actually have built something and gone through the entire process of building something they simply are n’t a programmer and are n’t likely to be .
I disagree with Bret here .
Programming and practice can and should be rewarding .
If it is n’t rewarding to students to make programs then they are not likely to become good at that skill ( same goes with Mathematics , Physics , etc . )
So , what Simon did n’t tell you is that what we do [ at the O’Reilly School of Technology , which Scott leads ] is set up situations where we get students to do work and at first do small programs that demonstrate the concepts being talked about in the content .
We do n’t discuss anything without them doing an example .
It also turns out that if you set up the situation just right , you can get close to 100 % of the people DOING programming in order to learn programming .
When they build these programs and see it work and know they created it , then they gain a sense of ownership over the skill they are learning which prepares them to do a project without our guidance which is what Simon was telling you about .
It ’s also important to have instructors there to help students through the frustrations they are likely to encounter when learning .
Our instructors are their coaches .
They coach them through the process , motivate them to work it out themselves and solve that problem they ’re having because is n’t that what a programmer is someone who can deal with a situation and work on it until the program does what it ’s designed to do .
People who can go from novice to expert with books are actually quite rare .
It does n’t seem like they are rare to O’Reilly since these are the types of people you ’ve been selling to all along .
However , if you ’ve ever taught at a University you know that maybe 2 % of the students you teach can learn themselves from nothing but a book .
It ’s not that this other 98 % are dumb it ’s that they have n’t learned how to learn a skill like programming or mathematics and have to be motivated to do kind of work they need to do to learn .
Unfortunately , in most courses students do the minimum amount of actual practice that they can get away with because it ’s not been made available in a form that gives them * ownership * over the process .
What we learned at the University of Illinois Math & Mathematica project was that properly used the computer can be used to not only get students working and practicing but give them ownership over the material as well .
OST is basically replicating this same pedagogy that works for those Mathematics courses .
The recipe is to merge content and tools in a way that fosters student activity , and to provide coaches to give students positive feedback and to help them through the rough spots .
At this point I could go into the business aspect of this and discuss the need for credits in order to hit the price point per student to pay for this process and also to motivate students to actually take these courses and work hard to finish them .
Let me just say that for courses the extrinsic motivation of certificates and degrees makes it all come together so that both the students and the institution are happy and successful .
The nice thing about the book business , is that you do n’t have to deal much with end users or observe whether they are actually accomplishing your instructional goals .
The only types of feedback you get are reviews , sales , and anecdotes .
Once you start teaching courses and adding assessments and feedback the expectations change .
When you sell someone a book , if they do n’t read it or they do n’t pick up the skill they generally do n’t hold the book responsible , it ’s probably their own fault .
However if they take your course , and they do n’t learn it ’s your fault .
There are much higher expectations with courses , so you better get it right .
So far over the last five years we ’re getting 80 % of our students through these courses .
The industry standard for online courses is 30 % .
We ’re doing something right .
Allison Randal :
“ I ’ve been deeply impressed by Scratch in this respect .
The real magic of learning is to practice without realizing you ’re
practicing .
My son is learning to program not because he dutifully sits
down to work through exercises , but because he ’s having fun creating
games and animations to share with his friends .
We do n’t learn applications like Word because we set regular practice
sessions , we learn them because there ’s something we want or need to get
done , and this tool helps us do it .
The same is true of natural language , you can drill and drill and drill
( and should , to build vocabulary ) , but will never really get the
language until you use it in active communication .
And putting yourself
in a situation where the language you ’re learning is the * only * possible
language you can use to communicate with those around you leads to
exponential leaps and bounds in language skills .
There ’s a fantastic book on language learning around this subject , that
does n’t teach you a specific language , it teaches you how to learn any
language ( Language Acquisition Made Practical . )
It includes exercises that are more
suggestions than drills , like “ Have a conversation with your neighbor
about the weather ” , so you gradually start to integrate the skills into
your life .
Scott Gray :
“ By the way , ‘ practice ’ brings up all kinds of negative connotations like
‘ drill ’ .
Nobody likes drills do they ?
Practice can and should be part of the process of creating something ,
like Allision pointed out .
Again , I hate to seem like I ’m plugging my stuff too much , but it seems
relevant to the discussion .
Just this month one of our students won a
Yahoo !
Hack day by adapting a project he created in one of our courses .
A lot of our assignments that they do and hand - in for feedback are
“ Build something cool that incorporates X ” .
Kurt Kagle :
“ I ’m watching my eight year old daughter go through a distance learning curriculum , and its been something of an eye opener from a number of perspectives .
Jennie is a natural on computers – she figured out the level editor for SuperTux at the age of six , was navigating through web pages by the age of five , even though she was n’t really “ reading ” yet ( which says something very profound and disturbing about our assumptions about reading , I suspect ) and has reached a point where she ’s gaming the cheat codes in Sims , without really realizing that she ’s actually using the programmer ’s interface into the program and beginning to learn LUA .
She also does most of the practice math exercises in the GCompris quickly and usually enthusiastically … especially if there is a game context associated with it .
The problems she face with this , however , are two - fold .
She gets easily bored when forced into the school tempo , she finds physical writing to be frustrating ( partially due to an abysmal first grade teacher , partially because of disgraphia ) and overall she finds that repetition without some kind of contextual framework to be tedious in the extreme .
My wife and I also tend to be at odds about the degree of computer interaction that Jennie should have ; to me , what ’s important is the conceptual practice that she could get just as easily with a computer , with Anne , what ’s more important is that she do the repetition on the worksheets because she ’ll have to do them that way in real life .
While I ’m not sure what the resolution of this particular conundrum will end up being , I think it does point out a somewhat bigger picture .
I like computer - based “ practice ” precisely because it both gives you a stronger mastery with a shorter feedback time and it provides a way to easily test that mastery , especially in areas where repetition is significant .
Moreover , it provides a way to build simulations that can help you work through a problem .
This does n’t mean that I approve of all educational software …
I ’ve written educational software for Fisher Price , Microsoft and works such as The Oregon Trail over the years , and some of it ( the stuff I usually did n’t have a design hand in , generally , though I would think that ) was pretty dreadful .
On the other hand , the ones that worked well were the ones that provided an enjoyable context , a compelling narrative and enough awareness to determine when someone just was n’t getting it , and all the repetition in the world would n’t help the student make the conceptual leap .
Yet this short feedback loop is very much at odds with the way that teachers currently teach – in part because they have 30 + kids to track typically , and as such , individually they can give these kids only a small percentage of time spent specifically with them .
I think there ’s also been this emphasis in recent years away from repetition , both because it forces everyone to move at the pace of the slowest student and because in an age of media bombardment , kids lose patience with boring repetition that has no context and a non-contextual feedback loop ( the students get back their homework two or three days after they complete it , typically long after they ’ve moved onto new work and only with an indication showing them that they got the answer wrong , not why ) .
This is especially true in areas like mathematics .
There ’s still a very strong Calvinistic ethic that permeates the educational culture , with one of the most insidious beliefs being that in order for something to be educational , it must not be pleasurable – that said pleasure actually distracts from the process of learning .
The O’Reilly Head First books are a prime counterpoint to that – engaging , relevant , and generally fun , I think they are some of the best educational books out there , but there are a few people know who have told me that they do n’t seem like real teaching books precisely because they are flip and irreverent .
Teaching is best done with massive tomes set in thick type with few examples , interspersed with deep theory , according to this viewpoint , though I ’ve noticed that while books like these may get bought , they also have a tendency to sit on the shelves .
While I ’m not a huge fan of a lot of computer games ( way too much violence ) I do recognize that there are games out there that challenge people to think , that justify the onerousness of repetition with a tangible reward ( achieving the next level ) and that provide a context and narrative in a way that “ story problems ” usually ca n’t or do n’t .
Case in point .
One of my eldest daughter Kate ’s teachers assigned a homework problem – design a simple floorplan for a house that had to fit within a lot ( i.e. , take up a certain area ) , one that had to include two bathrooms and two bedrooms at a minimum , then calculate the total surface area involved .
Kate ’s solution was actually pretty inspired – she powered up Sims , created a building from scratch , then began putting in the various walls , fixtures and appliances , working within the constraints that each of these occupied both square footage and had implications for plumbing and the like .
Once she ’d done this , she printed up the floorplan , measured the dimensions , converted the units into meters and calculated the area from there .
What I find interesting here was that she used the simulation to help turn what could have been a very boring exercise into an engaging one , and one that also showed that there was much more to the particular context than just finding a number .
She still had to do the math ( my insistence ) , but with the same simulation she could also determine a significant amount of other information that she would n’t have been able to do with the previous exercise ( how much would such a house cost to build , how much to carpet , how much area did a staircase take up , and so forth ) .
To tie this back into the thread – she was playing , within the parameters established for that play .
She gained immediate feedback that let her see when something worked or did n’t ( a hallway that was too thin for people to pass , a bathroom that was shaped wrong for a bathtub , etc. ) , and in the end , she had something that she could not only play with but also share with her friends ( Kate ’s my social butterfly ) .
She was problem solving ( the use of a Sims game for laying out a house was not something I would have thought of ) , and she was practicing not just one skill , but several that were likely to be used in concert together .
Consider , for instance , the last time that you needed to just calculate the area of a plot of land .
In the last several years , I think I ’ve spent perhaps twenty minutes total involved in that particular exercise , after an investment of several years worth of learning the math to get me there .
If I was an architect or a construction manager , I ’d have done it on a computer using some kind of 3D rendering package , and if I was hiring that architect or construction manager , I ’d probably fire them if I found that they were doing all of these calculations by hand .
Practice is necessary to learn a skill ( it takes about a million repetitions , typically around ten years to master any given skill ) , but I think that we have become so fixated upon this necessity that we have to question if the skills that we are spending so much of our time and resource educating them are ones that they truly need .
If our children are going to live in a world heavily dominated by computer technology , is it worthwhile for us to be practicing skills that we ’ll only use a handful of times in our life ?
When we have the means to make learning subtasks engaging and fun , does it really behoove us to make them dull , pedantic ( funny how that has become a synonym for dull ) and time - consuming ?
My own belief is that our children are growing up having to adapt to a world of information bombardment .
Children generally learn to adapt to their world despite our best intentions in trying to teach them how to live in ours .
This growing disconnect is going to eventually rupture as the mission of the school system becomes fundamentally incompatible with their needs .
I think we are now in a position to start doing something about that , to recognizing that practice , while necessary , can be readily disguised as play , and that learning should be challenging but engaging , not repetitious and dull .
Scott Gray :
“ Repetition and drill sucks .
Creation and discovery rocks .
I once saw a show on new learning techniques .
They took a first or
second grade music class and told the students they were going to play
them a song and that they should come up with a way of remembering the
tune .
Each of the children came up with a different method mostly using
crayons and construction paper .
They created different ways to designate
the notes and loudness and spaced things to indicate the timing , etc .
Then they showed each student how the method they came up with mapped to
sheet music .
According to the program I was watching this was really
effective in teaching children how to read sheet music .
What I ’ve seen and first learned while teaching was that instead of
telling students things and explaining everything we can set up
situations where they discover what we want them to .
For example , I
taught students about differentiation and integration by giving them a
problem about driving to the store and figuring out their speed without
a speedometer .
( all written up in Mathematica so they could follow along
and experiment ) .
Eventually they each came up with the main idea about
differentiation .
When they were done ….
I ’d say “ oh yeah , what you just
discovered is what Isaac Newton discovered in the 1600 ’s , it ’s called
‘ Differentiation ' ” .
It ’s quite a powerful thing to create and discover
ideas whether or not it was created and discovered previously .
After
all , Mathematics is about creating and discovering .
Computers and the internet can be used to scale the learning by
discovery paradigm . ”
Simon :
“ Scott said ‘ Repetition and drill sucks .
Creation and discovery rocks . ’
Now we ’re starting to reach the opposite of what I was thinking this morning , which is always a great thing in a conversation .
My point this morning was in large part that repetition and drill matter , and that once you ’ve figured out that they ’re actually helping you , they ‘ suck ’ a lot less .
It ’s not just a matter of Calvinist ethics ( sorry , Kurt ) – it ’s an opportunity for learners to move forward by doing things a lot , shifting ahead a bit at a time .
The great leaps are fun as well , but build on smaller steps .
My concern with this is that while letting kids figure out what works for them is a good idea and that different kids will figure out different things , actually becoming good at things is about a lot more than discovering them or creating them .
Reading sheet music is one thing – learning to play an instrument is another .
And I figured out what integration and differentiation were about long before I got to calculus , but I probably should have flunked my second semester of calculus because I just could n’t wrap my head around how to actually make it work .
( Which shocked me , because math up to then had just flowed naturally for me . )
Ideally I ’d love to have discovery and creativity motivate learners ’ actions – but they still need to motivate learners into a tremendous amount of repetition to get there .
Kurt said ‘ Computers and the internet can be used to scale the learning by
discovery paradigm . ’
Yes , and they can also be used to manage , moderate , and fine - tune repetition .
Hopefully we can combine all of that into something that gives people instruction at a pace they can maintain , thrilled by their progress , but also in a way that sticks with them . ”
I hope you all found that discussion as thought - provoking as I did .
I ’d love your thoughts .
How have you found practice to be important in your programming — or in other aspects of your life ?
Much like Black God , I did n’t have the slightest clue about what Chrome Shelled Regios was going to be about , only that it was a fighting anime .
I kind of like it that way , walk in with a blank slate , ready to be impressed .
After watching the first two episodes I ’ve realized that I have seen this all before , weapons that form out of nothing , the quiet purple haired loli , the shy hero who can only kick ass when things are really bad , and that blonde sniper who is in every anime that always gets the ladies ; its like they are not even trying anymore !
However , I am a simple man to please .
Things do n’t have to be ‘ new ’ and ‘ innovative ’ in order to please me , just entertaining .
What really got me interested about this series is that it reminded me of Final Fantasy 8 , with SeeD , Garden , and all that fun stuff .
Read my first impression of this anime after the jump .
Like most anime , the story after the first two episodes is n’t really apparent as of yet .
Basically , there are schools within giant moving cities , where students learn how to fight using magically - appearing weapons .
The main character , Layfon , recently joined one of these schools and is forced to join a squadron of warriors .
From what I ’ve seen so far , the purpose of these schools is to have giant “ capture the flag ” games with other cities .
In order to train students for this “ game ” , squads hold practice capture the flag matches with other squads .
And then there are the giant insects , which play some kind of role within this anime .
Artwork overall is average , which is n’t really too bad because the fight scenes are nicely animated .
And really , when you have nicely animated fight scenes , nothing else really matters .
Music is also pretty swell , chugging out jungle beats whenever the action gets heavy .
It ’s hard to say if this anime is going to be good , but for me it was entertaining .
I really like the world this series exists in , tournaments , magic , schools of teenaged insect killers — who can ask for more ?
The story so far is not yet there , though Regios is based off a series of light novels , so there has to be a story in there somewhere .
What this season needs is some mindless action , and Chrome Shelled Regios happily took that spot .
What would make this anime go from good to great is to break the shell of the expected and do something different .
Give it a shot if you are like me and love those action shows , especially so if there is a chance that a tournament might be involved .
God I love tournaments .

There 's a xkcd comic that shows a person resisting going to bed because " someone is wrong on the Internet , " which has become an Internet meme because it strikes a chord with so many of us .
Admit it : we 've all done it before , probably multiple times .
But when we think of the type of person who does this , most of us think of men .
That stereotype , it turns out , is not quite as true as we think .
According to new survey results from Intel , women are more likely than men to willingly sacrifice sex for two weeks than risk losing Internet access for that long .
And you thought headaches were a problem .
According to the survey of 2,119 adult Internet users , commissioned for Intel by Harris Interactive ( full results will be published next week ) , 95 percent of all respondents said it was at least " somewhat " important to have devices that allow them to get online .
65 percent said that they simply could not live without Internet access , period .
Clearly , this is a crowd that loves their Internet .
But it would n't take much for this luxury - turned - utility to interrupt people 's lives in the bedroom , it seems , and in trends that seem to be moving in opposite directions .
Almost half ( 46 percent ) of all women said that they would choose the Internet over sex for two weeks .
Broken down , the numbers are even more scary for the male side of the population : 49 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 34 would rather have the Internet than some tender lovin ' , and 52 percent between age 35 and 44 felt the same way .
It looks like the numbers only go down in the upper age groups , who do n't tend to spend as much time on the Internet in the first place .
Truer than we'd like to admit Truer than we'd like to admit
Men have trouble resisting the succubus that is the online world either , but in lower numbers ( 30 percent overall ) .
39 percent of men between the ages of 18 and 34 said they would sacrifice sex for the Internet for two weeks , while a mere 23 percent of those between 35 and 44 said so .
Sex was n't the only thing people ranked below Internet access in Intel 's survey , though .
Cable TV subscriptions , dining out , shopping for clothes , and gym memberships all lose out to the Internet when push comes to shove .
In fact , TV seemed to be one of the most expendable of the non-people - related options , with 58 percent of all adults ( male and female ) saying they would rather give up TV for two weeks than live without Internet for even a single week .
In the spirit of things we would rather give up in order to stay online for two weeks , the Ars staff has come up with a list of things that we would sacrifice to keep our Internet on
Phone service
Shaving
Bathing ( Nate only )
Air conditioning ( in the summer , that is )
TV ( broadcast , cable , or even online )
Caffeine
What are some of yours ?

Among the outsiders , John McCone , a California shipbuilder installed by President John F. Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs disaster , has generally been given high marks .
Mr. McCone is credited with correctly predicting that the Soviet Union would deploy offensive missiles in Cuba .
The agency also delivered increasingly grim reports to the White House about the Vietnam War , to the dismay of both Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson .

By contrast , Richard Helms , a careerist who ascended the ranks to take over the C.I.A. under Johnson and President Richard M. Nixon , was highly regarded inside the agency , but was ultimately blamed for the fallout from dozens of C.I.A. covert operations abroad that went sour .
In describing the rationale for turning to Mr. Panetta , aides to Mr. Obama said it was important to bring clarity to the division of responsibilities among American intelligence agencies , and in particular to end the current disputes between the offices of the C.I.A. director and the director of national intelligence .
Because Mr. Panetta does not have a C.I.A. background , the aides said , he may be less likely to instinctively defend the C.I.A. ’s turf against other spy agencies .
They said Dennis Blair , the retired admiral who has been tapped to become director of national intelligence , had played a role in choosing Mr. Panetta , but would have the clear mandate from the White House to set intelligence policy across the 16 intelligence agencies .
In expressing disapproval about the choice of Mr. Panetta , Mrs. Feinstein recalled that she had said that an intelligence professional would be the best choice to lead the agency now .
In softening her stance on Tuesday , the senator told a reporter that the choice might be more palatable if Mr. Kappes , the No. 2 official , remained in his job .
Mr. Kappes left the agency in 2004 after a clash with Porter J. Goss , then the C.I.A. director , but agreed to return in 2006 under a new director , Michael V. Hayden , in a move that lifted morale among clandestine officers .
A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment about whether Mr. Kappes had decided to stay in his current job .

Oh , so you decided to watch it ?
We were just kidding !
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The sheriff of the third - most populous U.S. county halted evictions on foreclosed properties on Thursday , saying innocent tenants were being put on the street .
But bankers said he was breaking the law .
Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said he understood he was flouting the law in refusing to have deputies carry out the rising number of eviction requests , but mortgage holders must be accountable .
“ These mortgage companies only see pieces of paper , not people , and do n’t care who ’s in the building , ” Dart said .
The eviction moratorium applied to any home , apartment building or condominium facing mortgage foreclosure .
Other evictions due to such issues as failing to pay rent would continue , Dart said .
Dart , whose county includes the city of Chicago and encompasses 5.4 million people , said he believed he was the first sheriff in a major metropolitan area to take such a step .
Chicago is the hometown of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
A spokesman for the sheriff said there were more than 500 evictions for foreclosure scheduled over the next six weeks and the office was on pace to conduct 4,500 evictions this year .
Mortgage foreclosure cases filed in Cook County are likely to exceed 43,000 this year , compared to some 18,000 in 2006 , the sheriff said .
The Chicago metropolitan area ranked 35th in the United States in terms of foreclosure rates in the second quarter , according to RealtyTrac .
Illinois law was recently revised to require the owner of the property and mortgage holder to notify whoever lives there 120 days before an eviction is carried out .
But some landlords disappear without notifying tenants , or tenants may be tossing out eviction notices in the mail without realizing what they are , said Linda Koch , president of the Illinois Bankers Association .
The bankers trade group said Dart was ignoring the law and was engaging in “ vigilantism . ”
“ In announcing his plan , Dart acknowledged that he could be found in contempt of court , ” the IBA said in a statement , adding that the sheriff ’s decision “ should not be tolerated . ”
“ We have to have the ability to take over collateral upon default , and if we do n’t have that assurance , or we think evictions wo n’t be made ... we simply wo n’t make the loan , ” Koch said of the moratorium .
Alongside a lineup of refreshed Ford Fusions and Mercury Milans , the Blue Oval has revealed details on the hybrid versions of the mid-size pair .
The Ford - designed hybrid setup is similar in function to that used in the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner hybrids , but it boasts significant improvements over the old system .
The gas - powered side of the equation is the same 2.5 - liter Atkinson - cycle four - cylinder , which produces 155 hp and 136 lb- ft of torque on its own .
Several packaging improvements have been made , most notable being a revised nickel - metal - hydride battery that takes up 30 percent less space while also providing 20 percent more power .
The cars ’ regenerative brakes , a staple technology for hybrids , are said to reclaim up to 94 percent of available kinetic energy .
These new hybrids also claim to reach up to 47 mph using electric power alone , which is pretty unbelievable ; most hybrids on sale today , including Toyota ’s Prius , cap EV - mode speed at 25 mph or so .
What ’s more , Ford expects the new hybrids to beat the Toyota Camry hybrid by 6 mpg in the city ( for a grand total of 39 mpg ) , while also bettering the Camry 's highway rating of 34 mpg .
All of this fuel aversion will allow a 700 - mile city range for the hybrid duo , says Ford .
It all sounds quite good , but we hear the new tech wo n’t allow the company to both price the vehicles competitively and make anything near a profit , making these green sedans little more than environmentally friendly loss leaders .
Ch-check Out How Green You Are
Ford has collaborated with design consultant group Ideo to create a new system to monitor fuel economy and other information .
The system , clumsily dubbed SmartGauge with EcoGuide , is a reconfigurable gauge cluster made up of a large , centrally located analog speedometer flanked by two 4.3 - inch LCD displays .
Four default layouts can be chosen as a basis of customization , from a bare - bones look at vital vehicle stats to an information - laden view designed for — and with the help of — hypermilers .
Why Ford wants to promote the dangerous driving techniques involved with hypermiling , we ’re not sure .
The SmartGauge displays are bright and easy to read , but we do worry that this is another step toward total driver distraction .
One such distraction is a display featuring a tree branch that grows more leaves as the vehicle is driven in what ’s determined to be an environmentally friendly manner .
Drive like a hooligan , though , and you ’ll kill the tree .
This hokey , literal interpretation of efficient driving can be turned off or substituted for a more useful gauge , but we look forward to wiping out whole forests once we drive the car .
Although SmartGauge ’s grass - and - sky theme looks similar to Windows Vista , Ford says the system was developed entirely in - house and will not communicate with Microsoft ’s SYNC system .
SmartGauge also will not display navigation information on vehicles so equipped , which sounds sort of not - so - smart to us .
The 2010 Fusion and Milan hybrids will be fully revealed — wearing the nonhybrid cars ’ new exterior and interior styling , of course — at this year ’s Los Angeles auto show .

This year , astronomers including Dr. Swain ’s group reported finding water vapor and methane swirling around HD x189733 b .
And in Thursday ’s issue of the journal Nature , a different group of astronomers , led by Carl J. Grillmair of the California Institute of Technology , now report that they , too , have detected water around the same planet , using a technique more precise than that used in earlier research .

As seen from Earth , HD 189733 b passes directly in front of and behind its parent star as it orbits .
Taking advantage of those eclipses , Dr. Swain ’s group used the Hubble Space Telescope to compare the near - infrared light from the star alone ( when the planet was hidden behind it ) with the combined light from both .
The difference between the two spectrums revealed the light emitted from the planet , and the mix of colors in the planet ’s light contained the telltale signs of carbon dioxide at concentrations of between one part per million and one part per 10 million , compared with Earth at about 385 parts per million .
Even that much carbon dioxide was a bit of a surprise , because the simplest chemistry equations predicted that carbon would prefer to form carbon monoxide or methane molecules .
One possibility is that the intense ultraviolet radiation from the star , just three million miles away , is spurring chemical reactions to produce the observed carbon dioxide .
“ The theorists will have no problem explaining it , ” said L. Drake Deming , a planetary scientist at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , and a member of Dr. Swain ’s team .

先週はソニーコンピュータサイエンス研究所のオフサイトミーティングだった。年一回やっている研究合宿だが全員の話を集中して聞けるのは楽しくもあり知的体力を消耗させる場でもある。
そこで知ったエピソードで最も衝撃的だった、ENIACによる気象数値シミュレーションの試みについて。
ENIAC - Wikipedia
ENIAC といえば( ABCとならぶ)コンピュータの元祖。フォンノイマンアーキテクチャー（プログラム内蔵方式）ではなくワイヤーパッチで計算要素をつないでいくタイプのコンピュータである。それで気象シミュレーションをしようとなどと今から振り返ってみれば無謀もいいところだが、真剣にチャレンジしていたらしい。気象情報を格納するメモリーなどもちろんないので、すべてをパンチカードに打ち込み、それを入力して、一サイクル計算すると大量のパンチカードが出てくる、という構成になっていた。

Here ’s General Motors chief Rick Wagoner ( circled above ) on his way to Washington – in a car , of all things .
Two weeks ago , GM ’s CEO flew from Detroit to Washington on a corporate jet to ask the nation ’s lawmakers to rescue his embattled company .
The action provoked a loud Bronx cheer , so yesterday , acting like the ordinary American he is not , the hapless fellow was driven to the nation ’s capital .
He rode in a black hybrid Chevrolet Malibu , the kind of high - mileage vehicle that critics say Detroit should be concentrating on .
The trip through four states was 500 miles , and Wagoner – no elitist , he – did some of the driving himself .
When not driving , he sat in the passenger ’s seat and made calls on his cellphone , wearing sunglasses to protect him from the glare .
Today and tomorrow , Wagoner , along with fellow CEOs Alan Mulally , of Ford , and Robert Nardelli of Chrysler , will appear before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee to beg for up to $ 34 billion in financial aid .
Mulally and Nardelli also made the trip in hybrid cars .
Wagoner ’s Malibu was accompanied by two other cars – a Buick Lucerne , which runs on fuel that is 85 percent ethanol , and a Chevy Cobalt XFE , the brand ’s highest - mileage vehicle .
An Associated Press reporter tailed the caravan from the Ohio - Pennsylvania border to Washington , noting that it routinely exceeded the speed limit by about 5 mph .
The weary travelers arrived in Washington during the evening rush hour and stopped for the night at the JW Marriott Hotel , a few blocks from the White House .
Wagoner did n’t exactly cheap out .
The least expensive room at the hotel costs $ 399 a night and a suite goes for about $ 800 .
In the restaurant , a glass of white wine can cost $ 15 .
Meanwhile , the United Auto Workers agreed to scrap or dra matically downsize a controversial program in which workers are paid even if they ’re not on the job .
As part of a package of concessions to Detroit ’s struggling Big Three , the union plans to give up “ jobs banks , ” which guarantee laid - off rank - and - file employees nearly full salary and allow the automakers to delay payments to a cash - strapped health trust fund .
“ We are willing to take an extra step here , ” UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said after an emergency meeting with execs from GM , Ford and Chrysler .
“ Concessions .
I used to cringe at that word .
But now , why hide from it ?
That ’s what we did . ”

After years of delay , Ventura County has fully complied with the state mandated " Medical Marijuana Program Act " , which changes the way the county and its municipalities regard medical cannabis and the estimated 10,000 seriously ill patients who require it .
Indeed , as early as December 7 , an intrepid Web voyager could find her way to a page on the Ventura County Public Health site titled " Medical Marijuana Program . "
The ordinary - appearing page provides information for qualified Ventura County medical cannabis patients regarding how to obtain the state - issued Patient 's ID Card .
County compliance with Senate Bill 420 has taken too long , yet we thank the Board of Supervisors for finally doing the right thing .
The Patient 's ID Card , which provides patients with extended protection in law enforcement encounters , is one of a number of rights and privileges guaranteed patients by the Medical Marijuana Program Act of 2004 .
Importantly , the law assures patients safe and local access to medicine .
For the vast majority of patients , safe and local access means acquiring medicine through a dispensing collective with a " storefront " operation .
According to the attorney general 's " Guidelines " on medical cannabis , issued during August 2008 , collectives must operate on a " not - for - profit " or " non-profit " basis .
Additionally , a collective must be a " closed - circuit " - all medicine must be cultivated by the collective exclusively for its members .
No illicit marijuana may enter the medical supply stream , and no medical cannabis may enter the black market .
Today there is not a single medical cannabis " dispensary " operating publicly in Ventura County .
While the situation has caused years of unnecessary hardship for patients , there might be a positive side .
The L.A. experiment and its 400 dispensaries have produced , with notable exceptions , a spawn of poorly managed , copycat operations bearing scant resemblance to anything " medical " - a situation the attorney general 's " Guidelines " attempt to remedy .
The fact that Ventura County is virgin territory for medical cannabis gives local patients a unique opportunity to create the next generation of facilities and services , to develop a new dispensary model viable for our community and others , to better serve both patients and the community .
There is also a very substantial economic impact .
For a number of years , the county has not benefited from it estimated $ 50 million annual medical cannabis economy .
Now , more than ever , that $ 50 million needs to stay in our community , where it can bring much - needed economic development and job creation .

Mukasey 's recommendation of exec privilege to hide Cheney transcript revealed Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 31 , 2008
Print This Email This The Justice Department this week released Attorney General Michael Mukasey 's recommendation that President Bush invoke executive privilege in refusing to release to Congress transcripts of Dick Cheney 's conversations with the FBI .
The seven - page letter ( pdf ) , dated July 15 , argues that disclosure of such records would hinder future presidents ' ability to receive guidance from their advisers because Cheney 's conversations detailed internal White House deliberations .
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee requested the transcripts along with other documents related to its investigation into the leak of former CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity .
A bipartisan committee report has already determined the claim was inappropriate , and a separate report ( pdf ) , that the committee has delayed voting on recommends holding Mukasey in contempt of Congress .
It 's unclear if the committee will ever vote on that report ; a spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday .
Mukasey 's letter , which was released by the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel Monday , provides a fuller look at the Bush administration 's attempt to keep its secrets regarding the Plame leak , which many observers believe the vice president orchestrated .
Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , was the only person convicted in Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald 's probe , but Bush commuted his sentence .
Investigative reporter Murray Wass has been told some of what 's included in the Cheney FBI interview transcript at issue .
Vice President Dick Cheney , according to a still - highly confidential FBI report , admitted to federal investigators that he rewrote talking points for the press in July 2003 that made it much more likely that the role of then - covert CIA - officer Valerie Plame in sending her husband on a CIA - sponsored mission to Africa would come to light .
Cheney conceded during his interview with federal investigators that in drawing attention to Plames role in arranging her husbands Africa trip reporters might also unmask her role as CIA officer .
Blogger Emptywheel , who has reported on the Plame investigation since the beginning , notes that the disclosure " would make it more likely that Cheney had a role in outing Plame . "
Mukasey 's recommendation of executive privilege invokes several arguments made by Richard Nixon as he tried to avoid handing over White House tape recordings regarding Watergate .
The letter 's release was previously reported by the Legal Times .
In Cheney 's case , the records are protected by the law enforcement component of executive privilege , Mukasey said .
Even though the investigation has run its course , disclosing the records would raise " serious separation of powers concerns related to the integrity and effectiveness of future law enforcement investigations , " Mukasey wrote .
" I have a general concern about the prospect of committees of Congress obtaining confidential records from Justice Department criminal investigative files for the purpose of addressing highly politicized issues in public committee hearings . "
The Oversight Committee 's final report took specific issue with this law enforcement claim .
" There is no basis to support the proposition that a law enforcement privilege , particularly one applied to closed investigations , can shield from congressional scrutiny information that is important for addressing congressional oversight concerns , " the committee 's report says .
" The Attorney General did not cite a single judicial decision recognizing this alleged privilege .
Even the Departments own opinions that he cited , which do not have the force of law , only apply the privilege to open law enforcement inquiries , not to closed matters like the Special Counsel investigation . "
The music industry has been cracking down on illegal sharing
The report by Jupiter Research suggests European consumers who download music from illegal file - sharing websites outnumber those using legal services .
It says illegal networks are used three times as much as legal ones .
It also warns that file - sharers , particularly young people , have little concept of music as a paid commodity .
The UK music industry has been cracking down on illegal file - sharing .
The BPI recently stepped up its campaign by launching 65 new legal cases against those it accuses of large - scale file - sharing .
Free consumption
Jupiter analyst Mark Mulligan said : " The digital youth of today are being brought up on a near limitless diet of free and disposable music from file - sharing networks .
" When these consumers age and increase spending power they should become key music buying consumers .
He added : " Unless the music industry can transition these consumers whilst they are young away from free consumption to paid music formats , be they digital or CDs , they may never develop music purchasing behaviour and the recording industry could suffer long - term harm . "
The research suggests only five per cent of all internet consumers pay to download music while 15 % share the music without paying .
In the 15 - 24 year age group , 34 % admitted to sharing music online without paying for it .
However , the report did find a solid demand for paid music downloads from sites such as iTunes , with 10 % of Europeans willing to pay to download tracks .
Sweden reported the highest demand with 31 % prepared to pay .
