— A Cary man who spent nearly two decades in prison on a first - degree murder conviction walked away from a courtroom Wednesday a free man after a three - judge panel decided he was convicted of a crime he did n't commit .
" It 's unbelievable , " Gregory Taylor , 47 , said , encircled by family , friends and media .
" I mean , you think all these years what this day would be like – 6,149 days , and finally the truth has prevailed . "
Taylor was convicted in April 1993 in the 1991 death of Jacquetta Thomas , a prostitute found dead at the end of a Raleigh cul - de-sac .
Taylor had exhausted all avenues of appeals when the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission reviewed his case and decided in September that it merited a review before the special panel .
" I feel like I 'm dreaming , " Taylor 's daughter , Kristen Puryear , 26 , said .
" She was 9 years old when I went to prison , " Taylor said , embracing her for one of the first times as a free man .
" I missed her 10th birthday , I missed her 16th birthday . … I missed her marriage .
I missed the birth of my grandson .
Now all of that 's returned . "
" And I 'm taking him home , " Puryear said .
For six days , Taylor 's attorneys argued there were never any physical links between Thomas and Taylor and that despite investigators ' claim of blood on Taylor 's Nissan Pathfinder , there was no evidence connecting the two .
They wrapped up Wednesday morning with closing arguments in which Wake County District Attorney Colon Willoughby said the evidence presented in support of Taylor was n't logical , credible or believable .
( Read more about the closing arguments . )
" I did not know what to expect , " Willoughby said of the judges ' decision .
" I felt like it was our responsibility to present the evidence and to allow the three - judge panel to make their decision and do what they found the evidence showed . "
In asking the judges to free Taylor , defense attorney Joseph Cheshire urged them to undo a wrong and to help assure the public that the judicial system is changing to help ensure it does not happen again .
" Out of tragedy and sadness can actually come a better world , " Cheshire said .
" Nothing makes our system better than the public acknowledgment that mistakes have been made . "
' Innocence points out injustice '
Wednesday 's ruling marks the first in the state 's history in which a prisoner has been exonerated because of the involvement of the Innocence Commission – the only state - run agency in the country that investigates post - conviction claims of innocence .
Taylor 's case is the second case in the commission 's four - year history that has gone up for an evidentiary hearing where only new evidence is considered .
As of January , the commission has reviewed 634 cases , 463 of which were rejected – the others are in various stages of review or have been closed .
At a news conference Wednesday afternoon , Cheshire credited the agency and the North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence for their attention to the case and for finding inconsistencies with evidence and testimony from Taylor 's trial .
" This is one of those fantastic days , " he said .
" We should all look at this day as a positive day for the state of North Carolina .
No innocent , wrongfully accused person should ever have to spend a day in prison . "
Gov. Beverly Perdue described the commission as setting " a new standard of jurisprudence in America . "
" I believe in this Innocence Commission , and I believe the ruling today shows bad things can happen , even in the finest of systems , " she said .
Joining the likes of Dwayne Dail and Darryl Hunt – both men were wrongly convicted of separate crimes and each freed after spending 18 years in prison – Taylor said he hopes to do work to help other people in situations similar to his .
" This is not just about innocent people , this is about injustice , " Taylor said .
" Innocence points out injustice . "
' It is just not over ... Now what ?'
Although Taylor 's innocence has been a focus of prosecutors and defense attorneys over the course of years , Sierra Pharr , Thomas ' daughter , does n’t want people to forget her mother .
" It makes us feel , as far as our mom 's case , ' Who really cares ? ' " said Pharr , who was 5 years old when Thomas was killed .
" The fact that someone who gave birth to you was taken from you as horrible and tragic as she was , it hurts , " she said .
With Taylor now free , all she wants to know is who killed her mother .
Raleigh police declined to comment on the court 's decision Wednesday evening or the status of the case but urged anyone with information to come forward .
" It is just not over , " Pharr said .
" There is a lot of questions .
Where is this person ?
Who did it ?
Now what ? "
BANGKOK  A ninth church was vandalized Monday in Malaysia in a series of arson attacks that have raised religious tensions surrounding a dispute over the use of the word “ Allah ” by Christians in this mostly Muslim nation .
“ Allah ” is the common term for God in Malay - language Bibles , but the government and many Muslim groups insist that the word should be reserved for use in Islam .
The attacks , which began on Friday , came after a court ruling on Dec. 31 that overturned a government ban on the use of “ Allah ” by Christians .
That ruling has been stayed while the government appeals .
Only one of the churches has been seriously damaged , and some of the attacks were minor .
In Monday ’s attack , the Sidang Injil Borneo Church in the central state of Negeri Sembilan was slightly damaged when its door was burned , according to local reports .
WASHINGTON ( PAI ) –AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka had a positive reaction to the White House summit on health care that Democratic President Barack Obama convened with bipartisan congressional leaders on Feb. 25 — more than he had for Obama ’s health care blueprint released three days before .
But as far as Trumka was concerned , the GOP behaved at the summit just as it has through the whole health care debate : Saying “ no ” to everything that helps workers .
Meanwhile , other union leaders and members trained their sights on Congress .
Obama brought 37 congressional leaders together for a day - long televised public discussion of health care , after lawmakers showed no signs of final action on massive — but vastly different — health insurance revision bills Congress passed last year .
Obama used the Senate bill as a blueprint for his own plan , and which formed the basis of the discussion .
His plan would impose a 40 % excise tax on “ high - cost ” insurance — plans costing more than $ 27,500 yearly for a family — starting in 2018 .
He also would fine those eligible companies that refused to offer workers health care $ 2,000 per worker yearly .
One cost control would be a commission to order rollbacks of insurance company rate hikes .
“ The people really left out in the cold are working families , ” the president declared at one point in the deliberations .
The Republicans at the summit roundly rejected Obama ’s ideas , and anything else from the Democrats .
Ignoring facts , House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , declared the U.S. “ has the best health care system in the world ” and should not change .
Obama ’s White House had forced union leaders in mid-January to swallow the excise tax , despite their own opposition and that of the rank and file .
That did n’t stop Trumka from being positive about the health care summit — and criticizing the GOP .
“ It has been 13 months since we began debating health care , and the process has been painstaking and tough .
But comprehensive reform is now more urgent than ever .
You need look no further than the unconscionable price increases being pushed onto consumers from insurance companies , such as the 39 % increase recently levied by Anthem Blue Cross in California , ” the AFL - CIO chief said .
“ But Republicans showed once again they have no intention of working to solve the health care crisis .
They turned their backs on people who need health care as well as those struggling to afford the high cost of health care .
Instead of offering solutions , they have offered obstruction and political posturing , ” he stated .
In a bow to labor ’s own objections to taxing health care , Trumka said , “ The reforms on the table from the president are not perfect .
They do not add up to the bill we would have written .
We will keep working with the Congress to improve them until health care reform is signed into law , and afterwards .
But we are within sight of real health care reform . ”
Trumka got agreement on the health care bill ’s imperfection from the pro-worker Democrat at the summit who has toiled longest on health care , Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich .
Dingell said his father — who held the House seat before him — introduced an universal , affordable health care bill during the Truman administration .
Rep. Dingell said , “ The last perfect piece of legislation was handed down on stone tablets at Mt. Sinai . ”
Obama ’s plan was an attempt to again revive the stalled health care legislation , by taking the Senate - passed health care bill — much of which is anathema to workers and unions — and grafting on some compromises .
A top Obama aide , Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer , made it clear that Obama wants Democrats to use any and all legislative tactics to overcome the Senate Republican filibuster against the measure .
That includes sidelining the GOP , if it does n’t cooperate , by using “ reconciliation , ” a tactic meant for budget and tax bills .
Reconciliation needs only 51 senate votes , not 60 ; filibusters are banned .
But Obama ’s plan got a less - warm reaction from Trumka .
“ We look forward to moving … toward the goal of quality , affordable health care for all Americans .
Republicans in Congress have an opportunity to stand with working families or continue to protect the profits of the insurance industry .
We are prepared to work with the White House and leadership in Congress to advance a comprehensive health care bill that will be passed into law , ” Trumka ’s statement said after Obama released his own plan Feb. 22 .
The Steelworkers included a link to Obama ’s plan in their health care activists ’ toolkit , while vowing to keep campaigning against one of the Senate ’s most - onerous schemes that Obama kept : Taxing peoples ’ health insurance .
“ We must continue pushing for a final health insurance reform bill that guaran - tees us quality , affordable health care for all , with the choice of a public health insurance option and NO excise tax on our benefits , ” USW ’s toolkit states .
“ On Jan. 14 , the AFL - CIO announced changes that had been worked out to a proposed excise tax in the health insurance reform bill .
The changes should make the bill better for all working families , not just those in a union , ” the USW adds .
“ We wo n’t stop working to make this bill better , ” USW President Leo Gerard said .
Other unions concentrated more on lobbying Congress in the days leading up to the summit .
The United Food and Commercial Workers , labor - backed Health Care for America Now and the Service Employees set up a mass drive to flood Congress with e-mails , wires , blogs , twitters and calls on health care .
They want lawmakers stand up to the insurers and finally pass comprehensive , affordable and universal health care .
In a full - page ad in Politico , UFCW thanked Obama “ for showing us the way forward on health care reform . ”
Then it demanded Congress approve Obama ’s framework , because “ delay is not an option for the men and women who check groceries , stock shelves , cut meat , make soup , clean buildings , care for children an care for the sick and aged . ”
SEIU and some allies staged a week - long march that reached Capitol Hill from Philadelphia on Feb. 24 .
Neither the communications nor the march , which had more than a hundred participants , focused on Obama ’s plan .
SEIU President Andrew Stern , speaking before the march , blasted insurers who “ jack up their premiums ” nationwide and drop people from coverage daily .
“ And because our system is broken , we are even losing loved ones , ” he added .
That included health care activist Melanie Shouse , who died of breast cancer while “ still fighting with her insurance company that refused to cover her chemotherapy . ”
The Philadelphia - Washington march was in her memory .
Obama “ recognized that people like Melanie should not have to lose their life because of an insurance company refuses treatment .
That insurance companies cannot be allowed to gouge Americans with rate increases …
And that working families deserve health insurance that covers more and costs less , ” Stern concluded .

Today , highly qualified women — and there are more of them than ever — tend to want to work , even if that means forgoing children ; by their mid-40s , one in three German women live in childless households , the highest proportion in Europe along with Austria .
At the same time , more and more women need to work , either as single mothers or because their partner cannot support a family alone .
Now , said Ms. Schwesig , who is also family minister in Mecklenburg - Vorpommern , a northeastern state , the mothers who stay at home are increasingly those with less education and sometimes an immigrant background , those whose children would , in her view , “ benefit the most from visiting a childcare facility all day . ”
In late 2001 , an O.E.C.D. study of literacy skills of 15 - year - olds stunned Germany by ranking it 21st out of 27 and among the last in terms of social mobility , even though it has Europe ’s largest economy .
Two years later , the government , Social Democratic at the time , made available € 4 billion , or $ 5.7 billion , to introduce all - day programs at 10,000 schools by 2009 .
In the end , some 7,200 schools took part , joining a small existing stock .
Intentionally or not , the mostly male establishment unleashed a long - incipient power : mothers chafing to work who needed longer school hours .
In the rectory next to Neuötting ’s 15th - century St. Nicolas Roman Catholic Church , the priest , Florian Wöss , reluctantly accepts the change .
His parish runs two kindergartens for children over 3 .
More mothers have asked him to accept younger children .
“ I do n’t like the fact that more mothers feel they have to hand over their children and go to work , ” he said .
“ But it is a reality . ”
Local clergy debated whether to stall the trend by simply refusing , he said .
“ We came to the conclusion that the pressure is so overwhelming and so multilayered that we ca n’t stop it . ”
Wolfgang Gruber of the Bavarian education authority concurs .
He uses words like “ flood ” and “ avalanche ” to describe the demand for afternoon schooling .
From 2006 to 2009 , only 40 primary schools in Bavaria converted .
This school year , the number of all - day programs shot to 150 .
The aim is to introduce afternoon classes in 540 of the 2,300 primary schools , Mr. Gruber said .

UC Davis researchers searching for autism clusters in hopes of finding an environmental cause for the disorder have identified 10 clusters around the state , but the source of the clusters is not exactly what they expected .
The clusters , including five in metropolitan Los Angeles and one in San Diego , are centered on regional developmental services centers in areas with highly educated parents , primarily Caucasians , with high incomes .
In short , what they found were clusters of increased diagnostic rates for autism .
In one respect , the results were not surprising because it has long been known that high - income , highly educated white parents are more likely to have their children diagnosed with autism and more likely to have them diagnosed at an early age .
" Looking at clustering is often a way to uncover leads about problems in the environment , " said epidemiologist Irva Hertz - Picciotto , the senior author of the study .
" Mapping has a long history of being a way to get clues " about causes of disease .
She was , indeed , surprised by the findings -- " not that there are clusters with parents with higher education , but that it was so consistent across the board . "
In virtually every cluster they identified , the rate of autism was about twice as high within the cluster as in adjacent regions .
Hertz - Picciotto and her colleagues obtained birth records for 2,453,717 children born in the state between 1996 and 2000 .
By 2006 , the children had all reached at least age 6 , the age by which diagnosis of autism is generally accomplished .
State records showed that about 9,900 autism cases were in the records of the Department of Developmental Services .
The team reported in the journal Autism Research that they identified 10 clusters of autism among the 21 regional offices of the department and two potential clusters .
The clusters were primarily in the high - population areas of Southern California and , to a lesser extent , in the San Francisco Bay area .
The clusters were :
-- The Westside Regional Center in Culver City , which serves western Los Angeles County , including Culver City , Inglewood and Santa Monica .
-- The Harbor Regional Center , headquartered in Torrance , which serves southern Los Angeles County .
-- The North Los Angeles County Regional Center , in Van Nuys , which serves the San Fernando and Antelope valleys .
Two clusters were in this region .
-- The South Central Regional Center in Los Angeles , which serves Compton and Gardena .
-- The Regional Center of Orange County in Santa Ana .
-- The Regional Center of San Diego County , which serves San Diego and Imperial counties .
-- The Golden Gate Regional Center in San Francisco , which serves San Francisco , Marin and San Mateo counties .
There are two clusters in this area .
-- The San Andreas Regional Center in Campbell , which serves Santa Clara , Santa Cruz , Monterey and San Benito counties .
Increased incidence was also noted in two other regions , the Central Valley Regional Center in Stockton and the Valley Mountain Regional Center in Fresno .
The incidence of autism was not as high in those regions , however .
Because the team analyzed birth locations and not the location of diagnosis , it is highly unlikely that the parents moved into the cluster regions to seek care , Hertz - Picciotto said .
" In the U.S. , the children of older , white and highly educated parents are more likely to receive a diagnosis of autism or autism spectrum disorder , " said lead author Karla C. Van Meter , who was a graduate student when the data were collected but is now at the Sonoma County Department of Public Health .
" For this reason , the clusters we found are probably not a result of a common environmental exposure .
Instead , the differences in education , age and ethnicity of parents comparing births in the cluster versus those outside the cluster were striking enough to explain the clusters . "
The team is now looking elsewhere for possible causes .
Some previous studies have hinted that exposure to pesticides may play a role and a study in Texas showed that exposure to mercury in the environment -- but not in vaccines -- could be a causative agent .
" We are casting a wide net , looking at everything we can -- pesticides , medical conditions in the mother , medications , flame retardants , etc. , " Hertz - Picciotto said .
The problem , she conceded , is that , if the exposure is truly widespread , then linking it to autism will be very difficult .

Iran has arrested seven people linked to a US - funded Farsi - language radio station for allegedly fomenting unrest , and accused some of the suspects of working for American spy agencies , Iranian state media reported Sunday .
The official IRNA news agency and Iran 's state radio both cited an Intelligence Ministry statement saying the suspects played a role in violent anti-government demonstrations in Teheran on December 27 , 2009 .
On that day , at least eight people were killed and hundreds were arrested during clashes between opposition supporters and security forces .
The violence was the worst since authorities launched a harsh crackdown immediately after Iran 's disputed presidential election in June .
IRNA quoted the ministry statement as saying " some of them have been officially hired by the US intelligence agencies . "
State radio said the suspects were trained outside of Iran in sabotage , disturbing public order , spreading rumors and overthrowing a government by soft means .
It also said the seven planned to take part in opposition demonstrations expected on February 11 , when Iran marks the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution that brought the country 's hardline clerical establishment to power .
It did not identify the suspects or say when they were detained .
The arrests may be part of a government effort to discredit the opposition .
Iran 's hardline rulers frequently accuse its opponents of being " stooges " of the country 's enemies and of trying to topple the Islamic system .
The US - sponsored Radio Farda , meaning " Radio Tomorrow , " is Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty 's Farsi - language service .
The station , which has bases in Prague , Czech Republic , and Washington , DC , has been broadcasting since 2003 .
RFE / RL's spokesman in Prague , Julian Knapp , expressed concern over the arrests , but said the station has no independent confirmation of them .
" Since the contested elections last June , there has been a harshcrackdown on independent media and civil society in Iran , " Knapp saidin a statement .
" These arrests seem to be the latest evidence of thisincreasing pressure on media and the freedom of expression .
" Iran has repeatedly accused the US and other Western powers of fueling the country 's postelection unrest in a bid to oust the country ' sclerical regime .
Most recently , Teheran said it had detained two German diplomats itaccused of playing a role in the December protests , and accused Germanyof meddling in Iran 's internal affairs .
Germany denied the allegations , and said it had no knowledge about any diplomats being detained .

It 's easy to take a couple months of charts and declare that the future will continue the present trend .
That 's what the Green Shooters / Recovery crowd is doing .
But when you step back and put things into historical perspective , when you analyze the fundamentals of the economy , then it changes everything .
It smooths out all the temporary stimulus created by the federal government that is destined to run out soon .
This chart from David Rosenberg sums things up quite well .
I should note that the chart above does n't include everything .
For instance , it fails to mention the conditions in the housing sector .
Or the conditions in the credit markets .
Or the conditions of the wage earners of the nation .
I 'm not saying that the Green Shooters / Recovery crowd is n't providing a needed service .
People want to here good news when they are scared and depressed .
The Onion gives a great example of this from last May .
Tired of hearing the grim truth about their economic future , Americans demanded that the bald - faced lies resume immediately , particularly whenever politicians feel the need to divulge another terrifying problem with Wall Street , the housing market , or any one of a hundred other ticking time bombs everyone was better off not knowing about .
In addition , citizens are requesting that the phrase , " It will only get worse before it gets better , " be permanently replaced with , " Things are going great .
Enjoy yourselves . "
...
" From now on , just tell me the bullshit I want to hear , " Pletcher added .
" Tell me my savings are okay , everybody has a job , and we 're No. 1 again .
Please , just lie to my face . "
So you see , when people tell you that the bad times are over and everything will be golden from here on , just remember that the American public demanded it .
This is probably going to look like a commercial for the Calera company but I ’ll say right off the bat that I have no connection or financial interest in them .
What I do have is a scientist ’s interest in them .
Here ’s a statistic that shocked me : cement manufacturing is responsible for 5 % of global CO2 emissions and in the U.S. , cement production represents 2.9 % of overall energy usage .
What Calera has figured out how to do is use CO2 from factory emissions to make concrete .
And here ’s the amazing part :
Calera estimates that each cubic yard of its concrete would soak up more than 1,000 lb of CO2 .
In contrast , producing a cubic yard of traditional concrete generates more than 500 lb of CO2 .
Most of the info in this blog entry is from a recent article in Chemical & Engineering News ( Amer. Chem . Soc. membership req ’d ) called “ Seeking To Cement A Green Future ” .
In the article the talk about several new cement manufacturing start - up companies that are aiming to make “ green ” cement and wallboard .
But the part about Calera was what really caught my interest .
From the article :
To make cement , manufacturers heat limestone in a kiln to 2,650 °F .
The process eliminates chemically bound water molecules , releases CO2 , and produces a marble - sized material called clinker , which is then ground to a fine powder .
Gypsum is added , and the resulting cement is mixed with water , sand , and aggregates to produce concrete .
The rehydration causes an exothermic chemical reaction that hardens the mix .
Brent Constantz , Calera ’s chief executive officer and an associate professor of geological and environmental sciences at Stanford University , plans to produce cement and aggregate that will enable the production of concrete with a negative CO2 footprint .
In Calera ’s process , CO2 from hot industrial flue gas is bubbled through mineral - rich seawater or hard water .
Calcium and magnesium carbonates precipitate out of the solution and are transformed into two concrete ingredients : a synthetic limestone aggregate and an amorphous calcium carbonate with cementlike properties .
“ Our process is akin to the skeletogenic process of corals and other marine organisms that precipitate carbonates from seawater , ” Constantz says .
Calera estimates that each cubic yard of its concrete would soak up more than 1,000 lb of CO2 .
In contrast , producing a cubic yard of traditional concrete generates more than 500 lb of CO2 .
For the precipitation to occur , the solution must have a high pH .
Depending on the water source , Constantz tells C&EN , the company can opt to use a proprietary , low - energy electrochemical process to add alkalinity .
The full process is being tested at the company ’s Moss Landing pilot plant near Monterey , Calif .
Will this eliminate all 5 % of the CO2 generated from the manufacture of concrete ?
No .
There are some conditions that must be met in order for a plant to be viable .
Given the mass - balance challenges of creating sufficient carbonates from flue gas and water , Constantz says Calera will have to carefully select its locations .
The ideal site would include a power plant to supply CO2 , a concrete ready - mix plant , and a water desalination plant .
He says Calera ’s wastewater , when stripped of its calcium and magnesium , could be inexpensively desalinated .
And salt from the desalination could resupply Calera with raw material for the electrochemical plant .
So , of course not all cement can be made in this way .
But , because of the negative carbon footprint of the process , every pound of concrete made using this process is the carbon equivalent of NOT making 2 pounds of cement in the conventional process .
If one - third of all cement made used the Calera process , it would be the same as eliminating all CO2 emissions from current cement manufacturing .
Put another way , founder of Calera , Brent Constantz , says “ For every ton of cement we make , we are sequestering half a ton of CO2 ″ .
It ’s worth having a look at the video on Calera ’s website .
It features Carl Pope , the former Executive Director of the Sierra Club , speaking quite favorably about this exciting new technology .
It should be noted that there are some skeptics .
You ’ll find doubters HERE and HERE .
However , if Calera ’s claims turn out to be true and their pilot facility , now operational , proves their concept , this is just one more example demonstrating why we need to value and invest in science and scientific R&D in this country .
The more resources we provide to smart , clever , capable entrepreneurs like the ones at Calera , the faster we will be able to solve the most vexing problems associated with carbon emissions .
As Vinod Khosla , a technology investor who is backing this venture puts it , “ this is so game - changing it could completely change the nature of the carbon problem this planet is currently dealing with . ”
And that is cool .
I ’m just sayin ’ …
HIV is the cure ( Image : Voisin / Phanie / Rex Features )
A company is planning to inject people with an HIV vaccine made of the deadly virus itself , albeit a deactivated version .
Vaccines against many viruses , including flu , are made from deactivated versions of those viruses , but such an approach was previously dismissed as too risky in the case of HIV .
Now Virxsys of Gaithersburg , Maryland , is resurrecting the controversial approach , thanks to successful tests of a similar vaccine against SIV – also known as simian HIV – in monkeys .

“ We said ‘ let ’s use HIV against itself ’ , and that ’s what we ’re doing , ” says Gary McGarrity , Virxsys ’s vice president of scientific and clinical affairs .
High - profile flop
The idea of turning to the virus itself follows years of frustration with prospective vaccines based on viruses other than HIV , such as adenoviruses that cause colds .
Adenoviruses have been modified to carry parts of the HIV virus .
Although there were hints of modest success with one such vaccine last year , the previous best bet proved to be a high - profile flop in 2007 , during a trial dubbed “ STEP ” .
Crucially , the new tests in monkeys suggest a vaccine based on HIV itself might be more effective than these attempts .
The company is planning to apply for approval to perform human trials .
Virxsys says such trials would initially be only in people who already carry the virus , rather than in healthy people at risk of infection .
This will certainly make for a less controversial trial , as it would avoid any chance of the vaccine going “ live ” and infecting people who did n’t have HIV to start with .
Virus slashed
For now , though , the company ’s latest results , presented on Thursday at the 2010 annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in San Francisco , are limited to a vaccine based on a deactivated version of simian HIV called SIV .
Virxsys researchers described how they vaccinated monkeys , and then six months later injected them with SIV .
Within weeks of receiving the injection of SIV , concentrations of the virus had fallen by at least 95 per cent in those treated .
After a year , when the trial ended , these concentrations remained low , whereas untreated monkeys became progressively sicker as their immune systems were depleted by the virus .
“ We expect them to die in the next few weeks , ” says McGarrity .
What ’s more , in vaccinated animals , concentrations of CD4 + cells – the immune cells that both HIV and SIV attack and kill – remained the same , suggesting their immune systems were able to withstand SIV infection .
“ These results give us the green light to proceed , ” says Franck Lemiale of Virxsys , who led the two - year trial and presented the results .
“ We can not be sure that this will work as well in humans , but this is the point of performing clinical trials .
Entry only
Virxsys is convinced that the HIV vaccine it is planning would be safe because , as in their SIV vaccine , all the genes that would usually make it infectious and able to multiply itself would be removed .
“ It ca n’t replicate , ” says Lemiale .
All that would be left of the dozen or so genes that HIV normally has would be the three – called gag , pol and rev – that enable it to infiltrate cells and embed itself into their DNA .
This means the vaccine ’s version of the virus only undergoes one cycle of protein production , which enables it to get inside a few cells , but then ca n’t spread further .
The hope is that the vaccine version of HIV would invade sentinel cells , known as dendritic cells – as the SIV - based vaccine did in the monkeys .
These would then prime the immune system ’s T - cells to attack the real virus , should it turn up in the body .
Dodge this
The monkey trials also suggested that a vaccine based on HIV itself might be more effective than previous vaccines based on cold viruses .
The “ STEP ” HIV - vaccine trial had to be halted prematurely in 2007 when it emerged that antibodies produced by the body against the vaccine may have provided HIV with more target cells to infect , speeding its spread .
But Virxsys ’s tests in monkeys revealed that the animals did not produce antibodies against the SIV - based vaccine itself .
This suggests that an HIV - based vaccine might dodge the problems that dogged the STEP trial .
Potent mix ?
Virxsys is not the first company to successfully test SIV - based vaccines in monkeys .
A team led by David Evans of Harvard Medical School in Southborough , Massachusetts , reported successfully protecting monkeys a year ago with a similar “ single - cycle ” vaccine , this time containing all but one of the SIV genes , but he had no intention of transferring the work to people .
There is still the possibility , however , that in people that already have HIV , the vaccine version of the virus could recombine with the incumbent full - strength strain , and evolve into an even more potent adversary .
Evans thinks Virxsys has made this less likely by limiting the vaccine virus to a single cycle of infection .
“ That certainly makes it safer than a replication - competent live attenuated virus , ” he says .
It ’s Candid Camera for the Internet age , a lethally effective political tool that Mr. O’Keefe has helped pioneer between college and graduate - school studies .
He has lampooned liberals by inviting them to become pen pals of imprisoned terrorists , and , more darkly , recorded Planned Parenthood staff members agreeing that he can designate his donation exclusively to the abortion of black babies .

But never has his work had anything like the impact of the Acorn exposé , conducted by Mr. O’Keefe and a friend he met through Facebook , 20 - year - old Hannah Giles .
Their travels through various offices of Acorn , the national community organizing group , caught its low - level employees in five cities sounding eager to assist with tax evasion , human smuggling and child prostitution .
What began as a firestorm on conservative talk shows spread across the news media and to both parties in Congress , as Mr. O’Keefe and Ms. Giles unveiled videos of more cities where Acorn workers had misbehaved .
Jon Stewart , whose “ Daily Show ” on Comedy Central leans to the left , highlighted the videos , and a House proposal to cut off all federal money to Acorn passed Thursday by a vote of 345 to 75 .
In a telephone interview on Thursday night — when he was editing still more Acorn footage — Mr. O’Keefe said that when he accepted Ms. Giles ’s idea that they take on Acorn , “ I thought we ’d get some snippets ” worth posting to the Web .
“ I ’m a skinny nerd , the least convincing pimp in the world , ” he said .
Instead , a succession of Acorn workers advised the pair on how to smuggle Salvadoran girls into the country , falsify a loan application to buy a house for use as a brothel and even claim the under - age prostitutes as dependents for tax purposes .
( CNN ) --
Trafficking of children and human organs is occurring in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti , killed more than 150,000 people , and left many children orphans , Haitian Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive said Wednesday .
" There is organ trafficking for children and other persons also , because they need all types of organs , " Bellerive said in an exclusive interview with CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .
He did not give specifics , but asked by Amanpour if there is trafficking of children , Bellerive said , " The reports I received say yes . "
Haiti is trying to locate displaced children and register them so they can either be reunited with other family members or put up for adoption , Bellerive said .
But , he said , illegal child trafficking is " one of the biggest problems that we have . "
Many groups appear to be legitimate , " but a lot of organizations -- they come and they say there were children on the streets .
They 're going to bring them to the [ United ] States , " he said .
Bellerive said he 's trying to work with embassies in Port - au - Prince to protect Haiti 's children from traffickers .
" Any child that is leaving the country has to be validated by the embassy under a list that they give me , with all the reports , " he said .
Speaking at his temporary headquarters in a police station near the Port - au - Prince Airport , Bellerive said the first thing Haitian officials seek to confirm is whether the children have adoption papers before they leave the country .
In Washington , the State Department said Wednesday it is moving cautiously on the issue of adoptions from Haiti .
" We want to be sure that when a child has been identified , that due diligence has been done to make sure that this is truly an orphan child and not a child that actually has family , " said State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley .
" Sometimes if you push too hard , too fast there can be unintended consequences .
So we are being very , very careful . "
" We respect the sovereignty of Haiti and their right to control the departure of Haitian children .
So we think the system that has been established is working effectively .
I know there is a perception out there of ' cut through the red tape . '
But there are very good reasons we want to make sure this process works well , " Crowley said .
On the broader issue of Haitian children , Bellerive told Amanpour the government will reopen schools Monday in most of the country .
He said there were particular problems in Port - au - Prince .
" We can not open one school and not the other .
But some of the schools want to operate right now .
They say if there are tents -- if there are facilities and we can help them -- they are willing to open very rapidly . "
Bellerive also highlighted the critical importance of getting enough tents and shelters to Haiti before the rainy season begins in May .
He said he did n't know where all the tents promised by aid agencies and governments are .
" We have reports that they 've already sent 20,000 tents maybe , and 20,000 more are on the way .
But yesterday , when we did n't see the tents and we did n't see any action to organize the shelters , the president himself asked to see the storage place and we only counted 3,500 tents . "
Bellerive said President Rene Preval asked for 200,000 tents to house between 400,000 and 500,000 people .
" We are very preoccupied about the consequences of all those people on the street , if it starts to rain . "
The prime minister also rejected criticism from within Haiti and overseas that his government needs to be more visible to the Haitian people .
" We are in charge .
Frankly I do n't understand what that position is that we are not visible , " he said .
" I almost feel that I spend more time talking to radio , television , than I am working . "
" I know it 's part of my job and I have to communicate .
But I really feel that I have spent too much time doing that . "
Bellerive also said he does not believe it 's necessary to relocate the capital to another part of Haiti .
" I have to wait for technical and scientific evaluation , but from what I 've heard until now , Port - au - Prince will stay there . "
" Tokyo is still there , Los Angeles is still there .
We just have to prepare a better constructed Port - au - Prince , a safer Port - au - Prince , " he said .
He also acknowledged the need for more transparency and new procedures to prevent corruption in Haiti .
But he said 70 to 80 percent of the aid coming to the country right now does not go through the Haitian government .
Bellerive said about 90 percent of American aid , for example , goes through non-governmental organizations .
" They are accountable to the American government , but not to the Haitian government , " he said .
The prime minister told Amanpour that he does not believe people overseas are helping Haiti out of a moral obligation .
" I believe it 's a more pragmatic responsibility , " he said .
" I believe Haiti could be an interesting market in the midterm .
We are 10 million [ people ] here and it's a market . "
When the inevitable police report is filled out , expect all the old cliches .
" She seemed so harmless , " the neighbors will say .
" We never thought so much evil could be hiding under such a cute little bow . "
But we knew better .

WEST VALLEY CITY -- A West Valley City police officer is waiting to be formally charged after being cited for DUI over the weekend , but Lt. Kory Newbold was not booked into jail .
Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Jeff
Nigbur says they made the decision to keep him out of jail because of safety concerns .
" This case was definitely different than most of them that we see .
Not every DUI that we come across and charge is booked into jail .
In this specific case , we were worried about the safety of the officer getting booked into a facility , " said Nigbur .
He adds that if Newbold was put in jail , he could run into people he had recently arrested and anything could happen after that , putting a number of people at risk .
Lt. Kory Newbold of the West Valley Police Department was pulled over on suspicion of DUI near 3900 South and 800 West Saturday night .
" We felt due to his safety and him possibly having connection with people inside that jail , we felt it was a better response to contact his department , let them know about what 's going on and also release him to a responsible person , " said Nigbur .
Newbold was pulled over by UHP DUI Squad Section Commander Steve Winward near 900 West and 3900 South around 11 p.m. Saturday night .
Winward had been out assisting Salt Lake County police officers on a call and was returning to the Salt Lake City area when he noticed a car driving erratically and speeding .
Once he pulled the car over , he could smell a strong odor of alcohol as he approached the vehicle .
" He got through pretty much all of the tests , and then he mentioned he was a law enforcement officer , " said Nigbur .
" From there on we took him into custody for DUI and took him over to ‘ special ops , ' which is at the Salt Lake County Jail . "
There Newbold blew on an Intoxilyzer to check his blood alcohol level .
Once all the paperwork was filled out , it was determined instead of booking Newbold into jail they would take him to his girlfriend 's house nearby .
Nigbur says they notified their chain of command and West Valley City Police about where was being taken and why .
Nigbur says Newbold will not receive special treatment because he is a police officer and he 'll have to face the consequences of his actions just like anyone else .
The highway patrol will complete a charging document and present it , along with the evidence , to the district attorney .
That could take about a week .
West Valley police are n't commenting on the incident , other than to say they have a police lieutenant who 's been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation .

( Newser ) – Frantic Democrats are circulating a 2008 interview in which Scott Brown insinuated that Barack Obama was born out of wedlock .
While discussing Bristol Palin 's pregnancy during the Republican convention , Brown drew a parallel to Obama 's mother , who was 18 when he was born .
When another interviewee on the program noted that she was married , Brown responded , " Well , I do n't know about that " and laughed .

Asked today whether he would apologize for the remark , Brown responded , " I was asked whether the president ’s parents were married .
I said I did n’t know . "

London , England ( CNN ) --
The club 's staff just were n't prepared for the crush .
But when you work for Mansfield Town -- an English non-league club that rarely attracts more than a few thousand fans -- a pre-match scrum big enough to delay kick off by 20 minutes and block traffic was the last thing to expect .
More than 7,000 supporters , and reporters from as far afield as Brazil , turned up for the clash against Gateshead at Field Mill last week , not because it was a local derby , nor a top - of - the - table clash .
They had a far greater incentive : the club 's fans were invited to pay whatever they wanted for a ticket .
" I 've been to restaurants abroad that let you pay what you think the meal was worth so we were thinking how can we apply that here ? " explained Andrew Perry , chairman of Mansfield Town .
But then Perry got inspiration from an unlikely source , the British rock band Radiohead .
The group famously released their last studio album " In Rainbows " online , inviting fans to pay what they wanted for a limited period .
While many downloaded the album for free , according to Radiohead 's publisher Warner / Chappell the band made more money through the " Pay What You Want " model than from sales of previous album " Hail to the Thief . "
" I download a lot of music and I actually bought ' In Rainbows . '
I paid for that .
I was happy to pay £ 5 ( $ 8 ) for it , " admitted Perry .
" You get put in the position where you start to think about them , the band , and what they deserve .
Why could n't that work here ? "
Translating that business model to the turnstiles has , for one game at least , been a huge success .
The match secured the club 's biggest crowd in eight years .
Their previous home game attracted just 2,800 fans .
Perry is not revealing how much money the club made from the bumper turnout , but fans paid anything from 5 cents to $ 80 for a ticket that would usually cost $ 25 .
Times have been tough for Mansfield Town since relegation to the realms of amateur football .
They have seen two TV deals , the bedrock of modern football financing , disappear when two satellite broadcasters who had invested millions of dollars to secure live rights went bust , leaving holes in the finances .
" The collapse [ of TV funding ] was a wake - up call and you have to say that this is a great idea , " said Michael Brunskill of the Football Supporters ' Federation .
" The clubs are realizing they have to do more to attract fans .
They need to find ways to get young people going to the grounds and , once you 've found a way to do that , they are hooked for life . "
The need to attract and enthuse new fans in testing financial conditions has prompted innovative ideas in other parts of England .
Northampton
Town , who play in the fourth tier of English football , recently offered fans a free , week - long holiday in mainland Spain or Tenerife if they renewed their season ticket .
And in 2007 Ebbsfleet United , a team in the same division as Mansfield , was bought by community football Web site MyFootballClub.co.uk .
Fans could buy a stake in the club for $ 55 and in return vote on everything from team selection to what players to sign , the first team in world football to do this .
For now , though , Perry and other staff at Mansfield are considering how to repeat their unique experiment .
" We put our necks on the line , it was worth it and we would do it again because of the fans , " Perry said .
" Mansfield has had a tough time , it 's an old mining and hosiery town and it 's getting back on its feet .
But I know how the town is working and there 's some great enterprise going on here . "
With a near full house and media interest , Mansfield Town 's gamble was a success .
Except in one way : they lost 2 - 0 .
Full body scanners at US airports can transmit digital strip search images of people , contrary to US Transportation Security Authority assurances .
The TSA has maintained that such scanners cannot store or transmit scanned body images of people , stating that " the machines have zero storage capability . "
A TSA release stated that any scanned full body image " wo n't be stored , transmitted or printed , and [ will be ] deleted immediately once viewed . "
This is wrong too .
But according to documents obtained under freedom of information laws by EPIC ( Electronic Privacy Information Center ) , they do indeed have a storage capability .
According to the TSA procurement specification , v1.02 , 23 September 2008 , the scanner , termed a Whole Body Imager ( WBI ) will have " a high capacity read / write drive ... to permit data uploads and downloads . "
It will also " provide capabilities for data transfers via USB devices " and support both Ethernet and TCP / IP .
Field reporting data for up to a year will be stored on the hard drive .
The procurement spec specifies two operating modes .
In screening mode the WBI system will " prohibit the storage and exporting of passenger images . "
However , " when not being used for normal screening operations , the capability to capture images of non-passengers for training and evaluation purposes is needed " and this is provided in test mode .
In screening mode , the system will be prohibited from exporting passenger image data .
The spec states : " During Test Mode , the WBI shall not be capable of conducting passenger screening . "
Therein lies the rub .
The system does not know a passenger from a non-passenger - both are simply humans inside the system 's scanning field .
The spec does not state how the system is switched between modes .
Another document obtained by EPIC says one system , identified by the government , can record images for training purposes .
This capability is configurable at a superuser level and will be disabled in operational systems .
So that leaves us with full body scanners that can capture strip search scanned images of people when in test mode and export them either by USB or TCP / IP transfers ( which are subject to certain security restrictions ) , and at least one system that can store scanned images .
That leaves privacy campaigners salivating at the mouth with the possibilities for information abuse , and the TSA with much egg on its face for issuing misleading statements . ®
A man has been charged over an attack on a Indian taxi driver in Ballarat , in Victoria 's west , early this morning .
Police say the man from Navigators , near Ballarat , racially abused and bashed the 24 - year - old taxi driver at a Skipton Street service station about 2:00 am ( AEST ) .
The taxi driver was not badly hurt in the attack .
The 48 - year - old Navigators man has been charged with two counts of unlawful assault , one count of making threats to kill , and one count of criminal damage .
He will appear in the Ballarat Magistrates Court later today .
The President of the Ballarat Indian Association , Khushi Maharaj , says media reports of other attacks may be fuelling copycats .
" It may have been because of the media blow - out in Melbourne and other cities that this sort of thing is creeping into Ballarat also , " Mr Maharaj said .
" I think it 's too much of the media exposure like that sometimes breeds jealousy also and it spreads . "
Mr Maharaj says the bashing will damage Ballarat 's reputation .
" I am really surprised about it because I have never heard of a taxi driver being bashed in Ballarat , " he said .
" I am a bit disappointed because I thought Ballarat was a very friendly place and we never expected something to happen here . "
The chairman of the Ballarat Taxi Co-operative , Stephen Armstrong , says he is grateful the driver was not badly hurt , but says he is disappointed by the attack .
" It 's just sad that a guy 's out there going about his business , providing a service for the patrons of Ballarat , and has to suffer that kind of verbal abuse and physical abuse just going about the course of his duties , " Mr Armstrong said .
I wrote a post yesterday exploring how girls and women identify themselves or get identified as geeks .
In the course of doing that , I thought it was important to point out some of the sexist and misogynistic behaviors that seem unfortunately somewhat common in some geeky circles .
That post spawned some very interesting comments , but I was concerned that we were going down a different avenue of conversation , focused more on why male geeks mistreat female geeks than on how female geek identity is formed .
I hope nobody minds too much that I figured that conversation deserves its own post .
Now , to address the those comments , I ’d like to focus on a claim Jordan made :
I would argue that Female involvement gets special explanation because geek culture has been extremely misogynistic .
I would argue that this is a bit too broad of a generalizationâ€ ” would I say that even half of the geeks I ’ve met in person were sexist ?
â€ ” but it is not inaccurate .
All the actual behavior we ’d think of as misogynistic or sexist in geek culture has almost exclusively been visible to me on the internet ( or described by others in certain small , isolated contexts full of nerds , such as at certain conventions and CS departments ) .
Not that there are n’t woman - hating dorks wandering around the streets or at the cons I ’ve attendedâ€ ” just that certain anonymous or isolated social contexts make people feel they can let this side of themselves show .
So , yes , there is a sexist and misogynistic side to geek culture which is unfortunately quite common in some circles .
Saying that women get mistreated because geek culture is misogynistic , however , is somewhat tautological .
Let ’s take that a step further :
Why have so many geeks been so hostile to women ?
In the post from yesterday , I guessed at why there are more male than female geeks , and I think we can similarly hazard some guesses as to why many male geeks are misogynistic .
Basically I think this comes down to feeling rejected and threatened by womenâ€ ” either personally / romantically / sexually or in terms of professional and cultural identityâ€ ” and trying to cut women down to feel better about themselves .
Some geeks have indeed turned to coding or gaming or whatever to prove their worth as men , according greater worth to geeky knowledge than to traditional indexes of masculinity ; contemplating women excelling in these fields raises questions about how masculine they really are .
Others may feel resentful about rejection , which gets guys ( like in one of the above - linked posts ) claiming that the exclusiveness of computer culture is no worse than “ stupid fashinista culture . ”
They are resentful over feeling personally rejected , and frame their exclusiveness and rudeness as a response to women as a stereotyped “ other . ”
On the other hand , some are just desperate and socially inept , and may sincerely think that harassing women online might yield some kind of personal or sexual interaction .
As for the specific example of misogyny among gamers and sexism in the gaming industry , further explanations abound .
Perhaps the most compelling relate to the historical gender makeup of the industry , which was born of earlier - established , male - dominated academic and professional cultures .
You see this playing out in both design and marketing ( meant to titillate boys ) .
Based on my own experiences , I do n’t see “ geek culture , ” broadly speaking , as misogynistic .
Actually , I see it kind of torn between two mindsets : one , a sexist mindset built on isolation from women and the freedom of anonymity , and the other , an open - minded and welcoming mindset built on a rejection of “ mainstream ” norms and self - conscious ( even self - congratulatory ) embrace of the intellect and social progress .
This duality was hinted at by a keynote speaker at ROFLCon , who pointed out that “ Internet culture can be very sexist , homophobic and racist , ” but also allowed that this could be directed by netizens themselves :
“ If this is the culture we ’re building as internet nerds , lets have it be something we ’re proud of . ”
I think it ’s fairly easy to guess at how the sexist side of geek culture developed .
I wonder how the more open - minded side has developed , and what could be done to spread that .
Over the course of this week , you 've probably heard at least a little about the controversy surrounding a mistake in the IPCC 's 4th Assessment Report from 2007 .
Short version : The Working Group II section , which covers observed and projected impacts of climate change , states that Himalayan glaciers are " very likely " to disappear by 2035 .
Glaciologists say that 's bogus .
And the IPCC report , itself , sources the claim to a position paper put out by the World Wildlife Fund , rather than any peer - reviewed research .
The error was first pointed out by scientists within the climate research community .
As of yesterday , the IPCC has apologized , and is reviewing how such a sketchily sourced factoid made it into the final report .
So what should you take away from this incident ?
Two things :
It 's a mistake .
But mistakes happen , and this really is n't even a big one .
Climate science is science , not a religion .
It makes no claim to infallibility .
In fact , the whole thing with science , in general , is that it assumes mistakes will happen .
Systems like peer review exist to catch those mistakes .
Standards , like reproducibility and independent verification , push our knowledge , over time , closer to the truth .
The basic facts about climate science — that climate change is happening and that human activities are the most likely cause — do n't stand and fall on single sources .
They 're based on hundreds of peer - reviewed papers that , combined , lead to a robust conclusion .
That 's different from this claim , which was based on one source , and a flimsy one at that .
It should n't have made it into the IPCC report .
There are some critics who say there are other , similar , mistakes going on in Working Group II .
But neither of those things undermines the real science .
It 's also worth pointing out that the Himalayan glaciers really are retreating , just not so very fast .
The real problem lies in how the IPCC responded to criticism
While the mistake does n't undermine the well - sourced facts about climate change , the way it was handled does undermine public confidence in those well - sourced facts .
And that 's a big problem .
A scientist who reviewed the Working Group II report says he spotted the mistake before publication , and was ignored .
A scientist who pointed out the mistake after publication , in a report prepared for the Indian government , was publicly criticized as a practitioner of " voodoo science " by IPCC chairman Rajendra K. Pachauri .
It 's not OK that it took resounding pressure by the scientific community and the press in order to get this addressed .
Climate scientists have to deal with a whole lot of crap .
Most of the time , that crap is about as well - sourced as this glacier claim .
So it is , on one level , understandable that some scientists have developed a knee - jerk " circle the wagons " response to criticism .
But that response is very , very bad when it starts being applied to any criticism .
The Internet can't make us all armchair experts , so we have to rely on the people who really are experts to tell us what 's going on — and we have to be able to trust them to self correct .
The experts did that here , but they did it in a way that — to the average layman — made it look like they 're more interested in being " right " than being accurate .
That can't happen when there 's so much at stake .
Where 'd this all come from ?

The government has backed away from its proposals in the Digital Economy Bill to cut off people who have illegally shared files online .
In a response to a petition on the Number 10 website that petitioned Gordon Brown " to abandon Lord Mandelson 's plans to ban individuals from the internet based on their use of ' peer to peer ' file sharing " , the government says : " We will not terminate the accounts of infringers – it is very hard to see how this could be deemed proportionate except in the most extreme – and therefore probably criminal – cases . "
It adds : " We added account suspension to the list of possible technical measures which might be considered if our measures to tackle unlawful file - sharing through notifications and legal action are not as successful as we hope .
This is but one of a number of possible options on which we would seek advice from Ofcom – and others – if we decided to consider a third obligation on technical measures .
However what is clear is that we would need a rapid and robust route of appeal available to all consumers if we decided technical measures were needed . "
Although the original petition received just 550 signatures – far smaller than many others that have been rejected in the past , and only 50 more than are required for the proposal to be considered – it appears to have come as the government was concerned about the effect of the plans on its popularity .
The petition may also have struck a chord by pointing to the contradiction in the " three strikes " proposal and the government 's aim to get everyone online .
The petition noted : " The increasing role of the internet in access to society should not be underestimated .
Cutting off households deprives families of education , government services and freedom of speech . "
Thus the first line of the response reads :
" The government wants as many people as possible to enjoy all the benefits that broadband internet can bring . "
But the announcement marks a clear change from the proposals put forward in the original bill presented to the House of Lords .
That offered a number of " technical measures " that should be taken to limit the internet access of people found to have broken copyright law repeatedly .
Those included any measure which " prevents a subscriber from using the service to gain access to particular material , or limits such use ; suspends the service provided to a subscriber ; or limits the service provided to a subscriber in another way " .
Now the government is retreating from the idea of termination – although it is still retaining the idea of " temporary " suspension " as a last resort " .
Update : the Open Rights Group , which campaigns on digital rights , says that this is not a change in the government 's position .
ORG says :
" When is ' disconnection ' not disconnection ?
When it is ' account suspension ' , of course .
" The government therefore felt justified in a response to a petition on Friday in claiming that were not intending to ' disconnect ' families from the net after accusations of copyright infringement .
If you think they mean that their internet cabling will still be plugged in at the wall , then that 's true .
" If you think they mean that these families will be able to connect to the internet , well , no they wo n't .
Their connection will be switched off .
" Please do not be confused by the government 's semantics .
BIS [ the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills ] and DCMS [ the Department of Culture , Media and Sport ] decided in the summer that they would not refer to ' disconnecting ' users , because that sounds harsh and over the top .
' Temporary account suspension ' sounds much more reasonable .
" Language matters .
What journalist is going to run a story on ' temporary account suspension ' ( yawn ) ?
This is why the government has chosen these disingenuous terms : it 's just more spin . "
It concludes :
" ' Temporary account suspensions ' sound like the government would to suspend accounts for a few hours , or at most a day , to fit most people 's idea of ' temporary ' and ' suspension ' .
We doubt ' suspensions ' would be so brief .
We can assume what the government means to you and me is ' disconnection ' . "
We will speak to DBIS in the morning to see how long " temporary " is .
Scientists have discovered a biological quirk in bottlenose dolphins that could lead to a treatment for late - onset diabetes in humans .
Studies on the marine mammals found that healthy dolphins switch into a diabetic - like state overnight when they are not feeding , but revert to a normal physiology when they eat the following morning .
The extraordinary finding has led scientists to suggest that dolphins have a " genetic switch " that allows them to mimic diabetes while they are fasting , without suffering any ill effects .
If researchers can identify a similar genetic pathway in humans , they may be able to develop drugs to effectively switch off diabetes .
Some 2.2 m people in Britain have late onset , or type 2 diabetes , a figure that is expected to reach 4 m by 2025 as a consequence of rising levels of obesity .
The tissues of people with type 2 diabetes have become resistant to insulin so they lose the ability to control sugar levels in their blood .
The condition can damage the heart , eyes , kidneys and nerves and contributes to 5 % of all deaths , according to the World Health Organisation .
Dolphins appear to mimic diabetes to maintain high levels of blood sugar when food is scarce .
Like humans , dolphins need some sugar in their blood for their brains to function normally .
" It is our hope that this discovery can lead to novel ways to prevent , treat and maybe even cure diabetes in humans , " said Stephanie Venn - Watson , director of clinical research at the National Marine Mammal Foundation in San Diego .
Venn -Watson 's team analysed 1,000 blood samples from 52 dolphins while they fasted overnight and fed in the morning .
At night time , the dolphins ' metabolism changed dramatically and showed similar characteristics to that seen in people with type 2 diabetes .
" What 's interesting about this is when you look at dolphins fed in the morning , they revert back to a non-diabetic state , indicating that these animals may have a genetic fasting switch that can turn diabetes on and off , " Dr Venn - Watson told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Diego yesterday .
Humans and dolphins have the largest brains of all mammals and both have red blood cells that are exceptionally permeable to glucose and able to ferry large amounts of the sugar into the brain .
Scientists believe diabetes emerged in dolphins as an evolutionary adaptation to a high protein and low carbohydrate diet .
No other animal apart from humans shows the same complex range of diabetes - like symptoms as dolphins .
" Maybe this is a vestige of something dormant that could be awakened and used as a therapy or cure , " Venn - Watson said .
" There is no desire to make a dolphin a lab animal , but what we can do is compare their genes with human genes and look for evidence of a genetic switch , " he added .
In 2007 , scientists at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , identified a genetic switch in mice that lowers blood sugar levels , raising hopes that a similar mechanism exists in humans .
Mark Simmonds , international head of science at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society , said the prospect of using dolphins to study diabetes was " a grave concern " .
" Dolphins are intelligent and sophisticated animals which are vulnerable to stress and suffering when confined and removed from their natural environment and societies , " he said .
" The fact that dolphins in captivity experience ongoing stress adds to questions about the validity of studies of physiological processes that are intimately connected with the animals ' well - being . "
Why You Should n't Wait for Signs of Interest
by Squirrels
There are many , many women out there who wo n't give you any encouragement , even if they want you .
So if you wait around for HER to give you a sign of interest , you may miss a lot of opportunities .
Most girls wo n't open kino , for example .
You have to go ahead and touch them first ... really start to warm them up before they counter with their own touching .
If you get that early - on , consider yourself lucky and take full advantage .
Unless a girl is REALLY taken with you , she probably wo n't put forth any effort to further the relationship .
She 'll make opportunities but YOU have to capitalize on them .
This is a natural TEST .
Women offer openings , but unless they are extremely attracted they do not actively pursue .
This is the female nature -- receptiveness .
The chump who has no self - confidence will sit and wait for a sign of interest and , not receiving any , will hem and haw and wait aimlessly until his self - doubt overcomes him and he walks away .
Or she 'll glance over at him , but she wo n't smile and instead just looks the other way .
He 'll read that as disinterest and go mope in the corner .
Or he 'll be on a date with a girl and put his arm around her but she wo n't react at all ... she wo n't snuggle closer , wo n't look at him , acts like it did n't even happen .
And he 'll assume she 's not interested in him physically and back off .
But the truth is he NEVER GOT REJECTED .
He rejected HIMSELF because he took her lack of reaction as disinterest .
This is what Gunwitch and others mean when they say , " Make the ho say no . "
Remember ... girls can't give go - ahead signs to just any guy , because if they did , they 'd have EVERY guy out there wanting to bang them .
And often they feel uncomfortable giving those signs even to the guys they WANT , because even THAT can be seen as " slutty " , and they do n't want to appear too interested all at once .
You ever been at a party or in a nightclub / bar and seen a guy just walk right up to a girl you were trying to work up the nerve to talk to ... and start talking to her , putting his arm around her , etc , and she seemed to be unfazed by it ... and chuckled to yourself about how the guy was an ass and was just being obnoxious and could n't get any ?
Then later that night you find her warming up to him , seeking HIM out , smiling , giving out her number , etc ... and you wondered how she could POSSIBLY be taken in by his lame " routine " ?
She was into him from the BEGINNING .
During the proverbial " 7 seconds " , she had already decided that this guy made the first cut .
From then on it was simply a test of his persistence , to see if he felt confident that he was the real deal or if he would be overtaken by his insecurities in response to her indifference and take off .
Too many guys make that first cut , but the hot girl he 's talking to offers little in the way of encouragement .
This is the " mirror - test " .
With no positive feedback , a man receives no indication of his self - worth from the woman , so he has to derive it for himself .
If he looks at himself and sees one who is n't worthy of the woman in front of him , then he will reject himself .
He will wait for a sign of interest or encouragement and , receiving none , he will give up on a woman that he could have easily seduced .
If he truly BELIEVES that he has what it takes to seduce the girl , he will persist until outright rejected .
This is what 's " hard " about approaching , about revealing interest , and about escalating .
This is what most guys have so much trouble with ... taking control of their OWN lives when encouragement is not offered to them .
Do NOT ask , " Is she interested in me ? " Find out .
Do NOT wait for a sign of interest .
Assume she is interested .
Do NOT wait for the right moment .
MAKE it .
If a lack of encouragement forces you to quit at something as simple as picking up a girl ... what is she supposed to think you 're going to do when REAL problems come up , when you go through the hardship of raising kids and providing for their well - being ?
Act like you 've got a pair .
Do n't rely on other people to create your self - esteem for you .
The saga of GoonSwarm could only end in two ways .
The first was the way 90 % of alliances die , a tale so humdrum that it draws preemptive yawns as soon as someone begins launching into it : yet another tale of failure cascade woes .
External enemies at the gates , gradually declining participation , corps abruptly leaving and evacuating assets , and a final miserable defeat resulting in dissolution and recrimination .
That was n't going to happen to the Swarm .
We opted for something different : catastrophic self - immolation , setting off a storm of drama , idiocy and negligence which would forever reshape the balance of power in New Eden .

It started out innocuously enough .
We were at the outset of what could have become another Great War , defending successfully against the efforts of our various enemies to seize territory from us in Querious .
After the dramatic win in 49 - U , GoonSwarm was feeling pretty confident .
Everyone was focused on the conflict , and no one was focused on our director of finances , Niart Epar .
Or rather the absence of said director , who had been increasingly less active in the game .
While the leader of the alliance ( Karttoon ) was away from the game for a 1.5 week honeymoon , Niart was left in charge of the alliance wallet .
Given the way the Dominion sovereignty system works now - as a gigantic isk sink - this was a Big Deal ; if periodic bills are not paid by the alliance executor out of the correct wallet division , sov is abruptly lost in the unpaid system .
You can see where this is headed .
At 4:00 evetime on January 27th , sov bills came due all across New Eden .
These were for every ' legacy ' sov structures held over from pre-Dominion , for which CCP spawned TCUs for the territories held at the time of the patch .
For GoonSwarm , that meant the vast majority of the alliance 's holdings , which had remained mostly unchanged for a year .
Whoosh .
Sov drops in most of GoonSwarm territory .
Not only us , but Legion of Xdeath and Wildly Inappropriate .
At first the assumption was that this was a bug , given how efficient and well - coded Dominion is .
However , it turned out that all of these alliances had suffered a case of high - level idiotic neglect , and that we were all Probably Screwed .

style= " border : 0 px solid ; width : 200 px ; height : 125 px ; " />
Rather than bother giving our enemies a chance to brag about winning a war , GoonSwarm immediately pulled the plug on our territorial holdings and commenced evacuating assets to Syndicate .
We considered this to be the most prickish thing to do under the circumstances , and indeed the leaders of our oldest foes began calling for a grace period for the Swarm to get our sov back such that we could have an ' honorable war ' .
No chance of that .
With GoonSwarm out of the Galactic southeast , the glue uniting a disparate coalition of our foes is gone ; only chaos can come of it .
But we were not done ; merely losing the most valuable territory in the game due to an act of catastrophic , unprecedented stupidity was n't enough for GoonSwarm .
Mere days later , Karttoon came back from his vacation only to discover that not only had his alliance exploded , but that he was being blamed for it .
To say that the Swarm forums were sort of in torches - and - pitchforks mode would be like saying ' Iceland is somewhat insolvent ' .
Like proper goons , the alliance membership had initially blamed Niart for his negligence and gotten his resignation ( and his quitting the game entirely ) .
But Karttoon had structured the alliance hierarchy in such a way that the alliance wallet could only be accessed by himself and Niart , meaning that the rest of the directorate was unable to step in and fix the situation while he was away .
Worse for him , in the past several months many in the Swarm had grown tired of his absentee style of leadership ; much of the strategic management of the organization in warfighting had been devolved to myself , Xttz and the Fleet Commanders .
As the creator of Jihadswarm , Karttoon was increasingly seen as a roleplayer and a gimmick , neither of which is acceptable in our culture .
So upon his return , Karttoon found that the alliance was howling for his blood .
A poll showed that over 70 % of the Swarm wanted him to resign .
But as anyone could predict , that was n't going to happen - there was going to be drama , drama which would eclipse the mere negligence of Niart , the sort of highly flammable farce that would give Sophocles a fit of the giggles .

style= " border : 0 px solid ; width : 200 px ; height : 125 px ; " />
At 11:30 pm on February 2nd , Karttoon disbanded GoonSwarm and began kicking out directors .
War broke out between the rogue CEO and the loyalists .
Karttoon was banned from the forums and jabber , and a race between Karttoon and the directors began to secure the alliance assets before Karttoon could find and strip their roles .
Karttoon could only do one thing at a time , while there were many directors working against him .
Regardless , he made off with the alliance wallet ( some 150b , down from 500b at the outset of Dominion due to runaway sov costs in an overbuilt region ) and the alliance dreadnaught cache , some fifty hulls stashed in lowsec .
But there was hope .
Having anticipated the risk of Karttoon going ' screw goons ' , Darius Johnson , our former CEO , returned to service while Karttoon was away from the game .
When GoonSwarm disbanded , Darius was ready and stepped into the breach ; he had reactivated Goonwaffe , a corporation which used to house ' overflow '
Goonfleet membership in the 2006 era of EVE before the skill allowing more than 1000 members in a corp was seeded .
Goonwaffe already had substantial assets stashed in Syndicate in ' caches ' from that era , and the membership simply moved to that corporation , all the while participating in the frenzied drama that the alliance forums had descended into .
So now Goonfleet is held hostage by a rogue CEO and GoonSwarm is gone .
We 're temporarily ' What Fleet ? ' while we bask in the afterglow of the most ferocious cycle of alliance - level suicide in the history of EVE .
We were going to go invade Cloud Ring , but our prospective enemies there ( Ev0ke ) already evacuated the region before we arrived , so our short - term goals all appear to revolve around bitter arguments about what to name our new alliance ; Colony Collapse Disorder [ BILLS ] was tempting , but would probably get old after a week or two .
Whatever happens now , only one thing is certain : there will be drama .

At least eight people have been killed in an explosion at a house in the Pakistani city of Karachi , police said .
The blast happened in Balida Town , a poor neighbourhood of the southern city , Pakistan 's commercial hub .
Police said explosives stored at the house may have gone off and that the dead were believed to be militants .
In December , a blast at a Shia Muslim march in Karachi , claimed by the Taliban , killed 43 people and injured dozens more .
" The terrorists themselves are the victims of their own explosives , " the AFP news agency quoted Karachi police chief Waseem Ahmad as saying .
Police say that eight bodies were pulled out from the rubble of the house .
They say that hand grenades , Kalashnikov rifles and suicide vests were also recovered from the scene .
" So far , evidence on the ground shows the occupants of this house were trying to shift explosives and weapons when the blast occurred , " Mr Ahmad said .
" It seemed they were using two motorcycles we found in the rubble to transport the explosives . "
Targeted killings Pakistan 's Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters that the people living in the house were from the Swat Valley , a north - western district which was until recently a Taliban stronghold .
Separately , at least eight people have been killed in what appear to be incidents of targeted killings of mostly ethnic Balochis in parts of Karachi on Thursday .
The police suspect explosives stored in the house led to the blast
The killings were apparently triggered off by the discovery of a beheaded body of a member of Muttahida Quami Movement ( MQM ) in the old city 's Lyari district .
The MQM has dominated politics in Karachi since the mid-1980s .
Unknown gunmen then went on a rampage in the area , killing seven people , mostly ethnic Balochis , police said .
An eyewitness told BBC Urdu's Riaz Sohail in Karachi that two or three victims of the killings were sitting outside their house and repairing an auto rickshaw when armed men riding motorcycles gunned them down .
Karachi is dominated by Urdu- speaking people whose families migrated to Pakistan from India at the time of India 's Partition in 1947 - they form the main support base of MQM .
The Lyari district is mostly populated by ethnic Balochi people , who mostly support President Asif Ali Zardari's Pakistan People 's Party .
Pakistan has seen an upsurge in violence in recent months .
Hundreds of civilians have died in bomb attacks as Pakistan 's army concludes an offensive against Taliban militants in South Waziristan and surrounding areas .

WASHINGTON - President Obama said yesterday that he is ready to compromise with Republicans on health care if they are serious about it , but that an overhaul must go forward .
“ Let ’s get this done , ’’ he said .
Obama ’s comments in his weekly Internet and radio address , two days after an all - day bipartisan summit across from the White House , were the latest sign that Democrats are getting set to try to pass health care legislation without any Republicans on board .
Success will require colossal efforts on the part of Obama and Democratic leaders to round up votes after a year of corrosive debate and a Senate special - election upset that threw the overhaul effort into limbo last month .
But Obama and the Democrats reject the piecemeal approach sought by Republicans and have no intention of scrapping their 10 - year , $ 1 trillion bill and starting over , as the GOP demands .
“ I am eager and willing to move forward with members of both parties on health care if the other side is serious about coming together to resolve our differences and get this done .
But I also believe that we cannot lose the opportunity to meet this challenge , ’’ Obama said .
“ The tens of millions of men and women who cannot afford their health insurance cannot wait another generation for us to act .
Small businesses cannot wait .
Americans with preexisting conditions cannot wait .
State and federal budgets cannot sustain these rising costs .
“ It is time for those of us in Washington to live up to our responsibilities to the American people and to future generations , ’’ Obama said .
Obama ’s legislation would insure some 30 million more Americans over 10 years with a new requirement for nearly everyone to carry insurance and would end insurance company practices such as denying coverage to people with medical problems .
Republicans generally oppose mandates that make everyone get insurance , and although they want people with health conditions to be able to buy insurance , they would try to address the problem without new requirements on insurers .
Obama plans to release an updated proposal in the week ahead , probably on Wednesday , according to press secretary Robert Gibbs .
Gibbs suggested it would include concepts put forward by Republicans at the summit .
One attendee , Senator Tom Coburn , Republican of Oklahoma , was contacted Friday by the White House and asked to submit details of suggestions he made to tackle waste and fraud in the medical system , Coburn ’s spokesman said .
John Hart said Coburn views Obama ’s legislation as a government takeover and would not be able to support it even if it includes some of his proposals .
Adding Republican ideas is not likely to win Republican votes because the GOP insists Democrats should start from scratch .

Quite an oddity ( Image : Shinichi Maruyama
We are confronted by many mysteries , from the nature of dark matter and the origin of the universe to the quest for a theory of everything .
These are all puzzles on the grand scale , but you can observe another enduring mystery of the physical world – equally perplexing , if not quite so grand – from the comfort of your kitchen .
Simply fill a tall glass with chilled water , throw in an ice cube and leave it to stand .
The fact that the ice cube floats is the first oddity .
And the mystery deepens if you take a thermometer and measure the temperature of the water at various depths .
At the top , near the ice cube , you ’ll find it to be around 0 °C , but at the bottom it should be about 4 °C .
That ’s because water is denser at 4 °C than it is at any other temperature – another strange trait that sets it apart from other liquids .
Water ’s odd properties do n’t stop there ( see “ Water ’s mysteries ” ) , and some are vital to life .
Because ice is less dense than water , and water is less dense at its freezing point than when it is slightly warmer , it freezes from the top down rather than the bottom up .
So even during the ice ages , life continued to thrive on lake floors and in the deep ocean .
Water also has an extraordinary capacity to mop up heat , and this helps smooth out climatic changes that could otherwise devastate ecosystems .
Yet despite water ’s overwhelming importance to life , no single theory had been able to satisfactorily explain its mysterious properties – until now .
If we can believe …
Digital HD ( high definition ) , like that enabled through HDMI and Blu-ray , is awesome .
It offers amazing picture and audio quality .
It allows you to conveniently connect one single cable to provide both picture and sound .
It is royally going to screw up a lot of homes next year .
Wait , what was that last part ?
After December 31 , 2010 , manufacturers will not be " allowed " introduce new hardware with component video outputs supplying more than an SD resolution ( 480 i or 576i ) .
If the manufacturer has existing models in its line - up , it will be able to continue selling that model until the end of 2013 .
The AACS licensing authority , in its " Final Adopter Agreement , " plans to enforce a provision that forces consumer electronics companies that make Blu-ray players ( and any other AACS devices ) to eliminate analog video .
This has been referred to as the “ Analog Sunset , ” where the analog ports on Blu-ray players will be phased out entirely .
Should this go through as planned , it 's going to disable or throw a wrench in a lot of existing custom installations as soon as the end of this year .
To say that this is going to wreak havoc on the installation market is an understatement .
Lest you think that this wo n't affect existing players , note that after January 1 , 2011 , the manufacturers of Blu-ray discs will be able ( at their option ) to insert an Image Constraint Token into any Blu-ray disc .
This is a sort of " digital flag " that will turn off the high - definition component video output in the player ( effectively turning it into a low - resoluton 480i / 576i output ) .
The goal is to make sure that all high - definition video will only be made possible through " secure " digital connections like HDMI .
AACS is really hosing the legitimate consumer with this change .
They will turn upside down those users who have earlier pre-HDMI custom installations , forcing them into alternative ( and expensive ) connectivity options or causing them other costs that they would otherwise have not needed to incur - just to get them back to where they were in 2010 .
Add to this the complete conundrum companies like Kaleidescape will face as they continue their MPAA - thwarted attempts to expand their business model .
We 've even read stories about Hollywood - based mastering engineers having to use Slysoft AnyDVD HD software in order to circumvent AACS and BD + restrictions just to get their work done .
In short , the studios in Hollywood do n't care about you , logic , or making money .
Well , actually they care a LOT about making money , however they are too thick to read the signs presented by the music industry and therefore are missing some of the greatest opportunities to encourage actual sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs .
People want to be able to copy and stream their home movies legally .
The trouble is , when a company like RealDVD comes along to present a solution , the studios pull out the lawyers and kill it .
Well , congratulations for at least keeping a perfect record ... of short - sighted , poorly thought out business decisions .
Decoding the Actual AACS Provisions
The actual AACS provisions are fairly clear and understandable , leaving little wriggle room for those manufacturers facing these upcoming dates .
The first ( below ) sets the end of 2010 as the final time period for producing ( manufacturing ) a player that has analogue outputs above interlaced standard definition .
This is n't even 480 p , they actually specified interlaced SD output .
2.2.2.1 Analog Sunset – 2010 .
With the exception of Existing Models , any Licensed Player manufactured after December 31 , 2010 shall limit analog video outputs for Decrypted AACS Content to SD Interlace Modes [ composite video , s- video , 480i component video and 576i video ] only .
The next provision is incrementally worse , since it completely does away with analogue outputs entirely .
2.2.2.2 Analog Sunset – 2013 .
No Licensed Player that passes Decrypted AACS Content to analog video outputs may be manufactured or sold by Adopter after December 31 , 2013 .
We spoke with several manufacturers , who had differing opinions on what they would do when this sunset hit .
One popular Blu-ray player manufacturer had this to say :
" We have not planned anything for the AACS sunset rules yet .
Our current product development projects still have all analog video outputs - component , composite and S - Video .
In case any new products do not make [ it ] into production in 2010 , we will revise based on the then - current AACS rules .
There are some rumors floating around that the deadline will be extended , but we are not betting on it .
If the deadline stays , we probably will omit analog video altogether instead of limiting to SD interlaced .
If all analog video outputs are omitted , at least we save the trouble and cost for analog copy protection . "
What to Do If This Happens to You
For those who are n't using component video at all , this wo n't be a big deal .
But if I were you I would n't sit on my laurels and laugh at those who are going to suffer this mandatory " upgrade " .
After all , they are ultimately keeping you , through similar restrictions , from legally copying content onto your portable devices except for the sanctioned procedures and files provided by some studios .
Want to know why you can't ( legally ) rip and stream your Blu-ray discs over Sling ?
AACS and DRM are why .
In particular this is going to cause some serious growing pains for installers whose clients ' systems are going to stop looking good overnight .
And they 'll hear about it - in spades .
Many installers have , in the past , avoided HDMI because of technical issues associated with the format .
It 's unruly , more expensive to use , and downright clunky in terms of the speed of switching inputs and its reliability .
If the installer did not take into account the possibility of a change in format , they may be facing a very unpleasant backlash from clients .
Even those who did provide for HDMI will have to deal with clients who have been using the redundant component video connections simply because they were there .
If you are a consumer , or a custom installer who is dealing with a component - only wiring schema , you have several solutions at your disposal :
Deploy a set of baluns , which use one or two Category 5e or 6 cables to carry HDMI over longer distances .
These devices are typically capped by stand - alone boxes or wall plates which require power and convert to and from HDMI .
As much as we hate to admit it , wireless HDMI may be a solution , if you can afford it , have no traffic going between the transmitter and receiver and the distance supports the limitations of the system .
You 're taking your life into your hands with these systems , but under controlled circumstances they can do just fine .
Gefen , among other companies , also offers a system that uses coaxial cables and a hardware device on each end ( baluns ) to convert cable to and from coax .
This can be done over a single coax ( up to 1080i resolution ) or over 5 coax cables for full resolution HDMI .
Keep your eyes peeled as manufacturers are trying very hard to combat the limitations of HDMI with solutions over power lines , coaxial cable , and even standard wireless networks .
These may also provide solutions that will help alleviate a short - sighted or pre-HDMI installation .
Why This Sucks
We make no bones about calling out Hollywood studios on their ignorance , anti-market practices and general thick - headedness .
These AACS rules are especially frustrating because they , like those FBI and anti-piracy warnings on discs , only affect users intending to legally copy software to a local hard drive .
The AACS rules will have absolutely zero effect on actual piracy since the Blu-ray Disc 's AACS / BD + system has already been broken and spread far and wide across the Internet .
Anyone can copy a BD disc and play it back over analogue outputs .
You just can't do it legally .
And there 's the rub .
Killer of Human Rights Activist Identified Officials say they have identified the killer of activist Natalya Estemirova .
MOSCOW , Feb. 26 , 2010  --
It 's a glimmer of good news in an region so often filled with bad .
Russian officials say they have identified the killer of well - known human rights activist Natalya Estemirova , abducted last summer outside her home in Chechnya 's capital Grozny .
" Estemirova 's murder has been cleared up and investigators have established the killer , " a law enforcement official told Russian news agency Interfax Thursday .
Details are scant and the name of the suspect has not been revealed .
Officials told Russian news agencies that they were working to track down the shooter and who ordered the killing .
Colleagues at Estemirova 's former human rights group , Memorial , are skeptical about there being a breakthrough .
" I asked my colleagues to contact the investigators and they denied it , " Oleg Orlov , the group 's head , told ABC News .
" I think that the investigating committee know the group of people who is responsible for this , " he added .
" People who have worked [ in the region ] for so many years could not possibly not know who was involved in this . "
After her kidnapping , Estemirova was driven to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia where she was found shot in the head and chest .
Orlov and others in the human rights community immediately pointed to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov , whom Estemirova had repeatedly accused of ordering kidnappings , torture and murders .
Kadyrov denied any involvement and sued Orlov for libel .
He recently dropped the suit in part at the urging of his mother .
" Why should Kadyrov kill a woman whom nobody needs ? "
Kadyrov said a few weeks after the murder .
Memorial 's offices in Grozny shut down as fierce condemnation poured in from around the world .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev responded forcefully after reportedly being " indignant " at the news .
Despite months of no apparent progress , calls for independent investigations and increased efforts were ignored .
Estemirova 's death is the highest - profile murder since journalist and fellow Kadyrov critic Anna Politkovskaya was killed in 2006 and human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov was gunned down January 2009 .
Arrests were made and charges brought in both the Politkovskaya and Markelov cases , which , rights activists say , is of little consequence if the people ordering the murders are n't found .
" Naturally , it 's very important to get the actual killer , whoever pulled the trigger , but it 's so essential in this particular case and in any other case of a political killing to be precise who gave the order , " Human Rights Watch 's Tanya Lokshina said .
" That 's what is of paramount importance here .
There will be no justice without it . "
The exercise of human rights should not be contingent on whether or not you think a person ’s choices or circumstances are a good way to live or be .
Entangling morality with a conversation about rights and painting a portrait of people in the sex industry as victims without voices only perpetuates their disempowerment .
Since becoming a part of the U.S. sex worker rights movement
five years ago , talking about contentious issues concerning bodies , labor ,
money , and rights has very much become my calling .
In the past year alone , I’ve
been quoted on CNN
about the value of virginity , talked about South Carolina ’s Governor Mark
Sanford on WNYC’s The Takeaway ,
and admonished the Boston Herald for its slurs toward sex
workers .
Suffice to say , I give my
opinion freely and often loudly .
I thought I knew a lot about sex work , rights , and
organizing when , in September , I set off for two weeks in India with my colleague
Khushbu Srivastava ,
Program Officer for Asia at the International Women ’s Health Coalition .
But as much as I am accustomed to being an “ expert , ” I
quickly realized that I knew next to nothing about the nuances of Indian
culture and the dynamics of the local struggle for sexual rights and
reproductive health .
While there are many things that I learned during the two
weeks I spent time with our partners at CREA , The YP Foundation , Commonhealth ,
and SANGRAM ,
perhaps the biggest lesson I learned –as a leader , as an advocate , and as
privileged white lady from the United States who was way out of my element–was
to shut up and listen .
I spent almost a week in Sangli , a
rural district that ’s six to nine hours ( depending on who ’s driving ! ) southeast
of Mumbai .
Maharashtra state , where Sangli is located , has
progressive laws that afford many rights to its citizens , particularly in
respect to accessing healthcare .
However , populations that are already marginalized
in their communities and in local institutions — like sex workers , HIV - positive
women , and people who are not literate — do not know their rights or how to
navigate the legal structures and institutions that facilitate access to these
rights and services .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

In Sangli , I spent time with the
staff and organizers of SANGRAM , which empowers
individuals with the knowledge and tools they need to understand and claim their
rights .
SANGRAM was founded in 1992 to address the growing HIV infection rate
in Sangli district , and they soon realized the value of mobilizing sex workers to
become agents of change in fostering a sustainable and effective response to
the epidemic .
Today , one of the
organization ’s largest projects is a collective of 5,000 sex workers that
manages a peer HIV prevention education and condom distribution program in
Sangli .
This collective also advocates to ensure equal access to health
services and end violence and discrimination against sex workers .
While many organizations train and bring
in people from outside the community to help and support people in need ( the
social work model ) , SANGRAM operates under the principle that the only way to
empower people is to provide them with the tools they need to claim their
rights and facilitate change .
It was inspiring to meet the HIV - positive rural women ,
illiterate sex workers , and community health advocates who are working together
to facilitate change in their communities .
Many told me how for years , doctors in the local primary
health centers refused to provide health services to sex workers or avoided
touching them by giving them inoculations with extra long needles .
With
SANGRAM ’s assistance , sex workers have been able to form alliances with some of
the doctors and achieve a higher standard of care and respect .
Their efforts
have resulted in health system
improvements that benefit the entire community : advocates have been successful
in demanding that the primary health centers be functional , with trained staff ,
adequate supplies , and medicine .
In Sangli , I worked with SANGRAM to
document their work and successes .
On International Human
Rights Day , we released a five minute video about sex worker
organizing , the first collaborative media project of the International
Women ’s Health Coalition & SANGRAM .
Since we posted the short documentary about SANGRAM and the
mobilization of sex workers in Sangli , it ’s been interesting to read the posted
comments and reactions .
One of the most frequent responses is a well - meaning
but slightly problematic one .
To paraphrase : “ It ’s so great to see these women getting the
protection and help they need ! ”
Obviously , the respondents want what ’s best for
women , but this response does n’t instill much trust in the agency of sex
workers to realize what ’s best for them on their own .
Furthermore , it casts sex
workers as damaged goods : victims in need of saving , delicate flowers in need of
protection .
Why is it that there has been a shift in how advocates
describe those who experience gender - based violence from “ victim ” to
“ survivor , ” but when speaking of people in the sex industry , the word “ victim ”
has persisted ?
Why is it that US - funded HIV prevention programs require a
denunciation of sex work by organizations best poised to reach sex workers with
life - saving information and services ?
Why is it that while in other social
justice movements , the voices of the people most affected are at the forefront ,
yet some feminists are quick to leap into conversations about sex work and
trafficking to speak for the affected communities ?
The basic answer to these questions is that many people
regard the sex industry as something that must be halted , one that at its core
perpetuates violence against the people who work in it , a business from which
no good can come .
I wo n’t argue that the sex industry is a well - functioning
industry that respects the rights of all its workers , or that most sex workers
feel safe and fulfilled in their jobs .
However , there are a variety of
contributing factors that might keep a sex worker in the business , even if the
worker has the choice to leave it for other work .
SANGRAM works to prioritize the voices of sex workers
themselves , so that sex workers can articulate what they need to be safe ,
healthy , and able to provide for themselves and their families .
Sometimes this
includes an exit strategy , but often the sex workers ’ circumstances and the
economic and social climate in which they live make exit from the sex industry
unrealistic .
Programs that are designed to rescue and protect sex workers
from the industry usually do n’t comprehensively consider the well - being and
economic stability of the people they are supposed to serve .
One of the tactics
these programs often employ is abstinence education – and we all know how well that ’s worked for sexuality
education .
Another recent example of an attempt to rehabilitate sex workers is
an initiative launched in India in which men volunteered to marry sex workers to get
them out of the sexually exploitative situation of the sex industry .
As any survivor of intimate partner violence knows , marriage is n’t exactly a safe
haven from violence or HIV infection for women .
As
a major Open Society Institute report titled “ Rights ,
Not Rescue ” indicates , programs that aim to get sex workers out of
the industry do little to reduce violence or improve health and working
conditions within the industry .
According to the report , which analyzes rehabilitation programs in
Botswana ,
Namibia , and South Africa , “ None of the
interviewed sex workers who had completed rehabilitation programs had managed
to obtain gainful employment from their training . ”
Domestically , in a recent program launched by the
Dallas ,
Texas police to rehabilitate sex workers , half of 375 arrested
sex workers chose rehabilitation over being charged with prostitution , but only
21 of those who went through the rehabilitation program had left the business
upon follow up .
Despite
these numbers and testimonies by sex workers about the problems with rescue and
rehabilitation programs , getting sex workers out of sex work is widely posited
as the way to end exploitation .
The exercise of human rights should not be contingent on whether
or not you think a person ’s choices or circumstances are a good way to live or
be .
Entangling morality with a conversation about rights and painting a
portrait of people in the sex industry as victims without voices only perpetuates
their disempowerment .
The feminist movement is built on the principle that women
should have opportunities that are equal to those granted to men , a lot of
which is about economic opportunity – things like pay equity and the ability to
own property .
It is also built on the struggle for women ’s rights to control
their own bodies and make choices about their sexual rights and reproductive
health that are unfettered by cultural and familial demands .
The struggle for
sex workers ’ rights is at the intersection of the struggle for economic justice
and bodily rights , and it is perhaps that combination that can often make
discussing sex work uncomfortable .
Hi !
My name is Lindsay , I ’m from Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada .
I ’m married to my wonderful husband Gord , no kids yet !
Until recently I considered myself a person of faith .
I was completely credulous and I would believe pretty much anything I read or anything somebody said to me with authority .
That all changed when I saw the movie Religulous , and the idea that doubt was a virtue and that questioning authority is healthy was introduced to me .
I began to look at my beliefs with a critical eye and I saw that my blind faith was holding me back from learning all that the world had to offer .
I was struck by enlightning !
I am now a science enthusiast , a skeptic , and an atheist .
It ’s my hope that through this blog I ’ll be able to share with as many people as possible the bolts of enlightning that I encounter in my day to day life .
I do n’t have a background in any sciences .
I have a BA in History and Anthropology , so I invite scrutiny to anything I post on this blog .
I want to learn and I want to know when I ’m wrong , otherwise I ’ll never learn !
Please post a comment if there ’s anything else you ’d like to know about me .

Update : January 4 , 2009 : I just wanted to add some links to posts that go into more detail in describing my background with regards to my transition from a person of faith to an atheist and a skeptic :

The Penn State Collegian archive once again is first on a story , breaking the news that the Penn State Inquiry has finished its inquiry and that results will be available later this week .
They report :
Penn State President Graham Spanier addressed the inquiry and the panel ’s work during the Board of Trustees meeting on Jan. 22 .
“ I know they ’ve taken the time and spent hundreds of hours studying documents and interviewing people and looking at issues from all sides , ” Spanier said .
They did n’t contact me .
The only inquiry that has contacted me so far has been an anti-terrorism officer seconded to the Norfolk Police who interviewed me about FOI requests and my views on climate change .
Nor have any CA readers notified me that they ’ve been contacted by the Penn State inquiry .
I wonder who they interviewed .
I wonder what they meant about “ looking at issues from all sides ” .
I ’ll be looking for both how they address issues arising out of Climategate and issues that Cicerone kept out of the 2006 NAS inquiry :
– whether Mann was justified in providing results ( and code ) that contain “ dirty laundry ” only to “ trusted colleagues ” and not to potential critics .
( The example , of course , being Mann ’s provision of residuals to Osborn and Briffa , while refusing them to me . )
– the failure to report adverse verification r2 results for early steps in MBH ( while reporting favorable results for later steps ) , and a consideration of the associated IPCC TAR comment ;
– claims that MBH98 results were “ robust ” to the presence / absence of all dendroclimatic indicators when they were not robust to presence / absence of bristlecones ;
– failure to display principal components from the “ Censored ” directory ;
– the unique extension of the Gaspe tree ring series from 1404 to 1400 ;
– whether the retention of 5 principal components in an effort to salvage MBH results was , as Wegman observed , “ of no statistical integrity ” .
A few other topics will undoubtedly occur to me when I read the report .
When I looked at the Calgary Flames roster in the summer I concluded by saying that the Flames were spending too much money on defence both in the present and looking into the future - someone needed to be moved .
In a cap system there are really only so many dollars to spend and , even if you 're only spending it on good players , spending too much of it in any one area can really hurt .
I like to use the following as a set of general guidelines :
Top 3 Forwards - 27.5 %
Middle 6 Forwards - 20.0 %
Top 4 Defenders - 27.5 %
Goaltending - 10.0 %
Bottom 8 Players - 15.0 %
Yesterday , the Flames made a very significant transaction and maybe even two .
After the jump , we 'll take a look at how the Flames altered this structure both before and after yesterday 's move(s ) .
Prior to the season the Flames had spent extensively on the back end .
If we assume a cap of 56 million ( leaving $ 800,000 dollars in wiggle room ) , this is how the Flames spent ( in terms of cap hit ) coming into this season :
Top 3 Forwards - Iginla , Jokinen , Langkow = 16.75 M or 30.0 %
Middle 6 Forwards - Bourque , Moss , Glencross , Conroy , Dawes , Boyd 6.40 M or 11.4 %
Top 4 Defenders - Phaneuf , Bouwmeester , Regehr , Sarich = 20.80 M or 37.1 %
Goaltending - Kiprusoff , McElhinney = 6.37 M or 11.4 %
Bottom 8 Players - Giordano , Pardy , Johnson , Nystrom , Sjostrom , Prust , McGrattan , Lundmark = 5.22 M or 9.2 %
The Flames were a top heavy team , spending much more than the model on their top three forwards and top four defenders .
But to spend more in one area , you need to take from another and the Flames took liberally from both the middle and bottom of their roster .
Saving money at the bottom of the is probably a good idea if you can manage it but taking money from the middle of your forward corps is likely to cause issues in terms of depth .
If some of your big forwards do n't deliver as much as expected ( Jokinen , Iginla ) , the problem can become glaring .
For the Flames the larger issue was the length of all these contracts .
All four of the top defenders , the starting goalie and two of the top three forwards were signed for at least three years .
The Flames had made a long term bet that a top heavy team with the money focused on defencemen could be a contender .
The events of yesterday changed course significantly .
The only confirmed deal is the trade of Dion Phaneuf to the Toronto Maple Leafs .
The complete deal is as follows :
To Calgary - Ian White , Matt Stajan , Niklas Hagman , Jamal Mayers
To Toronto - Dion Phaneuf , Fredrik Sjostrom , Keith Aulie
My focus thus far has been on cap considerations and that 's where I 'll begin .
Here 's the updated salary chart after the transaction :
Top 3 Forwards - Iginla , Jokinen , Langkow = 16.75 M or 30.0 %
Middle 6 Forwards - Bourque , Moss , Glencross , Stajan , Dawes , Hagman 9.45 M or 16.9 %
Top 4 Defenders - Bouwmeester , Regehr , Sarich , Giordano = 15.19 M or 27.1 %
Goaltending - Kiprusoff , McElhinney = 6.37 M or 11.4 %
Bottom 8 Players - White , Pardy , Johnson , Nystrom , Boyd , Prust , McGrattan , Conroy = 5.52 M or 10.0 %
If nothing else , the Flames trade of Dion Phaneuf restores some balance to the pay structure which I think is pretty important when you 're trying to create a winning team .
When you consider the fact that Jokinen is coming off the books this summer ( and maybe a whole lot sooner ! ) , the Flames have put themselves in a much better position .
The only long - term salary coming back is that of Niklas Hagman which also frees up cap space going forward .
Strictly in terms of pay structure , I think the Flames made a very good deal here .
( In an interesting twist , the Maple Leafs have gone in the other direction .
Their top four defenders are now earning 19.05 M ( or 34.0 % of 56 M ) and all are signed for both this season and next .
And that number does n't even include Jeff Finger 's 3.5 M deal which also runs through next year .
In terms of pay structure , this looks like a pretty bad deal for the Leafs . )
So what about the players ?
The main guy on the way out the door is Phaneuf .
I'm of the opinion that Dion Phaneuf is a very good defenceman that has shown some improvement so far this season .
He has n't been sheltered this season , generally seeing some of the tougher opponents , though with the most favourable zone start ratio among all Flames defenders .
This , of course , makes perfectly good sense .
Although Phaneuf has improved defensively , the strength of his game remains his ability to generate some offence .
He 's struggled to do that at EV so far this season , but in both 2007 - 08 and 2008 - 09 he did generate good offence at EV ( around 1 point per 60 minutes which is a good rate for a defenceman ) .
His track record on the power play is also very good and he adds a physical element which is a very nice bonus at the very least .
So that 's the good .
The problem for the Flames , aside from the overall pay structure , is the same problem I brough up this summer with regard to Jay Bouwmeester .
Phaneuf is a good young player who is still being paid for potential .
He 's also tied for the seventh highest cap hit among defenders this year and I really do n't think there 's much of an argument that he 's one of the seven best defenders in the league .
Nor is it a sure thing he ever gets to that level .
And that 's the big problem with Dion Phaneuf .
He 's a very good player who will have trouble meeting the expectations of his contract .
It 's a less - bad version of the Brian Campbell deal and I think Calgary is probably wise to be rid of it .
The other players moving out are Fredrik Sjostrom and Keith Aulie .
Sjostrom 's departure is a virtual non-issue .
Sutter showed a real willingness to bring in players on cheap deals in the summer ( Dawes , Lundmark , Jaffray , Sjostrom ) so I do n't think losing Sjostrom 's cheap deal for next year will hurt the Flames at all .
For this season , Sjostrom is more than replaced by the trade return .
To be honest , the Flames now have a tonne of forwards .
I did n't even include Jamal Mayers in my salary breakdown because there was n't enough room on the roster and I assume he 's being demoted once the Flames get Dawes and Moss back from injury .
I do n't know much at all about Keith Aulie .
He seems to be a good but not elite defence prospect who has spent his entire this past season in the AHL .
Maybe he ends up being a big part of the return down the line but he's not a " special " player , so I doubt the Flames strongly regret moving him .
In terms of incoming players , the Flames main acquisitions are Ian White and Niklas Hagman .
Hagman has two years left on his deal beyond this one at 3 M per season .
Without delving too deeply into it , I quite like Hagman .
He 's a player that has performed well in the Western Conference earlier in his career and has managed to be a solid middle six forward option for Toronto .
His contract expires when he 's 32 which is a little older than you 'd like but it's not " old " either .
Over the last three seasons he 's never scored at a rate lower than 1.9 pts/60 at EV while taking on middling to strong competition from the other side .
Given the Flames struggles on offence this is a player with a reasonable contract who fits a need in Calgary and who may even end up playing some with Jarome Iginla .
It 's a nice fit .
Ian
White is also a very solid pickup .
A restricted free agent at the end of the season he 's performed well for a couple of seasons and is having a very good season in 2009 - 10 .
He 's an offensive defender who come cheap this year but will probably expect a raise in the near future .
Like Phaneuf , he provides a good amount of offence at even strength and is a solid performer on the PP .
He 's received an extremely favourable faceoff ratio at EV ( i.e. a LOT of OZ faceoffs to pad his numbers ) and he 's probably been playing the second toughs most of the time .
He 's also quite a bit smaller than Phaneuf and does not bring the same physical game .
He 's just not as good as Phaneuf so there will be some drop - off there but the Flames will be able to play him to his strengths ( offensive situations ) since
White is likely to play on the second or even the third pairing and take some of those offensive zone draws that Phaneuf is leaving behind .
I must admit , however , that my hope is that he plays with Bouwmeester so that the two can form the " Defencemen Under the Influence " pairing ( White 's with a suspended license !
Bonus ! ) .
The last two players the Flames acquired are both UFAs at the end of this season and could n't be more different in their ability to help Calgary this year .
Matt Stajan has been taking on tough competition and coming out on top in terms of Corsi .
Although he has n't outscored his opponents , a lot of that has to do with some atrocious goaltending in Toronto this season .
Given the Flames struggles on offence this year , Stajan is a welcome addition who immediately makes the team stronger .
Jamal Mayers , on the other hand , is just awful .
I suspect the Flames will send him to the minors once they get healthy ( and it might not take that long ) .
To conclude I 'll just say that I 'm much more impressed with Calgary 's side of things in this deal than I am with Toronto's .
I think Calgary did a lot of very good things here in terms of addressing current team needs and giving themselves more long - term flexibility as well as bringing better balance to their salary structure .
But if this Jokinen ( and stuff ) for Kotalik ( and stuff ) deal ends up going through ...
I 'll be much less impressed with Sutter 's overall performance .
But we 'll cross that bridge if and when that second deal gets confirmed .
Many prisons in Italy suffer from overcrowding
Italy is to open one of the world 's first prisons for transgender inmates , reports say .
The prison , at Pozzale , near the Tuscan city of Florence , is expected to house inmates who mainly have convictions for drug - related offences and prostitution .
Gay rights groups in Italy welcomed the move to convert an almost empty medium security women 's prison into a specially equipped detention centre .
It is thought that Italy has a total of some 60 transgender prisoners .
The centre will house about 30 people , according to reports .
The BBC's Duncan Kennedy , in Rome , says that until now transgender prisoners have been located in women 's prisons where they are often segregated for their own safety .
Psychological support
Leading gay rights groups say they welcome the new prison as a dedicated space providing the psychological support transgender prisoners need .
However , one local council official has said she cannot understand why the Pozzale prison had remained almost empty for so long .
" There are at least 30 to 40 women held in nearby prisons who would be ready to be transferred to a medium - security centre such as Pozzale .
But very restrictive entry requirements were imposed , " Franco Corleone told Italian news agency Adnkronos .
According to Italian newspaper Il Giornale , the prison only has two inmates at present but has a staff of 22 people .
The prison has its own library , recreation centre , football pitch and agricultural land which produces olive oil and wine .
Inmates also have their own cell and are given a personal development plan .
Hey there , time traveller !

Opinion
According to something called the International Office of Epizootics , the nine - banded armadillo is the only creature capable of contracting leprosy other than a human being .
Although this armoured insectivore is expanding its range across North America , it has yet to reach Canada and certainly has n't started scrounging around for grubs in the fertile soils of the Fraser River Valley in beautiful British Columbia .
This is good news for the nine - banded armadillo , because as most of the world was surprised to hear , leprosy has become a serious issue at the Vancouver Olympics .
On Friday , health officials in B.C. revealed someone working on a cruise ship housing Olympic personnel had been diagnosed with leprosy .
Although the ship in question served as a dorm for Olympic security personnel , the infected crew member worked below decks and did n't come into contact with the temporary lodgers , officials told The Canadian Press .
The man with leprosy , which is transmitted through infected nasal droplets , was sent back to his undisclosed home country for treatment .
The general public was not at risk , officials said .
" I think the major concern is that the British media will run off with this , " said Dr. Perry Kendall , B.C. 's chief medical officer of health .
Geez , do you think ?
The British press might have a problem with the 2010 Olympics ?
The same U.K. exaggerators who 've compared the slopes of Cypress Mountain to the killing fields of Cambodia ?
The easily agitated Anglo - Saxons who 've wondered whether the Vancouver Games are " the worst Olympics ever ? "
I think the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich might have a problem with that sentiment .
Now do n't get me wrong : I 'm not a fan of the Olympics , and not just the ones in Vancouver .
The idea of spending billions of dollars so underpaid athletes can generate massive ad revenues for TV networks and expose millions of couch potatoes to the nutritional wonders of Coca - Cola and McDonald 's is not popular in my little corner of the universe .
As I suggested in this space last week , the Olympic message of international peace and harmony is a sickening mirage .
The wealthy nations of this planet do n't really care about the poor ones , despite the impressive aid efforts following natural disasters in places like Haiti and the eastern Indian Ocean .
Most of the time , we 're content to fritter away our lives on Facebook and numb our minds watching So You Think You Can Masticate Canada .
Far - flung , poverty - stricken places like Bangladesh and Benin just do n't concern us until major disaster strikes -- or the parade of nations marks the start of the Olympic Games .
But the hyperbole surrounding the Vancouver Games remains unwarranted , aside from the legitimate criticism directed against VANOC for practically whistling past the corpse of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili .
Yes , Vancouver is too mild to host the Winter Games .
Yes , the Olympic cauldron sits behind a fence that belongs in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas .
And yes , I believe I Believe to be one of the cheesiest pieces ever composed .
But this remains a series of athletic contests .
When you strip away the corporate sponsorship and the bizarre juxtaposition of bald - faced nationalism against saccharine " we - are - the - world " sentiment , the Olympics are just a series of races between a bunch of people with unusually low body fat .
If the collective scorn of the planet 's media needs to be directed somewhere , why not somewhere else ?
Why not bemoan the motivations of machine - gun manufacturers and the people who buy shares in their companies ?
Or U.S. senators who lobby to maintain corn subsidies that continue to push impoverished people off farms in developing countries ?
Or a Manitoba government that spends $ 2.3 million on an Olympic pavilion that opens a few weeks before the province announces a public - sector wage freeze ?
Oh , wait -- I 'm criticizing something Olympic - related again .
As Freep Parliament reporter Mia Rabson noted on her blog this week , Slate.com has taken the piss out of Manitoba House , this province 's apparently feeble attempt to put its finest face forward at the Olympics .
Apparently , while we 're showing the world an award - winning quilt , Saskatchewan is slinging beer and bison burgers .
Will the Selinger government survive the scandal ?
No one 's going to notice , because Vancouver has had a case of freaking leprosy .
The question Glamour health editors heard most after Brittany Murphy 's death : Could an eating disorder have caused it ?
We may never know for sure , but what we do know is that anorexia , bulimia and binge eating disorder can have serious and wide - ranging effects .
Just a few of the consequences :
Infertility
Not having enough body fat can halt ovulation ; having too much can throw hormones out of whack .
The good news is that for many women , fertility returns once they get healthy , and they do n't suffer any long - term problems , says Walter H. Kaye , M.D. , director of the University of California , San Diego , eating disorders program .
Heart Problems
Anorexia literally starves the heart , making it weaker ; dehydration from vomit-ing may cause electrolyte imbalances that can lead to cardiac arrest .
Most of the damage is reversible once a woman reaches a healthy weight .
Tooth Loss
Women who frequently make themselves throw up suffer cavities and tooth loss , as stomach acid erodes enamel .
" Can you imagine having dentures in your thirties ?
I 've seen it , " says Jennifer Nardozzi , Psy.D. , national training manager of the Renfrew Center eating disorders clinics .
Bloating
Eating disorders result in a host of digestive problems , from heartburn to constipation , many of which lead to abdominal swelling — something that , ironically , can make someone with a bad body image feel worse .
Bingeing and purging also overstimulate salivary glands .
" This can make the face swell , giving someone a chipmunk cheek ' look , " says Nardozzi .
Medication Overdose
Typical drug doses are based on people of normal weight , so severely underweight women can overdose by accident .
( Murphy reportedly had several different prescription medications in her home . )
" Society applauds skinny stars , but there should n't be such a fine line between looking glamorous ' and being ill , " says Lynn Grefe , CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association .
The simple truth : Eating disorders are serious — and any woman who 's suffering needs our support .

The number of green jobs is growing throughout the Golden State , but it still represents just a tiny fraction of California 's overall employment .
A study to be released today counted 159,000 green jobs throughout the state - everything from scientists devising new fuels and better solar panels to workers insulating buildings to cut energy use .
While the Bay Area has the most - 41,674 jobs , compared with 39,894 for the Los Angeles area - California 's green economy is surprisingly widespread .
It employs people in places as disparate as the San Joaquin Valley and the Inland Empire .
But taken together , those jobs represent less than 1 percent of employment in the state , according to the report 's authors .
Green industries have great promise for employment , but they have n't delivered yet .
" Green tech is not a panacea , " said F. Noel Perry , founder of the Next 10 public policy group , which commissioned the report from consulting firm Collaborative Economics .
" We believe green jobs are going to be a significant part of future jobs growth in California .
But at the same time , we know they are a small proportion of the total jobs we have now . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The report , " Many Shades of Green , " aims to give an accurate account of the number and distribution of green jobs throughout the state .
California has embarked on an ambitious effort to fight global warming and encourage renewable energy , hoping to capture as much of the growing green - tech industry as possible .
Supporters and opponents of that effort often issue competing estimates of how many jobs the state 's climate change policies will create or destroy .
In contrast , the Next 10 report tries to count jobs that are already there .
It does have a significant drawback .
The survey , which collects and cross-checks data from many sources , is based on data from January 2008 .
It misses any jobs that might have been lost during last year 's economic collapse or jobs that might have been created by this year 's economic stimulus program from the federal government .
The study defines green jobs as those that develop new energy sources , save energy , conserve natural resources or reduce pollution , including greenhouse gases .
By that measure the number of green jobs in California has grown 35.9 percent since 1995 , the earliest year for which Collaborative Economics could get consistent data .
In contrast , the total number jobs in the state grew 13.3 percent during the same period .
The Bay Area , long a hub of university research and venture capital funding , has benefited more than any other part of the state .
And yet other places , such as Orange County and Sacramento , have succeeded in luring and nurturing young green companies , to the point that each area has developed its own specialties .
The Bay Area , for example , leads the state in the number of jobs related to energy - generation technologies , such as solar and wind power , with a total of 7,003 positions .
But the Los Angeles area has the most jobs related to green transportation , with 1,072 people working on alternative fuels or advanced vehicles .
" It 's not like everybody has to do the same thing , " said Doug Henton , chief executive officer of Collaborative Economics .
" Every region - Sacramento , Southern California , even Sonoma - everyone 's trying to develop some kind of economic strategy to their advantage . "
Perhaps the study 's most surprising finding is that manufacturing accounts for a significant portion of the state 's green jobs , about 21 percent .
Although many green companies are research startups whose products have n't yet left the lab , others have moved on to mass production .
For example , solar panel manufacturer Solyndra Inc. started construction of its second Bay Area factory in September , helped by a $ 535 million federal loan guarantee .
" At a time when we 're worrying about whether we can hold onto manufacturing jobs , it looks like we have an opportunity here , " Henton said .
In addition , the green economy may have benefits that extend beyond the number of new jobs generated .
Stephen Levy , director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy , noted that much of the green economy will consist of companies changing how they operate and what they make , offering products and services that help the environment and cut energy costs .
Some of those jobs will be new , while others will simply be existing jobs given a different purpose .
Even if they are n't new , those jobs can still help the overall economy by helping consumers and companies save money on energy bills .
" I do n't want to count it as job growth , but I also do n't want to ignore the benefits , " said Levy , who was not part of the Next 10 study .
" You 're going to have benefits to consumers and the planet . "
About a year ago I was having a discussion with my friend Crutcher when he suggested that one could hot - swap versions of a running program .
This post describes my implementation of just such a thing .
Why would you hot - swap ?
One of the major benefits of hotswapping is that the new version of the program will have access to all of the old version ’s file - descriptors .
This means that any files , sockets , or pipes that the previous version currently had open can still be open .
For example , if one was careful , you could hotswap an application that was in the middle of serving a very large file to a user without him being aware that anything happened .
Before we begin discussing how this should work , let ’s look at some of the problems .
Sure we get file descriptors , but what about all of our state ?
Well , this is a problem .
We cannot easily take our state with us .
Since we ’re updating versions here , you want to be particularly sure you only take state that you need .
To do this , I would recommend using a serialization library for C. A bit of Googling showed me this one , TPL , though I have n’t tried it yet .
For our example here , we ’ll just manually move the only pieces of state we care about : a counter and a file descriptor to a file we ’re currently writing to .
The basic idea of what ’s going to happen is that we will create a pair of pipes and then fork ( ) .
The child process will hold the pipe that does the writing and the parent the one that does the reading .
Now , the parent will exec .
This is a bit odd .
Normally when you fork , then exec , it ’s the child process which does the exec .
However , here we really want the new version of the program to have access to all of the old file descriptors .
Luckily , execl preserves these .
As an added benefit , the program gets the exact same process ID .
So , let ’s look at the important bits of the hot - swap ( reader and writer are the file descriptors for the pipe ) :
unsigned int outputFD = fileno ( output File ) ; if ( fork ( ) ) { /*
I am the parent .
*/ char readBuf [ 20 ] = { 0 } ; close ( writer ) ; sprintf ( readBuf , " %d " , reader ) ; execl ( " ./ newbinary " , " -- hotswapping " , readBuf , ( char * ) 0 ) ; exit ( 0 ) ; } else { /* I am the child .*/ FILE * outputStream = fdopen ( writer , " w " ) ; close ( reader ) ; fprintf ( outputStream , " %d
" , i ) ; fprintf ( outputStream , " %u
" , ( unsigned int ) outputFD ) ; fclose ( outputStream ) ; exit ( 0 ) ; }
First , let ’s look at what the parent process does .
It simply closes its “ writer ” since it will never need to write to the pipe then it execs “ newbinary ” which is the new version of the program .
It does so with a flag “ –hotswapping ” .
This flag indicates another parameter will follow which is the file descriptor for the “ read ” end of the pipe we created .
We do this so that the new binary can then get the state serialized across the pipe from the old binary .
Now , onto the child process .
Line 32 creates a file handler from the file descriptor which is the “ write ” end of the pipe .
Why ?
Because I ’m lazy and I would prefer to work with fprintf ( ) to write ( ) .
Now that we have this file handler , we can fprintf ( ) directly to it and serialize the state we want .
In this contrived case the only state I care about is my counter variable and the file descriptor of my output file .
Line 19 gives me the descriptor from the handler using int fileno( FILE *) .
So , to recap , we fork ( ) then the parent exec’s to the new version of the binary and the child writes any relevant state to a pipe which the new binary is listening to .
Now , let ’s look at what has to exist in the new binary .
The new binary must recognize the argument “ –hotswapping ” which passes along the file descriptor of the “ read ” pipe .
The following , in newversion .c does just this :
for ( i = 0 ; i < argc ; i ++ ) { if ( ! strcmp ( argv [ i ] , " - - hotswapping " ) ) { int reader = atoi ( argv [ ++ i ] ) ; inputStream = fdopen ( reader , " r " ) ; } }
Notice that Line 17 does something interesting .
It converts the file descriptor back to a file handler using fdopen ( int , char * ) .
Thus we can use this pipe just like we were reading from a file .
So , now we can use fscanf to read from the pipe instead of having to worry about read ( ) and buffers .
This is done starting at line 21 :
fscanf ( inputStream , " %d " , & i ) ; fscanf ( inputStream , " %u " , & outputFD ) ; fclose ( inputStream ) ; output File = fdopen ( outputFD , " w " ) ;
Once again , at line 24 , we turn the file descriptor we read from the pipe back into a file handler .
Now , we can resume writing to it , just as we did before .
It will continue to append to the end of the file .
The files which implement this are available as gists here :
Makefile original .c newversion .c

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Federal agents detained and interrogated a U.S. college student at the Philadelphia airport simply because we was carrying a set of English - Arabic flashcards , a lawsuit alleged on Wednesday .
The American Civil Liberties Union said it filed the suit on behalf Nicholas George , 22 , a language student at Pomona College in California who was held at Philadelphia International Airport for nearly five hours in August 2009 .
George , a U.S. citizen from the Philadelphia suburb of Wyncote , was on his way back to college when airport security officers found him carrying the flashcards , each of which had an English word on one side and its Arabic equivalent on the other , the ACLU said .
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration questioned him , and a TSA supervisor asked him how he felt about the September 11 attacks , whether he knew “ who did 9/11 , ” and whether he knew what language Osama bin Laden spoke , the ACLU said .
He was handcuffed and left in a locked cell for two hours before being “ abusively ” interrogated by two FBI agents , but was never told why he was being detained , the ACLU said .
The lawsuit , filed in U.S. district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , charges that officers from the TSA , FBI and Philadelphia police violated George ’s constitutional rights of free speech and to be free from unreasonable seizure .
“ As someone who travels by plane , I want TSA agents to do their job to keep flights safe , ” George said in a statement .
“ But I do n’t understand how locking me up and harassing me just because I was carrying the flashcards made anybody safer . ”
Neither the federal agencies nor the Philadelphia police could be reached for comment .
I ’m not usually a massive fan of Jude Law , at least I was n’t before today when I finally got down to my local cinema to finally watch Sherlock Holmes ( Jon ’s review here ) and I really enjoyed it , especially the scenes with Law in .
One of the movies I ’m most looking forward to seeing this year is the rather harsh looking Repo Men which , as well as Law stars Forest Whitaker , Liev Schreiber , RZA , Alice Braga and Carice van Houten .
If you ’ve not see the red band trailer or theatrical trailer for the movie you can check them out here .
The movie is set in the future where organs are distributed and if not paid of , the repo men come along to reclaim their merchandise in rather harsh fashion .
All then changes when Remy ( Jude Law ) needs a transplant and the repo men come looking for him !
Repo Men is directed by Miguel Sapochnik and you can check out the new posters below which give you the real price of a heart a new eye or liver !

Forget about oil , occupation , terrorism or even Al Qaeda .
The real
hazard for Iraqis these days is cancer .
Cancer is spreading like
wildfire in Iraq .
Thousands of infants are being born with deformities .
Doctors say they are struggling to cope with the rise of cancer and
birth defects , especially in cities subjected to heavy American and
British bombardment .
Here are a few examples .
In Falluja , which was heavily bombarded by the US in 2004 , as many as 25 % of new - born infants have serious abnormalities , including congenital anomalies , brain tumors , and neural tube defects in the spinal cord .
The cancer rate in the province of Babil , south of Baghdad has risen from 500 diagnosed cases in 2004 to 9,082 in 2009 according to Al Jazeera English .
In Basra there were 1885 diagnosed cases of cancer in 2005 .
According
to Dr. Jawad al Ali , director of the Oncology Center , the number
increased to 2,302 in 2006 and 3,071 in 2007 .
Dr. Ali told Al Jazeera
English that about 1,250 - 1,500 patients visit the Oncology Center every
month now .
Not everyone is ready to draw a direct correlation between allied
bombing of these areas and tumors , and the Pentagon has been skeptical
of any attempts to link the two .
But Iraqi doctors and some Western
scholars say the massive quantities of depleted uranium used in U.S .
and British bombs , and the sharp increase in cancer rates are not
unconnected .
Dr Ahmad Hardan , who served as a special scientific adviser to the
World Health Organization , the United Nations and the Iraqi Ministry of
Health , says that there is scientific evidence linking depleted uranium
to cancer and birth defects .
He told Al Jazeera English ,
" Children with congenital anomalies are subjected to karyotyping and
chromosomal studies with complete genetic back - grounding and clinical
assessment .
Family and obstetrical histories are taken too .
These
international studies have produced ample evidence to show that
depleted uranium has disastrous consequences . "
Iraqi doctors say cancer cases increased after both the 1991 war and the 2003 invasion .
Abdulhaq Al - Ani , author of " Uranium in Iraq " told Al Jazeera English
that the incubation period for depleted uranium is five to six years ,
which is consistent with the spike in cancer rates in 1996 - 1997 and
2008 -2009 .
There are also similar patterns of birth defects among Iraqi and Afghan
infants who were also born in areas that were subjected to depleted
uranium bombardment .
Dr. Daud Miraki , director of the Afghan Depleted Uranium and Recovery
Fund , told Al Jazeera English he found evidence of the effect of
depleted uranium in infants in eastern and south - eastern Afghanistan .
" Many children are born with no eyes , no limbs , or tumors protruding
from their mouths and eyes , " said Dr. Miraki .
It 's not just Iraqis and Afghans .
Babies born to American soldiers deployed in Iraq during the 1991 war are also showing similar defects .
In 2000 , Iraqi biologist Huda saleh Mahadi pointed out that the hands
of deformed American infants were directly linked to their shoulders , a
deformity seen in Iraqi infants .
Many US soldiers are now referring to Gulf War Syndrome # 2 and alleging they have developed cancer because of exposure to depleted uranium in Iraq .
But soldiers can end their exposure to depleted uranium when their
service in Iraq ends .
Iraqi civilians have nowhere else to go .
The
water , soil and air in large areas of Iraq , including Baghdad , are
contaminated with depleted uranium that has a radioactive half - life of
4.5 billion years .
Dr. Doug Rokke , former director of the U.S. Army 's Depleted Uranium
Project during the first Gulf War , was in charge of a project of
decontaminating American tanks .
He told Al Jazeera English
that " it took the U.S. Department of Defense in a multi-million dollar
facility with trained physicists and engineers , three years to
decontaminate the 24 tanks that I sent back to the U.S. "
And he added , " What can the average Iraqi do with thousands and
thousands of trash and destroyed vehicles spread across the desert and
other areas ? "
According to Al Jazeera , the Pentagon used more than 300 tons of depleted uranium in 1991 .
In 2003 , the United States used more than 1,000 tons .
Patrick Grigor ( L ) and David Sneath had been on a work night out Two drunk men on a work night out sparked a terror alert after they broke into an airport and tampered with the controls in the cockpit of a plane .
Police on high alert arrived to find one of the men wearing a pink cowboy hat , straddling a plane and covered in foam from a fire extinguisher .
Pizza Hut workers David Sneath , 25 , and Patrick Grigor , 24 , climbed a fence to get into Dundee Airport , a court heard .
The pair were given a deferred sentence for one year to be on good behaviour .
Sheriff George
Way also told them to " voluntarily " make compensation payments to Tayside Aviation , who owned the aircraft .
He was considerably under the influence of alcohol .
He can't remember how he got there
Solicitor John Boyle Dundee Sheriff
Court heard the men had been in a nightclub before walking to the airport , climbing a security fence and entering a hangar .
They discharged a fire extinguisher over five planes , causing £ 8,400 worth of damage and grounding them until safety checks were carried out .
An airport security officer found the pair in the controlled area on 20 May 2009 , looking into the cockpit of a plane with one of them covered from head to toe in white powder .
They admitted entering the restricted zone and " maliciously " discharging a fire extinguisher over five aircraft , covering them in a noxious substance and rendering them unsafe to operate .
They also pleaded guilty to entering two other aircraft without authority and interfering with the controls .
' No malice ' A defence agent for Grigor said : " When police were first called , they were concerned it might be a terror incident .
" But when they arrived Mr Grigor was seen wearing a pink cowboy hat , straddling an airplane with a fire extinguisher and covered in foam .
They soon realised what was going on . "
Solicitor John Boyle , acting for Sneath , said : " He was considerably under the influence of alcohol .
He can't remember how he got there . "
Speaking after his court appearance , Grigor said : " There was no malice intended .
We had both been on a work night out and after we left the Students ' Union at 2.30 am , we must have gone for a drunken walk , perhaps looking for a party .
" We have no real recollection of how we got to the airport , how we got in , or what really happened .
" At first the police mentioned something about terrorism .
The day after , when we got interviewed and we had sobered up , they realised it was just a couple of drunken idiots . "

The Islamic regime in Tehran , which came to power in 1979 dismissing nationalism as an imperialist plot aimed at weakening the worldwide Muslim community ( or umma ) , initially displayed less interest in the gulf ’s Persian identity than in the spread of its Islamist message .
“ The Iranian revolution is not exclusively that of Iran , because Islam does not belong to any particular people , ” insisted Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
“ The struggle will continue until the calls ‘ there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah ’ are echoed all over the world . ”
Yet like Stalin , who responded to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 by urging his people to fight for the motherland rather than for the Communist ideals with which they had been indoctrinated , Khomeini reverted to nationalist rhetoric to rally his subjects after the Iraqi invasion of 1980 .
He also used the war to justify a string of military and diplomatic actions against the smaller Arab states like Qatar and Kuwait aimed at asserting Iran ’s supremacy in the gulf .
In this history of a single body of water , one sees a perfect example of the so - called Islamic Paradox that dates from the seventh century .
For although the Prophet Muhammad took great pains to underscore the equality of all believers regardless of ethnicity , categorically forbidding any fighting among the believers , his precepts have been constantly and blatantly violated .
It took a mere 24 years after the Prophet ’s death for the head of the universal Islamic community , the caliph Uthman , to be murdered by political rivals .
This opened the floodgates to incessant infighting within the House of Islam , which has never ceased .
Likewise , there has been no overarching Islamic solidarity transcending the multitude of parochial loyalties  to one ’s clan , tribe , village , family or nation .
Thus , for example , not only do Arabs consider themselves superior to all other Muslims , but inhabitants of Hijaz , the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula and Islam ’s birthplace , regard themselves the only true Arabs , and tend to be highly disparaging of all other Arabic - speaking communities .
Nor , for that matter , has the House of Islam ever formed a unified front vis-à - vis the House of War ( as Muslims call the rest of the world ) .
Even during the Crusades , the supposed height of the “ clash of civilizations , ” Christian and Muslim rulers freely collaborated across the religious divide , often finding themselves aligned with members of the rival religion against their co-religionists .
While the legendary Saladin himself was busy eradicating the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem , for example , he was closely aligned with the Byzantine Empire , the foremost representative of Christendom ’s claim to universalism .
They used to sell meatballs in groups of 10 , 15 or 20 , but now they sell a " plate of meatballs " and tempt you to " add 5 meatballs for $ 1 ! " which is strange , because they do n't explain how many meatballs you start with on the plate in the first place .
It 's like " Do you want X meatballs or X+5 meatballs ? "
And no , you can't solve for X because the $ 1/5 meatballs is marketed as a better rate than the original X meatballs for $ 4.99 .
I mean , I hope it is a better rate , because if the $ 1/5 rate holds up for the $ 4.99 , that 's 25 meatballs , and if I could possibly eat 25 meatballs , why the hell would I want 5 more at any price ?!
I got chicken strips and a shotglass of Pepsi .
The Goshen College President ’s Council announced last Friday that beginning in March , an instrumental version of the national anthem will be played at select sporting events followed by a prayer .
More than a year ago , a spectator at a Goshen women ’s basketball game expressed his disappointment that the college did n’t play the national anthem before sporting events .
The issue received national coverage after the fan forwarded the e-mail discussions to talk show hosts such as Mike Gallagher .
Although this opened a discussion about patriotism and allegiance at Goshen College , it ’s not the first time the college has confronted the issue .
In an interview , former Goshen College president Lawrence Burkholder recalled a time during the Vietnam War in the 1970s when a similar issue of allegiance and respect was dealt with : as a Mennonite college , should Goshen College fly the U.S. flag ?
“ There were lots of feelings [ involved ] , ” Burkholder said .
He remembers walking into his office one morning and seeing the flag neatly folded up on his desk : a sign to him that not everyone agreed with the college ’s decision to fly the U.S. flag on campus .
If you look out any number of windows facing west on campus , the flag remains .
33 years later , Goshen College is dealing with the same issue .
As a Mennonite College , are the college ’s Anabaptist theology and allegiance to God undermined if the national anthem is not included on campus due to its militaristic lyrics ?
Is it disrespectful to the nation if teams and fans choose not to play it ?
In the spring of 2009 , the President ’s Council requested that a task force , made up of students , faculty and administrators , gather to explore the issue .
They discussed it as a group while welcoming input from Student Senate in addition to gathering thoughts from faculty and staff meetings .
A campus town hall meeting was held where students , community and alumni voiced their opinions .
“ We have a diverse campus , ” said Bill Born , the current Dean of Students , “ that represents different faith perspectives . ”
In fact , Goshen College ’s student body includes 40 Christian denominations as well as several other religions .
Taking into consideration these different perspectives , the President ’s Council reached their decision based on the following four beliefs , as quoted from Jim Brenneman ’s letter to the student body :
• “ We believe that playing the anthem offers a welcoming gesture to many visiting our athletic events , rather than an immediate barrier to further opportunities for getting to know one another .
• We believe playing the national anthem is one way that is commonly understood to express an allegiance to the nation of one ’s citizenship .
We have shown that in the past in a variety of other ways , such as flying a flag on campus , praying for all men and women serving our country , welcoming military veterans as students and employees , annually celebrating the U.S. Constitution and encouraging voting .
• We believe playing the anthem in no way displaces any higher allegiances , including to the expansive understanding of Jesus – the ultimate peacemaker – loving all people of the world .
• We believe playing the anthem opens up new possibilities for members of the Goshen College community to publicly offer prophetic critique – if need be – as citizens in the loyal opposition on issues of deepest moral conviction , such as war , racism and human rights abuses . ”
The decision will be put into action in March at the start of the spring sports season .
A flag will be present as the instrumental version of the anthem plays , and it will be followed by a prayer .
Fans will be asked to stand respectfully , but they are not required to sing or place their hand over their heart unless they feel comfortable doing so .
Tim Demant , the athletic director at Goshen College , supports both the process and the resolution .
He believes that “ this decision will have a positive effect on how many outside of GC look at us as it will begin to break down some of the negative impressions many people have of GC as being unpatriotic and anti-American . ”
Demant went on to say that the playing of the national anthem will “ definitely have a positive effect ” on the college ’s ability to recruit since some coaches have dealt with negative feedback due to the absence of the anthem .
According to Jim Caskey , the vice president for institutional advancement , alumni funding was not an issue that played a role in the decision .
The 3.9 million dollars that was donated by the public in 2008 ( $ 1.9 million of which was donated by alumni ) came as a result of “ supporters [ who ] are deeply invested in the students and mission of the college , beyond any one issue , ” Caskey said .
When asked how the choice to play the national anthem might affect enrollment , Lynn Jackson , the vice president for enrollment management , did not wish to comment .
However , she stands behind the decision of the President ’s Council .
Not everyone is supportive of the decision .
John D. Roth , professor of history at Goshen College , is saddened by the choice to play the anthem .
Planning is underway for a campus meeting to be held next week to foster continued conversation and dialogue about the national anthem .
President Brenneman will be leading this session .
Please watch for details in the Communicator on Friday and Monday .
As discussion continues , Roth reminds us that our “ commitment to peacemaking does n’t fall solely on this issue . ”
He encourages us to “ keep finding the balance between courageously expressing Christian convictions that may go against the grain of popular culture with a more gracious embrace of the community in which we live . ”
* 9 - 0 ruling a victory for car rental company Hertz
* Breyer says “ nerve ” center typically at headquarters
NEW YORK , Feb 23 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court said a corporation ’s principal place of business is where its top executives work , typically at the corporate headquarters , rather than where its products or services are sold .
Tuesday 's 9 - 0 ruling in favor of Hertz Global Holdings Inc HTZ.N may limit the ability of parties to pick and choose among courts , including in their own states , to find one with particularly favorable laws or conditions under which to sue .
It is also intended to resolve confusion among lower courts that had adopted many standards to assess where corporations did business in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction .
In the Hertz case , two California citizens sued the car rental company in California state court for alleged violations of that state ’s wage and hour laws .
The plaintiffs said Hertz was a California citizen , subject to the jurisdiction of state courts , because of the business it conducted there .
They sought class - action status .
Hertz sought to move the case to federal court .
It said its core executive functions were at its Park Ridge , New Jersey , headquarters , that it operated in 44 U.S. states and that it did less than 20 percent of its business in California .
A federal district court ruled against Hertz , finding that California was its principal place of business because it did significantly more business there than anywhere else .
The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed .
Justice Stephen Breyer , writing for the Supreme Court , disagreed , saying the principal place of business “ is best read as referring to the place where a corporation ’s officers direct , control , and coordinate the corporation ’s activities . ”
This , he said , is known as the corporation ’s “ nerve center ” and is typically its headquarters .
Breyer said federal courts had adopted a range of increasingly complex tests for where corporations conducted business .
He said this task seemed “ doomed to failure ” given that corporations come in many forms , and do business in many ways and in many regions .
“ Courts do not have to try to weigh corporate functions , assets , or revenues different in kind , one from the other , ” Breyer wrote .
“ Our approach provides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply . ”
The Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit ruling and returned the case to lower courts for further proceedings .
The case is Hertz Corp v. Friend , U.S. Supreme Court , No. 08-1107 .

Letters that lay undiscovered in national archives for more than 230 years suggest that Silbury Hill , the enigmatic man-made mound that stands between Marlborough and Beckhampton , may have originally be constructed around some sort of totem pole .
Historians have uncovered in the British Library in London letters written in 1776 that describe a 40 ft - high pole which once stood at the centre of Silbury Hill .
Europe ’s largest man-made mound .
The letters detail an 18th century excavation into the centre of the man-made mound , where archaeologists discovered a long , thin cavity six inches wide and about 40 ft deep .
A separate excavation found fragments of oak timber within the cavity leading historians to believe that the mound was built around the pole dating from around 2,400 BC .
David Dawson , director of the Wiltshire Heritage Museum in Devizes , said : “ This is important , lost information dug out of the library , rather than through field work .
“ It tells us that in one of its earliest phases some kind of totem pole was erected on the mound , then subsequent additions to build the hill up were piled up around that timber . ”
The 18th century letters , written from Edward Drax to Lord Rivers , described excavations Drax had supervised at Silbury Hill .
He oversaw the digging of a vertical shaft from top to bottom that is sometimes claimed to be the work of the Duke of Northumberland .
Drax , a wealthy landowner who lived in Bath , had hired a team of miners to dig a shaft from the top of Silbury Hill , to the centre of the hill , 125 feet below .
To begin with the miners found little but chalk and pieces of deer antler , but 95 feet down - some 30 feet above where they expected the base of the mound to be – they stumbled upon a deep , narrow cavity .
The hole was six inches across but Drax noted : “ We have already followed it already about 20 feet , we can plumb it about eleven feet more . ”
In his letter he wrote that “ something now perished must have remained in this hole to keep it open ” .
Together with a later , independent account of fragments of oak timber found at the centre of the mound , the evidence adds weight to the totem pole theory .
Last year English Heritage completed a £ 2 million restoration programme on the mound to prevent it from collapsing after previous excavations , including the one by Drax , had left the structure weakened and prey to erosion .
Drax ’s letters have been published for the first time in the new volume of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine .

Water warmed by climate change is taking giant bites out of the underbellies of Greenland ’s glaciers .
As much as 75 per cent of the ice lost by the glaciers is melted by ocean warmth .
“ There ’s an entrenched view in the public community that glaciers only lose ice when icebergs calve off , ” says Eric Rignot at the University of California , Irvine .
“ Our study shows that what ’s happening beneath the water is just as important . ”
In the summer of 2008 , Rignot ’s team measured salinity , temperature and current speeds near four calving fronts in three fjords in western Greenland .
They calculated melting rates from this data .

The underwater faces of the different glaciers retreated by between 0.7 and 3.9 metres each day , representing 20 times more ice than melts off the top of the glacier .
This creates ice overhangs that crumble into the sea , says Paul Holland at the British Antarctic Society .
Warming water may also be unlocking ice from the seabed , removing the buttresses that stop inland ice sliding out to sea , says Rignot .
This is one way that warming oceans could be helping to shift Greenland ’s ice off the land and out to sea .
Glaciologist Eric Steig at the University of Washington in Seattle says the importance of bottom - melting by warm ocean water was well - known in Antarctic glaciers .
“ But this is the first study to strongly indicate that it is occurring in Greenland too , ” he says .

South African education officials are investigating reports that a girls ' boarding school dormitory was closed because of lesbian relationships .
Two girls who were caught kissing reportedly said that other pupils were involved in same - sex relationships , and 27 pupils were expelled .
Rights activists say the high school in KwaZulu - Natal province has overreacted .
South Africa is the only African country to guarantee freedom from discrimination to homosexuals .
However , activists say that prejudice remains common .
The school has not been named .
The Star newspaper says some of the pupils who have not been able to return home have been moved to houses near the school on a temporary basis .
Education Department spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa is quoted by the Star newspaper as saying that schools do not have the right to remove or expel pupils because of their sexual orientation .
My Sunday column reflected on the ironies of British and American conservatism on the gay question :
Since I left the UK a quarter of a century ago as a supporter of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan , the gulf between American and British conservatism on this question has never been this wide .
There is something of an irony in this .
Gay conservatism first found its footing in the US in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the publication of Bruce Bawer ’s A Place at the Table and my own Virtually Normal .
The gay left denounced us as “ homocons ” , but the gay and lesbian group Log Cabin Republicans named after Abraham Lincoln ’s log cabin thrived .
The push to integrate gays into the military deemed by the largely leftist gay movement of the 1970s to be a violation of the “ rainbow coalition ” against the military and war dominated US politics in 1993 , long before it came to pass in Britain .
My own New Republic cover story , “ A conservative case for gay marriage ” , which argued along David Cameron lines that commitment and family should be valued among gays as well as straights , was published in America in 1989 .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
When former " Growing Pains " actor Andrew Koenig missed his flight home to Los Angeles from Vancouver , British Columbia , last week , his father became worried .
Walter Koenig , an actor known for playing Pavel Chekov in the original " Star Trek " series , had just received a letter from his son that had a " despondent tone , " according to a family statement on the father 's Web site .
Two days later -- on February 18 -- the elder Koenig and his wife , Judy , called Vancouver police to report their 41 - year - old son missing , Detective Raymond Payette said .
" Andrew has recently been despondent and his family and friends are concerned for his well - being , " a police statement said .
Although the Koenigs are reaching out for public help , their son's disappearance is too painful for them to appear on camera to talk about it , Walter Koenig said .
" I tried it once , and it was just too difficult , " he said .
The parents last talked on the phone to their son February 9 , a week before he failed to board his flight home , the family statement said .
" Andrew was suffering from depression at the time of his disappearance , " the family said .
Walter and Judy Koenig will travel to Vancouver on Tuesday to assist with the search , a family spokesman said .
Andrew Koenig , who was in Vancouver to visit friends , was last seen by those friends at a Vancouver bakery on Valentines Day , two days before the missed flight , police said .
Walter Koenig , in the posting on his Web site , said he did not believe there was one specific incident that led to his son 's disappearance .
" I think it 's something that has been a part of his makeup for a long time , " he said .
" There 's no single trauma .
There 's no episode .
There 's nothing of that nature . "
He also said drugs were not an issue .
" It was also discovered that Andrew sold or gave away a number of his possessions before flying to Canada , and he refused a job , saying he ' was n't going to work anymore , ' " the family statement said .
Andrew Koenig was described as being 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 135 pounds , with brown shoulder - length hair and brown eyes , authorities said .
Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to notify police .
Koenig appeared in 25 episodes of " Growing Pains " from 1985 to 1989 , playing Richard " Boner " Stabone , according to the Internet Movie Database Web site .
He also has appeared in episodes of several other TV shows , including " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , " " G.I. Joe , " " My Two Dads " and " 21 Jump Street . "
His father 's
Web site describes him as " a gifted and passionate , multitalented young man . "

The aim of the device is to bridge the gap between laptops and smartphones .
Apple are also reported to be gearing up to launch a slate device in late January to go on sale in March , according to the Wall Street Journal .
You can imagine how overwhelming it is for the ordinary consumer

The HP device is also expected to go on sale later this year .
" It 's a beautiful little product , " said Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer .
During his keynote address at CES , Mr Ballmer demonstrated the machine in front of an audience of over 3,500 press , bloggers , analysts and industry peers .
He also showed off two other tablet computers - one made by Archos and the other by Pegatron Corp .
Muted reaction Reaction to the as yet unnamed device was somewhat subdued .
" What we saw confirmed my worst suspicions that this is your standard Microsoft software in a slate form , " Paul Miller , senior associate editor of technology website Engadget , told BBC News .
" It 's an interesting product in itself but Microsoft could have gone further .
It 's not anything new in terms of software and that is what you really need to make a device like this make people want to buy it . "
Analysts warn that a glut of these products will confuse consumers
However , technology blogger Devin Connors of Tom's Hardware did not agree .
" It looked really good given the short amount of time we saw it for and it has Windows 7 .
Everyone loves Windows 7 and putting it in a device the size of an e-reader is probably going to be a winning combination . "
The lack of enthusiasm for the product was in part due to speculation about what - if anything - Apple may launch .
Rumours of a Apple slate - dubbed the iSlate - has dominated the blogosphere in recent weeks , although there has been no formal announcement by the Cupertino - based company .
" Apple tends to change the game and this Microsoft / HP tablet did n't blow them out of the water , " said Dean Takahashi of tech blog VentureBeat.com .
" How successful it will be is up in the air , but HP is the biggest technology company in the world and can certainly put a lot of muscle behind the device , " he told BBC News .
Microsoft is the world 's biggest software company .
Market boost
This is not Microsoft 's first attempt to introduce a tablet or slate - like computer .
Back in 2002 , the company introduced a tablet PC version of Windows XP , which failed to take off .
The form factor is around 10 years old .
Windows 7 replaced the much hated Windows Vista Analysts however believe these new entries should give the middling $ 950 m ( £ 597 m ) US market for tablets a much needed jolt .
" Apple could do for the tablet market what it did for smartphones with the iPhone , " analyst David Daoud of IDC told USA Today .
Other industry watchers fear that consumers might be a little wary with so many companies all rushing at once to bring out new devices .
" With this market awash in products , customer confusion is what we have for certain , " said Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group .
In his address , Mr Ballmer also focused on new PCs , software and the success of Windows 7 which was released last October .
" The biggest hit of the year was Windows 7 , " said Mr Ballmer .
" Windows 7 is by far the fastest selling operating system in history . "
The software boss cited figures from the market analysis firm NPD that said that since the launch of Windows 7 , sales of consumer PCs in the US over the latest holiday period were up more than 50 % from the year before .

POLITICIANS DO not scrutinise State and semi-State organisations enough , Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey has told a seminar on the electoral system .
Mr Dempsey warned against public representatives getting distracted from their national function by “ constant clientelism ” , when he addressed the event hosted by the Parliamentary Society of former Oireachtas members .
“ Our State and semi -State organisations are not scrutinised nearly enough . . . particularly in relation to their service delivery to citizens , ” he said .
The Minister said Ireland ’s electoral system made it inevitable that TDs would “ betray their calling ” when re-election was a priority .
“ Any time a public representative abandons their own judgment to serve as the representative of a lobby group or objective they do n’t actually believe in , they ’re betraying their calling . ”
Founder of the Progressive Democrats Des O’Malley said the formation of new political parties was an essential component of a dynamic democratic system .
If it became difficult to start and maintain new parties , democracy in a country would decline .
The real impediment to the emergence and survival of new parties was the dispersion of public funds , which was based almost entirely on past electoral performance .
“ This means that it is very difficult , indeed almost impossible , for a new party to break through in electoral terms , ” said Mr O’Malley .
“ This is a disgraceful manipulation of public funds in favour of . . . the somewhat stifling incumbency , ” he said , adding that he wished someone would set up a new party .
Former president of the European Parliament Pat Cox said the Republic , which was now experiencing its third major economic and social “ catastrophe ” since the 1950s , was failing its people .
A preference for short - term pragmatism over long - term vision had led to this , Mr Cox said .
“ We may need a new electoral system . . . but I would argue that it should be part of a wider and deeper project . . . what we need is a new Republic . ”
Former Fianna Fáil TD Jim Glennon offered a humorous reflection on the life of a backbench deputy .
As a rugby player , he said he always knew who he was supposed to be marking before a match .
“ But it was only when I went into politics that the concept of marking a man at a funeral surfaced . ”
Glennon said there was a “ funeral culture ” among politicians which had left him with a sense of “ self - disgust ” .
IBM 's Supplies Division introduced the Port - A - Punch in 1958 as a fast , accurate means of manually punching holes in specially scored IBM punched cards .
Designed to fit in the pocket , Port - A - Punch made it possible to create punched card documents anywhere .
The product was intended for " on - the - spot " recording operations -- such as physical inventories , job tickets and statistical surveys -- because it eliminated the need for preliminary writing or typing of source documents .
Among the Port - A - Punch 's customers and applications were : Ford Motor Company , to locate new car prospects and other marketing data ; New York State Department of Public Works , to conduct traffic surveys in the field ; Reynolds Metals Company , for sales personnel call reports ; U.S. Army Ordnance Tank Automotive Command , to report on vehicle R&D tests ; Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company , for time reporting by field installers and repairmen ; Jackson Brewing Company , to invoice customers at time of delivery ; Thompson - Ramo Woolridge Corporation , for faster production line reporting ; Varina Wholesale Builders Supply Company , for point - of - sale recording of chain store sales and inventory data ; and Peckham Road Corporation , to prepare job tickets on customer shipments leaving various plants .

WHO VISITS PANTRIES WHO VISITS PANTRIES Kindness is your daily source of inspiration and guide to making a difference in fresh and exciting ways , no matter where you are .
One in eight Americans — 37 million — received emergency food help last year , up 46 % from 2005 , the nation 's largest hunger - relief group reports today .
Children are hit particularly hard , according to the report by Feeding America , a network of 203 food banks nationwide .
One in five children , 14 million , received food from soup kitchens , food pantries and other agencies , up from 9 million in 2005 , the year of the group 's last major survey .
" This is a crisis , " says Vicki Escarra , president of Feeding America .
" People need to understand that this is America , and we 're seeing this kind of need . "
She says the report is her group 's most comprehensive study on emergency food distribution .
FOOD BANKS : More who need and more who give NATIONWIDE :
More first timers at food banks RECORD DEMAND : Food banks adapt for busy holidays KINDNESS : New ways we give and volunteer
It comes as a record number of Americans are receiving food stamps — 33.7 million last year — and as President Obama , who has set a goal of ending childhood hunger by 2015 , proposed in his budget Monday to add $ 1 billion annually to school - based food programs .
The report " reinforces what we know , which is that poverty and hardship are rising , " says Stacy Dean , director of food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , which researches how public programs affect low - and middle - income people .
She says some of the same people who get food stamps also go to soup kitchens or food pantries , because the government aid might not be enough .
The Agriculture Department reported in November that 14.6 % of households did n't have enough food at some time in 2008 .
Feeding America based its report on 61,000 interviews with people seeking food aid and 37,000 surveys of food pantries , soup kitchens , emergency shelters and other programs affiliated with Feeding America food banks .
More than a third of those interviewed said they had to choose between food and other necessities , including rent , utilities and health care .
The average monthly income of households seeking help , $ 940 , is below the $ 1,214 federal poverty level for a two - person household .
" Our system is overburdened , " Escarra says .
She says companies , individuals and the federal government have increased donations , but food banks are still struggling to keep up with demand .
The Food Bank of Northern Nevada served 124,200 people last year , four times as many as in 2005 , spokeswoman Jocelyn Lantrip says .
" We 're a very hard - hit state , " Lantrip says , noting Nevada 's 13 % unemployment rate .
She says the food bank is able to meet demand largely because it got a new privately funded facility in July 2008 that tripled the bank 's size and expanded its ability to accept perishable food , much of it donated by grocery stores .
In Austin , the Capital Area Food Bank is holding more food drives and sending trucks to local grocery stores to pick up food about to expire , spokeswoman Kerri Qunell says .
She says the bank collected 3.3 million pounds of food last year , up from 1.8 million in 2008 .
Qunell says most of her food bank 's clients have jobs but are n't earning enough to make ends meet .
Like Lantrip in Nevada , she sees more newcomers .
She recalls meeting a man in his early 60s who lined up for food at a mobile pantry .
He told her that , in the past , " my wife and I were always the ones who helped . "

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Researchers at National Jewish Health and the University of Colorado Denver used a new strategy to develop cancer vaccines that were remarkably effective in mice .
In the February 16 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , Kimberly Jordan , PhD , Jill Slansky , PhD , and John Kappler , PhD , report that 100 percent of the mice vaccinated with a peptide they developed remained alive and tumor - free for at least 60 days after inoculation with colon cancer cells .
The research suggests a method for developing vaccines against a wide variety of cancers .
" We developed a peptide vaccine that binds strongly to naturally occurring T cells and stimulates them to vigorously attack cancer cells in mice , " said Dr. Slansky , Associate Professor in the Integrated Immunology Department at National Jewish Health and the University of Colorado School of Medicine .
" We can't guarantee that the vaccines we developed will make it to human trials , but our work does show that very effective cancer vaccines can be made , and outlines a new strategy for their development . "
T cells are one of the prime sentinels of the immune system , which sound the alarm and help orchestrate the immune response .
Ever since scientists found T cells inside tumors , they realized that the body does have a natural , albeit mild , immunity to cancer .
The T cells inside tumors recognize antigens on the surfaces of tumor cells , but do n't bind them strongly enough to sound an alarm or initiate a robust immune response .
Scientists have tried several strategies to stimulate those T cells , from general immune stimulants to synthetic variations on the naturally occurring antigens .
Although some of the vaccines showed moderate results in animal models , none has proven effective in humans .
Dr. Slansky hypothesized that previous vaccine candidates were unsuccessful because they did not bind strongly enough to the T cells found inside tumors .
As a result , the vaccines failed to stimulate the T cells into mounting an effective immune response .
So , she , structural biologist Dr. Kappler , and Dr. Kimberly Jordan , the postdoctoral fellow whose work bridges the two labs , designed peptide vaccines that resemble naturally occurring antigens but bind more strongly to the T cells found inside tumors .
They evaluated five candidate peptide vaccines .
They vaccinated mice twice with the candidate vaccines , then injected colon tumor cells into the mice a week later .
The results were quite variable .
Two of the vaccines protected few or no mice , three other vaccines kept 60 % , 90 % and 100 % alive and tumor - free for 60 days .
The researchers tried to learn what distinguished the effective peptide vaccines from ineffective ones .
They found that the ineffective vaccines strongly stimulated T cells that recognized the peptide vaccine but not any T cells that recognized antigen on the cancer cells .
The successful vaccines stimulated T cells that recognized both the peptide vaccine and the naturally occurring antigen .
The successful antigens stimulated the growth of many more T cells than the ineffective ones .
Those T cells were also highly activated and ready to attack , as evidenced by their production of cytokine signaling molecules .
Remarkably , the most successful vaccine varied by only one amino acid from the naturally occurring antigen , which provoked almost no immune response .
" Our theory about the importance of the T cell - peptide bond was correct , but we learned that the peptides must also stimulate T cells that cross react with the existing antigens and produce a large population of activated T cells , " said Dr. Kappler .
" We believe this provides a very promising strategy for developing cancer vaccines .
We are now working to learn why a single - amino - acid substitution makes such a huge difference in effectiveness . "
The research was supported by grants from the American Cancer Society , the National Cancer Institute and Cancer Research Institute .

Simon Butler ’s goal line handball gifted Kings Arms Wheatley a place in the Sam Waters Cup semi final as they romped to a 4 - 1 win over Kidmore End .
With the Reading Sunday League side 1 - 0 up and seemingly cruising , the centre - back ’s instinctive reaction to clear a goal - bound header earned him a straight red card .
Kings Arms , who ply their trade in the Upper Thames Valley League , scuffed the resulting spot kick , leaving Kidmore to hang on with 10 men for 70 minutes .
The away side ’s rearguard action swung into operation as Kings Arms slick passing game began to pay dividends .
However , when opportunities presented themselves they found goalkeeper Simon Switala in inspired form .
Kidmore were still a threat on the break and chances for James Day , Robert Dighton and Richard Pilcher came and went .
The tie began to stretch out in the second period as Kings Arms searched for an elusive equaliser and soon got their reward .
Darren Ferris ’ outstretched leg upended the home side ’s useful right winger in the box on 65 minutes , and this time made no mistake from 12 yards .
As the game entered the closing stages Kidmore faded and Kings Arms rattled in three goals in the final 10 minutes for a harsh final scoreline .
Ok , S&P actually downgraded California to A - .
And since developing countries have some of the best balance sheets around , maybe the title is especially unfair to those countries .
The reason ?
The budget situation remains horrible .
Dow Jones :
Due to uncertain assumptions of major portions of the budget , S&P said the state 's credit is more susceptible to adverse economic developments .
As a result , it lowered its ratings on the state 's $ 63.9 billion of general obligation debt by one notch to A- , which is four notches into investment grade .
That is the lowest such rating for any state in the U.S. California also has a negative outlook , meaning future downgrades are n't out of the question .
And while the budget proposal includes efforts to make some structural improvement to the state 's projected fiscal imbalance , S&P said it does so by assuming what it considers to be " significant increases in federal reimbursements and funding and reduced federal spending mandates -- provisions over which the state lacks singular or direct authority . "
It also requires voter approval of two ballot measures to allow the redirection of $ 1 billion in funds presently earmarked pursuant to two prior election results .

" 3D comes to your living room " was supposed to be one of the biggest stories at CES 2010 , and indeed it was — the promotional push by Panasonic , LG , Samsung , Sony , and a few smaller panel makers was massive , with multimillion - dollar booth setups intended to awe conference - goers and start the technology off with a bang .
Unfortunately for the billions that have been pumped into R&D and manufacturing for 3D TVs , the normally hype - friendly press has been completely underwhelmed by what its sees after donning the ubiquitous shutter glasses here on the show floor .
The collective response from the early adopter crowd at every booth has been , " Meh , I 'm not going to buy one of these . "
But because of the specific approach that the industry has settled on , consumers do n't have to be bowled over for 3D TV to wind up in every living room .
Here 's a look at the current state of 3D TV , and at why it 's coming to a screen near you whether you like it or not .
Everyone bet on the same 240 Hz LCD horse
Sharp , LG , Samsung , Sony , and the list goes on .
Everyone is on board .
With a few possible niche exceptions , the entire consumer electronics industry seems to have settled on a single implementation of 3D TV : active shutter glasses ( vs. the passive glasses used in cinema 3D ) .
The basic idea is that the 3D display shows video as a series of alternating frames : left eye , right eye , left eye , right eye .
The viewer then dons a pair of powered shutter glasses , which block out one eye or the other on alternate frames .
The glasses sync to the display via infrared — there 's a transmitter on the bottom of the display panel and a receiver in the glasses .
The main disadvantage of this shutter approach is that the active glasses need a battery .
Fortunately , the battery is very small ( like a watch battery ) and for most of the glasses I tried the size and weight were comparable to passive 3D glasses .
The advantage of the active shutter approach is that you can watch video in 1080 p ; in contrast , passive glasses that use polarized light only let you do 1080i .
( Remember this advantage , because , as I 'll explain later , it 's the key to why 3D TV will succeed even if it fails . )
Except for Panasonic , which is betting heavily on plasma technology , the rest of the market has settled on LED LCD at 240 Hz ( 120 Hz per eye ) as the display technology of choice for 3D TV .
You 'll also need a Blu-ray player that 's compatible with the new Blu-ray 3D spec and that uses HDMI 1.4 , which is a higher - bandwidth variant of HDMI that 's needed for transmitting the alternating frames at increased frequencies .
Samsung and Sony both demonstrated AMOLED - based 3D TVs , also based on the active shutter approach , in sizes from 15 inches to 32 inches , but there are apparently no plans to commercialize the technology any time soon .
These were merely prototypes to show what 's possible right now with AMOLED .
Unfortunately for both consumers and the industry , only the smaller AMOLED 3D displays blew anyone away .
The 3D effect on the 15 - inch AMOLED at the Samsung booth was just mind - bendingly good at the proper distance ; likewise with the larger AMOLED at the Sony booth .
Plasma was next on the quality spectrum , but with the Panasonic TVs I did n't feel like I wanted to watch very much TV that way .
I could see using the 3D effect for the occasional movie , but the effect was n't so compelling that I could imagine watching everything in 3D .
LED LCD was last on the list , with the effect at various booths ranging from " hmmm ... yeah , I could see using this , " to " I 'm going to have a headache if I do n't get these glasses off immediately . "
AMOLED 3D : more like this , please
Side and angle views of Samsung 's 32 inch AMOLED 3D TV
As I said above , the AMOLED displays were the clear winners at 3D .
Right now , though , it 's not clear to me why the distance and ambient lighting seemed to matter as much for the 3D effect as they did , but they certainly were crucial .
Stepping back from the small Samsung AMOLED produced a very clear 3D picture that was so real that I wanted to lick the shiny little Pixar aliens , but when I stood in front of the 32 inch AMOLED the effect was diminished ( Samsung had the glasses tethered to prevent theft , so I could n't experiment with distance for the 32 inch display ) .
At the Sony booth , the large AMOLED screen was tucked back into a little viewing booth that blocked out ambient light .
I do n't know if it was the ambient light blocking or the distance at the Sony booth , but the 3D effect was very good .
Too bad we wo n't see AMOLEDs like this on the market any time soon .
As I reported in March of last year , the commercialization of OLED has been delayed by the economic downturn .
New factories have to be built to produce these displays , and that build - out wo n't happen until credit and capital free up and consumer demand returns .
The Samsung rep working the AMOLED booth made clear that there 's no announced timeframe for bringing these displays to market , which suggests that they 're all one - off lab prototypes and not evidence of a functioning production pipeline .
And given that Samsung has been ahead of everyone else in the large - screen OLED race , I would n't count on Sony or anyone else being further along .

More than 2,000 people spent hours trapped inside the Channel Tunnel after five Eurostar trains broke down due to cold weather .
The trains failed as they left the cold air in northern France and entered the warmer tunnel .
Some passengers were evacuated via service tunnels to car trains , while others were kept on their trains .
Many have faced gruelling 15 - hour journeys .
Eurostar has cancelled all its services for Saturday .
Meanwhile , more snow and freezing temperatures are expected for parts of Scotland and south - east and eastern England .
Heavy snowfall caused travel chaos , forced schools to close and cut off power supplies in parts of the UK on Friday .
Electrics failure Although one Eurostar train is still stuck in the tunnel , there are no passengers on board .
John Keefe from Eurotunnel , the operator of the Channel Tunnel , said the situation was " absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented " .
" There 's never actually been an evacuation of a Eurostar train in the 15 years that the tunnel has been opened and last night we evacuated two whole trains to get people off . "
The evacuation procedure we followed was one that we set down ourselves
Eurostar passenger Lee Godfree
Snow leads to further disruption
Four trains have been moved from the tunnel but an empty one remains stuck .
The five trains were coming from Brussels and Paris , and Eurostar said the change in the atmospheric conditions caused a problem with their electrics .
Eurostar said some passengers were already back in England .
Director of communications Mary Walsh said the company was " extremely sorry " for the delays and refunds would be available for all those affected .
" We will also be looking at compensation , " she added .
Many people are at terminals at either end of the tunnel , waiting to make the crossing or to be transferred to other stations in England .
Lee Godfree , a passenger evacuated from one of the stranded trains , said he and his family had arrived in Folkestone at 0500 GMT , having left Disneyland Paris at 1837 GMT .
He said their journey had been a " complete nightmare " .
" We were without power .
We ran out of water , we ran out of food and there was very , very poor communication from the staff , " he told the BBC .
Some Eurostar passengers were transferred on to a car shuttle train ( pic - Lee Godfree ) .
" We lost air conditioning when we lost the power .
We had to open the emergency doors ourselves .
" The evacuation procedure we followed was one that we set down ourselves . "
Mr Godfree , from Stowmarket in Suffolk , who was travelling with his wife and young son , was told there were 700 people on board their stranded train , where the " heat was unbearable " .
He said there were pregnant women , people in wheelchairs and hundreds of parents with young children , and they got themselves on to the car train , where they sat on the " filthy floors " .
The shuttle took them to Calais before heading back to England and they then had to wait for a train to take them on to London .
One of the stranded trains was towed out of the tunnel and taken directly to St Pancras .
Passengers from a second were evacuated from the stricken train by Eurotunnel shuttle and later transferred to a Eurostar train bound for St Pancras .
People on the third train were also evacuated to a service tunnel and then taken to the terminal in France .
The fourth and fifth trains were coupled together and hauled by a diesel train to England .
The problems with the Eurostar services had a knock - on effect for car passengers hoping to use the tunnel .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Eurotunnel assisted with the removal of the trains from the tunnel and at first the car service was suspended but it has since re-opened with " significant delays " .
James Brownell and his friends had a 12 - hour wait at Folkestone .
They were due to catch the 1800 shuttle on Friday night but only arrived in France at 0500 GMT .
The 27 - year - old from Essex said they were left in their car in " sub zero temperatures " but they luckily had duvets and blankets to keep them warm .
He said they were offered no food or water , and very little information .
" It was so frustrating , we did not have a clue what was going on , " he said .
" There were babies in the car behind us .
It has been a terrible 12 hours . "
Hazardous roads
To add to passengers ' difficulties , there is congestion around Folkestone and Dover due to the Channel Tunnel problems and the closure of the port of Calais due to severe weather .
Kent Police said bad weather in the county was also making driving hazardous .
Ch Supt Matthew
Nix said : " Many people have spent a long time in their cars and other vehicles .
" We appreciate how difficult it is for them and our partners , supported by Kent Police , are making health checks and providing hot drinks and snacks . "
It will take " considerable time " to clear the backlog of vehicles and people should only make essential journeys , he added .
The force has brought Operation Stack into effect - holding coast - bound heavy goods vehicles on the M20 .
It means more than 2,300 lorries can be parked on the motorway .

ID card campaign group No2ID has - with a little financial backing from Microsoft - won admission to the industry working group of Project STORK , the EU programme for devising interoperability standards for electronic ID systems across Europe .
Representing " civil society interests " , No2ID will be able to attend and report on STORK discussions with industry representatives .
And keep an eye on what the Identity & Passport Service is up to .
" We know that IPS is one of those around the table , " No2ID National Coordinator Phil Booth told The Register , " and is using the interoperability of passports as an excuse to drive fingerprints on chips .
" We 'll be able to see who 's pushing what , and who 's likely to be going more extreme than other countries . "
No2ID reckons that at the moment the UK Home Office 's ID scheme is " by far the most pernicious ID scheme in the continent , if not the world .
" But if developing European standards start to present a threat to privacy and civil liberties , then we are now in a much better position to know about it and lobby against it . "
No2ID is probably the first non-governmental and non-corporate organisation to be given this level of access by Project STORK , but it seems reasonable to speculate that others might now follow .
The Microsoft backing will cover travel expenses , and comes from the company 's corporate social responsibility fund , bless . ®

I think this is a great question to ask , and it is also the subject of some debate .
I guess the answer would depend on what the context is .
Some bloggers are paid , but usually by some company to churn out news for that company or about a product , much like the way many popular newspapers , magazines or news programs operate .
In my opinion , I do n’t think if you get hired by one of these companies you should be able to call yourself a blogger anymore .. you ’re then a journalist :) .
I do however think bloggers should get paid , and still keep their title .
It really has to do with HOW they get paid .
I will get to what I mean by that in a minute , but first we need to examine the situation a little bit to realize why paying bloggers is a good idea .
I was at my buddy ’s cabin this weekend and I do n’t know if it was the peace and quiet , or the beer , but for some reason a thought popped into my head :
What makes a good blog any different than a good song , or a good movie , or TV show ?
Why do n’t bloggers directly charge their readers before reading their content ?
Even the best bloggers .. why do n’t they charge ?
It ’s because blogs were born on the internet , and the internet is about sharing information openly , and for no other reason than because people want to .
Movies , Music and TV were born in a completely different place , where big companies controlled the content and did their best to put a lock on it , unless they were payed .
But alas , the internet has found a way for even this content to be unlocked and shared with the world for free , and the big companies are n’t even getting paid anymore .
There has to be a better solution for ALL intellectual property in this internet injected world … and there is .
Why has there been no blog platform like a WordPress or Blogger , that offers their most popular bloggers a percentage of ads placed .
I ’m not talking about ugly AdSense ads that only pay on a click - through or a purchase point click - through basis .
I ’m talking about the website posting non-conficting , unobtrusive ads on a bloggers webpage , and having the bloggers get paid based on impressions ( page views ) .
One of the theories that makes this work is the ads being small , and them being placed in the corner of a function of a site , not a side bar .
In this case the function would be a blog article .
The ads are not only placed where a user can’t really ignore it , but they are allowing the readers to get the content for free , while they are supporting their favorite authors , who would have more time to devote to writing good news .
The icons could also expand to reveal more information .
There are of course a few more crucial pieces of the puzzle , but I gave you as much information about it as I can right now .
This would create a blogosphere full of bloggers who suddenly have more time for things like research , fact checking , interviewing , travel , and other crucial aspects of what makes a good blogger a good news source .
This would essentially be a revolution of information , and the independent blogger community formed may even prove to be a contender for mainstream news networks , being more accessible , more updated as a whole , and with a much wider selection of sources on any particular topic .
The future of blogging looks bright , and pretty soon the hobby , or even secret double - life blogger , may be able to finally drop the act and introduce themselves to world again ; this time as full time , self - made , “ Professional Bloggers , ” in the true sense of the phrase .
It has a good ring to it .. and being your own boss has an amazing amount of benefits as well , including working in your boxers , and also sometimes eliminating any sneaky or devious hidden motives behind article content .
Oh how the world will change .. Til then though , why not take up blogging ?
It might just eventually pay off ..

The left 's response to Israeli atrocities in Gaza provides a case study in ressentiment .
If we want to stop such slaughters rather than participate in the spectacle of them , we need to stop fetishising distant victims and start trying to exercise power over our own lives so that meaningful solidarity becomes possible .
A tentative peace reigns in Gaza , if you can call a devastated open prison , surrounded by one of the most powerful militaries in the world , where " Hamas fighters stride confidently down the road with rifles slung across their shoulders " as at peace .
' Both sides ' claim victory , while the overwhelmingly proletarian population counts the cost .
This underlines precisely the problem in seeing the ' sides ' of this conflict in national rather than class terms ; when the bourgeoisie make war , proles always lose .
$ 1bn dollars of Saudi reconstruction money will soon line the pocket of the region 's construction bosses ; as anyone who followed the Halliburton / KBR scandals in Iraq knows , reconstruction is a lucrative business .
Spectators to slaughter
So another slaughter has come and gone as we stood by as spectators , and again overwhelmingly the opposition to the conflict was framed in national , not class terms .
Of course even the most perfectly phrased communist slogans would not have made a material impact on the slaughter , but while nationalism offers nothing but endless bloodshed for the nation , a practice of seeking out , supporting and trying to generalise the small seeds of hope in the region - the village committees resisting the wall in the West Bank , Israeli refuseniks , protestors , Sderot residents and anarchists , the class struggles in Egypt and the fact many more Gazans elected to flee the bombardment than martyr themselves for the nation - at least offers the potential of a different future .
Some groups produced propaganda to this end .
The Manchester and Sheffield Anarchist Federation groups produced a statement which was adapted and distributed by the Solidarity Federation in Brighton , Organise ! in Northern Ireland and the No Borders group , as well as translated into Polish .
The reaction to this leaflet , and a subsequent incident on a demonstration in Sheffield provide a case study in leftist ressentiment , in the affirmation of victimhood and the inability to side with the working class against all our enemies .
Worse than bad ... evil
I previously summarised this leftist ressentiment as ;
anti-consumerism ( Buying stuff bad !
Dumpster diving good ! ) , anti-imperialism ( Imperialism bad !
Resistance good ! ) , Class War Federation
( Toffs bad !
Workin ’ clarse caricatures good ! ) , black pride ( White good ?
Black good ! ) , gay pride ( Straight good ?
Queer good ! ) , much anarcha - feminist health ( Patriarchal medicine bad !
DIY herbalism good ! ) , and even heavyweight theorists like Toni Negri , Harry Cleaver and other ‘ Automonist Marxists ’ who have a tendency to pose the working class as an autonomous force external to and in conflict with capital which must affirm itself ( Capitalist valorisation bad !
Self - valorisation good ! ) "
I was mistaken to use the term ' bad ' here , to be more authentically Nietzschean I should have used the term evil .
The importance of ' evil ' to the leftist , ressentimental worldview became apparent with the reaction to the aforementioned internationalist propaganda produced and distributed on Gaza demonstrations .
As Django noted in his analysis of the Gaza attack and the left 's response ,
To suggest that being anti-war might mean opposing both the capitalist factions engaged in it might not be that controversial to ordinary people , but is met with hysterics from leftists .
As a result , there has been much in the anti-war movement that is troubling .
Of what did these hysterics consist ?
The first part of our case study is the reaction on UK Indymedia to the AF 's text ' No State Solution for Gaza . '
While criticism was not universal and the statement enjoyed some support , the leftist reaction was twofold .
First , it was claimed that the idea anyone on the left or the demonstrations supports Hamas was a " straw man " and " a blatant lie " ( more on this in a minute ) .
Secondly it was alleged it " plays into the hands of Zionists " and the AF and other internationalists are " apologists for the Israeli genocide " - remember this is a text that opens with the sentence " one thing is absolutely clear about the current situation in Gaza : the Israeli state is committing atrocities which must end immediately " - some apologetics for Zionism !
The criticism was accompanied by vague threats of violence ( " the next member of AF I meet is going to suffer the consequences " ) .
Of course violence is justified in confronting ' evil ' , and in ' playing into the hands of Zionists ' the AF had aligned themselves with the ultimate evil .
Gilles Dauvé observes that :
fascism occupies a special place in the spectacle of horrors (...)
For the bourgeoisie and the petit bourgeoisie , fascism was an abnormal phenomenon , a degradation of democratic values explicable only by recourse to psychological explanations .
Liberal anti-fascism treated fascism as a perversion of Western civilisation
' Zionazis '
Leftists routinely equate Zionism with Nazism .
Latuff 's cartoon illustrating this blog is one of many examples from him , while the term ' zionazi ' is a staple of IMC - UK comments .
The manifestation of this in relation to Gaza has been the comparison of the assault to the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto by the Nazis and the widespread labelling of the Israeli assault as a ' Holocaust . '
This exagerated claim was n't plucked from thin air , it stems from the widely reported misquoting of Israel 's deputy defence minister .
He used the hebrew word ' shoah ' , meaning catastrophe , not ' hashoah ' , meaning the catastrophe , the holocaust .
But one has to ask where the usual leftist skepticism towards the capitalist media goes when encountering information that affirms ones biases .
However what is worst about the Israeli onslaught is that - and in this respect only it is like fascism - it is in fact nothing uniquely bad in the world of capitalist barbarism .
The blockade , the media blackout , the use of white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas were all features of the US destruction of Fallujah in 2004 .
More widely , far from being an exceptional ' genocide ' , Israel has acted largely within the norms of Western barba - civilisation ( if one takes the US / UK as standard - bearers for this civilisation and Iraq as their standard ) .
Ignoring this however , leftists set up Zionism as the ultimate evil ; one banner on a march even described it as " 1000 times worse " than Nazism .
Consequently in the face of such an evil , all principles become ' ivory tower ' pontification , all critical thought must be postponed .
Thus we 're told that " Hamas are nasty morons but today they are illuminated saints compared to the Israelis " - ressentiment par exellence ; opposition to evil is beyond criticism .
We are told that to criticise Hamas is to say " that the Republican government in Spain was equally as bad as Francos fascists . "
This example inadvertantly gives the game away ( we will return to the fallacy that mutual criticism means equating the things criticised in a moment ) .
It was of course the Republic that butchered the revolutionary working class long before the fascist victory ( before the fascist putsch in fact , at Casas Viejas ) .
This is precisely the leftist ' my enemy 's enemy is my friend ' logic Dauvé attacks in ' Fascism / anti- fascism ' , a logic of a united front that leads to all kinds of suicidal alliances with class enemies - and as the example of Spain illustrates the physical suppression of dissent .
The next episode in our case study was therefore aptly timed .
' I do n't support Hamas , but ...'
After much foot - stamping histrionics and insistence that saying support for Hamas existed on the demonstrations was a " blatant lie " ( despite visible Hamas flags , and leftists praising their " brave resistance " etc ) , a controversial incident was captured on camera .
The incident involved the destruction of a placard held by an AWL member by the chairman of Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign , applauded by members of the SWP .
The placard read ' no to IDF / no to Hamas ' on one side and ' solidarity with women , workers & the left ' on the other .
The post hoc justifications for this were two - fold ( ignoring the undercurrent of Trot sectarianism which does n't change the arguments made ) .
Firstly , the slogan ' no to IDF / no to Hamas ' was claimed to equate the IDF and Hamas .
There was no equals sign , and you needent have schooling in formal logic to realise that rejecting two things does n't necessarily imply equivalence .
A string of posters produced a list of body counts to ' prove ' the inequivalence of the IDF and Hamas .
A quantitative inequivalence for sure , nobody disputes it , but what crude morality judges the rights and wrongs of a group solely on their body count ?
If an equivalence is implied , it is a qualitative one , akin to ' No to the BNP , No to Labour ' - which does n't imply the BNP are kicking down the doors of , incarcerating and deporting immigrants on anywhere near the scale of the governing party , merely that they 're both bourgeois forces and as communists we reject both .
In fact Brighton Solfed recently distributed a leaflet saying just that , and nobody went hysterical about ' equivalence ' - although you can imagine Labour apologists doing similar mental gymnastics to their Hamas counterparts .
For good measure , the placard was also described as " insensitive " ( might hurt Hamas ' feelings ? ) and " Zionist " ( ' no to the IDF ' ffs ! ) while the AF were apparently " cheering on Zionists who disrupt Palestinian solidarity rallies " for objecting to the theft and destruction of the placard .
This lead onto a second criticism about who has the ' right ' to a ( critical ) opinion on Gaza .
Apparently " it takes the piss to slag off the very people who are being bombed " - even if they 're Islamist gangsters .
Victimhood gives one a special place in the leftist worldview .
For criticising Hamas , I was told " who are you to tell them how and when they should rise up and whether they are doing it properly ? " echoing an earlier theme that " if the Palestinians want a state , and are dying for that right , it is only decent for you to keep your puerile little political fantasies buttoned . "
And " the fact I would prefer to live without a state does not qualify me to lecture Palestinians on what they should be aiming for . "
The assumption is that anyone who is n't under the bombs cannot have a valid opinion ( of course one can speak for ' the Palestinians ' so long as one is uncritical ) .
An affirmation of victimhood as the prerequisite of subjectivity .
The fetishisation of ' the resistance ' , romanticised fighters with AK - 47s is precisely " born of weakness " ( Nietzsche , see below ) - powerless in our own lives it is easy to project our absent agency onto an Other who is put beyond criticism ( " who are we to criticise Palestinians ? " ) .
Ressentiment oncemore .
Consequently , the leftist support for the destruction of the placard - in some cases from the very same people who said saying there was support for Hamas on the demos was " a blatant lie " - could be summed up roughly as follows .
' I do n't support Hamas , but ...' - ' I do support the physical suppression of criticising them ' and ' I would say anybody that stands if the face of Israel deserves my support . '
Supporting while not supporting is a curious act of leftist doublethink .
Presumably anyone destroying an ( for the sake of argument uncontroversial , not anti-semitic ) anti-Israel placard would immediately be identified as a ' supporter of Israel ' or rather a Zionist .
But apparently physically destroying a placard critical of the IDF , Hamas and calling for solidarity with women , workers and the left , on account of the critical mention of Hamas , is not support .
The mind boggles .
Beyond the spectacular ?
What is good ?
All that heightens the feeling of power in man , the will to power , power itself .
What is bad ?
All that is born of weakness .
- Friedrich Nietzsche
So what would activity not rooted in ressentiment look like ?
The most obvious answer - and a popular one amongst the critics quoted in this blog - is direct action activism .
On the face of it , this breaks out of the passive marches , the spectacle of dissent , and materially disrupts the war machine .
To a certain extent this is true - by all accounts the recent smashing of EDO by Smash EDO ( pictured right ) did cause significant damage to precision tooling that will disrupt production of the electro - mechanical components for bomb release mechanisms they manufacture .
But there are valid questions to be asked about the effectiveness of such acts ( in over 4 years of ' actions ' , there 's not been any demonstrable impact on the war effort ) , and their exclusiveness , that is the fact they necessarily exclude those who for one reason or another ( kids , jobs ... ) can't risk arrest or lengthly legal procedings .
Another aspect of this latter point is the way in which ' doing something ' becomes a badge of honour , an individual purging of guilt through self - sacrifice to the cause ( I speak from experience , not a desire to belittle the undoubted dedication and sincerity of many activists , some of whom are friends ) .
This attitude was on display throughout the leftist histrionics over internationalist views on Gaza , for instance : " I 've got photos of war factories I 've damaged " juxtaposed to " revolutionary armchairs " , and " yeah well , I am having to go out now to take direct action against another British ' defence ' company , so I 'll leave the last word to the AF meat puppets who blame Hamas for this tragedy while doing nothing except talk , talk , talk . "
The critique of activism is well - worn and does n't need repeating at length , but needless to say this taking of self - sacrifice as the basis for subjectivity ( and the patronising presumption of everyone elses inferior activity ) is another example of ressentiment .
The text ' Give up activism ' sums it up well :
The key to understanding both the role of the militant and the activist is self - sacrifice - the sacrifice of the self to ' the cause ' which is seen as being separate from the self (...)
Revolutionary martyrdom goes together with the identification of some cause separate from one 's own life - an action against capitalism which identifies capitalism as ' out there ' is fundamentally mistaken - the real power of capital is right here in our everyday lives - we re-create its power every day because capital is not a thing but a social relation between people ( and hence classes ) mediated by things .
Consequently , while activism certainly has the ' feeling of power ' Nietzsche praises , that power is almost entirely just that , a feeling , experienced on an individual or ghetto level , and so it 's ulitmately ' born of weakness . '
Real power is something collective , something social , something exercised in everyday life .
This means on some level it has to be an expression of class power , since capital is a class relation of which war is a symptom , not a single issue which can be addressed palliatively .
Very early on Smash EDO opted for the latter route , abandoning attempts to fraternise with workers at the first hurdle , perhaps with a Lucas Aerospace approach in mind , and opting more for substitutionist SHAC tactics .
A recent example from Greece , although the circumstances are unclear , seems to reflect a more collective apporach , with a call to blockade a port due to ship arms to Israel taken up by multiple groups , which against the background of the recent social insurrection apparently caused the shipment to be cancelled .
But not being in a position of open insurrection , or even heightened class conflict and solidarity , how does the Greek example relate to us here in the UK ?
The 2003 refusal of two anti-war train drivers to move weapons bound for Iraq provides a glimpse at the impact class power could have on the mobilisation for war .
And of course class power does not just mean industrial action ( important though it is ) , as the widespread use of blockades during the anti-CPE struggles in France ( or the Piqueteros in Argentina for that matter ) showed .
So the question becomes how do we get from A to B , how do we increase class power ?
That 's a difficult but necessary question .
However , it 's clear that humanitarian sympathy does not require a fetishisation of victimhood , that a desire to act does not have to mean a subsitutionist urge to ' do something ' and that an opposition to war cannot mean ( however temporarily or critically ) supporting any side other than the working class .
Class power is beyond good and evil , it requires the assertion or our own needs in our everyday lives which puts us in a position to engage in meaningful solidarity with our fellow proletarians around the world .
Huckabee rips CPAC
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee blasted the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday as outdated , nearly corrupt and unrepresentative of the conservative movement .
Huckabee , a 2008 Republican presidential contender and potential 2012 candidate who had spoken at the conference for years , said the reason he blew it off this year was that the meeting has become dominated by libertarian activists .
Advertisement
“ CPAC has becoming increasingly more libertarian and less Republican over the last years , one of the reasons I did n’t go this year , ” Huckabee said in an interview with Fox News , where he is a paid analyst and has his own show .
He was responding to a question about whether he was upset by his single - digit showing in the conference ’s straw poll , which was won by libertarian - leaning Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
But it was n’t the only criticism the Arkansan leveled at CPAC .
Huckabee said the rise of the tea party movement had “ taken all of the oxygen out of the room , ” rendering the venerable conference far less relevant than it had been in previous years .
“ Where CPAC was historically the event , the tea parties are having their own events all over the country and a lot more truly grassroots people are getting involved because of the tea parties , ” said the former governor .
And , goaded by Fox Host Geraldo Rivera , Huckabee went even further .
“ Because of the way that it solicits sponsors , it ’s almost becomes a pay - for - play , ” he said .
“ It ’s kind of like , who will pay money to be able to be a sponsor and get time in the program .
That ’s one of the things that has hurt its credibility in the last couple of years . ”
Dating to his failed 2008 run , Huckabee has had tense relations with the Washington - based conservative leaders who run the conference .
The conservative establishment types questioned his fiscal bona fides and the former governor was annoyed so few of them took his campaign seriously – even after he won the Iowa caucuses .
He has also never fared well in conference ’s straw poll – until Paul , Mitt Romney had won it for three consecutive years – and was n’t likely to do much better this year .
Still , his daughter and adviser , Sarah Huckabee , made no mention of her father ’s concerns about the conservative confab when asked by POLITICO about his absence .
The younger Huckabee Friday said only that the former governor was committed to campaign for a House candidate in South Carolina and then be in New York City for his TV show during the conference .
But that may not make his comments about CPAC – made on the network favored by conservatives on the same night they broadcast live their own Glenn Beck 's keynote speech to the conference – sting any less .
Huckabee ’s assault comes on the heels of a conference , the 37th annual , that reflected both the enduring appeal of CPAC and its unmistakable challenges .
About 10,000 energized conservatives showed up at the Wardman Park Marriott in Washington and were rewarded with red meat - filled speeches from a parade of high - profile GOP politicians and celebrities .
The event won considerable national media coverage and two cable stations even staged correspondents full - time throughout its three days .
But for all the enthusiasm in the hotel ’s corridors , much of the rhetoric on stage felt oddly dated .
For every Marco Rubio – the young Florida Senate candidate who is seen as by many conservatives as their future – there was the NRA ’s Wayne LaPierre , rambling about Clinton - era gun control battles and showing decade - old video clips of himself jousting with TV hosts on the big screens in the ballroom .
Worse , at least in the eyes of CPAC organizers , hearty supporters of Paul showed up in part to ensure the quirky Texas septuagenarian won the straw poll .
What was seen in the past as an indicator of who conservative activists preferred in the next presidential race became ratified as all but worthless as boos rained down in the ballroom when it was disclosed that Paul had won the contest .
The conference was also hurt by its notable absences .
Not only did Huckabee skip an appearance , but former Alaska governor , 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee and sure - fire attention - getter Sarah Palin also did n’t make the trip .
Thought not as directly as Huckabee , Palin also took shots at the conference .
In explaining last year why the Alaskan was n’t attending , Palin aides raised two issues : a lobbying controversy involving David Keene , whose American Conservative Union puts on the event and the presence of the extremist John Birch Society .
Unmentioned , but also possibly a reason she stayed away , was that CPAC organizers complained when Palin appeared to agree to attending the conference in 2009 only to then not show up .
The staff at the Wellcome Library in London have scoured the shelves for the weirdest and most wonderful objects in their collection , the ones that made even them scratch their heads when they first set eyes on them .

Thoughts on HipHop PHP
This morning Facebook announced , as had been rumored for several weeks , a new , faster , implementation of PHP .
To someone , like me , who loves dynamic languages and virtual machines this type of announcement is pretty exciting , after all , if they have some new techniques for optimizing dynamic languages they can almost certainly be ported to a language I care about .
However , because of everything I ’ve read ( and learned about PHP , the language ) since the announcement I ’m not particularly excited about HipHop .
Firstly , there ’s the question of what problem HipHop solves .
It aims to improve the CPU usage of PHP applications .
For all practical purposes PHP exists exclusively to serve websites ( yes , it can do other things , no one does them ) .
Almost every single website on the internet is I / O bound , not CPU bound , web applications spend their time waiting on external resources ( databases , memcache , other HTTP resources , etc. ) .
So the part of me that develops websites professionally is n’t super interested , Facebook is in the exceptionally rare circumstance that they ’ve optimized their I/O to the point that optimizing CPU gives worthwhile returns .
However , the part of me that spends his evenings contributing to Unladen Swallow and hanging around PyPy still thought that there might be some interesting VM technology to explore .
The next issue for consideration was the “ VM ” design Facebook choose .
They ’ve elected to compile PHP into C++ , and then use a C++ compiler to get a binary out of it .
This is n’t a particularly new technique , in the Python world projects like Shedskin and Cython have exploited a similar technique to get good speed ups .
However , Facebook also noted that in doing so they had dropped support for “ some rarely used features — such as eval ( ) " .
An important question is which features exactly , they had dropped support for .
After all , the reason compiling a dynamic language to efficient machine code is difficult is because the dynamicism defeats the compiler ’s ability to optimize , but if you remove the dynamicism you remove the obstacles to efficient compilation .
However , you ’re also not compiling the same language .
PHP without eval ( ) , and whatever else they ’ve removed is quite simply a different language , for this reason I do n’t consider either Shedskin or Cython to be an implementation of Python , because they do n’t implement the entire language .
This afternoon , while I was idling in the Unladen Swallow IRC channel a discussion about HipHop came up , and I learned a few things about PHP I had n’t previous realized .
The biggest of these is that a name bound to a function in PHP cannot be undefined , or redefined .
If you ’ve ever seen Collin Winter give a talk about Unladen Swallow , the canonical example of Python ’s dynamicism defeating a static compiler is the len ( ) function .
For lists , tuples , or dicts a call to len ( ) should be able to be optimized to a single memory read out of a field on the object , plus a call to instantiate an integer object .
However , in CPython today it ’s actually about 3 function calls , and 3 memory reads to get this data ( plus the call to instantiate an integer object ) , plus the dictionary lookup in the global builtins to see what the object named len is .
That ’s a hell of a lot more work than a single memory read ( which is one instruction on an x86 CPU ) .
The reason CPython needs to do all that work is that it a ) does n’t know what the len object is , and b ) when len is called it has no idea what its arguments will be .
As I ’ve written about previously , Unladen Swallow has some creative ways to solve these problems , to avoid the dictionary lookups , and , eventually , to inline the body of the len ( ) into the caller and optimize if for the types it ’s called with .
However , this requires good runtime feedback , since the compiler simply cannot know statically what any of the objects will actually be at runtime .
However , if len could be know to be the len ( ) function at compile time Unladen Swallow could inline the body of the function , unconditionally , into the caller .
Even with only static specialization for lists , dicts , and tuples like :
if isinstance ( obj , list ) : return obj . ob_size elif isinstance ( obj , tuple ) : return obj . ob_size elif isisinstance ( obj , dict ) : return obj .
ma_fill else : return obj . __len__ ()
This would be quite a bit faster than the current amount of indirection .
In PHP ’s case it ’s actually even easier , it only has one builtin array type , which acts as both a typical array as well as a hash table .
Now extend this possibly optimization to not only every builtin , but every single function call .
Instead of the dictionary lookups Python has to do for every global these can just become direct function calls .
Dissatisfied with the botched efforts of underwear bomber patsy Umar Abdul Muttalab , military - industrial complex promises to try again
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , February 3 , 2010
Using information gleaned from the blatantly set - up underwear bomber patsy Umar Abdul Muttalab , intelligence chiefs have assured us that their bosses will stage another terror attack in the U.S. within the next three to six months .
“ According to the nation ’s intelligence chiefs , a terror attack in the United States will likely be launched within the next six months , reports WLS .
“ ABC News has learned some of the intelligence has come from the accused Christmas Day bomber , ” states the report .
Despite the fact that the official story behind the Christmas Day bombing has been discredited beyond all recognition , the establishment is still constantly invoking it as yet another reason for Americans to obediently line up for naked body scans in fear of whatever boogeyman is being waved in front of their faces this week .
Since federal and state authorities apparently now consider libertarians , Ron Paul supporters , gun owners and basically anyone with two brain cells left to rub together as potential domestic terrorists , whatever tricks they do decide to pull over the next six months will undoubtedly be used to tighten the screws against American dissidents that they have consistently characterized as extremist threats .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Authorities last week quietly reversed the official story behind the Christmas Day underwear bomber attack and acknowledged that an accomplice was involved , despite weeks of denial and derision of eyewitness Kurt Haskell ’s description of a sharp - dressed man who helped Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab board Flight 253 in Amsterdam .
Detroit lawyer Kurt Haskell maintained from the beginning that he saw a well - dressed Indian man aid the accused bomber to board the plane despite the fact that he had no passport and was on a terror watch list .
“ While Mutallab was poorly dressed , his friend was dressed in an expensive suit , Haskell said .
He says the suited man asked ticket agents whether Mutallab could board without a passport .
“ The guy said , ‘ He ’s from Sudan and we do this all the time , ’ ” reported the Michigan Live news website .
FBI agents interviewed Haskell and he told them about the sharp - dressed man but officials refused to admit that a wider conspiracy was at hand , stoically maintaining the official story that Abdulmutallab had acted alone .
Authorities claimed that videotapes did not show a second man accompanying Abdulmutallab and yet they refused to release any footage of the alleged bomber .
There seems little doubt that Abdulmutallab had at least one accomplice if not more .
Authorities have remained silent on other eyewitness reports which described a man intently filming the alleged terrorist throughout the whole flight , a connection that strongly suggests the attempted bomber was involved in some kind of drill and that his strings were being pulled by people in more senior positions .
The ludicrous spectacle of long - deceased boogeyman Osama bin Laden apparently claiming responsibility for the attempted attack last weekend only confirmed that a fairytale was being contrived which was totally at odds with what eyewitnesses described .
The glaringly obvious truth that Mutallab was at best a patsy and at worst an informant who was duped into believing he was involved in a drill renders fraudulent any supposed information attributed to him , specifically the notion that America faces the threat of another terrorist attack from anyone other than the only entity that always benefits from such attacks – the military - industrial complex itself .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Hundreds of terror suspects ( read : patsies and mental deficients ) have been convicted in civilian federal courts , including convicted shoe bomber Richard Reid who attended the Finsbury Park Mosque in North London .
The Finsbury imam at the time was Abu Hamza al - Masri who began working with British Security Services in 1997 .
A large number of the supposed terrorists convicted in American courts were entrapped by the FBI in classic COINTELPRO fashion and did not have links to the CIA - created al - Qaeda .
The entrapped were often fuzzy on al - Qaeda or what it represents .
In 2009 , supposed terrorists in New York were so reluctant to participate in an FBI arranged undercover operation they had to be enticed with piles of cash , gifts , and bags of marijuana .
In the media lauded Miami terror case in 2007 , the supposed ringleader Narseal “ Prince Marina ” Batiste “ had heard of Al - Qaeda , but was n’t sure what it stood for .
The FBI instigators made Batiste swear loyalty to al - Qaida ; then had him call on his local buddies to form an ‘ Islamic army ’ in Miami .
None had military training .
Some could barely read .
But Batiste assured the group in the midst of its collective marijuana buzz of greatness ahead , ” writes Saul Landau .
During the Senate “ terror assessment hearing , ” National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair also warned of the growing cyber threat , saying computer - related attacks have become “ dynamic and malicious . ”
Blair warned the United States faces a “ cyber Pearl Harbor ” that will have devastating consequences for America ’s technological infrastructure .
Blair said an increasingly sophisticated group of enemies has “ severely threatened ” the country ’s information systems and he said the recent cyber attacks against Google should be treated as a “ wake up call , ” reports Channel 4 News .
The Google attacks , according to an American internet security firm , came from China or its proxies , not al - Qaeda .
The government also expects us to believe the sophisticated and coordinated attack occurring on September 11 , 2001 , was also the work of medieval terrorists located in remote caves .
It was never explained how Osama bin Laden made NORAD stand down .
Likewise , Blair does not tell us how al - Qaeda will take down the most advanced and complex computer networks in the world , presumably from the backwaters of Pakistan ’s tribal region .

While Lysacek was the first of the top six competitors to perform , Plushenko was the last .
At the end of his performance , the Russian held his arms up with one finger pointed skyward .
" I was positive that I had won , " he said .
" But I suppose Evan needs the medal more than I do .
I now have two silvers ( from 2002 and 2010 ) and a gold ( from 2006 ) . "
There 's little debate that the United States lags behind other industrialized nations in high - speed Internet use .
According to the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , more than 100 million Americans do n't have broadband at home because they either can't get it , ca n't afford it , or are n't aware of its benefits .
Some 65 percent of U.S. households have broadband , a far lower adoption rate than in other technologically advanced countries such as Singapore ( 88 percent ) or South Korea ( 95 percent ) .
And that 's why FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski is proposing a National Broadband Plan that would greatly widen the data pipe to most American homes .
Speaking in Washington D.C. on Tuesday at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners conference , Genachowski set an ambitious goal : His “ 100 Squared ” initiative would bring 100 - megabit - per - second broadband to 100 million U.S. households by 2020 .
Pipe Dream ?
Is the 100 Squared plan doable ?
It depends on whom you ask .
Qwest Communications CEO
Edward Mueller tells
Reuters that not only is the plan is unrealistic , but that consumers do n't want 100 - Mbps broadband .
But at DSL Reports , blogger Karl Bode writes that not only are home broadband speeds of 100 - Mbps very feasible within 10 years , they 'll arrive whether or not the FCC gets involved .
It 's true that home broadband providers are busily upgrading their networks to enable faster connections .
Verizon 's FiOS Network could easily bring 100 - Mbps service to the home , and cable companies are implementing the DOCSIS 3.0 spec to achieve similar goals .
Comcast 's Extreme 50 Service , for instance , currently offers download speeds as fast as 50 megabits per second .
At AT&T , there 's a broadband Uverse package with 24 - Mbps downloads .
Add these efforts together , and it's a reasonable assumption that 100 - Mbps broadband in the home could happen within ten years .
Will it reach 100 million homes ?
That 's questionable .
Certainly , consumers would benefit greatly from increased competition in the home broadband market — something better than today 's telco - cable duopoly .
Do n't Forget Google
Google is planning a series of " experimental " fiber optic networks designed to bring blazingly fast 1 - gigabit - per - second broadband — yes , that 's 10 times faster than the FCC plan — to a small number of U.S. communities .
While no one 's suggesting that 1 - gig service will go mainstream anytime soon , a successful Google broadband implementation would no doubt boost consumer demand for broadband service that far exceeds today 's relatively poky DSL and cable modem connections .
Do we need 100 - Megabit or 1 - gigabit broadband ?
Absolutely .
This is one of those build - it - and - they - will - come scenarios .
" They , " in this case , are the online applications that require faster broadband than what 's currently available .
Genachowski points out that various Internet apps that are n't feasible today , such as numerous health care and educational uses , would be enabled by ubiquitous , super - fast broadband .
I 'd also add that the growing popularity of movie - streaming services such as Netflix , VUDU , and Amazon On Demand , are a good indication that consumer demand for a faster Internet will only continue to grow .

The act of killing is as fundamental to war as oxygen is to fire .
Yet it is also the one thing many combat veterans avoid discussing when they return home , whether out of shame , guilt or a deep fear of being misunderstood .
But a new study of Iraq war veterans by researchers in San Francisco suggests that more discussion of killing may help veterans cope with an array of mental health problems stemming from war .
The study , published last week in The Journal of Traumatic Stress , found that soldiers who reported having killed in combat , or who gave orders that led to killing , were more likely to report the symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder , alcohol abuse , anger and relationship problems .
The study was based on data from health assessments conducted on about 2,800 soldiers who returned from Iraq in 2005 and 2006 .
Shira Maguen , a psychologist at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the principal investigator on the study , said the results suggested that mental health professionals need to incorporate killing more explicitly into their assessments and treatment plans for veterans .
That would include finding ways to discuss the impact of killing , in public forums and in private treatment , to reduce the stigma and shame , she argued .

While some animals hibernate in the winter and prefer to sun themselves during the warmer months , other animals are perfectly comfortable with the snow and offer photographers a plenty of opportunities for remarkable photos .
To celebrate the nicer facets of the leaving winter , we now collected some beautiful and adorable photos of animals in snow .
These photos are nice to look at and will help you get a break from the regular work and hopefully get a fresh perspective on whatever you have to get done today .

The leader of a religious cult was " outraged " when a one - year - old boy did not say " Amen " before a meal and ordered her followers to deprive him of food and water until he died , a prosecutor told jurors .
Three members of the now - defunct cult known as 1 Mind Ministries are on trial for murder in the death of Javon Thompson , who was around 16 months old when he died of starvation and dehydration in either December 2006 or January 2007 , according to authorities .
After the boy died , the cult members prayed for his resurrection , then destroyed all evidence of his death and stuffed his body in a suitcase , which they hid in a shed behind a home in Philadelphia , Assistant State 's Attorney Julie Drake told jurors .
The cult members - Queen Antoinette , 41 ; her daughter , Trevia Williams , 22 ; and Marcus Cobbs , 23 - are representing themselves at trial .
Antoinette declined to make an opening statement , while Williams and Cobbs spoke briefly ; Williams in a voice so quiet that jurors , prosecutors and the judge strained to hear her .
Williams suggested the prosecution 's theory of the case was flawed .
" Pay attention to details , " she said .
Cobbs pledged that " when the truth comes out , " jurors would realise the defendants are not guilty .
" The truth shall set you free , " he said .
The jury of seven men and five women listened intently as Drake recounted how Javon 's mother , Ria Ramkissoon , was recruited into the cult and did nothing to stop her son from wasting away , even though she was " distraught " over his slow and agonising death .
Ramkissoon pleaded guilty last year to child abuse resulting in death and plans to testify against Antoinette , Williams and Cobbs .
At her insistence , the plea deal included an extraordinary provision :
If Javon comes back to life , the plea will be vacated .
Ramkissoon , then a teenage single mother , joined the cult because she wanted to become a Christian and was told she would n't have to work or go to school , Drake said .
The cult members lived together in a small apartment and were forced to abide by an increasingly strict set of rules , and Antoinette was " leery " of Javon , Drake said .
" If she perceived a rebellious spirit in someone , she would characterise it as demonic , " Drake said .
The cult members " did everything they could think of " to make Javon say " Amen " before Antoinette ordered them not to feed him until he did , Drake said .
She later took the boy away from his mother and placed him in Williams ' care , the prosecutor said .
" In full view of every member of that household , Javon wasted away , " Drake said .
" If this little boy had ever had the capacity to say ' Amen , ' he surely lost it .
He could not say anything . "
Ramkissoon prayed for days for Javon to be resurrected , and Antoinette " told her it was her fault " the boy did not come back to life , Drake said .
Prosecutors are seeking a first - degree murder conviction for Antoinette - also known as Toni Sloan - and second - degree murder convictions for Williams and Cobbs .
In similar attacks in July , a wave of six simultaneous bombings of churches killed five people and injured scores more .
Christian government officials have also been singled out .
Last year , Paulos Faraj Rahho , the Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul , was kidnapped after his bodyguards and driver were shot dead .
His own body was found in a shallow grave two weeks later .
The threats , though , came not just from violence motivated by religion .
Ordinary Christian families , who did well in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq as doctors , teachers and academics , were also uniquely vulnerable to Iraq 's post - war criminal gangs .
As middle - class professionals , they were attractive targets for kidnappers – and because they lack the tribal structures of Iraq 's Muslim communities , they were less able to organise street militias to deter such attacks in the first place .
When I was a teenager , there were moments when I behaved like a princess or a criminal .
( An athlete ?
Never . )
But most of the time , I fell somewhere between " brain " and " basket case . "
I 'd say that 's still true today .
Twenty - five years ago , The Breakfast Club was released in theaters .
It impacted a generation -- maybe more , because I did n't see it until a few years later -- and was one of the first films that treated teens like adults instead of simple - minded , super - pretty hormone machines .
Although John Hughes had earned young fans ' trust a year earlier with Sixteen Candles , this is the movie that began to turn him into a pop-culture icon .
In terms of films I quote on a regular basis , Breakfast Club is right up there with Lebowski and Star Wars .
( " Answer the question , Claire ! " " Do n't mess with the bull , young man .
You 'll get the horns ! "
" It was a banner f--- ing year at the Bender household ... " )
I 've seen it a hundred times , and yet if I stumble upon it on cable , I 'll stop and watch again -- all the way until Bender thrusts his fist into the air .
I do n't even want to say it , but today , I have this feeling teens do n't feel the same way about The Breakfast Club as I did .
Claire 's lipstick scene probably seems crazy - tame in 2010 .
I was reading some YouTube comments about the dancing sequence , and some viewers were honestly confused about " how Molly Ringwald could dance like that " ... because the dancing looks so antiquated and strange now .
Yikes .
But no matter how many years pass , I can't imagine going a week without quoting Brian or Principal Vernon or one of the gang .
I can't picture seeing Cap'n Crunch or Pixie Stix and not thinking of Ally Sheedy , or hearing that whistling song from Bridge on the River Kwai without imagining our misfit friends in detention .
One of the last things we hear in The Breakfast Club is Simple Minds singing Do n't You Forget About Me over the credits .
Twenty - five years later , I have n't forgotten the movie -- and I 'm pretty sure I never will .
What are your favorite moments from The Breakfast Club ?

Republicans should not automatically assume Massachusetts Sen.- elect Scott Brown ( R ) is going to be the upper chamber 's 41st vote on every piece of legislation .
In an interview with The Associated Press , published Friday , the Senate 's newest member stressed he would form his own positions on important issues , independent of his party 's stated thinking .
ADVERTISEMENT
He added he already informed top GOP leaders of this , including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) , who replied he " understood , " Brown said .
“ I already told them , you know , ‘ I got here with the help of a close group of friends and very little help from anyone down there , so there ’ll be issues when I ’ll be with you and there are issues when I wo n’t be with you , ” ’ Brown told the AP .
“ So , I just need to look at each vote and then make a proper analysis and then decide . ”
Indeed , few lawmakers would announce before assuming office they plan to support their party on every vote that reaches the chamber floor .
But Brown 's line on Friday is especially interesting , given that he campaigned on the premise he would be the GOP's " 41st vote " on such important issues as healthcare reform .
At one point , Brown reportedly included the number ' 41 ' in his autographs -- a habit that McConnell later praised .
" This is a man who understands how the Senate operates , " McConnell previously told the Christian Science Monitor .
A Texas Chevy dealer just accepted the trade - in of a red - on - black $ 1.6 million Bugatti Veyron for a $ 100,000 Corvette ZR1 .
We knew the fiercest of all ' Vettes was a world - beater , but this is ridiculous !
Exclusive photos , details below .
UPDATE !

All American Chevrolet of Midland , Texas just made the mother - of - all - trades when it accepted a Euro - bombing 2008 Bugatti Veyron with just 2,307 miles for an unabashedly American Corvette ZR1 and some cash .
Since a new Veyron lists for about $ 1.6 million and a used one still costs in the range of $ 1.4 to $ 3.6 million depending on condition , trim , and rarity , the dealership told us they would n't accept the trade - in until they lined up a buyer , which they did .
A new Corvette ZR1 , by comparison , starts at around $ 107,000 .
And while the Corvette ZR1 only does 0 - to - 60 MPH in 3.3 seconds with a top speed of 205 MPH , compared to a 253 MPH top speed and 2.4 - second 0 - to - 60 time , it does n't cost more to run the ZR1 than to operate a private jet .
Chalk that up in the win column because it certainly does with the Bugatti .
Also , the Bugatti does n't have the righteousness of an American - built supercar .

UPDATE : The Bugatti traded in belonged to Carlton Beal , Jr. , who runs a petroleum company in Midland Texas .
He 's previously owned a Lamborghini Diablo and McLaren F1 but , despite this , a friend of his describes him as an " amazing down - to - earth person . "
We 'd imagine if you 've sampled a Veyron , Diablo and F1 you'd be interested in also trying an American - made car that can compete with them .

( Do old people even read the title text ? )
When we posted a gallery of comics cover art drawn from Tony Isabella ’s 1000 Comic Books You Must Read , some Wired.com readers got pretty riled up about excluded titles .
It was just supposed to be a sampling , people :
We obviously could n’t include all 1,000 of the titles in Isabella ’s cool book .
Nevertheless , readers ’ comics picks proved pretty fascinating .
Ranking the fan blowback by writer , Sandman creator Neil Gaiman topped the readers ’ choice list .
Alan Moore was widely lauded for Watchmen as well as Swamp Thing and From Hell .
Frank Miller and Grant Morrison rounded out the top four for a variety of their bold franchise reinventions .
A few commenters went epic - length .
FlipM cited 24 titles “ off the top of my head ” that deserved must - read status .
Others went deep with major love for a specific issue , like reader pjbeisser , who promised that Walking Dead No. 48 “ will make you both sick to your stomach — and potentially cry like a little girl . ”
For a close - up of fan favorites including Wanted , pictured above , check out comments and graphics in the comic book cover art gallery that follows .

Animal Man No. 5
The series took a minor DC character with the cheesy power of gaining the abilities of any nearby animal , and turned it into a clever , esoteric spin on superhero comics .
Issue 5 features a Wile E. Coyote - type character breaking the fourth wall to escape an endless cycle of violence .
Animal Man No. 26 is also excellent , as he learns about his fictional nature and confronts his author .
–hokum
I would go for the 24 issues of Animal Man written by Grant Morrison .
The mix of meta - linguistic , reality - warping , suburban superhero fantasy made more for me than four years studying psychology .
– Lisandro
The Bone
I would be very disappointed if Bone by Jeff Smith is n’t somehow mentioned in the book .
The series lasted 55 issues over the course of 10 years or so .
Delightfully funny fantasy adventure .
–avenger534
Y : The Last Man
I loved Y : The Last Man .
A world without men is very thought - provoking , and I think Brian K. Vaughan did a good job imagining what it might be like .
– Zometh
The Red Star
The Red Star , created by Christian Gossett , has to be on my top five list of all time … .
In addition to being a phenomenal comic , [ it ] is also trying to drop the European comics model into the American scene and , unfortunately , suffering for it .
Where the American market expects monthly deliveries of generally OK products , the European model supports more lengthy creations that often deserve the title of graphic novel .
This is also a more humane model for the artists , who get to realize a complete vision from start to end , as well as for the readers , who are able to buy a complete story when it ’s published in a single unit , instead of parsed out in pamphlets .
–pyar
Walking Dead No. 48
I have personally enjoyed Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard ’s Walking Dead .
Also Kirkman and Ryan Ottley ’s Invincible is one of my favorites right now .
– joshriddell
Looking for a particular issue that will make you both sick to your stomach — and potentially cry like a little girl ?
First thing that comes to mind is probably , “ No . ” After reading comics for 20 years , I thought I had … read it all , seen it all , done it all .
Then came Walking Dead # 48 ( 2008 ) ….
For those unfamiliar , it ’s a black - and - white monthly book about a group of survivors who are struggling to make it day to day after a majority of the populace become zombies … .
Intense !
I finally got to meet Robert Kirkman earlier this year at the Baltimore Comic Con .
Everyone in front of me had a stack of books for him to sign .
This is the only one I had in hand .
–pjbeisser
The Eternals and Jack Kirby
Get some Jack Kirby artwork under your eyes .
In particular , notice his particular use of shadow , which might be termed “ Kirbyoscuro , ” and often looks not unlike biomorphic circuitry .
I got to read a lot of his ’70s series .
An outstanding series was his one for Marvel : The Eternals , about what happens when giant , ancient gods return to Earth .
– Osirisrise
The Preacher
Preacher combines Clint Eastwoood ’s Unforgiven with David Lynch ’s Twin Peaks .
Great stuff .
–featuring_dave
Invincible
I feel comics are having a renaissance .
Here are some titles I recommend to the old - school comic geek and the new readers alike :
Invincible , Image Comics , Robert Kirkman
Y : The Last Man , Vertigo ( DC ) , Brian K. Vaughn
Powers , Image Comics , Brian Michael Bendis
The Walking Dead , Image Comics , Robert Kirkman
Hawaiian Dick , Image Comics , B. Clay Moore
Fables , Vertigo ( DC ) , Bill Willingham –csmallfield
Hellboy
After my comic - book - collecting high - school years , Hellboy was the only thing that kept me reading comics !

Sandman .
Nuff said .
–noodlelpugerine
Neil Gaiman ’s Sandman … especially Brief Lives .
– kaylan
Definitely need to read the entirety of Neil Gaiman ’s Sandman series .
–fencerf
The Morningstar Option , Parts 1 - 3 .
It ’s a spinoff of Sandman without Gaiman writing but it ’s fantastically written for the character .
– Lucifer 00
Fables
Vertigo ’s Fables , ca n’t believe that nobody has mentioned them yet .
Twelve Eisners and counting .
Also Hellboy , Sandman and Transmetropolitan are all required reading before you visit the casket .
–kloudykat
Miracleman
I ’d add a vote for Miracleman — though not sure which issues I ’d include .
Still amazed at how he took a character that was about as dorky as it gets ( basically Captain Marvel / Shazam ) and rework it into something really dark and chilling and intense .

– jhnshft
Superman No. 75
Death of Superman –jhnshft
Transmetropolitan
I feel like everyone should read Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis .
A lot of the subject matter is amazingly funny , but there ’s one cryogenics story that is pretty hard - hittingly sad .
– Sliver
Transmetropolitan was fun , and I have n’t read Maus yet but want to someday .
I quick - read Marvels at the comic shop earlier this year and it was excellent as well .
– baccaruda
From Hell by Alan Moore and Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis were both excellent reads .
–kwikdraw
Batman : The Dark Knight Returns
Sorry , but this list is too constrained for my tastes … .
The most influential comic in the history of the genre , The Dark Knight Returns , was n’t even mentioned , except in a post by another reader !
There ’s a complete world of very cool stuff out there that just went — zip ! — right over this guy ’s head .
So here ’s my list :
Any issue of Heavy Metal with stories / art by Enki Bilal or Jean Giraud / Moebius ; Shirow ’s Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell ; Adam Warren ’s Dirty Pair ( if you have time for only one , go with Sim Hell ) ; Frank Miller ’s Return of the Dark Knight .
I close with my fave line from Warren : “ Girls with guns ! Crucial realm ! ” –rpbird
Green Lantern
Gonna have to go with the Adams / O’Neil run on Green Lantern / Green Arrow .
Beautiful art and some hard - hitting tales make these classic books .
Also worthy of seeking out is the Grant Morrison / Steve Yeowell series Zenith , taken from U.K. publication 2000 AD .
Light - years ahead of its time .
–jeemie
One of the best has to be Green Lantern / Green Arrow Nos. 85 and 86 with Speedy ’s drug addiction .
– Magician216
One of my all time favorites is Green Lantern : Emerald Dawn .
It ’s one of the first comics I read and still one of the best .
Also , Kurt Busiek ’s Marvels is amazing .
– gpmeyer2
Valiant Comics
I loved the Valiant Comics with first 12 issues of Magnus , Robot Fighter , Rai , X - O , Dr. Solar , Turok , Archer & Armstrong , Harbinger and Eternal Warrior .
Anything before Unity 2 .
–halkyra
Watchmen
What about the Watchmen ?
Rorschach ’s character alone represents the living embodiment of paranoia .
–mrnonel
Watchmen by Alan Moore , no doubt .
– LupinYonsei
It may be a graphic novel but it has changed the world of literature and everyone needs to read it .
– JordanEast
1 ) Alan Moore ’s Watchmen — one of Time magazine ’s top 100 novels of the 20th century
2 ) The Long Halloween
3 ) A Dame to Kill For — the best in Frank Miller ’s Sin City series
4 ) Batman : Year One
5 ) For all you zombie fans : The Walking Dead series .
–iamhouli
I ’ve gotta say that Alan Moore ’s Watchmen is a must - read .
Definitely one of the greatest graphic novels of all time .

WUWT readers may recall this story from November 3rd NOAA deletes an “ inconvenient ” kids science web page where NOAA took down a web page called “ It ’s a gas , man ” that talked about a tabletop science demonstration that kids could do themselves to “ prove ” that CO2 retains more heat .
Problem was , the experiment as presented then was flawed , and when it received some attention from skeptical websites , NOAA recognized the flaw and took it down , replacing it later with an updated page .
Fast forward past Climategate to this past Thursday Dec 17th , and we find that the BBC decides to try essentially the same experiment on live TV for an impressed and non questioning audience .
Only one problem , the BBC presenters botched the experiment .
Fortunately we can show why , because WUWT reader Professor Kevin Kilty of the University of Wyoming , who took an interest in recreating this experiment with students in his physics class well before the BBC did their experiment , has conclusively demonstrated its scientific shortcomings in an experiment log he sent me on December 20th showing results of a November 23rd experiment run .
What got me connecting what Professor Kilty had done to the BBC live TV experiment was a comment from WUWT reader Bryan C of the UK .
Here ’s an excerpt :
Dear Anthony
Here ’s something I found shocking and that you do n’t see every day : the British government ’s former chief scientific adviser Professor Sir David King flagrantly lying on national television to boost the dubious idea that some foreign agency ( the Russian secret service ? ) was behind Climategate .

This was in the context of BBC 2 ’s Newsnight staging a peculiar experiment , with a politically - correct black female “ space scientist ” heating two bottles – one containing “ air ” ( last time I looked , that included carbon dioxide anyway ) and one containing “ atmospheric air with a greater concentration of carbon dioxide ” ( they did n’t say how much they were adding , of course , but I ’d bet it was substantially more than 0.000388 % ! ) .
Surprise , surprise — the latter bottle grew hotter …
Of course it did .
A greater amount of carbon dioxide will be warmer when heat is applied .
This is not a surprise !
The proportions are key , of course , as you know .
Newsnight itself characterised the effort right at the start as a “ very unscientific experiment ” — so why do it at all ?!
In fact the “ science ” as presented was misleading and selective to the point of deception .
Indeed when you watch the BBC video , it is clear that there ’s no sort of control of any kind , the thermocouples were placed haphazardly at different angles into the bottles , and there ’s likely alignment differences between the lights illuminating the bottles .
It seems so from my viewing of the video .
Professor Kilty also viewed the BBC video and writes :
You can see that the two bottles start at temperatures of 32 +
C. Perhaps the house is this warm , we do n’t keep ours this warm , but more likely they have run the experiment and know pretty well in advance how it will turn out .
I tried to see from the size of the spot on the bottle if one or other is obviously closer to the lamp –I can ’t– but what really matters is the thermocouple , of course .
The NOAA description in “ its a gas , man ” looks like the epitome of careful research in comparison .
This is just kid science .
The BBC did their best .
Not as good as the ten - year old of a couple of weeks ago , though .
It is funny that the journalist sells this as “ proof ” of global warming early in the sequence .
Here is what a properly conducted experiment looks like , as performed under professor Kilty ’s supervision by students at his lab at the University of Wyoming .
A SILLY EXPERIMENT ABOUT CO2
KEVIN KILTY
Date : December 20 , 2009 .
Are there endless silly or meaningless experiments and demonstrations that one can do with carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) ?
We ’ve seen a few on WUWT recently .
1
On Tuesday November 3 , 2009 , WUWT exposed one endorsed by a major scientific organization under the headline NOAA deletes an inconvenient kids science web page .
Indeed , all reference to this page appears now gone at NOAA .
But , thanks to the efforts of WUWT , and the help of the way - back machine , 2 selected physics students in three of my courses at LCCC got to try the experiment as someone at NOAA designed it .
As it turns out , this experiment is silly for what it attempted to show , but it provides darned good lessons about scientific experiments .
The first group of physics students to get a crack at greenhouse warming in a two liter bottle were from my Physics 1050 course – physics without math .
They set the experiment up as closely to the NOAA specifications as possible and made Runs 1 and 2 as I describe below .
The algebra based physics course got a stab at it next , then the calculus - based physics class had their try .
These classes modified the experiment to get a better picture of what was going on .
They performed Runs 3 and 4 , respectively .
1. Procedure
The NOAA web - page suggested doing the experiment according to the following recipe .
(1) Partially fill both bottles with water .
In fact , we filled each with the same amount of water – about two inches worth .
(2) Add the seltzer tablets to one of the bottles .
We delayed this step until we had the apparatus assembled .
(3) Suspend the thermometers inside the bottles in such a way that you can measure the temperature of the air and seal the tops with molding clay .
We thought there was little reason for sealing the top completely , so we used a cork stopper with hole large enough to allow gas generated in the bottle to pass out around the thermometer .
(4) Place the lamp at equal distance between each bottle .
This is the tricky step in this seemingly simple experiment .
(5) After an hour , measure the temperature of the water in each bottle .
We thought the word “ water ” was a mistake here because there was no instruction to make the amount of water in each bottle equal , nor any reason the water would be of interest when the thermometers were suspended in air .
Accordingly we monitored the temperature of the air to equilibrium at least , which was less than an hour .
Despite the simplicity of the procedures , we encountered plenty of experiment design issues .
These included :
1 ) the typical lab thermometers have fiducial marks at one - degree interval and so temperature can be read to a resolution of about 0.5 ◦C at best ,
3
2 ) the marks are actually not of uniform size ,
3 ) it is really difficult to get a label completely off a two - liter soda bottle , and so there is a readily available shield or
reflector to confound one ’s results .
Finally , there is that deceptively simple step 4 ; Place the lamp at equal distance between each bottle .
Although a person can purchase clear light bulbs that allow one to see precisely where the filament is , and what geometry it has , there is almost no way to decide what is the exact center of radiation .
After all 95 % of the radiation leaving the lamp is infrared and invisible .
From outside the lamp does radiation appear to come from the filament ?
Or does the bulb envelope appear as the source ?
Moreover , even if a person can decide where is the center of radiation , there are a host of other ways to get the set - up wrong .
Figures 2 and 3 show some .
Students rarely noticed if the thermometer was centered and vertical or if it stayed that way during the course of the experiment – and as one might expect to happen sometimes , thermometers in the CO2 - filled bottle tipped toward the lamp , as Figure 3 shows , while those in the control bottle tipped away like Figure 2 .
2. Results
The table below summarizes our research of November 23 , 2009 .
The first experimental run , using ordinary lab thermometers , appeared to detect an increased temperature rise in the CO2 - filled bottle .
However , students failed to appreciate at this point that repeating this experiment , no matter how exactly , could arrive at a different outcome .
Indeed , Run 2 , using six thermocouples read to a temperature resolution of only 1 ◦ C indicated no average difference in temperature rise , but showed greatest temperature change in some bottles without CO2 .
Run 3 , using thermocouples read to better resolution of 0.1◦C , showed the greater average temperature rise to occur in the non-CO2 bottles .
In this case students swapped thermocouples among bottles to make certain no variation was the result of mis-manufacturing of these sensors .
We concluded from these results that sufficient replications of properly randomized runs would likely show no detectable difference at temperature resolution typical of equipment in K - 14 science labs .
Run 4 made use of Moll - type thermopiles .
These devices capture a very broad spectrum of radiation , from far IR through visible , and conveys it to a highly absorptive collector at the base of a conical reflector .
A series connection of 17 type -K thermocouples indicates the temperature rise of the absorber .
These thermopiles have a sensitivity of 0.28 mV / μW ; a voltage that good quality bench multimeters can read easily .
Figure 4 shows one of these devices .
In these runs we organized a moll - type thermopile to look at the lamp through our plastic bottles .
When the potential of the thermopile became stable we then dropped two selzer tablets in the bottle and monitored the decline in potential until it became stable again .
In this manner we managed to avoid all confounding influences except variations in one plastic bottle to another , and possibly extremely small variations in aim of the thermopile .
The average decline was 0.095 mV .
This translates into a typical decline of 0.34 μW of radiation power entering the conical collector .
3. Discussion
The presence of CO2 in a plastic bottle reduced radiation collected by a thermopile looking through that bottle .
But what radiation is reduced , and what causes the reduction ?
We are pretty sure that visible light is n’t reduced as there is no visible difference between bottles with CO2 and those without .
Thus , the difference is likely in the infrared ( IR ) part of the spectrum .
CO2 , as we have heard interminably for the past 25 years , absorbs certain bands of IR radiation , most notably in the IR near 2 , 3 and 4 micrometers wavelength , and in longwave bands between 13 to 17 micrometers wavelength .
At thermal equilibrium CO2 will radiate in these same wavelength bands as much power as it absorbs .
The radiated radiation does not travel in the same direction as the absorbed radiation was traveling , however .
It is radiated uniformly in all directions .
In the case of our experiment this leads to a small decrease in power reaching the Moll - type thermopile .
Applying this to the case of a simple Earth atmosphere , containing nothing but CO2 and having no weather , leads one to conclude that longwave radiation leaving the top of Earth ’s atmosphere will decline in magnitude slightly .
This decrease in longwave power traveling away from the surface forces the Earth ’s surface temperature to rise slightly in order to maintain its thermal equilibrium .
This is the “ greenhouse effect ” in its pure form .
4. Conclusions
When this experiment is set - up according to the prescription on the NOAA webpage it is quite possible to get a difference of temperature of 1 ◦C between or among thermometers even if none of them contain any CO2 .
A properly randomized experiment will likely result in no discernible difference among thermometer readings irrespective of CO2 in bottle or not .
The issue is one of not enough magnitude of effect to resolve on typical lab thermometers .
An instrument as sensitive as a Moll - type thermopile can detect a small difference in radiation passing through bottles filled with CO2 as compared to an identical bottle not filled .
The amount of IR power re- directed by a two - liter , CO2 - filled bottle appears to be about 100μW / m2 .
The most important result of this experiment is how it shows students so many issues of experiment design .
First , there is the issue of how difficult temperature measurements are to make accurately .
Students are quite surprised at this .
They are equally surprised that seemingly identical temperature sensors will not measure identically .
Second , there is also the difficulty of proving conclusively that A causes B when the experiment includes confounding factors .
This is an important lesson about the value of skepticism in climate change research , observations , and publicity .
If X , Y , and Z cause B just as readily as does A , then what allows one to claim A causes B ?

Back to the BBC video , Bryan C points out some problems with statements by Professor King , who joined the group after the CO2 bottle experiment was performed .
Here is his comment , continued .
… Professor King adroitly avoided key questions .
Anyone there with any knowledge of the science could have taken him apart .
The BBC clearly was n’t interested in finding anyone equipped with the facts who could have countered the orthodoxy .
In contrast , we had an ignoramus who expressed scepticism at the beginning saying he was now completely convinced .
Others taking part who maintained their scepticism unfortunately did n’t have the facts at their fingertips to back up their positions .
Professor King ’s assertions about Climategate ( from 6:20 ) were particularly shocking .
He conceded that the behaviour shown was unacceptable , but no conclusions were then drawn by him — the program simply moved on !
But I was most stunned by his obfuscatory introduction of the conspiracy theory about “ agencies ” which went unchallenged , and involved a direct fabrication about mobile phone conversations .
“ Remember that these emails go back to 1998 and they ’ve been accumulating them and just released them in the week before Copenhagen …
“ Let me also make this allegation for the first time in public .
It ’s an extraordinarily sophisticated piece of work to hack into all of these emails and mobile phone conversations , right ?
What agencies have got the sophistication to manage that ?
I leave you to think about that . ”
Of course , the most likely scenario is not of an outside hacker but a whistleblower inside the CRU who pulled them together and released them .
The suggestion of “ an extraordinarily sophisticated piece of work ” does n’t really hold up if you ’re just referring to emails , but introducing the idea of monitoring mobile phone conversations ( a complete lie as far as I ’m aware ) serves to boost the conspiracy theory and muddy the waters .
And this man was Britain ’s most senior scientist ?
I hope you can draw people ’s attention to this deception !
Regards Bryan C
Clearly there has never been any mention of “ mobile phone conversations ” in any known discussion about the Climategate incident .
This appears to be a complete fabrication by Professor King .
It is troubling that the BBC has not corrected this .
All in all , this was not a well thought out or well researched video presentation by the BBC , and in my opinion it does a disservice to the citizens that pay taxes through television licenses to support the BBC .
UK readers are encouraged to make the issues and independent experimental results known to the BBC and to media monitors there .

Editor 's note : Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts " Fareed Zakaria GPS " on CNN U.S. on Sundays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET and CNN International at 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. CET / 5 p.m. Abu Dhabi / 9 p.m. HK
New York ( CNN ) --
The solutions to America 's long - term budget deficits are surprisingly simple , but they 're politically unthinkable in today 's Washington , says analyst Fareed Zakaria .
America 's failure to deal with its growing budget deficit is hurting its image internationally , according to Zakaria .
President Obama proposed a $ 3.8 trillion budget Monday , projecting a deficit of more than $ 1.5 trillion this year and nearly $ 1.3 trillion for the 2011 budget year .
Zakaria , author and host of CNN's " Fareed Zakaria : GPS , " spoke to CNN Wednesday .
CNN : So the president released his budget this week , projecting deficits almost as far as the eye can see .
What do you make of it ?
Fareed Zakaria :
The real problem is not the current deficits that the president has projected .
These deficits are to a large extent inescapable because of the financial emergency we find ourselves in , the rescue of the financial system , the stimulus package to jump - start the American economy .
But it 's worth understanding why this gets us to 10 percent of GDP , the worst deficit since World War II .
And it is because , as the president points out , the budget was broken in the first place .
It was broken by three decisions made during the Bush administration .
The first was to have massive tax cuts , which was a decision made in the wake of the Clinton surpluses .
The second decision was to have a massive new entitlement program -- prescription drugs for the elderly -- which took the fastest growing part of the American population and joined it to the fastest - rising costs in American health care , which is prescription drugs .
It was therefore a marriage made in budgetary hell .
And the third , of course , was to have two wars that were going to be funded without any tax increases , the first time in modern American history that that decision was made .
... A partial exception was Vietnam , which produced an economic catastrophe in the 1970s .
And then you add to it the fact that we were in a financial and economic crisis and needed to spend money to get out of it , and you have the current budget problem .
CNN : Right now the United States has a triple - A credit rating and the dollar is the reserve currency for the world .
Do you think America 's financial stability is threatened in the short term ?
Zakaria :
Not in the short term .
These are understandable choices America has to make .
The entire industrialized world is facing very similar budget deficits .
We have probably five years to try to bring our budget into some kind of manageable situation .
And if we can't do it within five years , it suggests two things .
One is that the trends at that point become so deep that fixing them at that point becomes very difficult .
And the second thing is that it becomes a signal to the world that we really cannot get control of our budget .
And at that point , I do think that America 's reputation , its credibility , its ability to borrow vast amounts of money all will come into jeopardy .
CNN : Do you think that President Obama should have taken more dramatic steps to curtail spending ?
Zakaria :
If he were to cut spending at this point , the economy would quite likely go into a second recession , a double - dip , and then frankly everything collapses .
If you do n't have growth , you have no prospect of getting out of this budgetary situation .
...
But he must in a year begin really to address the serious issues that make up the budget crisis that we have .
The most significant one is health care costs .
...
Obama 's health care plan , while it has some cost control measures , is mostly about expansion and adding to the costs .
...
There has to be a much , much more serious focus on costs .
The second is a number of sacred cows in the federal budget which are very large but which frankly make no sense .
We have a $ 250 billion a year hole in the federal budget because employers are given a tax deduction for health care plans .
This is actually bad for health care , because it is one of the factors that contributes to these out of control costs , because it 's an invitation to have inflation in the system .
CNN : Are there other large " sacred " budget items ?
Zakaria : Another is the deduction of mortgage interest , which is taken in America as some kind of great measure that has enabled Americans to own homes , whereas we have the same rate of home ownership as Britain and Canada , neither of which have interest deductions for their home mortgages .
What it is really is a subsidy for homeowners to take on debt .
...
We take on more debt than people in other countries and we can see that has been part of the distortion of the market that has produced the financial crisis that we 've just gone through .
That deduction is a hundred billion dollars .
When you hear people talking about freezing this or that federal program , there you 're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars , occasionally a billion dollars .
But the real big money is in all these middle class entitlements that are regarded as sacred cows .
And the third part is taxes .
You 're not going to bring the budget into balance unless you talk about tax increases .
The only real question is what kind of tax increases .
If we were to have a modest value added tax , the kind we have in Europe , it would probably raise $ 150 - $ 250 billion a year .
It would discourage excessive consumption , it would encourage savings .
...
CNN : So if the solutions are so simple , why are n't they happening ?
Zakaria :
If you take those three things -- health care , middle class entitlements and taxes -- we have effectively solved America 's budget crisis .
So the good news here is that we have a $ 14 trillion economy .
There 's more than enough money to have a very substantial federal budget , moderate taxes ( we are still at the low end of the industrialized world in terms of taxes as a percentage of GDP ) .
So it really is worth thinking about how strange it is , that a fairly sensible set of discreet measures could put us back into a situation where we would be the envy of the world in terms of our fiscal condition .
The steps I outlined are economically simple and sensible and yet they 're political dynamite .
If we were to raise the retirement age on Social Security , modestly and on a sliding scale so that it was phased in .
If we were to trim the benefits very slightly ... the program would be solvent for the next 75 years .
And yet think about it .
That simple commonsensical fix is politically absolutely impossible in Washington today .
CNN : Why do you think that is ?
Zakaria : Because we have a political structure in Washington today , that if one side proposes any solution to these problems , the other side does not ask itself :
How can we have a compromise that solves this problem ?
Instead they think :
How can we demagogue this issue to fundraise , to win votes , to scare people , to polarize the political climate and gain advantage from it ?
It 's almost that the entire strategy now is how can we take any proposal that anyone makes and turn it into a fundraising opportunity for our extreme wing .
And if you do that , you 're never going to actually solve the problems of the country because every proposal can be demagogued .
CNN : You just came back from Davos .
What 's the view of world leaders of this American budget problem ?
Zakaria :
There is great unease not just about the numbers ... the real unease is about the sense that Washington is no longer working , that you cannot count on the United States to be able to make hard decisions , to sort its own internal affairs out .
One European CEO said to me , what worries us more than anything else is that problems you 're facing now are the same problems you were facing 10 or 15 years ago .
They do n't seem to go away .
In other words , we keep kicking the can down the road .
He said : " I enjoy a cigarette myself so I know how smokers feel .
Someone suggested cutting holes in the wall .
It 's a bit of a joke but it actually works quite well .
It can get very cold sometimes so it 's not really an option to stand outside for a smoke .

The Capstronaut was n't the only celebrity in the house when the Caps Hosted the Flyers Sunday afternoon .
Hall - of - famer Bob Clarke was also in attendance , and Sovetsky Sport correspondents Natalia Bragilevskaya and Pavel Lysenkov were able to sit down with him and get his take on Ovechkin and fighting in the NHL .
Here is the first part of the interview with his assessment of Alex Ovechkin , and you can check out our SBN partner Broad Street Hockey later for the rest of the interview .
Bobby Clarke is already 60 years old .
Time waits for no man .
He 's no longer the gap - toothed forward wearing an impish grin while breaking Kharlamov 's ankle .
He was the ringleader of the gang from Philadelphia nicknamed the " Broad Street Bullies " during the 1970's .
Dave " The Hammer " Schultz , Bob " Hound " Kelly , Reggie " Rifle " Leach - what names they had back then !
Now he 's indistinguishable from any other retiree .
Good - natured and smiling , he probably gets up in the morning and mows his lawn and goes for a walk in the park .
He 's got all of his teeth now - American dentists can work miracles .
Several years ago Robert Earl Clarke ( or just Bobby ) was the General Manager of the Flyers , and he still holds an executive position with the club .
We were n't diverting him away from any important club business , so he readily agreed to an interview with Sovetsky Sport .
Recently , Russian Hockey Federation President Vladislav Tretiak was in Montreal and he said that Alexander Ovechkin must be half - Canadian , since he plays such aggressive hockey .
Do you agree ?
" Every Canadian dreams of playing like Ovechkin " smiled Clarke .
" He 's a real bull out there on the ice . "
Would he have fit in with Philadelphia in the 70's ?
" Easily !
Ovechkin could have been the best player on any team at that time . "
Even better than you ?
" Much better !
There 's no way I could compare myself with him .
Look how he skates , how he fights for the puck .
Look at how much strength and drive he has .
I 'll say it again - he 's a big bull .
He just runs over people on the ice .
It 's really difficult to play against Ovechkin . "

Former president Bill Clinton had two stents placed in a clogged heart artery Thursday after he complained of chest pains , according to a spokesman .
The 63 - year - old Clinton " is in good spirits , and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and Haiti 's relief and long - term recovery efforts , " said Douglas Band , counselor to the former president .
The nation 's 42nd president underwent a quadruple heart bypass operation in 2004 .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is traveling to New York to be with her husband , who is at the Columbia Campus of NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital , aides told the Associated Press .
They did not know whether the ex-president 's illness would delay Hillary Clinton 's scheduled trip this weekend to Qatar and Saudi Arabia ; she left for New York shortly after a White House meeting with President Obama .
Former president George W. Bush , who is working with his predecessor on a Haiti relief fundraising drive , spoke with Chelsea Clinton today " and was glad to hear that her father is doing well and that his spirits are high , Bush spokesman David Sherzer said .
" President Bush looks forward to continuing to work with his friend on Haiti relief and rebuilding . "
Cardiologists say that Clinton 's latest brush with chest pain should come as no surprise , especially because at least one of the blood vessels used in the former president 's 2004 bypass operation must have been a leg vein .
" It 's very common five to seven years after bypass surgery for a vein graft to ( clog ) , " just as native arteries do , says Steven Nissen , chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic .
That 's because coronary artery disease is progressive and likely to recur under the best conditions .
Also , the leg veins commonly used in bypass surgery are structurally different than arteries , so they tend to fail more quickly , Nissen says .
Doctors often fix the problem by inserting stents , spring - like devices that prop the artery open .
Once a stent is put in place , the chest pain goes away .
Typically , patients are released from the hospital within 24 to 48 hours and are able to resume their normal activities within a few days .
Fortunately , Nissen says , Clinton appears to have visited the hospital in time to avert a heart attack , " which means there probably is n't any heart damage . "
But the fix , Nissen says , is likely to be temporary .
" Once you have coronary artery disease , it tends to recur , " he says .
Clinton -- once renowned for his consumption of junk food -- first underwent quadruple bypass surgery in September of 2004 .
Six months later , he developed complications that required a second surgery .
He did not suffer a heart attack during either of those episodes .
Former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers joked that it was nice of Clinton to " inject a change of topic " into the news after all the coverage of the East Coast snowstorms .
" No one I 've talked to around him is very alarmed , " Myers said .
Myers added , " The guy works so hard , and a lot of people around him and Hillary are going to have to look at his schedule and dial it back around the edges . "
Lanny Davis , a White House lawyer during the Clinton years , predicted his resilient ex-boss would recover soon .
" He 's going to bounce back pretty quickly because he 's Bill Clinton , " Davis said .
Former president George H.W. Bush , who worked with his successor on relief efforts after the 2004 Asian tsunami , said in a statement he has been in touch with Clinton 's office .
" Of course , Barbara and I wish him a speedy and full recovery , " Bush said .
Here is the full statement from Douglas Band , counselor to former president Bill Clinton :
Today President Bill Clinton was admitted to the Columbia Campus of NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital after feeling discomfort in his chest .
Following a visit to his cardiologist , he underwent a procedure to place two stents in one of his coronary arteries .
President Clinton is in good spirits , and will continue to focus on the work of his Foundation and Haiti 's relief and long - term recovery efforts .
In 2004 , President Clinton underwent a successful quadruple bypass operation to free four blocked arteries .

I have moved my [ no ] money to a decent community bank to get away from these evil capitalist banks more times in my life than I care to contemplate .

This is a fine idea , as long as it is kept in perspective .
This is not the way the world or the system changes .
" Be the change you desire " is neither effective or a quote from Gandhi ( http://www.gandhitopia.org/forum/topics/a-gandhi-quote).
Change is made through mass uprisings , mass organizing and political pressure .
Power has to be marshaled .
We must never be sidestepped into a being - impotent - but - feeling - good - about - it state .

Mass uprisings do n't happen until the masses are enlightened .
Teabaggers are uprising , but they 're not enlightened theirs is just an anger uprising manufactered and exploited by the right wing .
" Be the change " whether Gandhi originated it or not ; is how TRUE , Revolutionary changes occur .
It 's not a marshalled force as much as it's demonstrated almost person to person and then it inundates society like a tsunami .
Being the change we want to see ... entails we becoming just as a people first ... we adopt peace as our only goal ... we practice and demand economic justice for all ...
Civil disobedience requires some " Be the change " mojo .... civil disobedience entails some personal investment of our own security ... and us being able to uphold each other until our voices are heard and heeded .
Civil disbedience like ... refusing to pay income taxes until we 're out of Iraq and Afghanistan , Wall Street and the banks be held accountible ....
That 's where the bulk of our tax dollars are going ... to the Military Industrial Complex and Wall Street Bankers .
Let 's see how long they can operate when people en masse refuse to pay income taxes .
To be that change people have to be enightened ... not marshalled or herded ... we have a marshalled and herded public now .
They 've been marshalled and herded with lies .... being the change means having the guts to speak and ACT truth to power .
Gandhi led a mass of Indians to the sea to make salt in order to circumvent the British salt tax ... in that simple action he threw off the British empire from India ...
Gandhi did n't marshall anything ... he simply walked out his enlightenment ... a nation followed and Britain lost control .
Does this nation have the guts ?
The guts to lead ... or follow someone doing a simple act of civil disobedience simply because it 's the right thing to do .
For the record Gandhi was n't trying to " defeat " Britain ... he was disobeying a stupid law that taxed something that was abundantly available for free ...
In that disobedience India was freed from British colonization .
Do we have the guts ...?

Jack , this is the first time I read anything that questioned the attribution of the Ghandi quote .
You may be right on that , but you are not right when you say " this is not the way the world or the system changes . "
As Howard Zinn observed in A Power Governments Cannot Suppress :
There is a basic weakness in governments , however massive their armies , however vast their wealth , however they control images and information , because their power depends on the obedience of citizens , of soldiers , of civil servants , of journalists and writers and teachers and artists .
When the citizens begin to suspect they have been deceived and withdraw their support , government loses its legitimacy and its power . "
Recall the effect of a minority of homes going into foreclosure on the big banks .
Johnson 's appeal is to the 97 % of Americans who do not benefit from the Wall Street schemes .
If that 97 % were to transfer their money from the big four to local Community Banks , the result would bring the big six to their knees .
True power is in the hands of the people .
What is lacking is knowledge on their part of the scope of that power .

A Tax revolt ...
If we as a nation stopped paying our income taxes , we could affect massive changes .
Those that are employed change your withholding to 0 , those that are self employed stop paying period .
We as a people would have to able to support those who the system comes down on ... their families and legal expenses etc .
But the system can't process or prosecute 50 million people for income tax evasion .
Up to 75 % of our income tax dollars go directly to military industrialists and to the federal reserve who are raping the nation .
We could bring those systems into compliance with the people 's wishes by NOT SUPPORTING THEM with our money anymore ...
They 're leeches enriching themselves on our labor .
This kind of action wo n't be easy or pretty ... We as a people would have to take responsibility for our fellow citizens , we would have to find commonground and keep our minds fixated on the justice we 're meeting out to the system that has used and abused us for decades .
We need some steel in our resolve ...
As I said earlier ... do we have the friggin ' guts ?!?

I propose we create a little social movement : create a flyer w/ a catchy title like : why you should break up with your bankster and give people actions steps w / local credit unions to take their money to .
It 's a start !
We gotta start SOMEWHERE !

" Just slip out the back Jack , make new plan Stan , no need to be coy Roy .... just listen to me ... Hop on the bus Gus you do n't need to discuss much , just drop off the key Lee and get yourself free " I agree Sophia ... it 's a start ... I like the idea ...

Solar Cycle 24 is now over a year old , so it is appropriate to see how it is ramping up .
Solar Cycle 24 was a late starter , about three and a half years later than the average of the strong cycles in the late 20th century and almost three year later than the weak cycles of the late 19th century .
It was almost as late as Solar Cycle 5 , the first half of the Dalton Minimum .
The last few months have seen it ramp up relatively rapidly .
[ Note : Solar Cycle 22 and 23 are overlaid on solar cycle 3 and 4 above to show similarity ]
Plotting up the last three solar cycles relative to the Dalton Minimum , another solar minimum is not precluded by the data to date .
With Solar Cycle 23 ending up at twelve and a half years long , applying Friis - Christenson and Lassen theory to the temperature record of Hanover , New Hampshire results in a two degree centigrade decline in the annual average temperature at this location over the expected twelve years of Solar Cycle 24 , from December 2009 to late 2021 .
Given some record low monthly averages in the northeast US in the recent summer , and the current cold winter , this cooling is well under way .

So you ’ve given in to the peer pressure and signed up with Facebook .
You ’ve hunted down your old high school pals .
You suddenly have a strong option on the Pirates v. Ninjas debate .
You play Scrabulous Lexulous .
It ’s great .
Everyone is on the Fizzy Bizzy .
But then , you realize …
EVERYONE is on the Fizzy Bizzy .
Including your boss .
Including your business partners .
Including your mom .
And they all now can see the Wall posts in which you refer to Gov. Blagojevich as “ that douchebag with the piece ” .
You have three options :
1 ) Delete your Facebook account and never use the Internets again .
This is less than ideal , as you will find yourself completely cut out of modern society and will have no idea what your friends consider the 25 most interesting bits of trivia about themselves .
2 ) Strip all interesting content from your Facebook .
This actually does n’t solve the problem , as if your sister - in - law tags you in a photo doing a keg stand in Wrigleyville , your manager will still be able to see it .
3 ) Implement Custom Security Privacy Awesomeness .
Hereafter referred to as CSPA , Custom Security Privacy Awesomeness is your solution for being able to be a wild and crazy Facebooker with the people who can handle it , but buttoning - down and synergizing strategic Powerpoints with those who need to see you as someone respectable who does n’t even know how to pronouce Jagermeister .
The obvious choice is Option 3 … CSPA .
And luckily for you , I am willing to share these secrets with you , for a lower cost than a ShamWow .
That ’s right – you can learn to lock down your Facebook for fun and profit ( okay , just fun ) for free .
And I will be your guide .
Instructions , after the jump !
Dividing up your Friends
The first step is to determine how you will “ break down ” your Friends on Facebook .
The ideal method is to look at them as security boundaries ; what are the different “ classes ” of security that you will want to implement ?
The easiest way to do this is to limit it to two types ; “ All Access ” and “ Restricted ” .
My setup is a little more complicated , which is what I will use for the illustrations below – but I will refer to the “ All Access ” and “ Restricted ” concept if you want to keep it that easy .
For me , I have broken down my Friends to the following groups :
“ All Access ” – These are the people I trust .
The people who can see all my secrets .
“ Family ” – Self - explanatory .
Folks I am related to .
At this point , they ’re not a security boundary ( they have the same rights as “ All Access ” ) but I keep this group in case there ever is a one - off scenario where I would prefer my family - type folks to not see a specific Note , for example .
“ HS ” – A group that contains people I went to high school or college with .
This group has very similar permissions to Family , except that certain restricted contact information may be withheld .
“ Professional ” – People I work with or who are business partners of mine .
This group tends to not see anything juicy .
“ Twitter ” – Folks I interact with solely on social networks .
This group is restricted from seeing my contact information .
Setting up your lists
To create these groups , click on the “ Friends ” link in the left menu of Facebook .
Then , on the top right , click on the button “ Create a List ” :
This will prompt you to name your new list .
For this one , call it “ All Access ” .
Now you want to click on all of the people you want to be on that list .
Just click on their name to add them , and continue to scroll through .
Once you have finished selecting the users , click on “ Create List ”
You now have your new “ All Access ” list .
Do it again and create a list called “ Restricted ” .
If you want to add users to a list after you ’ve created it , just click on the “ Friends ” button in the left menu , to expand to show all of your lists .
Then click on the list you want to edit :
This will show you all of your Friends on that list .
Then click the “ Edit List ” button to get the screen to add / remove users from the list .
This brings up the “ Extra Friend Detail ” view .
Notice the little drop - down triangle next to “ View Friends ” .
Click on it .
Locking it down
Now that you have your Friends all shuffled into their proper groups , it ’s time to do some privacy lockdown .
Hang on tight , as this is not for the faint of heart and it could take a while .
First , under Account , click on Privacy Settings :
We ’ll start with your Profile privacy .
There are a lot of settings here .
We wo n’t go through all of them , but I will show you how to lock down one , and you can apply the same concept to any other settings .
We ’ll start with “ Photos Tagged Of You ” .
Click the little drop - down next to that setting ( the default is “ Friend of Friends ” , I believe ) , and choose “ Customize ”
Now this is where it gets tricky .
Take a look at the screen that comes up :
You might think “ Aha !
I know what to do !
I will put the ‘ Restricted ’ group into ‘ Hide this from ’ !
I ’m so smart ! ”
Close , but not exactly .
Here ’s the problem with that system – if you base it upon exclusions , any Friend of yours can see that content until you put them in the Restricted group .
What happens if you get a Friend request from someone , and approve it on your smartphone , but do n’t get a chance to put them into the Restricted group until a day later ?
During that entire time , that person has full reign to view all your tequila shot pictures .
No good .
So we ’ll do it the other way .
In the “ Make this visible to ” dropdown , choose “ specific people ” :
You can type in both individual friends ( cumbersome ! ) or the name of a Friends List .
Type in “ All Access ” in that group and select it .
Once you ’ve done it for that setting , you can continue to set up all the different restrictions you would like .
Do n’t forget to visit all of the other settings on the Privacy page .
You can change the settings on the “ Contact Information ” the same way we did for “ Profile Information ” .
Bhubaneswar , Jan 4 : A man who had been declared dead woke up when doctors began to conduct his post - mortem examination in Jajpur district of Orissa , a media report said Monday .
Manas Deo was critically injured after a vehicle hit him Dec 25 near Baragadia village in Jajpur , Oriya daily Sambad quoted Manas 's wife Tiki Deo as saying .
Police brought him to a local hospital where the doctor on duty declared him dead .
" It was a surprise for the hospital staff and family members after Manas woke up when the doctors began his autopsy , " the report said .
Manas is now undergoing treatment at a hospital at Cuttack , 26 km from here .
His condition is improving and he will get well in a fortnight , the newspaper added .
FLORHAM PARK , N.J. -- Rex Ryan is feeling Super these days .
The New York Jets ' confident coach believes his team should not
only be favored to beat the Cincinnati Bengals , but to win the
Super Bowl .
During his daily news conference Wednesday , Ryan was asked what
his reaction was to being the team with the longest odds --
currently at 50 - 1 -- to win the championship .
" I was n't aware of that , " he said , " but to me , we should be
favorites , so that 's fine . "
Ryan then was asked to clarify if he meant the Jets should be
favored to beat the Bengals on Saturday in Cincinnati .
" I mean in the whole tournament , " he said .
" You know the way
that I feel . "
That 's right .
The guy who mistakenly thought the Jets were
eliminated from the playoff picture after losing to Atlanta three
weeks ago believes his team can win it all .
" I think we have the best defense , I know we do , " Ryan said .
" I know we have the best rushing attack .
Those are two huge
factors in our favor .
With a couple of exceptions on our staff ,
myself probably , I think we have a great coaching staff . "
When told of Ryan 's statement , defensive coordinator Mike
Pettine smiled .
" Shocks me , " said Pettine , whom Ryan brought with him from
Baltimore .
" Like I 've said before , that 's Rex being Rex . "
The Jets opened as a one - point underdog against the Bengals , and
are now a 2 ½ - point underdog despite beating Cincinnati 37 - 0 last
Sunday to make it into the playoffs .
" I want this football team , " Ryan said .
" I 'm not going to
trade our team .
If I had a choice to coach any team in this
tournament , I would choose this one . "
The Jets , of course , have not won the Super Bowl since Joe
Namath helped deliver the franchise 's only title -- with Ryan's
father , Buddy , the defensive line coach -- in 1969 .
In 2006 , a ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling allowed the University of California , Hastings College of the Law to restrict a Christian organization from controlling membership by requiring the organization to offer voting membership and leadership positions to students who do not share the organization ’s values and beliefs .
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case to determine whether religious organizations on college campuses can require their leaders to share that organization ’s beliefs .
Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox filed an amicus brief on behalf of Michigan last week encouraging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ninth Circuit Court ’s ruling in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez .
Universities should allow like - minded students to freely associate with each other in student groups and create membership requirements based on beliefs , said Cox ’s spokesman , Nick De Leeuw .
“ For college campuses to truly be diverse institutions , they must recognize the rights of diverse student groups , including faith - based groups , to set their own membership standards , ” said De Leeuw .
Although Cox said the ruling threatens the autonomy of student leadership in religious organizations , it has not been an issue at MSU , said Paulette Granberry Russell , MSU ’s senior adviser to the president for diversity and director of the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives .
“ We have not had disputes on our campus to the extent that we have student organizations concerned , ” she said .
Thirteen other states ’ attorneys general signed on to Cox ’s amicus brief , De Leeuw said .
Filing an amicus brief allows interested parties to express their stance regarding a case the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear , said MSU political science lecturer William Myers .
“ When the U.S. Supreme Court has already accepted a case , usually state governments and especially state attorneys general will submit amicus briefs , ” he said .
“ They may all have the same interest and because ( amicus briefs ) are really expensive to put together they usually band together . ”
MSU Campus Crusade for Christ President David Kempf said students of all beliefs and backgrounds can join the group , but leaders should uphold the Christian beliefs of the group .
“ It is obviously very important to have open avenues for people in a group regardless if they are Christian or not , ” he said .
“ In terms of leadership , that would be stupid , if you were n’t a Christian to be running for leadership in a Christian organization . ”
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in December , but the hearing is not scheduled yet .
Myers said the case likely will be heard before the end of the U.S. Supreme Court ’s term in June .
Until the gossip from the Mark Halperin / John Heilemann political scandal - fest took over the news headlines , it felt as if the entire Republican establishment and the media were joined in a chorus .
Their sole focus : our president 's purported lack of manly protectiveness in response to the failed attack of the Christmas underwear bomber .
Perhaps the pinnacle of this frenzy was a column that has been widely mocked across the internet all weekend long -- Maureen Dowd bitterly complaining that Obama 's calm demeanor in the wake of the botched bombing had disappointed her , showing a lack of uniquely paternal instincts .
She wrote ( emphasis mine ) :
But it 's not O.K. to be cool about national security when Americans are scared ....
He 's so sure of himself and his actions that he fails to see that he misses the moment to be president - to be the strong father who protects the home from invaders , who reassures and instructs the public at traumatic moments .
He 's more like the aloof father who 's turned the Situation Room into a Seminar Room .
Although Dowd and a few other major media figures are the most blatant purveyors of this strange gender - standard for politics , the demand that our president be some sort of mythical father figure is n't unique to her or other machismo - obsessed pundits like Chris Matthews .
It 's part of our national fabric , particularly in the Washington media , as Glenn Greenwald notes , but everywhere : the concept of a leader who will think , feel , emote , and get angry on our behalf .
It 's a craving for an Alpha - male in chief who will be strong where we are weak .
Blogger Digby writes about the real policy ramifications for foreign relations of this kind of aggressive attitude :
Chest pounding and overreaction just so that the pundits and politicians can get that marvelous thrill up their legs is the wrong policy .
It is a testament to just how much power these fatuous gasbags have that they actually seem to think they can force the president to come before the microphones and " sound " really mad so that they can feel comfy and secure that Daddy will keep the boogeyman from killing them in their beds .
But the more belligerent he gets and the more bellicose the threats , the less safe we all actually are .
As Digby and several other bloggers have said this week , even if we disagree with our president on many issues , his unwillingness to get into a verbal pissing match with the " axis of evil " or whomever is perceived to be the enemy remains one of his more appealing qualities .
And Americans seem not to have had the same reaction as Dowd : Obama 's approval ratings remain higher in the area of terrorism than in others ( most notably the economy ) .
Unfortunately , this American obsession with a " father knows best " image and attitude goes beyond foreign policy , terrorism , and the issue of outside threats .
First of all , it makes it more difficult for a woman to get elected without posturing or trying to be tough and bellicose , as recent elections have shown us .
It also continues the American tradition of leadership being necessarily masculine and image - based .
Look at four of the five presidents we 've elected since 1980 ( Reagan , Clinton , Bush Jr , Obama ) : all of them charismatic men with strong personalities -- personalities which have , at times , threatened to eclipse their ideology in the public eye .
One might wish that Obama had run more convincingly on a platform of progressive ideals and less on his personal ability to unite -- but clearly , the personal aspect is what helped propel him to victory .
It 's what people expect of our candidates : someone we can trust , someone who can take the reins for us .
The " father figure " mythology also resonates with our recent setbacks in the area of reproductive rights and women 's agency .
The concept of a strong leader whom we need to protect us and to be our surrogate , is a close cousin of the paternalistic ideas reproductive rights advocates have been fighting for years .
Why , after all , is the government involved in our wombs to begin with ?
There are many reasons , but the conception of the government as a parent , in particular a father , are a large part of the problem .
The media and public may have gotten too comfortable with the idea of pragmatic , no - nonsense , lawmakers and justices who know well , better than emotional women do , how to interpret our rights , what to bargain away and when .
And then of course , there are the ubiquitous laws that keep cropping up -- mandatory ultrasounds , counseling , waiting periods -- meant to make sure women who get appointments for abortions actually know what they 're doing , even after they 've made that appointment and traveled to the clinic .
This belief in the daddy state combined with pervasive misogyny helps explains why reproductive rights have been siphoned away for decades .
Yes , we need to elect politicians we can trust .
But leaders in a democracy should not be a parent whose job is to shield us and govern for us .
They are elected by the people to represent us , and therefore to be accountable to us .
The notion of a father figure is too closely linked to paternalism for comfort .
In the year 2010 , I will post a simple text - only tic - tac - toe application in a different programming language every week .
I ’m not sure where precisely the inspiration for this arose , but I know I ’ve been fascinated with the variety in programming languages for as long as I ’ve been exposed to them .
Even more than most human languages , a programming language shapes the sorts of ideas it even occurs to you to express , and I believe that to call yourself a professional , you ought to know more than one , more than those you make your living off of , and preferably one or two from each of the high - level language families .
This might have a practical benefit if it leads to the next paycheck , but more interesting is the “ cross - training ” that learning an unfamiliar modality brings .
While straining to learn a truly novel abstract concept , I find it ’s almost as if I can feel the new neural pathways forming .
I may not be able to directly use , say , monads in my day job , but learning how they work changes how I think about state .
But this project is not really about that .
This is at once more extreme , and less serious .
Call it adventures in programming dilettantism .
A breadth - first exploration of the brilliance and madness our arcane art has to offer .
I chose tic - tac - toe ( noughts and crosses ) because it ’s easy to understand what it should do , complex enough to hit on a variety of language features , yet simple enough to implement that I can reasonably churn them out at a pace of one a week while remaining happily married and employed .
But I need your help .
I ’ve assembled a partial list of the 52 languages , grouped into categories , but as you can see , there are still empty slots , and room for a few alternates .
Let me know what you think should fill them , and I ’ll update the list .
The only restriction for now is that I must be able to obtain a legal , zero - cost implementation .
I ’ve already implemented a few “ in reserve . ”
UPDATE : Thanks for the great suggestions , everyone .
I reserve the right to swap things in if the insane ones kill me . 🙂

OREM — Substance abuse , electronic entertainment and pornography are three counterfeits that can rob teens of real relationships , a BYU professor and author told high school and junior high school students Wednesday night at Mountain View High School .
" Tell yourself , ' I do n't need to settle for something that is pretend , something that is fake … when I have something that 's real all around me , ' " Brad Wilcox , an assistant professor of teacher education at BYU , told the packed auditorium as part of a parent and student meeting .
" Do n't settle for a counterfeit .
Reach out for all that is real around you . "
Wilcox likened himself to Timothy Mouse , who in the Disney cartoon " Dumbo " convinced the young elephant with exaggerated ears he could fly by holding onto a " magic " feather and then revealed that the feather was n't magic at all .
" There are three feathers that people try to give us so we can fly , " he said .
" Tonight I 'm telling you that you do n't need the feather to fly . "
Wilcox said smoking and drinking were one feather their friends would tell them they need .
" We think , ' Oh man , I 'm missing something if I do n't use these things . '
If you choose not to smoke , you 're not missing anything , " he said .
" The ones using them are missing something .
It 's called a brain . "
The second feather is technology .
Wilcox said recent studies show that with television , texting , video gaming , social networking and Web surfing , teenagers are spending up to four days a week in electronic stimulation .
" Many of us will go online and talk to complete strangers or bare our souls on the Internet , but we refuse to talk to Mom or Dad who is asking us how our day went , " he said .
" Are you settling for fake relationships when you could be having a real relationship ? "
Wilcox said pornography , the third feather , " is nothing more than the illusion of intimacy .
It is not intimacy .
It is … lust .
It is not sex education .
In fact , it is sex miseducation marketed for gain . "
Individuals who embrace pornography , masturbation and casual sex will find that when it comes time to develop a mature sexual relationship , they are unable to do it .
" All that person can do is take , because every sexual choice he 's made since he was 12 has taught his mind one thing — complete and total selfishness , " Wilcox said .
" So he shows up in his marriage ready to do one thing — take .
And nobody wants to be the one who is always giving to the one who is always getting .
" The best - kept sex secret in the world is love in a healthy marriage relationship , " he said .
Wilcox encouraged students who found they were relying on these " feathers " to fly to reach out for help by talking to a parent , a counselor or a member if his or her clergy .
" The more you try to keep these things a secret , the more you will be sinking , " he said .

A new study from the US Federal Communications Commission says that 93 million Americans do n't have broadband internet access at home .
Most non-adopters cite " affordability and lack of digital skills " as the reasons for not steering themselves into the fast lane of the information superhighway , but many fear or are disgusted by the web .
And millions just do n't care .
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski is n't happy with these numbers .
" In the 21st century , a digital divide is an opportunity divide , " he said in a statement ( PDF ) .
" To bolster American competitiveness abroad and create the jobs of the future here at home , we need to make sure that all Americans have the skills and means to fully participate in the digital economy . "
The study says that 15 million Americans think that broadband access is irrelevant , calling the internet " a waste of time " and saying there 's no content of interest to them or that they 're satisfied with dial - up .
These findings are detailed in a 51 - page report ( PDF ) , " Broadband Adoption and Use in America , " based on a survey ( PDF ) of 5,005 American conducted last October and November .
The survey was authorized by the Broadband Data Improvement Act signed into law by George W. Bush in October 2008 .
Of the roughly 60 million adult Americans who do n't use the internet at all , 47 per cent cited cost and complexity and 45 per cent agreed with the survey statement that " I am worried about all the bad things that can happen if I use the Internet . "
Thirty - five percent were of the opinion that " There is nothing on the Internet I want to see or use , " and one third thought " The Internet is just a waste of time . "
Of all respondents who told the FCC that they do n't have broadband - both dial - up and non-internet users - only 4 per cent said that the reason was lack of availability .
More important to them was " too much pornography and offensive material " ( 65 per cent ) and their belief that it 's " too easy for my personal information to be stolen online " ( 57 per cent ) . "
The survey is part of the run-up to the FCC's National Broadband Plan , which will be delivered to Congress on March 17 .
According to the FCC 's statement , this plan " details a strategy for connecting the country to affordable , world - class broadband . "
Of course , " affordable " means different things to different people .
Of those who currently have broadband , the average cost is a bit over $ 40 per month .
Those who do n't have broadband said they'd be willing to pay , on average , around $ 25 per month .
And 20 per cent said they would n't pay anything .
It 's not that those Americans without broadband are technophobes : 80 percent have either satellite or cable television , 70 per cent have cell phones , and 42 per cent have at least one working computer at home .
It appears that the FCC has its work cut out for it to achieve its goal of achieving " US global leadership in high - speed Internet to create jobs and spur economic growth ; to unleash new waves of innovation and investment ; and to improve education , health care , energy efficiency , public safety , and the vibrancy of our democracy . "
Millions of Americans do n't care , do n't want broadband , do n't want to pay for it , and find the internet either offensive or dangerous . ®
Military scientists are looking to ramp up research and development of a flying military vehicle that will hold up to 4 people and have the ability to launch vertically and soar when necessary .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) will this month hold its first Proposers ' Day Workshop in support of a flying car program it will begin this year known as the Transformer ( TX ) .
The goal of the TX will be to build a flying vehicle that will let military personnel avoid water , difficult terrain , and road obstructions as well as IED and ambush threats by driving and flying when necessary .
Layer 8 Extra :
i Phone apps , algorithms and satellites dominate 2009
Bots , bombs and weird science :
The wackiest stories of 2009
DARPA said the vehicle will need to be able to drive on prepared surface and light off - road conditions , as well as support Vertical Takeoff and Landing ( VTOL ) features .
The TX will also support range and speed efficiencies that will allow for missions to be performed on a single tank of fuel .
DARPA said the TX will " provide the flexibility to adapt to traditional and asymmetric threats by providing the operator unimpeded movement over difficult terrain .
In addition , transportation is no longer restricted to trafficable terrain that tends to makes movement predictable . "
DARPA said current transport systems present operational limitations where the warfighter is either anchored to the ground with a Humvee and thus vulnerable to ambush , or reliant on helicopters , which are limited in flight speed and availability .
The TX will let soldiers approach targets from directions opportune to them and not the enemy , DARPA stated .
Key requirements of the research and development will include :
Develop a robust vehicle design that maximizes military utility at a reasonable cost

DARPA is not only looking to get a vehicle that flies , it is also developing one that that 's as capable of zipping through the sky as it is underwater .
Announced last year , the agency 's Submersible Aircraft research project is exploring the possibility of making an aircraft that can maneuver underwater with the goal of revolutionizing the US Department of Defense 's ability to , for example , bring military personnel and equipment to coastal locations or enhance rescue operations .
DARPA said that the concept being evaluated here is for a submersible aircraft , not a flying submarine .
It is expected that the platform will spend the bulk of its time in the air and will only spend short periods of time submerged according to the agency .
According to DARPA : " The difficulty with developing such a craft comes from the diametrically opposed requirements that exist for an airplane and a submarine .
While the primary goal for airplane designers is to try and minimize weight , a submarine must be extremely heavy in order to submerge underwater .
In addition , the flow conditions and the systems designed to control a submarine and an airplane are radically different , due to the order of magnitude difference in the densities of air and water . "

Facebook developers announced and released HipHop , a compiler that takes PHP code and outputs C++ code to later be compiled by g++.
I 'll disclaim that I have n't seen the source code ( still not on github as I 'm writing this ) and am basing my conclusions only on their blog post , but I think there wo n't be a " tremendous impact " from this project .
It 's basic cost / benefit analysis .
The benefits are nearly great enough .
Only 50 % CPU reduction ?
Let 's walk through the math of what that might mean for Facebook in terms of cost savings .
Their post says they do 400B PHP impressions per month , which works out to about 150k / sec .
That 's a phenomenal number and a challenge for any site to perform at .
Facebook describes how PHP is used almost exclusively for the front end , and that the back end services are powered by Erlang , Java , Python , etc .
So if we assume they 've got the front and back fairly well separated and can scale the front end based entirely on CPU load , we can make up some numbers to guess their total cost .
In my experience , even a poorly implemented PHP site can run around 20 requests per second on a single core .
Assuming Facebook uses beefy 8 core machines , that would be 160 / sec per box , and 1,000 machines to serve their 150k / sec load .
Given that their load probably peaks with US traffic , and that they probably need double capacity to handle a co-location failing , I could see that going up to 4,000 machines .
Facebook has over 30,000 machines , most of which I 'm sure are used to handle photos data and their tremendous memcached layer , so 4,000 web serving machines sounds about right .
At Facebook 's scale , they can probably get a beefy 8 core machine relatively cheaply , but let 's use $ 5 k as a number , that means that saving 2,000 machines saves Facebook $ 10 MM .
That 's pretty impressive , but 2,000 machines compared against their total machine load of 30 k is n't that impressive .
It 's 7 % .
Further , if we expect this to catch on and have a " tremendous impact " on the world at large , it would have to be a big benefit for all the small PHP sites out there .
I 'd wager that almost all small sites are not bottlenecked on PHP CPU performance , but database performance instead .
Even if it was PHP performance , for most small sites the savings would likely be going from 30 machines to 15 , which is almost unnoticeable .
For this system to be really effective , I 'd want to see a speedup of 10 - 100x , not merely 2x .
So I 've laid out that the savings are n't that great .
But they are n't nothing , a speedup of 2 x which saves Facebook $ 10 MM is pretty impressive .
but what does it cost .
I suspect the costs are pretty high and measured almost exclusively in terms of developer productivity .
Let 's set aside the man year of development their lead developer spent developing this technology .
Facebook has to integrate this system into the development process , and there are two obvious ways .
1 . Developers add a " compile " step to their development cycle and test using HipHop on their development boxes .
This , to me , would represent a worst case outcome ( and from their blog post is almost certainly not what they do ) .
One of the many development speed benefits of scripted languages like PHP and Ruby comes from the fact that developers do n't have a compile cycle .
While that compile cycle seems trivial ( how hard is it to interrupt your code / test cycle with a 2 minute compile ? ) in my experience it's a large amount of the benefit .
Sure , dynamic typing is another major benefit , but I believe that if every Facebook developer now has to add a compile cycle , their overall productivity will plummet .
2 . Alternatively ( and more likely ) , they keep developers with an interpreted language on their dev box , and they move the compile step into the release process .
They indicate this in their blog post by talking about developers using HPHPi , their experimental interpreter .
The problem here is that you 've now doubled your testing .
A developer writes his code and tests it locally using HPHPi , or even the standard PHP install .
After that , they have to compile it with HipHop and test it again to make sure the compiler did n't break anything .
If the compiler were a mature technology , you could probably skip this step , but with an experimental compiler you simply can't trust that it will work on your code .
Further , when you find an issue in production that you did n't anticipate , you 're now not sure if it 's the compiler or the code that is broken .
Given the difficulty of debugging live site bugs that often come about due to circumstances that are hard to duplicate in the test environment , this seems like a disaster .
So we 're left with a system that does n't provide enough benefit for the costs that will be associated with it .
A neat toy , but if I were Facebook , I would value the developer productivity way over the $ 10 MM I might be able to save in server costs .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . -- NASA is about to launch the mother of all Super Bowl pregame shows with the space shuttle Endeavour , which is poised to blast off before dawn Sunday morning .
Endeavour and a crew of six astronauts are slated launch toward the International Space Station from a seaside pad here at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center .
Liftoff is set for 4:39 a.m. EST , about 14 hours before the Indianapolis Colts and New Orleans Saints kick off Super Bowl 44 in South Florida .
" It 's going to be a special day , " said shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach .
" We 're going to launch Sunday morning and we 're going to watch the big game Sunday night . "
SLIDESHOW : The Endeavour Flies Again
SLIDESHOW : The Hubble 's Greatest Pictures of Our Universe
The weather looks good for the launch attempt , with an 80 percent chance of clear skies .
But if the launch is delayed , NASA will gladly skip the Super Bowl to get Endeavour ready to fly on Monday .
" We 're not going to change our plans based on the Super Bowl , frankly , " Leinbach said , adding that tomorrow 's game is not the first – or the last – football championship game .
" So there have been quite a few , and there will probably be more . "
NASA will begin fueling Endeavour for launch Saturday night at around 7 p.m. EST .
Nighttime launch
Endeavour 's planned 13 - day mission is the first of NASA 's five final shuttle missions before the space agency retires its aging orbiter fleet later this year .
It is NASA 's last major construction job to build the 11 - year - old station .
The shuttle will deliver a new room to the station along with a dome - shaped observation portal lined with windows .
They will be installed during three spacewalks by the astronauts , who will be following an overnight work shift .
The predawn shuttle launch is also expected to be the last ever to blast off in darkness .
" It should be spectacular , " said Endeavour commander George Zamka , who will make his second trip to space on the mission .
[ How to see the shuttle launch . ]
At liftoff , Endeavour 's twin solid rocket boosters will light up the night sky , Zamka said .
That 's the first thing Florida skywatchers will see .
The rumbling roar of the shuttle 's rocket engines will reach the crowds a short time later as Endeavour climbs into the morning sky .
" It 's going to light up the ground around , " he said .
" You should be able to see it from as far as the Carolinas , I think , if the skies are clear .
It should be a wonderful sight . "
In fact , experts say the shuttle could be visible from as far away as New York if the skies are clear enough .
Set to launch spaceward on Endeavour with Zamka are shuttle pilot Terry Virts and mission specialists Kathryn Hire , Stephen Robinson , Robert Behnken and Nick Patrick .
All are veteran spaceflyers with the exception of Virts , who is making his first spaceflight .
Space rooms and windows
Zamka 's five - man , one - woman crew will deliver the station 's new Tranquility module and a seven - window observation portal dubbed the Cupola .
Once they 're installed , the $ 100 billion station will be about 98 percent complete .
Construction began in 1998 .
Tranquility is a new $ 382 million room designed to house the station 's life support and exercise gear , as well as a robotic arm control station .
The Cupola is a $ 27.2 million dome with six windows arranged around a large central portal for optimum viewing of the Earth and space .
Both Tranquility and the Cupola were built by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , which has sent more than 100 people to come watch Endeavour launch their handiwork into space .
" It 's a lot like a baby growing up , a child leaving the house , " said ESA space station program manager Bernardo Patti .
Endeavour 's flight comes less than a week after President Barack Obama ordered NASA to scrap its current plan to replace the shuttle fleet with new Orion spacecraft and their Ares rockets to send American astronauts into space and on to the moon .
Instead , the administration released a 2011 budget request for NASA that would set aside funding to develop new technologies and support commercially built spacecraft that could send astronauts back to the moon – or to asteroids or Mars – faster than the old path .
Shuttle officials said the radical shift has left some workers in shock , but they are still focused on the near - term goal of launching Endeavour safely .
" It 's kind of one of those uncertainties about where we 're going to go next , " said Mike Moses , NASA 's shuttle launch integration manager .
Sunday 's launch will mark the 34th flight for Endeavour and is NASA 's 130th shuttle mission since its reusable space planes began launching in 1981 .
" It 's going to be a beautiful launch .
You 'll be able to see it all the way up the East Coast and we 're looking forward to it , " Leinbach said .
" The team is energized .
We 're ready to go . "

Rethinking macro policy
Olivier Blanchard , Giovanni Dell ' Ariccia , Paolo Mauro
The global crisis forced economic policymakers to react in ways not anticipated by the pre-crisis consensus on how macroeconomic policy should be conducted .
Here the IMF ’s chief economist and colleagues ( i ) review the main elements of the pre-crisis consensus , ( ii ) identify the elements which turned out to be wrong , and ( iii ) take a tentative first pass at outlining the contours of a new macroeconomic policy framework .
The great moderation ( Gali and Gambetti 2009 ) lulled macroeconomists and policymakers alike in the belief that we knew how to conduct macroeconomic policy .
The crisis clearly forces us to question that assessment .
In a recent IMF Staff Position Note ( Blanchard , Dell ’ Ariccia and Mauro 2010 , which includes a bibliography ) , we review the main elements of the pre-crisis consensus , we seek to identify what elements were wrong and what tenets of the pre-crisis framework still hold , and we take a tentative first pass at the contours of a new macroeconomic policy framework .
What we thought we knew
To caricature : we thought of monetary policy as having one target , inflation , and one instrument , the policy rate .
So long as inflation was stable , the output gap was likely to be small and stable and monetary policy did its job .
We thought of fiscal policy as playing a secondary role , with political constraints limiting its usefulness .
And we thought of financial regulation as mostly outside the macroeconomic policy framework .
Admittedly , these views were more closely held in academia ; policymakers were more pragmatic .
Nevertheless , the prevailing consensus played an important role in shaping policies and institutions .
One target : Inflation
Stable and low inflation was presented as the primary , if not exclusive , mandate of central banks .
This resulted from the reputational need of central bankers to focus on inflation rather than activity and the intellectual support for inflation targeting provided by the New Keynesian model .
In the benchmark version of that model , constant inflation is indeed the optimal policy , delivering a zero output gap , which turns out to be the best possible outcome for activity given the imperfections present in the economy .
This “ divine coincidence ” implied that , even if policymakers cared about activity , the best they could do was to maintain stable inflation .
There was also consensus that inflation should be very low ( most central banks targeted 2 % inflation ) .
One instrument :
The policy rate
Monetary policy focused on one instrument , the policy interest rate .
Under the prevailing assumptions , one only needed to affect current and future expected short rates , and all other rates and prices would follow .
The details of financial intermediation were seen as largely irrelevant .
An exception was made for commercial banks , with an emphasis on the “ credit channel . ”
Moreover , the possibility of runs justified deposit insurance and the traditional role of central banks as lenders of last resort .
The resulting distortions were the main justification for bank regulation and supervision .
Little attention was paid , however , to the rest of the financial system from a macro standpoint .
A limited role for fiscal policy
Following its glory days of the Keynesian 1950s and 1960s , and the high inflation of the 1970s , fiscal policy took a backseat in the past two - three decades .
The reasons included scepticism about the effects of fiscal policy , itself largely based on Ricardian equivalence arguments ; concerns about lags and political influences in the design and implementation of fiscal policy ; and the need to stabilize and reduce typically high debt levels .
Automatic stabilizers could be left to play when they did not conflict with sustainability .
Financial regulation :
Not a macroeconomic policy tool
Financial regulation and supervision focused on individual institutions and markets and largely ignored their macroeconomic implications .
Financial regulation targeted the soundness of individual institutions and aimed at correcting market failures stemming from asymmetric information or limited liability .
Given the enthusiasm for financial deregulation , the use of prudential regulation for cyclical purposes was considered improper mingling with the functioning of credit markets .
The Great Moderation
The decline in the variability of output and inflation led to greater confidence that a coherent macro framework had been achieved .
In addition , the successful responses to the 1987 stock market crash , the LTCM collapse , and the bursting of the tech bubble reinforced the view that monetary policy was also well equipped to deal with asset price busts .
Thus , by the mid-2000s , it was not unreasonable to think that better macroeconomic policy could deliver , and had delivered , higher economic stability .
Then the crisis came .
What we have learned from the crisis
Macroeconomic fragilities may arise even when inflation is stable
Core inflation was stable in most advanced economies until the crisis started .
Some have argued in retrospect that core inflation was not the right measure of inflation , and that the increase in oil or housing prices should have been taken into account .
But no single index will do the trick .
Moreover , core inflation may be stable and the output gap may nevertheless vary , leading to a trade - off between the two .
Or , as in the case of the pre-crisis 2000s , both inflation and the output gap may be stable , but the behaviour of some asset prices and credit aggregates , or the composition of output , may be undesirable .
Low inflation limits the scope of monetary policy in deflationary recessions
When the crisis started in earnest in 2008 , and aggregate demand collapsed , most central banks quickly decreased their policy rate to close to zero .
Had they been able to , they would have decreased the rate further .
But the zero nominal interest rate bound prevented them from doing so .
Had pre-crisis inflation ( and consequently policy rates ) been somewhat higher , the scope for reducing real interest rates would have been greater .
Financial intermediation matters
Markets are segmented , with specialized investors operating in specific markets .
Most of the time , they are well linked through arbitrage .
However , when some investors withdraw ( because of losses in other activities , cuts in access to funds , or internal agency issues ) the effect on prices can be very large .
When this happens , rates are no longer linked through arbitrage , and the policy rate is no longer a sufficient instrument .
Interventions , either through the acceptance of assets as collateral , or through their straight purchase by the central bank , can affect the rates on different classes of assets , for a given policy rate .
In this sense , wholesale funding is not fundamentally different from demand deposits , and the demand for liquidity extends far beyond banks .
Countercyclical fiscal policy is an important tool
The crisis has returned fiscal policy to centre stage for two main reasons .
First , monetary policy had reached its limits .
Second , from its early stages , the recession was expected to be long lasting , so that it was clear that fiscal stimulus would have ample time to yield a beneficial impact despite implementation lags .
The aggressive fiscal response has been warranted given the exceptional circumstances , but it has further exposed some drawbacks of discretionary fiscal policy for more “ normal ” fluctuations – in particular lags in formulating , enacting , and implementing appropriate fiscal measures .
The crisis has also shown the importance of having “ fiscal space , ” as some economies that entered the crisis with high levels of government debt had limited ability to use fiscal policy .
Regulation is not macroeconomically neutral
Financial regulation contributed to the amplification that transformed the decrease in US housing prices into a major world economic crisis .
The limited perimeter of regulation gave incentives for banks to create off - balance - sheet entities to avoid some prudential rules and increase leverage .
Regulatory arbitrage allowed some financial institutions to play by different rules from other financial intermediaries .
Once the crisis started , rules aimed at guaranteeing the soundness of individual institutions worked against the stability of the system .
Mark - to - market rules , coupled with constant regulatory capital ratios , forced financial institutions into fire sales and deleveraging .
Reinterpreting the Great Moderation
If the conceptual framework behind macroeconomic policy was so flawed , why did things look so good for so long ?
One reason is that policymakers had to deal with shocks for which policy was well adapted .
For example , the lesson from the 1970s that , with respect to supply shocks , anchoring of expectations was of the essence was well understood when the price of oil increased again in the 2000s .
Success in moderating fluctuations may even have sown the seeds of this crisis .
The Great Moderation led too many ( including policymakers and regulators ) to understate macroeconomic risk , ignore tail risks , and take positions ( and relax rules ) which were revealed to be much riskier after the fact .
Implications for policy design
The bad news is that the crisis has shown that macroeconomic policy must have many targets ; the good news is that it has also reminded us that we have many instruments , from “ exotic ” monetary policy to fiscal instruments , to regulatory instruments .
It will take some time , and substantial research , to decide which instruments to allocate to which targets .
It is important to start by stating that the baby should not be thrown out with the bathwater .
Most of the elements of the pre-crisis consensus still hold .
Among them , the ultimate targets remain output and inflation stability .
The natural rate hypothesis holds , at least to a good enough approximation , and policymakers should not assume that there is a long - term trade - off between inflation and unemployment .
Stable and low inflation must remain a major goal of monetary policy .
Fiscal sustainability is of the essence , not only for the long term , but also in affecting expectations in the short term .
The following are important questions for economists to work on .
Exactly how low should inflation targets be ?
The crisis has shown that large adverse shocks do happen .
Should policymakers aim for a higher target inflation rate in normal times , in order to increase the room for monetary policy to react to such shocks ?
Are the net costs of inflation much higher at , say , 4 % than at 2 % , the current target range ?
Is it more difficult to anchor expectations at 4 % than at 2 % ?
Achieving low inflation through central bank independence has been a historic accomplishment .
Thus , answering these questions implies carefully revisiting the benefits and costs of inflation .
A related question is whether , when the inflation rate becomes very low , policymakers should err on the side of a more lax monetary policy , so as to minimize the likelihood of deflation , even if this means incurring the risk of higher inflation in the event of an unexpectedly strong pickup in demand .
This issue , which was on the mind of the Fed in the early 2000s , is one we must return to .
How should monetary and regulatory policy be combined ?
Part of the debate about monetary policy , even before the crisis , was whether the interest rate rule , implicit or explicit , should be extended to deal with asset prices .
The crisis has added a number of candidates to the list , from leverage to measures of systemic risk .
This seems like the wrong way of approaching the problem .
The policy rate is a poor tool to deal with excess leverage , risk taking , or apparent deviations of asset prices from fundamentals .
A higher policy rate also implies a larger output gap .
Other instruments are at the policymaker ’s disposal — call them cyclical regulatory tools .
If leverage appears excessive , regulatory capital ratios can be increased ; if liquidity appears too low , regulatory liquidity ratios can be introduced and , if needed , increased ; to dampen housing prices , loan - to - value ratios can be decreased ; to limit stock price increases , margin requirements can be increased .
If monetary and regulatory tools are to be combined in this way , it follows that the traditional regulatory and prudential frameworks need to acquire a macroeconomic dimension .
This raises the issue of how coordination is achieved between the monetary and the regulatory authorities .
The increasing trend toward separation of the two may well have to be reversed .
Central banks are an obvious candidate as macroprudential regulators .
Should liquidity be provided more broadly ?
The crisis has forced central banks to extend the scope and scale of their traditional role as lenders of last resort .
They extended their liquidity support to non-deposit - taking institutions and intervened directly ( with purchases ) or indirectly ( through acceptance of the assets as collateral ) in a broad range of asset markets .
The argument for extending liquidity provision , even in normal times , seems compelling .
If liquidity problems come from the disappearance of deep - pocket private investors from specific markets , or from the coordination problems of small investors as in traditional bank runs , the central authority is in a unique position to intervene .
How can we create more fiscal space in good times ?
A key lesson from the crisis is the desirability of fiscal space to run larger fiscal deficits when needed .
Going forward , the required degree of fiscal adjustment ( after the recovery is securely under way ) will be formidable , in light of the need to reduce debt while swimming against the tide of aging - related challenges in pensions and health care .
Still , the lesson from the crisis is that target debt levels should be lower than those observed before the crisis .
The policy implications for the next decade or two are that , when cyclical conditions permit , major fiscal adjustment is necessary and , should economic growth recover rapidly , it should be used to reduce debt - to - GDP ratios substantially , rather than to finance expenditure increases or tax cuts .
The recipe to ensure that economic booms translate into improved fiscal positions is not new , but it acquires greater relevance as a result of the crisis .
Medium - term fiscal frameworks , credible commitments to reducing debt - to - GDP ratios , fiscal rules ( with escape clauses for recessions ) , and transparent fiscal data can all help in this regard .
Can we design better automatic fiscal stabilizers ?
Discretionary fiscal measures come too late to fight a standard recession .
Can we strengthen and improve the automatic stabilizers ?
A distinction is needed here between truly automatic stabilizers – those that imply a decrease in transfers or increase in tax revenues when incomes rise – and rules that allow some transfers or taxes to vary based on pre-specified triggers tied to the state of the economy .
The first type of automatic stabilizer comes from the combination of rigid government expenditures with an elasticity of revenues with respect to output of approximately one , from the existence of social insurance , and from the progressive nature of income taxes .
The main ways to increase their macroeconomic effect would be to increase the size of government , make taxes more progressive , or to make social insurance more generous .
However , these reforms would be warranted only if they were based on a broader set of equity and efficiency objectives .
The second type of automatic stabilizer appears more promising .
On the tax side , one can think of temporary tax policies targeted at low - income households , such as a flat , refundable tax rebate , a percentage reduction in a taxpayer ’s liability , or tax policies affecting firms , such as cyclical investment tax credits .
On the expenditure side , one can think of temporary transfers targeted at low - income or liquidity - constrained households .
These taxes or transfers would be triggered by the crossing of a threshold by a macro variable .

Advertisement The British National Party has voted to scrap its whites - only membership rules after an extraordinary general meeting .
Members who had gathered in Essex voted to amend the party 's constitution to let black and Asian people join .
The BNP had been threatened with a possible court injunction over its whites - only membership policy by the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
The party must now go back to court in March when a judge will decide if the new rules meet race relation laws .
It is thought the BNP has removed references to " indigenous British " people , paving the way for black and Asian people to be admitted to the party for the first time .
' Legal reality '
But a BNP spokesman said he could not comment on the precise wording of the new rules until they had been seen by Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) lawyers .
Anti-fascist group Searchlight said the membership rule change was " a meaningless gesture " , adding that " no - one seriously believes that thousands of black and Asian Britons will now be queuing up to join Nick Griffin 's party " .
A spokesman for the group said : " The BNP are as racist and extremist as ever . " BNP leader Nick Griffin told the BBC News Channel : " We had to do it ( change the constitution ) for legal reasons .
Many of our members think it 's a good thing .
ANALYSIS Ross Hawkins
BBC political reporter
In the short term this dispute is costing the BNP money .
The party has incurred legal fees , and it is barred from taking on new members until this is resolved .
If the BNP loses at the next court hearing it faces the possibility of an injunction forcing it to look again at its constitution .
Ignoring that could result in court sanctions .
However this is a civil , not criminal , case and the EHRC cannot punish the party itself .
It certainly does not have the power to stop the BNP from contesting the general election .
Nick Griffin has tried to rally his members behind this fight with the EHRC .
But he knows as the election approaches he will have to spend more time with his party 's lawyers .
" A lot of people said we should have done it some time ago but that 's really by the by .
" Our problem with this is a government funded , taxpayer - funded quango telling people who they can and can't associate with , [ which ] is a fundamental outrage .
" Nevertheless , we recognise legal reality , so we have done it and now , for one thing , they can't call us racist any more . "
Mr Griffin also defended the forcible expulsion of a newspaper journalist from Sunday 's meeting , saying the paper had previously written " lies " about the BNP .
The expulsion took place before the result of the vote was announced as Times journalist Dominic Kennedy was bundled out of the venue by BNP security guards .
Mr Kennedy said he had been invited to the meeting by party officials , but on arrival had been confronted by senior BNP member Richard Barnbrook , who is also a London Assembly member .
Mr Kennedy told the BBC News website " A number of BNP security people shoved me out of the room .
I was hit in the back and had my nose grabbed . "
He said he had not been hurt in the incident .
' Indigenous ' Britons Asked on the BBC News channel how the BNP could expect to be seen as a normal political party in the light of its behaviour towards a journalist , Mr Griffin said Mr Kennedy had been ejected because of Times " lies " about his party .

" He refused to leave when he was asked so he had to be encouraged to leave , " said Mr Griffin .
He added : " We will carry on throwing The Times out until they report the truth .
That 's all we ask . "
Mr Griffin and his party must now wait until next month to learn whether the changes to its rules will enable it to escape a court injunction .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) had threatened the injunction against the BNP unless it changed rules limiting membership to " indigenous British " people .
However at a Central London County Court hearing last month , there were questions over whether amendments proposed to the party 's constitution would go far enough to satisfy lawyers from the EHRC .
' Major obstacle '
On Sunday , the EHCR said it had not seen the changes to the party 's membership rules but hoped that it was " no longer discriminatory " .
An EHCR spokeswoman said : " We 're expecting to see a copy of the policy on Tuesday , which is the deadline set by the court .
" When we 've received this we will consider our position ahead of the next court hearing on 9th March . "
BNP deputy leader Simon Darby said further changes had been made since the court hearing and the party now believed it had overcome the " major obstacle that has stopped us from complying with the law " .
The section of the constitution that could viewed as discriminatory against potential ethnic minority members had been removed , he told BBC News .
But he said he could not comment on the precise wording until it had been seen by EHRC lawyers , which would happen within the next seven days .
He said Mr Griffin had the authority to make further minor changes to the wording if the EHRC was not satisfied .

Excerpts below :
BEIJING : In an unprecedented move , India on Saturday joined China and two other developing countries to prepare for a major offensive on rich nations at the Copenhagen conference on climate change next month .
The four countries , which include Brazil and South Africa , agreed to a strategy that involves jointly walking out of the conference if the developed nations try to force their own terms on the developing world , Jairam Ramesh , the Indian minister for environment and forests ( independent charge ) , said .
“ We will not exit in isolation .
We will co-ordinate our exit if any of our non-negotiable terms is violated .
Our entry and exit will be collective , ” Ramesh told reporters in Beijing .
The move comes after reports suggested that rich nations led by Denmark are trying to set the agenda of the conference by presenting a draft containing a set of specific proposals .
…
The four nations issued a joint press release , which made it clear the developed nations should be ready to contribute funds and share green technology if they expected the developing and poor nations to take major actions on environmental protection .
…
The developing nations will also not accept any pressure from developed countries to establish legally binding emission targets at Copenhagen .
Developing countries want to be allowed to reduce emissions voluntarily and take what they consider to be “ nationally appropriate actions ” he said .
Ramesh said India will under no circumstances accept the concept of a peaking year under which each country will have to indicate on what date they will reach the highest level of pollution before beginning to come down .
India will also not accept any unsupported mitigation actions without any effort by developed countries to provide funds and technology support to improve environment in developing nations .

U.S. ' Star Wars ' laser plane successfully shoots down ballistic missile for first time
The U.S. have successfully taken out a ballistic missile with a high - powered laser beam mounted to a plane , it revealed yesterday .
The U.S. Missile Defence Agency ( MDA ) announced the feat after the test overnight on Thursday in central California .
The plane uses lasers to lock onto the missile and follow its trajectory and then brings it down with a single shot from its nose - all in a matter of seconds .
It is the first successful test of a futuristic , directed energy weapon and realises what had previously just been a science fiction fantasy .
Airborne laser : The Boeing Jumbo Jet is modified to shoot down ballistic missiles as it flies at 40,000ft 1 ) Telescope inside nose turret focuses laser beam on missile 2 ) Where the laser sits .
It is made from advanced material to reduce its weight 3 ) The Beam control system spots and tracks the target then decides the strength of the laser beam 4 ) Management station
5 ) Helps track the target and decide range 6 ) Laser beam weakens and destroys missile
Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan controversially proposed 30 years ago having lasers in space to bring down missiles .
Iran and North Korea could now be forced to alter their missile programmes to make them faster and to look at how to counter the laser beams .
Aviation experts
Boeing provide the airframe for the plane , which is a modified 747 jumbo jet .
Aerospace and defence contractor Northrop Grumman produce the high - energy laser and Lockheed Martin are developing the beam and fire control system .
' This was the first directed energy lethal intercept demonstration against a liquid - fuel boosting ballistic missile target from an airborne platform , ' the U.S. MDA said .
It added : ' The revolutionary use of directed energy is very attractive for missile defence , with the potential to attack multiple targets at the speed of light at a range of hundreds of kilometres and at a low cost per intercept attempt compared to current technologies . '
The test took place at Point Mugu's Naval Air Warfare Center - Weapons Division Sea Range off Ventura in California .
MDA did not say what the range was .
Work on the system has been going on for around 10 years and has cost more than $ 1 billion .
Until now , the laser beams have managed to hit stationary targets from stationary platforms but direction one from a plane at a moving target is a huge leap forward .
Critics claim the system may not be practical during an actual war and last year the programme was scaled back to one plane by the defence secretary Robert Gates .
Defence analyst John Pike told The Guardian this week 's test is unlikely to change his mind .
' Gates seemed to believe that therw as no prospect of the plane engaging targets at ranges of several hundred kilometres , and that engagements at ranges of less than 100 kilometres were not militarily interesting .'
Sometimes it ’s hard not to hate East Van — not because of the mountains of dog shit , the stench caused by the Westcoast Reduction Rendering plant , or the fact that the back alleys are treated as condom depositories .
No , what makes East Van a drag is the rent - a- protesters who choose to live there .
Three hundred or so came out Friday morning to protest the Olympic torch run .
Their message ?
“ I hate the Olympics , and therefore you should too . ”
Actually , that ’s not entirely accurate .
Their initial march down Commercial Drive had many messages .
The big one found them chanting “ No Olympics on stolen Native land . ”
That they are all living on stolen Native land seems to be something that they manage to conveniently overlook on a day - to - day basis .
One 50 - something dude who looked like something Tom Waits ’s alley cat dragged in decided to mix this up a bit by informing the many parents on hand with children that “ The Olympics will turn your kids into cheaters . ”
Thanks for that enlightening observation .
Others yelled “ No Olympics on the Drive . ”
And the protesters got their way , in the process flipping a giant double bird to the couple thousand people who were actually looking forward to a once - in - a - lifetime sighting of the Olympic torch .
When the protesters set up a barbed wire and concrete barricade at Venables and Commercial , the torch relay was diverted .
Those who manage to live and work in the neighbourhood without acting like a bunch of flaming , fun - ruining a - holes stood around waiting for something that never happened , and then had to turn around and go home with their kids .
There ’s nothing wrong with protesting .
Is it really asking too much to not ruin things for everyone ?
Do you see the rest of Vancouver staging protests that prevent you from entering your favourite patchouli shop ?
Do we show up at the Rickshaw every time Propagandhi is playing , screaming “ No concerts on stolen Indian land ” ?
No .
Because normal people understand there is nothing more ignorant than shoving your opinion down the throats of others .
In the future , East Vancouver , feel free to scream about everything from the Olympic overruns to the war in Iraq to the fact there are no organic iced soy - milk coffee lattes in the food co-op .
But please , do it from the curb .
Or Grandview Park .
Or better yet from a barge in the middle of English Bay .
That way you wo n’t be standing on stolen Indian land , ruining everything for the rest of us .

More companies could go bust if they fail to plug the gap in their pension funds .
That is the warning from a firm of leading pensions experts , which comes just over a week after the UK arm of magazine Reader 's Digest went into administration under a large pension burden .
Readers Digest UK , which was founded in 1938 , was for decades a successful magazine with readers all over the world .
But the group 's pension deficit hit £ 125 m and a deal could not be reached to pay it off .
Around 1,000 members on the firm 's pension plan are still waiting to hear how they will fund their retirement .
Not alone The Reader 's Digest story has reignited fears about the safety of pensions for millions of employees relying on schemes with big deficits .
And pensions consultants Lane , Clarke and Peacock say it is a real possibility that the same thing could happen to other firms .
No way am I going to pay into a pension again
Mark Walsh
" They 're struggling in the aftermath of the credit crunch and the financial crisis with their ongoing business and at the same time the pension trustees are saying we need more money , " warns senior partner Bob Scott .
" This is going to have an impact on company balance sheets , on their profits and their cash flow .
" I 'm sure there 'll be some companies who as a result will go the same way as Reader 's Digest , with members getting lower pensions . "
Unclear future Mark Walsh , from Cardiff , told the BBC about how he lost his job and his pension last year when the company he worked for went bust , which he believes was partly due to its huge pension deficit .
He had been paying into his final salary pension for 15 years but is now unsure about how he 'll fund his retirement .
Reader 's Digest reignited fears about the safety of pensions " You plan for your future , you plan for your retirement and luckily I 've got a few more years to try and save for that but I 'm going to lose a lot of money in the 15 years I paid into it , " says Mr Walsh .
" I know the pension we had was a very good pension . "
There are a number of big - name firms who have been in the news because their pension fund deficits are too high .
British Airways , BT and BAE Systems are all known to have large pension shortfalls and though none of these firms are about to fail , experts believe the coming years will be difficult .
" Companies are having problems with their final salary pension schemes because profits have got squeezed as the economy 's turned down and we 've moved into recession , " says Tom McPhail from Hargreaves Landsdown .
" They 're also finding that because of accounting standards , improved life expectancy , falling investment returns , all of these factors have created holes in the pension schemes and these companies do n't have the money to fill those holes . "
' Once bitten ' Mr Walsh has now found another job but is unsure about investing in a pension again .
" No way am I going to pay into a pension again .
I 've been bitten once and I would n't want that to happen again , " he says .
" In these difficult times I 'm going to have to look at alternatives for my future .
" I do n't know what I 'm going to get out of this pension when I retire , I know I 'm probably going to have to work longer . "
With around 90 % of final salary pension schemes now in deficit , the worry is that the era of generous retirement plans for employees is over .

Las Vegas , Nevada ( CNN ) -- Toshiba on Wednesday unveiled a " smart " TV the company claims will convert 2 - D signals into high - resolution 3 - D programming .
The ZX900 Series Cell TV models , available with 55 - inch and 65 - inch screens , will go on sale in the United States later this year .
Pricing was not announced .
Toshiba says the LED TV will have the capability to take any 2 - D content , including sports broadcasts , movies and video games , and convert it into 3 - D in real time .
" It 's unlike anything that 's out there , " said vice president of marketing Scott Ramirez during Toshiba 's press event at the 2010 International Consumer Electronics Show .
" This is the new ' it ' TV .
It 's the one everyone is going to be talking about . "
The TV's biggest strength is a multimedia processing chip previously used in advanced PCs and high - end gaming consoles .
Toshiba claims its Cell TVs will have 143 times the processing power available in current TV models , although that boast was hard to immediately verify .
With many manufacturers unveiling 3 - D and " connected " TVs at CES this week , Toshiba will have stiff competition for the " it " TV title .
But its ambitious Cell TV tries hard to offer something for everyone :
Like many new or next - generation televisions , Cell TV will allow you to transfer media files from your PC onto the TV's hard drive so that you can display photos and home videos on its screen .
The TV's Internet connection will offer access to streaming content from such partners as Netflix and Pandora .
Finally , Cell TV will also work as a video phone , but with much higher picture quality than most simple webcams .
" You 're going to look crystal clear at 55 inches , " said Ramirez .
In other TV news from CES Wednesday , Sharp unveiled something it called " quad pixel " technology that it claims will change the way TV consumers see color .
Sharp 's new Aquos LED models add a fourth color -- yellow -- to the traditional red - blue - green trio of primary colors , which the company says will enable it to display more than a trillion different colors .
Rapidly melting credibility
Q : Recently , a U.N. scientific report was found to have included a false conclusion about the melting of Himalayan glaciers .
That followed the release of stolen e-mails last year , which showed climate scientists commiserating over problems with their data .
Is there a broader meaning in these two incidents , and should they cause the public to be more skeptical about the underlying science of climate change ?
You can't call them isolated incidents now that they are coming in droves .
It is clear that global warming science has been hijacked by a subset of researchers who have crossed the line into advocacy and alarmism .
The cache of climategate e-mails alone reveals a number of scandals - key researchers and institutions manipulating temperature data to gin up a bigger warming trend , refusing to allow independent researchers to see the raw data , and strategizing to keep skeptical views out of the scientific literature and official reports .
Climategate is just beginning to unfold .
Now , the UN's vaunted 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report turns out to contain a whopper .
The report describes as " very high " the likelihood that continued global warming will cause the glaciers in Himalayan Mountains to disappear by 2035 if not sooner .
Amazingly , it turns out that the source of this claim is an unsupported statement of one researcher that appeared in a magazine article .
Worse yet , the IPCC report 's editors knew full well that the assertion was based on speculation rather than peer reviewed science , and in fact it was disputed by several scientists when it appeared in early drafts .
Nonetheless , it was left in for political reasons .
Similar shenanigans appear to have gone on with the IPCC 's claim that damage from hurricanes , floods and other natural disasters has worsened because of global warming .
Like the Himalayan glacier melt assertion , it was based on the claim of a single researcher who had not published it in the scientific literature , and who now disassociates himself from the way it was used in the IPCC report .
Indeed , when he did publish the study , he concluded that there was " insufficient evidence " of a link between warming and natural disaster damage .
There is a clear pattern with these revelations .
It 's the very scariest claims -- rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers threatening a billion people with flooding and then with drought , an increase in Katrina - scale disasters , and others - that are the ones on the shakiest ground .
Virtually everything the public has been told about global warming that sounds terrifying is not true , and what is true falls well short of being terrifying .
There is a reason why the gloom and doom , however dubious and unscientific , keeps getting advanced by those who support an expansive global warming agenda .
Without such hype , the threat of global warming does not justify the multi-trillion dollar costs and multi-million job losses of attempts to deal with it .
There is another lesson from Glaciergate -- it is high time to retire the distinction between the " skeptics " and the " consensus science . "
All along , several so - called skeptics have complained about the Himalayan hyperbole .
As is typical , they were denigrated as outliers or even kooks for doing so .
As recently as a few weeks ago , Rajendra Pachauri , chair of the IPCC , derided such critiques as " voodoo science , " until he reluctantly had to admit they were true .
By now , the skeptics have proven to be right about way too much , and the putative " consensus science " wrong about way too much , for the labels to make any sense .
In fact , if there are additional revelations like Glaciergate ( and it looks like claims of global warming devastating the Amazon rainforest may be next ) , it might make more sense for the labels to be reversed .

A ruby believed to be valued at £ 11 m and used to support an insolvent Shropshire construction firm has been sold for £ 8,000 .
The " Gem of Tanzania " was entered as one of Wrekin Construction 's assets in 2007 to help prop up its balance sheet .
In 2009 it went into administration when the Royal Bank of Scotland withdrew its services .
It then emerged the stone 's valuation had been forged .
First - home buyer housing affordability crashed in the final three months of 2009 , as would - be purchasers of homes confronted higher interest rates and surging prices .
The affordability index 's slide accelerated 18.4 per cent in the December quarter , following a 3.3 per cent fall in the September quarter , according to the Housing Industry Association and Commonwealth Bank , which compiled the data .
The index dropped from 147.1 points in the September quarter , to 120.1 points in the December quarter .
The median monthly mortgage payments in that time jumped to $ 2505 from $ 2087 .
With interest rates expected to rise from their current 3.75 per cent level , surging demand from international investors and a slow growth of new construction , affordability is expected to continue to suffer in coming months , the report said .

Ah , another day , another horribly misguided anti-anarchist post from the Barefoot Bum who seemingly simply refuses to even listen to what anarchists propose before criticizing Anarchism .
It ’s kind of sad really , especially seeing that it ’s someone who wishes to pass himself as a radical intellectual and yet is too stubborn to know his enemy and rather prefers to imagine what their position is and counter that .
It ’s starts to feel as if he purposefully avoids knowledge just so that he cannot be accused of willful strawmanning .
But one cannot avoid pointing out that this kind of behaviour goes far beyond simple misunderstanding , and rather points out a stubborn unwillingness to understand the other position .
This is unfortunately only exaggerated when one is closed to all dialogue and would rather close his ears while shouting at the wind .
Still , it does seem that when sufficiently demolished , TBB just might realize how egregiously wrong he is and jump to another strawman .
At best , one can expect him to eventually run out of strawmen .
At worst , this might serve to prevent someone who does not know better from being taken in by this kind of nonsense .
So , without further ado , lets take a look at the arguments put forward in this article .
First of all anarchism is criticized for not having a sufficiently succinct definition like “ Communism ” which he mistakenly defines as governmental control of capital .
One can provide quite a lot of descriptions of Anarchism but you cannot understand the sociopolitical system from just a description .
That requires either reading , or a discussion with actual Anarchists and you cannot do the latter by acting like a twat .
Nevertheless , one can describe Anarchism as egalitarianism via prevention of concentration of political or economical power .
The replacement of hierarchical control with individual voluntarism and the replacement of competition as the driving force of progress with cooperation .
As TBB said , the devil is in the details but fundamentally anarchism is predicated on the idea that distributed capital is order more effective than concentrated capital and that self - determination and mutual aid allows humans to achieve personal happiness that is orders higher than authoritarian top - down management can ever achieve .
TBB then moves to wonder what anarchists mean when they say that they “ oppose authority ” which is something that indeed needs clarification .
But if one actually read what Anarchists had to say about this , they should n’t really have any confusion on this issue .
This is really not a subject that is easy to explain , nor does it spring up from the definition of anarchism or from sound - bites one heard in a forum discussion and unfortunately that is precisely what TBB is doing and then wondering why it makes no sense .
Anarchists recognise very well the distinctions of “ authority ” and are very clear on what exactly they oppose .
In the words of Colin Ward :
“ You can be in authority , or you can be an authority , or you can have authority .
The first derives from your rank in some chain of command , the second derives special knowledge , and the third from special wisdom .
But knowledge and wisdom are not distributed in order of rank , and they are no one person ’s monopoly in any undertaking .
The fantastic inefficiency of any hierarchical organisation — any factory , office , university , warehouse or hospital — is the outcome of two almost invariable characteristics .
One is that the knowledge and wisdom of the people at the bottom of the pyramid finds no place in the decision - making leadership hierarchy of the institution .
Frequently it is devoted to making the institution work in spite of the formal leadership structure , or alternatively to sabotaging the ostensible function of the institution , because it is none of their choosing .
The other is that they would rather not be there anyway : they are there through economic necessity rather than through identification with a common task which throws up its own shifting and functional leadership .
” Perhaps the greatest crime of the industrial system is the way it systematically thwarts the investing genius of the majority of its workers . ”
It is blatantly obvious , when one retains intellectual honesty and does even a light attempt at discovering what anarchists oppose , that it is hierarchical authority .
We oppose the authority which comes from people being in control only in lieu of them having more power than others .
In very short , we oppose coerced authority .
Either passively or actively coerced , that is either authority enforced by force of arms , or authority imposed by taking away all other choices .
TBB proceeds to doubt wether coercion can be imposed as it ’s always “ within society ” but that is blatantly false as any society which has been invaded by another should make abundantly clear .
He also argued :
The anarchist opposition to “ hierarchy ” does seems really nonsensical ; a small group that exercised coercive power should be objectionable even if it were organized other than hierarchically .
For example , the capitalist ruling class employs hierarchical structures , but is not itself organized hierarchically .
This is irrelevant , since the capitalist coercive power can only be maintained by hierarchical control .
Taking away hierarchical control would necessarily require the abolition of capitalism and therefore the capitalist class .
In short , it is not possible to have a “ ruling elite ” without hierarchical authority , ie someone to rule over .
Anarchists of course do not aim to abolish all coercion , as that is simply impossible .
At the most basic level , we still need to use coercion to prevent the imposition of coercion .
Eg , we need to physically prevent someone beating up people who will not become his slaves .
It is the use of coercion that matters and how it is applied and anarchists argue that using coercion to form coercive hierarchies is bad , because hierarchical coercion is bad for humans .
The reasons why this is so , is a lengthy subject for another day .
Furthermore , his argument that distributed coercion is worse than hierarchical coercion is of course pure nonsense .
Finally , he also posits the following “ paradox ”
Another important consideration is that there are intrinsic variations in individuals and in the organization of more - or - less “ voluntary ” associations .
These variations can combine naturally to afford some groups more power to effect their desires than other groups .
And , of course , one natural desire is for more power .
Not only does power naturally concentrate , but the concentration of power forms a positive feedback loop .
In order to keep power distributed , some group would have to have the authority — the coercive power — to block or reverse natural concentrations of power .
Concentration of power is necessary to stop concentration of power , a nifty paradox .
If there ’s one thing that an anarchist who has had to debate quite a lot has learned to look out for , it ’s the common fallacy from human nature .
There ’s key words and phrases which should automatically ring alarm bells to the heads of everyone reading such arguments as they attempt to call out to previous assumptions of the reader about “ facts of human nature ” and work from there .
Such is the argument TBB is doing by saying “ And , of course , one natural desire is for more power ” where he does n’t attempt to base his arguments on anything other than a very shaky assumptions of what is a “ natural desire ” for humans .
Once you challenge this , the whole “ paradox ” topples down like a house of cards .
There is in fact no reason for humans to form coercive authority in order to prevent coercive authority .
We can firstly prevent hierarchies from forming by not enabling them ( which is where the abolition of private property comes in ) and by distributedly coercing those who would impose them .
But it is not tyranny to oppose tyranny .
TBB would like us to believe that humans naturally would try to accumulate power and that groups of people will somehow manage to do this within themselves before extending over others .
This of course will not work as within the group , those who are in the lower rungs of the hierarchy will soon rebel and demand equality .
This “ natural movement or humans within a positive loop ” that TBB asserts is nothing more than an unrealistic idea based on assuming a human who acts however you ’d like and on the pre-existence of a system which would naturally select for such a behaviour ( such as any propertarian system ) .
While I was writing this , TBB also wrote an article against voluntary co-operation , unfortunately filled with the same kind of misunderstandings of what Anarchism stands for .
This is a perfect example of why it makes no sense to argue against a theory , any theory , without first bothering to at least understand what that theory suggests in the first place .
It is unfortunate to say this but TBB is only following in the proud tradition of Marxist - Leninists ( I ’m certain he ’ll reject this classification too and call it slanderous ) who go out and make strawman after strawman as they attempt to make people pre-emptively dismiss Anarchism .

* Morton becomes finance minister , replacing Evans
* Liepert moves to energy , replacing Knight
* Budget announcement set for February 9 ( Adds quotes from premier , political rival )
CALGARY , Alberta , Jan 13 ( Reuters ) - Alberta ’s premier , facing an onslaught of criticism over his handling of the oil - rich Canadian province ’s finances and energy policy , replaced the ministers in charge of those departments on Wednesday to try to win back support from conservative voters .
Premier Ed Stelmach ’s cabinet shuffle had been expected as his Progressive Conservative party government has suffered dwindling support in the province that is among the largest foreign suppliers of oil and gas to the United States .
Stelmach said the changes were necessary as economic conditions have changed dramatically in the last 12 months .
“ In order for us to respond , we require a new focus and we also require a new team with expertise and experience , ” he told reporters .
But voters in the province of 3.5 million people have become increasingly disgruntled after he ran Alberta ’s first deficit in more than a decade .
Meanwhile , his relations with the powerful energy industry have worsened and popular support for the party has been shifting to the fledgling , further right - of - center , Wildrose Alliance .
Among key changes , Ted Morton , who was minister of sustainable resource development , becomes finance minister , replacing Iris Evans .
Morton is seen as one of the government ’s most socially conservative members .
Ron Liepert , who was health minister , becomes minister of energy , replacing Mel Knight .
Liepert is a onetime telecom executive and public relations consultant .
Stelmach and Knight have faced years of attacks from the oil industry for high - profile changes to the energy royalty structure , then frequent tinkering to try to stave off a huge drop in drilling .
The premier said he realized that market conditions have changed , especially in the natural gas industry , where the development of shale gas in the United States and British Columbia has led to forecasts of booming supplies and low prices .
The government had begun a review of its competitiveness among energy jurisdictions , which points to more changes in the fiscal regime .
“ We have to move the industry towards unconventional gas .
Shale gas requires new investment .
We ’re partners with the industry , ” Stelmach said .
“ We own the resource but they ’re the ones who put up all the critical dollars and those dollars are at risk unless you have a very good competitiveness position . ”
After winning one of the largest majorities in Alberta in 2008 , Stelmach has struggled to fend off critics attacking his fiscal record .
Under Stelmach , the province ’s long streak of multibillion - dollar budget surpluses ended .
He blamed the recession and weak oil and gas prices .
The government aims to be back in the black within three years .
He said on Wednesday he plans to announce his next budget on Feb . 9 .
Wildrose Alliance leader Danielle Smith said the cabinet remains packed with party loyalists and the shuffle will not change the government ’s course .
The Conservative party has been in power in Alberta since 1971 , making it one of North America ’s oldest political dynasties .

The Reverse Geocache™ Puzzle
[ Author 's note :
This post is the first in a real - life story that ultimately took a full year and four chapters ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) to tell .
Read them all , then browse through the other surprising puzzle box stories that have popped up along the way . ]
Early this summer , the friend who first introduced me to Arduino amazed us with the news that he was moving to France to get married .
Once I recovered from the surprise , it occurred to me that putting together some sort of Arduino - based wedding present might be a uniquely fitting thanks for his years of friendship and for helping get me started in this delightful enterprise .
And so after weighing several ideas — I did n’t fancy adding some ugly techno - junk to the pretty collection of tea cozies and china sets —
I finally settled on building the device I describe here : a puzzle box that wo n’t open until it is taken to a certain location .
To better understand my conception , let ’s fast forward and imagine the gift opening .
The new couple , freshly back from their honeymoon , remove the wrapping to reveal a book - sized wooden box elaborately carved with elephant images .
( I did n’t carve it ; I bought it that way at World Market . )
Mounted into the lid , perhaps incongruously , are an illuminated button , a small display , and a mysterious module that sharp - eyed readers might recognize as a GPS .
There ’s also some kind of connector tucked away on the box ’s left side .
More about that later .
What do they make of all this ?
It ’s hard to guess , but naturally I imagine they might try to open it up and take a look inside .
When they do , however , they find the lid stuck tight — it seems to be latched from the inside .
Will they push the button ?
Pretty buttons are awfully hard to resist , so let ’s assume so .
The blue display fires up and displays a friendly , personal greeting :
Bonsoir , famille Immel !
This is attempt 1 of 50 .
Huh ?
Now they do n’t know this yet , but the box ’s embedded electronics require a good GPS fix – something that ’s probably hard to come by inside a Parisian apartment .
And so the display flashes “ SEEKING SIGNAL ” for a couple of minutes and gives up .
No signal acquired ...
Powering off ...
Now my hope is that they ’ll realize they need to take the box outdoors or near a window .
Is that a stretch ?
I do n’t think so .
My friend is a patient fellow with an engineering background , so I expect he will at least try moving it before throwing it against the wall or chiseling off the hinges .
Let ’s assume , then , that they go outside and push the button again .
This time the series of messages is different :
This is attempt 2 of 50 .
Distance 391 km * Access Denied * Powering off ...
Hmm .
What does “ Distance 391 km ” mean ?
“ Access Denied ” suggests that getting inside the box is indeed the objective of all this button pushing .
Just for fun , let ’s try again .
This is attempt 3 of 50 .
Distance 391 km * Access Denied * Powering off ...
Uh oh .
We seem to be consuming our limited supply of “ attempts ” .
The “ No signal ” problem seems to be solved , but the message “ Distance 391 km ” remains puzzling .
Does the box know its own location ?
Is there something 391 kilometers away ?
London ?
The Hague ?
A circle of that radius drawn around Paris intersects quite a few interesting places in France , England , Holland , Switzerland , and Germany .
Knowing my friend , he will eventually think to move the box to a new location to see how the message changes .
Let ’s imagine , then , that he hops in his car and motors down the A11 to the famous city of Le Mans , about two hours to the southwest .
After a brief tour of the cathedral and a snack at a sidewalk café , he pulls the elephant box from his backpack and pushes the button again .
This time the display is once again slightly different :
This is attempt 4 of 50 .
Distance 226 km * Access Denied * Powering off ...
Aha .
We seem to be getting somewhere .
If we are in fact looking for a specific place , it would appear that it is 391 kilometers from Paris but only 226 from Le Mans .
As you can see by the map in Figure 3 , there are only two places on earth that meet these criteria – a spot just off the northern Brittany coast , and a rural area in the southwest near Bordeaux .
And , as my friend is aware , one of these can be quickly eliminated simply by taking a third “ reading ” in a new spot .
I suspect that from here things will proceed relatively quickly .
My friend will triangulate that the “ magic spot ” is Île - de - Bréhat , a tiny island just a short ferry ride off the northern coast of Bretagne .
If and when the couple do bring the box here , they ’ll be greeted with a congratulatory “ Access Granted ! ” and the whir of a motor announcing that the treasure inside is about to be finally revealed !
Hardware
The electronics for this project are fairly simple .
At the core , of course , is the Arduino , surrounded by a handful of devices that talk harmoniously through various native and third - party libraries .
The peripherals are wired to a custom “ shield ” that I soldered together .
The shield design makes the system modular and easy to disassemble for moving .
Power is provided by 4 AA lithium batteries mounted in the box ’s interior .
Major components
1 Arduino Duemilanove
1 USGlobalSat EM - 406A GPS module
1 8×2 blue backlight HD44780 LCD
1 Hitec HS - 311 servo motor
1 illuminated pushbutton
1 low voltage Pololu power switch
1 2.5 mm female DC power connector
1 Adafruit Arduino prototype shield
1 ornamental box
Minor components
1 severed chopstick used as latching dowel
3 #14 eyelet screws
1 Battery pack with 4xAA lithium batteries
Various mounting screws and glue
Wire , headers , solder , and other circuit connecting items
I designed this project to last a long time .
The batteries are locked inside the box and ca n’t be replaced if they run down — not while the puzzle remains unsolved , anyway — so it ’s important to conserve power .
That ’s why a given “ session ” lasts at most 2 - 3 minutes before the system powers off .
Furthermore , the owner is allowed only 50 attempts to discover the box ’s secret , so the active lifespan of the batteries need be no more than about 150 minutes .
Between sessions , the electronics draw virtually no power and should last idle for years .
The secret to this power conservation is the clever little Pololu switch , which gives a circuit the ability to completely turn itself off through software .
When you push the button , it latches and distributes power to the system .
When the sketch decides it ’s time to shut down — either because it can’t find a GPS signal or it ’s not close enough to the target — it simply brings the Pololu ’s power control pin high , cutting power .
In this “ off ” state the switch draws just 0.01 microamps .
Like most GPS units , the EM - 406A generates a stream of NMEA position data .
This stream enters the Arduino via a “ soft ” serial port managed by my NewSoftSerial library .
The NMEA data is parsed into latitude / longitude using TinyGPS , a popular library I built especially for this project .
If the GPS is getting a good fix , the box can determine its location within 10 meters and , through a simple calculation , how close it is to the target .
The display is an HD44780 - compatible device controlled by the Arduino LiquidCrystal library .
I wanted to incorporate some visual effects like flashing and scrolling , so my sketch contains several custom display routines .
These were carefully written so as not to block the all - important serial input stream coming from the GPS .
How to Sell the Harry Potter Ebooks
Gaunt's Ring
Riddle 's Diary
Hufflepuff's Cup
Slytherin's Locket
Ravenclaw's Diadem
Harry Potter Himself
The Snake , Nagini
PROBLEM : The people who wrote or published the Harry Potter books are not making any money off the ebook versions , and yet the ebook versions are out there and available anywhere you choose to look .
I read the last three novels on my laptop .
In the case of " The Deathly Hallows , " I read it even before it was available for sale in stores .
Harry Potter ebooks are slightly easier to steal than condoms or gum , and just as disposable .
PROBLEM : Ebooks are dangerous and untested .
They may be good for struggling unknowns , but for those who do brisk and cultish business , there is no reason to dilute the strength of what works with fly - by - night American fads that could tarnish a good British brand , which is why Rowling has been dead - set against ebooks thus far .
PROBLEM : Ebooks are mighty unaesthetic .
There is nothing magical about words on a screen , and there is even less that is magical about words on a proprietary corporate See'N'Spell , such as something coded for Google , Amazon , or Apple products .
The ugliness of ebooks are only exceeded by their weird inconveniences .
There are thirty different formats , and thirty different companies with whom to do business , each of whom have rules and restrictions about who can buy their products and how .
It is anarchy , and you do n't sail Spanish treasure galleons or silk - laden Black Ships through uncharted waters .
PROBLEM : People are much more willing to buy Harry Potter movies than Harry Potter books .
But those who start with one are also likely to consume the other .
If we are trying to create more readers in the world , how do we make it easier for pathological film fans to engage with the printed word ?*** Harry Potter 's universe is a world loaded with objects of deep significance .
From Sorting
Hats to wands to giant mechanical eggs that scream bloody murder unless you open them underwater , nearly everything that exists at Hogwarts does something magical .
Even the most benign watering can can be turned into a portkey -- an object that , when touched , transports a wizard or witch instantaneously across temporal space .
In addition to Rowling 's essential animism , the entire plot of Harry Potter centers on locating and destroying seven powerful objects called horcruxes , each of which contains a slice of the the partitioned soul of Lord Voldemort .
Seven books .
Seven horcruxes .
Harry Potter 's world is one in which the material has been utterly infused with the magical .
Our world may be dead and cold , but Harry Potter 's world hums with warm electric energy .
Which leads me to the suggestion that the Harry Potter ebooks ought to be the first high - profile ebooks sold as seeds : digital sculptures embedded with flash memory that can then be directly connected to a computer or ereader .
See " Wunderkammer Seeds : A Fantasia " for more about seeds ... Scholastic could sell these sculptures loaded with every available ebook format , including a program that plays a special , illuminated Scholastic version ( with art and music ) .
Additionally , Warner Brothers could embed the movies and computer games into the sculpture so that all things Officially Harry Potter are together at last in one touchable place .
Each sculpture would be a seed for all digital Harry Potter information .
Collectors could eventually disseminate this information or not , but first they must purchase something built to last .
Rowling would be able to be update the seeds as necessary from the cloud .
Each seed would be something worth owning ( and giving ) , and could even contain repositories for fan art , fan fiction , and fan mashups .
Each seed could also contain the blueprints for Espresso Book Machine editions , complete with multiple covers and multiple text sizes .
I like the narrative cohesion of selling the Harry Potter seeds as the seven horcruxes , but there are some artistic difficulties , such as how you would sell a reproduction of Harry Potter himself ( his wand , perhaps ? ) or of the snake Nagini .
Perhaps it would be easier to sell each book as a different totem representative of each novel .
I also like the idea of selling each seed as an orb from the Hall of Prophecy in which there is a fixed sculpture of a scene from each book carved beneath the frosted glass .
If we must have ebooks , why do they have to be washed - out ugly text files sold in graphing calculators ?
Why can't we make magic ?
Mullet power : John Inzer deadlifts 780 lbs. at 165 lbs. bodyweight .
( Photo : Powerlifting USA )
Pavel Tsatsouline , former Soviet Special Forces physical training instructor , has made a name for himself in the world of strength .
He wrote the below article , outlining the simple routine of Russian Master of Sports , Alexander Faleev , for Built magazine , which folded before publication .
Pavel contacted me to publish the piece here , and I am pleased to offer it to you as an exclusive .
Though I often suggest training to failure for maximal size gains ( see “ Geek to Freak : How I Gained 34 lbs. in 4 Weeks ” ) , the pre-failure approach detailed here is excellent for maximal strength development , and the repetitions can be further reduced for relative strength ( per-lb. bodyweight ) development .
Enter Pavel …
Total read time : 12 minutes .
Read time for routine only : 7 minutes .
Pavel :
I have read a book that has made an impression : The 4 - Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss .
The 4 - Hour Workweek is not a dubious get - rich - quick scheme but a guide to ultimate productivity through ruthless elimination of non-essentials .
“ Doing less meaningless work , so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance , is NOT laziness , ” states the author .
“ This is hard to accept , because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity .
Few people choose to ( or are able to ) measure the results of their actions and thus measure their contribution in time . ”
It is no surprise that Russia has borne a number of Ferriss - type strength and muscle building programs , mercilessly eliminating the non-essentials and delivering extraordinary gains .
One is Alexander Faleev ’s system that has gained many followers among Russian muscle heads in the last four years .
Comrade Faleev dabbled with powerlifting for seven or eight years , then took a few years off .
He poured over years of his training logs looking for what worked and came back to the barbell with a vengeance .
In just six months , he reached the coveted Master of Sports level in powerlifting .
Faleev has summed up his approach as “ Nothing extra ! ”
In one sentence , it is about doing only four things : the squat , the bench , the deadlift , and competing regularly .
That ’s it .
The system the Russian had developed for his strength and size breakthrough could have come out of The 4 - Hour Workweek .
Among Tim Ferriss ’ tools for getting the most out of life is Pareto ’s law .
The essence of the law is that 80 % of all results come from 20 % of the efforts .
Applied to muscle and strength , it means , if most gains will come from the three powerlifts , why waste your time and energy on curls and close - grip benches ?
Before I will move on to the nuts and bolts of the training regimen I will address your objections .
I can read your mind : “ But I am not a powerlifter , and I do n’t want to look like one ! ”
The sport of powerlifting ( PL ) has an unfair image of refrigerator - sized men whose faces turn red from blood pressure when they bend over to tie their shoes — or rather try to bend over and get stopped by an enormous “ uni-ab ” .
To say that all PLers look like that is akin to stating that all runners are thin and wiry .
Look at photos of powerlifters in lighter weight classes .
They are as hard as a rock , and many are ripped — without curls and cable crossovers .
Take Texan John
Inzer who held the world record in the deadlift for years , 780 pounds at 165 pounds of bodyweight or Ukrainian Oleksandr Kutcher , who recently beat that record with 793 pounds .
These guys look more like gymnasts than refrigerators .
Tim : Oleksandr Kutcher pulls a light 694 lbs. and then needs chamomile tea .
Faleev ’s 80/20 Routine
5 x 5 Progression :
For beginners , Faleev offers a straightforward progressive overload workout with 5 sets of 8 reps .
Eventually you are supposed to advance to 5 x 5 .
In my opinion , you should go straight to 5 x 5 .
Sets of five are the meat and potatoes of strength training .
Start with a conservative weight .
If you manage five reps in all five sets , next time add 10 pounds and start over .
Not 5 pounds , and definitely not 2 , but 10 .
For reasons that are outside of the scope of this article , Malibu Ken and Barbie jumps with tiny plates are a waste of time .
Most likely you will not bag all the fives on your first workout with the new weight .
Perhaps you will get 5 , 5 , 5 , 4 , 3 .
No problem , stay with the poundage until you get all 5×5 .
Your second workout might be 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 4 , and your third of fourth should get you to 5 x 5 .
Slap on another pair of “ nickels ” ( 5 - lb. plates ) and work your way up to 5 x 5 again .
According to Faleev , the above progression will add 110 - 175 pounds to your max in each of the three powerlifts in one year , provided you are fairly new to the game .
Deadlift 1 x per week ; Squat and Bench 2 x per week
You will be deadlifting once a week and squatting and benching twice a week , once heavy and once light for the latter two .
Your light days are for honing technique , not for burning out your muscles with high reps .
Do 5 sets of 4 reps ( 5 x 4 ) with weights that are 80 % of the heavy day’s .
For instance , if you did 5 x 5 with 200 on your heavy day , stay with 160 for 5 x 4 on your light day .
That ’s it !
The key to the program ’s success is in doing less .
The Russian recommends the following schedule :
Monday –heavy squat ( SQ )
Tuesday –heavy benchpress ( BP )
Wednesday –heavy deadlift ( DL )
Thursday – light SQ
Friday –light BP
Saturday –off
Sunday –off
If training five days is not an option , four will do :
Monday –heavy SQ
Tuesday –heavy BP
Wednesday –heavy DL
Thursday –off
Friday – light SQ , light BP
Saturday –off
Sunday –off
Not ideal , but if you have to cram your training into three days :
Monday – heavy SQ
Tuesday –off
Wednesday –heavy BP , light SQ
Thursday – off
Friday – heavy DL , light BP
Saturday – off
Sunday – off
Failure and Rest Intervals
Never train to failure !
Do n’t attempt a rep unless you are 100 % sure you will make it .
Ideally , keep one extra rep in the bank .
“ Save your strength for the next set , ” insists Faleev .
Do n’t get greedy .
Practice one lift per workout , stretch , and get out .
Faleev stresses that you must wrap up each strength workout with static stretches .
“ The benefits of stretching are enormous .
Stretching can increase your strength by 10 % .
It is a lot . ”
The man explains that “ when you lift a weight your muscles contract .
And after the workout the muscles remain contracted for some time .
The following restoration of the muscles ’ length is what recovery is .
Until the muscle has restored its length , it has not recovered .
Hence he who does not stretch his muscles slows down the recuperation process and retards his gains . ”
Besides , tension and relaxation are the two sides of the same coin , “ if the muscle forgets how to lengthen , it will contract more poorly .
And that is stagnation of strength . ”
Do n’t rush your sets .
Do a couple warm - up sets if you must , then feel free to take 5 min .
and even more between your work sets .
Top power dogs take longer ; 30 min. is not unheard of .
Power loves rest and does not tolerate rushing .
You may feel that you are completely recovered in 2 min .
but take a full 5 anyway .
According to Faleev , an hour is a good number to shoot for in your workout length .
Balanced Development : Biceps and Other Decorations
One common objection is : “ But I will not get a balanced development if do only three exercises !
What about my biceps and my …?! ”
Faleev sticks to his guns : “ For a sharp increase in muscle mass and [ strength ] results you must do only three exercises : the bench press , the squat , and the deadlift … when you deadlift a 550 - pound barbell think what kind of a huge load is born by your biceps , shoulders , traps , and even neck …
When you squat with a 550 - pound barbell , think about the high pressure the athlete ’s abdomen must withstand .
An athlete lifting such weights cannot have weak abs by definition – the midsection is strengthened in the process of training the squat .
If you bench 330 , the muscles of your arms , chest , and the front delts will be so developed , than any bodybuilder will be envious .
One must add an interesting detail–in the bench press it is very important to learn to use the lats when starting the bar off the chest .
Perhaps someone will think of this as a paradox but the bench press develops the back as well , especially the lats . ”
Faleev states than the above numbers , a 550 - pound squat and deadlift and a 330 - pound bench , are “ more than achievable ” if you focus on these exercises and practice them for years .
And if you have not felt your abs when squatting , it only means you have not squatted heavy enough .
“ Bodybuilding is a strength sport .
Do n’t forget it , ” admonishes Faleev .
The only legit reason for additional exercises is correction of a dysfunction or imbalance that puts your health at risk .
An example would be a pronounced discrepancy in the hamstrings ’ flexibility , your knees caving in when you land after a jump , or the failure to activate your butt muscles or “ gluteal amnesia ” .
But diagnosis and correction of such problems is not something you can do on your own or even under the guidance or a personal trainer ; you need a specially trained health professional .
I suggest that you find one through Gray Cook ’s website .
Cook is the country ’s premier sports physical therapist ; in the last Super Bowl both teams were his clients .
Get a tune - up from a professional on his team so you can safely focus on the basics and not do stupid things like extra leg curls “ to balance out my quads ” .
But back to our basics .
Faleev stresses that additional exercises are worse than worthless –- they are harmful because they drain valuable energy that your body could have directed towards spectacular gains in the big three .
“ … get rid of the excesses and just do what is necessary …
When you give up the secondary exercises , you will feel that you are not training enough .
You will be leaving the gym totally fresh .
This is it , the energy for an increase in the load in the basic lifts .
This reserve is what will enable you to ‘ shoot out of the gate ’ ! ”
The above point cannot be emphasized enough ; curls , calf raises , and other miscellaneous non-sense may not feel hard but they drain your adaptive energy !
The Fourth Element : Competition and Parkinson ’s Law
Focus on the lifts that matter is half of Faleev ’s power and muscle equation .
Regularly competing in sanctioned power meets is the other half .
Faleev observes that with a powerlifting meet date looming on the calendar , many an athlete have accomplished more in six months than others have in many years .
In The 4 - Hour Workweek , Tim Ferriss echoes him when he makes use of the Parkinson ’s law to get results faster .
According to this law , a task will take as much time as you will allot for it .
In other words , you will shine under the pressure of an ambitious deadline .
Applied to iron , it means compete , and often !
You will be forced to focus on what matters — your squat , your bench , your deadlift –– rather than fool around with what former Coach Powerlifting Team USA Mark Reifkind calls “ random acts of variety ” .
Subscribe to Powerlifting USA magazine on Amazon .
Find a meet near you three months away , and go for it !
Look for “ raw ” meets that require that you compete without special squat suits , bench shirts , etc. AAU is one of the federations that hosts raw meets .
As the meet approaches , cut back from 5 x 5 to 4 x 4 , 3 x 3 , and finally , a couple of weeks before the competition , 2 x 2 .
Up the poundages accordingly .
After the meet , take a week off , then start over with 5 x 5 .
Faleev stresses that maxing in the gym is dangerous .
Maxing out tests your strength but does not build it .
A max workout in the gym amounts to missing a productive 5 x 5 day that you will never get back .

Tim : 5 x 5 is n’t just for beginners : Johnnie Jackson , one of the few champions in both powerlifting and bodybuilding , demonstrates the deadlift .
I suggest not slamming the plates .
Touch the plates to the floor as if a baby were sleeping in the room .
Faleev offers a formula that will help you estimate your max from your 5 x 5 : multiply that weight by 1.2 .
This is not exact science , but it is much better than those ridiculous charts that claim to calculate your 1 rep max ( 1RM ) from your 10 RM .
Just decide what you want :
The process of enjoying the pump , the burn , and the variety of exercises ?
Or muscles and power ?
Faleev ’s secret of success is so simple , it is easy to ignore : practice nothing but the powerlifts and compete regularly .
Period .
The Russian muscle man walks into the gym , trains one lift , spends a few minutes stretching , and hits the showers .
Done !
Since he dropped all the assistance exercises his progress has been nothing but spectacular .
Ironically , his gym buddies who sweat for hours wasting time on meaningless exercises consider him a slacker .
He does not care , the wily Russkie has the last laugh with his strength and his mass .

Rachel Dolezal , curator of the Human Rights Education Institute in Coeur d’Alene , has also watched the Tea Party movement with trepidation .
Though raised in a conservative family , Ms. Dolezal , who is multiracial , said she could not imagine showing her face at a Tea Party event .
To her , what stands out are the all - white crowds , the crude depictions of Mr. Obama as an African witch doctor and the signs labeling him a terrorist .
“ It would make me nervous to be there unless I went with a big group , ” she said .
The Future
Pam Stout wakes each morning , turns on Fox News , grabs coffee and an Atkins bar , and hits the computer .
She is the hub of a rapidly expanding and highly viral political network , keeping a running correspondence with her 400 members in Sandpoint , state and national Tea Party leaders and other conservative activists .
Mrs. Stout forwards along petitions to impeach Mr. Obama ; petitions to audit the Federal Reserve ; petitions to support Sarah Palin ; appeals urging defiance of any federal law requiring health insurance ; and on and on .
Meanwhile , she and her husband are studying the Constitution line by line .
She has the Congressional switchboard programmed into her cellphone .
“ I just signed up for a Twitter class , ” said Mrs. Stout , 66 , laughing at the improbability of it all .
Yet for all her efforts , Mrs . Stout is gripped by a sense that it may be too little too late .
Yes , there have been victories  including polls showing support for the Tea Party movement  but in her view none of it has diminished the fundamental threat of tyranny , a point underscored by Mr. Obama ’s drive to pass a health care overhaul .
She and her members are becoming convinced that rallies alone will not save the Republic .
They are searching for some larger answer , she said .
They are also waiting for a leader , someone capable of uniting their rebellion , someone like Ms. Palin , who made Sandpoint one of the final stops on her book tour and who has announced plans to attend a series of high - profile Tea Party events in the next few months .
“ We need to really decide where we ’re going to go , ” Mrs . Stout said .
These questions of strategy , direction and leadership were clearly on the minds of Mrs.
Stout ’s members at a recent monthly meeting .

SEATTLE — Keli Carender has a pierced nose , performs improv on weekends and lives here in a neighborhood with more Mexican grocers than coffeehouses .
You might mistake her for the kind of young person whose vote powered President Obama to the White House .
You probably would not think of her as a Tea Party type .
But leaders of the Tea Party movement credit her with being the first .
A year ago , frustrated that every time she called her senators to urge them to vote against the $ 787 billion stimulus bill their mailboxes were full , and tired of wearing out the ear of her Obama - voting fiancé , Ms. Carender decided to hold a protest against what she called the “ porkulus . ”
“ I basically thought to myself : ‘ I have two courses .
I can give up , go home , crawl into bed and be really depressed and let it happen , ’ ” she said this month while driving home from a protest at the State Capitol in Olympia .
“ Or I can do something different , and I can find a new avenue to have my voice get out . ”
This weekend , as Tea Party members observe the anniversary of the first mass protests nationwide , Ms. Carender ’s path to activism offers a lens into how the movement has grown , taking many people who were not politically active — it is not uncommon to meet Tea Party advocates who say they have never voted — and turning them into a force that is rattling both parties as they look toward the midterm elections in the fall .
It sounds like the initial public offering of electric - car maker Tesla is already being greeted with skepticism , but some of the fine print about its plans may give potential investors even greater cause for concern .
A reading of the fine print by Wired 's Autopia blog uncovers some disturbing product - planning news .
To wit , the company 's only product , the first true freeway - capable , mass - produced electric car of the modern age , will go bye - bye next year .
From Autopia :
" We do not plan to sell our current generation Tesla Roadster after 2011 due to planned tooling changes at a supplier for the Tesla Roadster , " the company wrote in the filing .
The Roadster is built by Lotus , so presumably Tesla is talking about changes at the British automaker 's factory in Hethel , England , but we can't confirm that because Tesla spokesman Ricardo Reyes declined to comment .
That will leave the fledging automaker putting all its marbles on getting its electric sedan , the Model S , out the door in 2012 .
Tesla , of all companies , should know something about the delays and unexpected headaches that come with launching a product .
The roadster went through an obstacle course of trouble before it came out .
Thus , 2012 could become 2013 or 2014 -- with no revenue coming in the door .
Again , from Autopia :
" As a result , we anticipate that we may generate limited , if any , revenue from selling electric vehicles after 2011 until the launch of the planned Model S , " the company says in the SEC filing .
That may not be a problem if S production starts on plan and goes off without a hitch , but if Tesla hits any snags , things could get ugly fast — a point it concedes in the filing .
" The launch of the Model S could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited , if any , revenues from sales of our electric vehicles . "
Of course , it does n't hurt that Tesla obtained a $ 465 million loan from the Energy Department to build the Model S and is shopping for factory space in Southern California .
The only ones happy about all of this :
The 1,000 or so Tesla Roadster owners .
Suddenly , their collectible is destined to become even more rare .
Until the discovery of the New World in the late 15th century , Europeans hungered for sugar .
So precious was the commodity that a medieval burgher could only afford to consume one teaspoon of the sweet granules per year .
And even in Europe ’s early Renaissance courts , the wealthy and powerful regarded the refined sweetener as a delicious extravagance .
When Queen Isabella of Castile sought a Christmas present for her daughters , she chose a small box brimming with sugar .
The commodity ’s preciousness came , of course , from its relative scarcity during this period .
Sugar cane — the sole source of the sweetener — only really flourished in hot , humid regions where temperatures remained above 80 degrees Fahrenheit and where rain fell steadily or farmers had ample irrigation .
This ruled out most of Europe .
Moreover , sugar - mill owners required huge quantities of wood to fuel the boiling vats for transforming cane into sugar cones .
By the early 16th century , sugar masters along the southern Mediterranean , from Italy to Spain , struggled to find enough cheap timber .
So European merchants and bankers were delighted by reports they received from Spanish mariners exploring the Caribbean .
Jamaica possessed superb growing conditions for sugar cane , and by 1513 , Spanish farmers in the island ’s earliest European settlement , Sevilla la Nueva , tended fields bristling with the green stalks .
But until very recently , historians and archaeologists largely overlooked the story of these early would - be sugar barons .
Now a Canadian and Jamaican research team led by Robyn Woodward , an archaeologist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , has studied Sevilla la Nueva ’s fledgling sugar industry and excavated its mill .
“ It ’s the earliest known sugar mill in the New World , ” says Woodward .
Woodward first walked the site in 1981 while searching for traces of Christopher Columbus and his fourth expedition : the mariner had spent nearly a year in the immediate region after beaching two of his ships in St. Ann ’s Bay on Jamaica ’s north coast .
Columbus possessed a detailed knowledge of the eastern Atlantic ’s Madeira Island sugar industry — he had married the daughter of a wealthy Madeira sugar grower — and he clearly recognized Jamaica ’s rich potential for growing the crop .
Moreover , at least 60,000 indigenous Taino farmers and fishers lived on the island , a potential pool of forced laborers .
But Columbus died before he could exploit this knowledge .
Instead , it was his son Diego who dispatched some 80 Spanish colonists to the north coast of Jamaica in 1509 .
There the colonists subjugated the Taino , planted sugar cane and corn , and founded Sevilla la Nueva , the island ’s first European settlement that , in spite of its relatively brief history , tells a crucial story about the colonization of the Caribbean .
According to surviving records , the inhabitants of Seville la Nueva did not begin milling sugar until the arrival of their second governor , Francesco de Garay , in 1515 .
Garay , a former slave trader in the Bahamas , had made his fortune in Caribbean gold fields .
He devoted part of this wealth to constructing a mill in Sevilla la Nueva capable of churning out 150 tons of sugar a year for European markets .
He was in the process of building a second mill at the time of his departure for Mexico in 1523 .
Troweling into the sediments , Woodward ’s team uncovered the ruins of Garay ’s large , water - powered sugar mill , complete with a brick - lined tank for holding cane - sugar juice and an ax and a stone block that workers had used for chopping cane .
Almost certainly , says Woodward , Garay chose to house all the heavy equipment in simple , open - sided thatched sheds , as opposed to more permanent brick or stone buildings .
“ This is all very expedient , ” she says .
If Garay had been unable to make a go of it at the site , he could have moved the expensive equipment elsewhere .
Documents strongly suggest that Garay brought 11 enslaved Africans to Seville la Nueva , but excavators found no trace of their existence in the industrial quarter .
Instead , Garay relied heavily on coerced Taino laborers .
Woodward and her colleagues recovered pieces of Taino stone blades littering the ground near the mill , suggesting that the Taino were cutting and processing the tough cane stalks and doing heavy manual labor .
In addition , the Spanish colonists compelled Taino women to prepare traditional indigenous foods , such as cassava bread , on stone griddles .
But while Garay and the colonists worked closely with Taino villagers and dined on native fare , they determinedly kept up Spanish appearances in public .
They made a point , for example , of dining from fine imported Majolica bowls — rather than local Taino pottery — in the industrial quarter .
“ These were Spanish people wanting to show off their Spanishness , ” explains Woodward .
The excavations also reveal much about the grand ambitions of the early Spanish entrepreneurs .
In Sevilla la Nueva ’s industrial quarter , the archaeologists unearthed a massive sculptor ’s workshop littered with nearly 1,000 carved limestone blocks of archangels , griffons and demons — the largest collection of Renaissance sculpture ever discovered in the Americas .
These were destined for the altar of a magnificent stone abbey the settlers planned to build .
Sevilla la Nueva , says David Burley , a historical archaeologist at Simon Fraser University , “ is one of the best preserved early Spanish colonial settlements by a long measure . ”
But the town never lived up to its founders ’ great expectations .
Its colonists failed to reap sufficiently large profits , and most abandoned the site in 1534 , settling instead on the island ’s south coast .
Moreover , the sugar industry they founded in Jamaica took a tragic toll on human life .
European germs and exploitation virtually extinguished Jamaica ’s Taino in just one century .
Without this large coerced workforce , Jamaica ’s sugar economy faltered until the British seized the island in 1655 and set up a full - scale plantation system , importing tens of thousands of enslaved Africans .
By the end of the 18th century , African - American slaves outnumbered Europeans in Jamaica by a ratio of ten to one .
Despite its short history , says Woodward , the Spanish colony at Sevilla la Nueva tells us much about the birth of the sugar industry in the New World , a global trade that ultimately had an immense long - term impact on the Americas .
The growing and milling of sugar cane , she points out , “ was the primary reason for bringing ten million Africans to the New World . ”
What in the world is happening to public schools in the United States ?
Once upon a time they were safe and peaceful institutions where our young people could get educated and prepared for their future lives as adults .
But in today ’s “ security conscious ” America , many public schools are on the verge of becoming literal prison camps , with students regularly being handcuffed , arrested and charged with crimes .
Is this the new “ Amerika ” where even our schoolchildren have to be ruled with an iron fist ?
What does this say about our society as a whole ?
Are we witnessing the last days of the open society ?
The introduction of “ zero tolerance ” policies in many areas of the United States has led to some absolutely ridiculous outcomes .
Just consider the following examples ….
* A 6 - year - old girl was recently handcuffed and sent to a mental facility after throwing temper tantrums at her elementary school .
* One 12 - year - old girl in New York was recently arrested and marched out of her school in handcuffs because she doodled on her desk .
* One middle school student was arrested on Thursday for starting a fire in a restroom trash can .
* One teen in Georgia was recently arrested after he got into a fight with another student while waiting for a bus after school .
* One eighth - grade teacher in the U.S. has accused her students of committing a “ hate crime ” because they left a Bible on her desk and a Christmas card with the word “ Christ ” underlined .
* A while back , a 6th - grader ’s teacher told him that Jesus could not be mentioned in a Christmas poem that he was writing for class .
* A bill introduced in the Iowa House would require “ age - appropriate ” comprehensive sex education beginning in kindergarten .
* In Florida , students have been arrested for bringing a plastic butter knife to school , throwing an eraser , and drawing a picture of a gun .
Just what in the world is going on here ?
If this is what our public schools are becoming , who in the world would want to send their kids there ?
Of course not every public school is like this yet , but this is clearly the direction that the country is moving in .
If you know of more examples like this , please submit a comment and share them with us .
America is quickly changing , and unless we wake up and start speaking out now , the American we all remember may be lost forever .
Today ’s dialogue - less strip hearkens back to the Spy vs .
Spy style of one - upmanship .
While the Olimar / Snake rivalry continues , the mercenary finally meets his match when ambushed by an opponent that can literally disappear into the shadows .
There was something oddly satisfying about drawing this comic .
Perhaps I just like the idea of someone being two steps ahead of the sneaky guy .

FOR years , Altria , home to Philip Morris and its popular Marlboro cigarette brand , was a corporate pariah blamed for the deaths of millions of people and sued for hundreds of billions of dollars by attorneys general in every state .
After eventually acknowledging , like others in its industry , that cigarette smoking was , indeed , addictive and caused disease , Altria went a step further .
It broke from the Big Tobacco pack and began supporting legislation that would ultimately put the company under the regulatory thumb of the Food and Drug Administration .
Altria ’s motives for submitting to strict oversight have long been a mystery .
Did the company and its executives , who were internally pursuing a strategy of “ societal alignment , ” suddenly embrace a true partnership on public health ?
Or was this a case , as its longtime foes and competitors have argued , of Altria seeking to generate good P.R. or lock in its market dominance by cozying up to a regulator that could restrict rivals from marketing new products ?
Another possible answer was highlighted this month , as the federal government began fine - tuning aspects of a law that President Obama signed last summer that gives the government sweeping new powers to regulate the production and marketing of tobacco products .
A series of letters that Altria submitted to the F.D.A. as part of that process argues that the government should , effectively , sign off on the notion that smokeless tobacco products are less harmful than cigarettes — and that Altria and other companies should be allowed to market them as such to consumers .

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) to compel the release of documents relating to its overseas abstinence - only programs , which are funded through HIV / AIDS grants .
An Inspector General ’s report ( pdf ) issued last July indicated that USAID had a history of incorporating religious materials into such programs and had not received legal guidance from the Justice Department on whether this was constitutionally permissible .
Faith - based organizations have been allowed to compete for federal contracts since 2001 under an initiative begun by former President George W. Bush , but the guidelines have never been clarified .
ADVERTISEMENT
Following the publication of the report , the ACLU filed two freedom of information requests to obtain documents pertaining to the presence of religious materials in the abstinence - only programs .
Since USAID has not responded to these requests in a timely manner , the lawsuit seeks a court order to compel the release of contracts and communications that might shed light on the question .
The Inspector General ’s report had concluded that “ some USAID - awarded funds were … used for the rehabilitation of mosques and adjoining community centers in Iraq .
USAID also funded , within a program to combat HIV / AIDS , lesson plans that contained Biblical applications and discussions . ”
The report pointed in particular to the “ self - awareness and self - worth ” component of the Abstinence and Behavior Change for Youth Program .
“ Like the curriculums ’ other sessions , the self - awareness and self - worth session contains an optional Biblical application and discussion .
It draws on a Bible story about Jesus and Zacchaeus to convey the point that ‘ knowing we are loved and having a good attitude about ourselves help us do good things . ’
The session also includes a psalm to be used as a “ ‘ memory verse ’ for reflection purposes . ”
It appears , however , that the ACLU may be less concerned about the possible religious component of these programs than about what it sees as the ineffectiveness of abstinence - only programs in general .
The lawsuit ( pdf ) states that “ plaintiff seeks documents through the FOIA to understand whether Defendant is properly monitoring grantees to ensure that federal funds are not spent on religious activities . ”
It then goes on to note that “ abstinence - only - until - marriage instruction fails to provide youth with the tools they need to make healthy decisions .
Indeed , providing information about and access to condoms is crucial in preventing the spread of HIV / AIDS , and withholding this information can cause serious harm to young people . ”

“ In the face of a growing global HIV / AIDS crisis , USAID is not only violating basic constitutional principles by promoting government - funded religious activities , ” ACLU attorney Rose Saxe stated , “ it is unconscionably putting young people ’s health and lives at risk . ”
NAGOYA / DETROIT — Toyota announced today is has identified a defect in the design of its cup holders as the source of acceleration problems associated with its popular Corolla , Camry , Tundra , Avalon and RAV4 models .
NAGOYA / DETROIT — Toyota announced today is has identified a defect in the design of its cup holders as the source of acceleration problems associated with its popular Corolla , Camry , Tundra , Avalon and RAV4 models .
“ When a driver places a 32 ounce drink , say a super - sized Slurpee for example , in the cup holder , ” explained Executive Vice President Shinichi Sasaki , “ the vibrations created at speeds over 50 miles per hour cause a tiny amount of the beverage to spill out onto the driver ’s leg .
If there is ice in the cup , the liquid will be extremely cold , resulting in the person urinating on himself .
The humilation caused by the foul smelling bodily fluid streaming down his leg is too much for the the driver to bear .
Believing death to be the only honorable solution , he will close his eyes and slam his foot onto the accelerator pedal , causing the vehicle to speed wildly out of control . ”
The world ’s largest car manufacturer said it regrets any loss of life incurred by its valued customers , but respects their decision to end their lives honorably in a Toyota product .
The company believes its engineers have found a remedy to deal with the defect .
“ Toyota will install a small hand towel connected to the dashboard , ” according to an announcement on the troubled automaker ’s website .
“ If any cold liquid spills from the cup onto the leg of the driver , the hand towel will be automatically be deployed to dry the spill before the coldness causes the urination which , in turn , causes the gas pedal to be depressed during a state of suicidal embarassment . ”
Toyota is still experimenting with materials from which to make the towels .
“ So far , we ’ve ruled out vinyl . ”
Until they have the design flaws figured out , morotists may go to any Toyota dealer and ask the service manager to manually sop up their urine .
Toyota expects to have the Anti-Urination Towel Absorption Devices ready by mid-Spring .
Dealers will install them at no expense to the customer .
Meanwhile , Toyota has advised motorists not to use their cup holders .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms , vehicles and other public places , according to an inspector general report .
The officers , with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , " did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and , as a result , lost a significant number of firearms " between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008 , the report said .
In all , 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period , according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner .
Of those , 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers ' control -- for instance , ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer .
Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes .
But 74 percent , or 179 guns , were lost " because officers did not properly secure them , " the report said .
Following a review of the draft report in December , Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy , according to a response in the report .
A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment .
The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms .
" Instead , DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms , " it said .
" Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient , personnel did not always follow them . "
The inspector general cited several examples of " inappropriate practices . "
A customs officer , for instance , left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store .
The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside .
" A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler , " the report said .
In addition , an ICE officer left an M - 4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home .
Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon , according to the report .
Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast - food restaurant , and it was gone when he returned .
" Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot , a bowling alley and a clothing store , " the report said .
" Although our review focused on CBP and ICE , other components described similar incidents .
For example , a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle ; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later , " said the report .
" Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons . "
Of the 179 lost because of laxity , 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost , the report said .
That resulted from the agencies ' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms , as well as " a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm .
" Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen , our analysis showed that these firearms were lost ( stolen ) because officers left the firearms unsecured , " according to the report .
" All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms . "
The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer , the report said .
The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers , but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard , the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center .

Fox cuts away from president ’s Q&A for third day
The problem with preconceived shades of reality is that occasionally , someone comes along and knocks everything askew .
According to Jon Stewart , host of Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , that ’s exactly what happened when President Barack Obama spent an hour and a half swatting down House Republicans ’ questions , causing Fox News to “ cut the feed . ”

It was almost as if the president could see the GOP talking points in “ bullet time , ” Stewart joked .
It was “ f*** ing awesome , ” he exclaimed .
Stewart summarized the network ’s move simply .
“ We ’re gonna cut away because this is against the narrative we present , ” he said , miming a Fox News executive .
“ I do n’t know exactly how Fox News is produced , ” Stewart continued .
“ I can just only imagine at some point this event violated the prime directive , causing what I can only assume is a typically sedentary network exec to pack a year ’s worth of exercise into one feverish run down the hallway shouting , ‘ CUT THE FEED ! ' ”

Sir John Crofton and his team found the cure for TB
The man who pioneered life - saving treatment for tuberculosis sufferers has died in Edinburgh at the age of 97 .
Sir John Crofton led a team of scientists which found a cure for TB by using a combination of three antibiotics .
In tributes following his death , he has been called one of the greatest physicians of the 20th century .
In the 1950s , TB , which was also known as consumption , was the most common cause of death in young adults .
Sir John 's work in combating TB - which came to be known as the " Edinburgh Method " - saved the lives of thousands of people , and improved the health of millions more across the world .
Today , Scotland has only about 400 cases of TB a year , or 7.9 cases per 100,000 of population - fewer than elsewhere in the UK , and many European countries .

Infographic : How to Create Green Rental Homes
The rolling home foreclosure crisis continues to haunt homeowners facing foreclosure , their neighbors due to falling home prices , and of course the broader U.S. economy .
Relief programs initiated by the Obama administration and Congress are making a difference , but we at the Center for American Progress believe policymakers need one more arrow in their quiver — a targeted program to convert already foreclosed homes owned directly by the federal government into thoroughly energy efficient , affordable rental homes that can be resold as portfolios of rental properties to private investors .
Huge numbers of foreclosed homes are already falling into the hands of the Federal Housing Administration from the rising number of foreclosures from mortgage guarantees it made before the housing bubble burst .
Over the next several years , many more single - family homes are likely to do so also , recognizing that even if foreclosure rates return to historical norms , FHA ’s increased role in supporting housing finance during the crisis will translate into additional properties in absolute terms .
Rather than quickly selling these foreclosed houses off individually at depressed prices , which drives down the value of other homes in the neighborhood and does little to minimize the ultimate losses to FHA ’s insurance fund , policymakers should instead maximize the value of these homes for taxpayers over the long term .
How ?
By pooling these houses by location , renting them out affordably , and then selling them in as a portfolio of already - occupied rental properties to institutional investors .
Retrofitting and weatherizing these homes before renting them out provides even more value to taxpayers by reducing operating costs in the form of lower energy bills .
Because the value of rental properties is driven by the net cash flow from the properties , demonstrable cost savings on operations increase the portfolio ’s value .
In 2009 alone , FHA paid insurance claims and then took title on 75,000 single - family houses .
As increasing numbers of foreclosed homes come into the possession of the FHA , the federal government could create long - term affordable rental housing in communities across our nation while minimizing losses to taxpayers who stand behind FHA mortgage payment guarantees .
By repairing these foreclosed homes to meet the highest energy efficiency standards and then renting them out , taxpayers may well recover the most value after foreclosure .
Foreclosed homes , known as “ real estate owned ” or REO in real estate parlance , are most often sold off one house at a time in their current condition .
The aim is to move them off the books as quickly as possible , and this has typically meant finding a new homeowner to buy the house .
But with homeownership rates falling significantly as a result of the foreclosure crisis and many properties in disrepair , there are n’t enough of these ideal buyers in the market , leaving too many opportunistic investors who are only interested in flipping these homes to homeowners or other investors .
When REO properties are auctioned off in bulk , the buyers are nearly always investors with a short investment horizon .
To the extent these investors make repairs to the property to improve the chances of sale and increase their returns , the repairs are often largely cosmetic and can saddle unwary buyers with significant maintenance costs .
Indeed , these kinds of investors have little regard for the long - term habitability of the homes they bought and sold .
This market reality was the impetus for the Department of Housing and Urban Development ’s Asset Control Area program , which offers housing - related nonprofit organizations the first right to purchase HUD properties in their communities .
So instead of valuing an REO property based on the price it might fetch at auction through sale to investors looking to hold until they can resell for a quick profit , the federal government should consider the value of these properties for sale as packaged rental assets .
Specifically , REO properties held by FHA should be thoroughly retrofitted , rented out , and then aggregated by location for sale to private investors as rental portfolios complete with tenants .
In many cases , the value of the cash flow from these properties as rentals will be greater than what individual homebuyers would be willing to pay for the houses in the aggregate , which means the federal government should receive more from the sale of these foreclosed properties than would otherwise be the case .
What ’s more , investing in energy efficiency retrofits and then renting these properties would help stabilize local housing prices by keeping these properties out of the market not only while FHA prepares them for sale as bulk rental portfolios but for the foreseeable future .
This policy is designed not only to help rebalance housing policy to reflect increased demand for rental housing and to optimize the disposition of FHA properties , but also to help drive a true economic recovery that will not happen without job creation .
As such , it complements the strategies laid out in Vice President ’s Middle Class Task Force report , “ Recovery through Retrofit . ”
In this policy memo , we will examine the details needed to inaugurate such a green rental conversion program in communities across our country .
Our proposed new program on the face of it seems complex , but once the different facets of the program are considered together it becomes clear this green rental home program would help mitigate the home foreclosure crisis , improve rental opportunities for families in need of better rental homes , and boost jobs growth at a critical time in our economy ’s nascent recovery .
How to create green rental home investment portfolios
There are several steps that must be taken to convert some of the federal government ’s stock of foreclosed homes into portfolios suitable for sale to institutional and other large private investors as rental properties .
First , the existing stock of REO homes needs to be catalogued by geography .
Not all FHA - owned properties would necessarily make for good rental housing .
Rural and exurban homes , for example , are likely to have less rental demand as potential residents choose to live closer to where jobs are and incur lower commuting costs .
Suburban properties , however , particularly in good school districts , will likely have stronger rental demand .
The cost of managing a widely scattered portfolio of rental properties may deter private investors from bidding on such a portfolio .
This is why the government must be strategic in identifying appropriate homes to aggregate , retrofit , and rent .
But in rental housing submarkets with stronger demand , assembling green rental home portfolios can create value .
The volume of properties falling into the hands of FHA control creates an opportunity to identify concentrations of properties that would make narrowly scattered rental management more realistic .
As of the end of 2009 , there were more than 30 metropolitan areas where FHA paid claims on 50 or more mortgages issued in the past two years alone .
Second , many properties that ultimately become REO properties when mortgage holders or mortgage insurers such as FHA take title after foreclosure have significant damage , either as a result of outright vandalism or simply through neglect and abandonment .
Simply selling them “ as - is ” almost guarantees a steep discount to market value and , by extension , results in significant losses to FHA , which already paid a claim based on the outstanding mortgage balance and not the current property value .
Regardless of the reason for the damage , these properties will need rehabilitation to be suitable rental properties .
So just as under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program , which provides funds to local governments and nonprofit groups to buy and rehab REO properties in an effort to put the houses back into productive use , select REO properties held by FHA should be rehabilitated according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development ’s Housing Quality Standards , which establish a baseline for health and safety standards .
Further , these REO properties should be retrofitted consistent with green building and weatherization programs .
In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of moving toward a low - carbon economy , greening and weatherizing these properties ultimately lower the cost of operating the properties in exchange for a marginal increase in the capital costs of the rehabilitation .
A 20 percent improvement in efficiency directly translates into a 20 percent reduction in utility bills over the long term — and potentially even greater savings where deep , whole - home , verified retrofits are conducted .
Indeed , $ 2,500 spent on green retrofits can save , on average , $ 900 annually on energy costs .
Once these retrofits and weatherizations are completed , a property manager should be identified who will handle leasing these properties on behalf of FHA prior to their resale in bulk as rental portfolios to private investors .
Rents would be capped at HUD - determined Fair Market Rents to ensure long - term affordability for the tenants .
Given that these properties are already in public hands , we should take the opportunity to ensure that when they are sold , the sales are done with public purpose in mind .
Because of the energy efficient green retrofits , these properties would also be more affordable for tenants due to lower utility costs .
In turn , vacancy rates would be lower than in comparable houses that have not been retrofitted .
The anticipated lower long - term vacancy rate would increase the portfolio’s value , again minimizing losses to FHA .
Despite pooling these properties into small geographies , these new rental homes ultimately will remain scattered throughout neighborhoods and communities , which means rental management companies with specific expertise in scattered - site rental housing must be found to manage these portfolios for private investors interested in purchasing these portfolios of rental properties .
Scattered - site rental management can be difficult to do , particularly to do well at scale and at a modest cost .
In some markets , contracting out to public housing agencies may be an option , as some of them have expertise in this line of business .
Public housing agencies also may also be interested buyers of the portfolios , particularly those looking for a way to deconcentrate their housing stock , which is often found in only a handful of neighborhoods within their jurisdictions .
The operating costs for these single - family green rental portfolios will be somewhat higher than for an equal number of units in multifamily rental buildings .
Consider a 50 - unit multifamily building .
It probably has one roof and one boiler .
Not so for the single - family homes in this portfolio .
They will have 50 roofs and 50 hot water heaters , so reserves for future capital expenditures will be somewhat higher on a per unit basis .
Despite these additional costs , bulk purchases and maintenance contracts for 50 roofs or hot water heaters make it relatively less costly than rehabilitating and maintaining 50 houses under 50 different owners .
Moreover , while the per-unit labor costs for managing a handful of scattered houses are high , they decrease significantly with scale , arguing in favor of a portfolio - based approach to selling these properties .
Once the properties in these new green rental portfolios are rented out to families , the portfolios can be sold off to private investors .
Given the public funds that are going to go into the properties to retrofit and weatherize them , it is only reasonable to expect public purpose in return .
Specifically , the properties should have long - term affordability obligations attached to the deeds .
The portfolio’s value will ultimately be determined by the net cash flow from the rents .
This is why reducing vacancy rates by virtue of the green rehabilitations and lowering operating and management costs by working at scale will add value to the properties and minimize losses to FHA .
Possible buyers include life insurance companies and other institutional investors with long - term investment horizons .
Expanding the green rental home portfolio investment model
While the policy as proposed above specifically relies on FHA ’s portfolio of REO properties , the policy could potentially be expanded to include foreclosed homes held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well .
In the first nine months of 2009 , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac took possession of almost 160,000 single - family homes .
In that instance , it may be necessary to establish a separate limited - purpose public corporation capitalized with public dollars — perhaps funds drawn from the Troubled Asset Relief Program if it is deemed an eligible vehicle for the acquisition of these troubled assets — to acquire foreclosed properties from FHA , Fannie , and Freddie so that the capacity to pool properties and identify true concentrations would be greatly enhanced .
This new corporation would retrofit the properties it acquires , find tenants , and then sell them off in portfolios by location .
Additionally , this new public corporation could also acquire already rehabilitated properties from nonprofits participating in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program so nonprofits would not be left with long - term liabilities from stabilization activities — allowing them to recycle NSP funds much faster than if they retained ownership rights in rental properties .
This is particularly important given the mandate of using 25 percent of the funds for low - income households , which are unlikely to be appropriate candidates for homeownership .
These acquired properties would be added to the portfolio , rented out , and sold alongside the other properties in the area .
There is some historical precedent for a policy of renting foreclosed properties rather than selling them off immediately .
During the Great Depression , properties acquired by the Home Owners Loan Corporation after borrowers defaulted on their HOLC loans were often rented out for a period of time through local brokers until the market value of properties improved .
The policy of renting prior to resale was intended to minimize losses to HOLC that they otherwise would have realized on a postforeclosure sale in a depressed market .
Similarly , over the past year , both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have implemented small - scale rental initiatives , wherein they negotiate deed - for - lease arrangements with existing owners on the brink of foreclosure .
When launched , these programs only offered month - to - month leases as Fannie and Freddie expected to sell the houses to owner - occupants in the near term .
More recently , however , they began to offer year - long leases , implicitly recognizing that renting may be more valuable than selling under current market conditions .
The ultimate disposition strategies for foreclosed properties owned by Fannie and Freddie is not clear , but at this point there is no broader program for creating rental portfolios to be sold to larger investors .
In short , our proposed policy consists of aggregating , retrofitting , leasing , and selling government - owned REO properties , first those held by FHA and if successful , potentially those held by Fannie and Freddie .
In addition to creating many new green - collar jobs , this program will begin to rebalance housing policy to provide additional family rental homes at a time when homeownership may not be appropriate for many households .
Given the confluence of the location of many hard - hit communities and high unemployment rates , this policy can both stabilize neighborhoods as well as provide much - needed jobs .

As the debate over health care reform remains stalled in Congress , many U.S. residents are taking matters into their own hands by simply driving to Mexico for affordable care and prescriptions .
" I'm very lucky to live near enough to Mexico to get good healthcare at a reasonable price , " said retired police officer Bob Ritz , who lives in Tombstone , Ariz .
Although Ritz does have insurance , many of his medical costs are simply not covered , or the co-pays and deductibles are so high that he cannot afford them on his fixed income .
" I pay $ 400 a month for my health insurance , and it 's still cheaper to come to Mexico , " he said .
In contrast to Ritz , approximately 46 million U.S. residents live without any medical insurance at all .
According to a study by the University of California - Los Angeles ' Center for Health Policy Research , roughly one million people go to Mexico for dental or medical care or prescriptions every year from California alone .
The primary difference between Mexican and U.S. health care is the cost -- with many U.S. doctors having trained at Mexican medical schools and vice versa , and similar hygienic standards in place .
Responding to the influx of people from the U.S. seeking affordable care , clinics in Mexican border towns now offer everything from regular dental care to cosmetic and weight - loss surgeries or other major procedures like hysterectomies .
In Naco , Mexico , Dr. Sixto de la Pena Cortes charges roughly $ 20 for a standard checkup .
He says he gets about 15 patients from the United States every week .
The most common complaints that he treats are " bronchitis , pneumonia and stomach problems , " he said , but he has also treated broken bones .
Once , he referred a patient to a hospital for an appendix removal operation that cost $ 2,000 .
" I waste up to four hours coming to an appointment , but it 's worth it as we 'll save thousands of dollars , " said Beatriz Iturriaga of Eastlake , California , who paid $ 6,500 for bariatric surgery in Tijuana .
A typical bariatric surgery in the United States costs as much as $ 40,000 .

From the outside it still looks like what it once was : a Georgian town house in the suburbs of north London with a famous pedestrian crossing once trodden by the Beatles nearby .
But on the inside it contains a notable slice of British and recording musical history .
And shortly , apparently , it is going to be up for sale .
The Abbey Road studios are to be sold by the EMI group , according to the Financial Times , in a notably hard - headed attempt by the company to reduce the debt burden it acquired during a leveraged buy - out three years ago .
The sale – which has not yet been confirmed by the group – might be expected to raise more than £ 10 m , which would , even so , make only a small contribution to the private equity firm Terra Firma 's need to raise £ 120 m by June , to service a £ 3.3 bn loan from Citigroup .
The studio's worldwide fame – in contrast to other much more anonymous recording studios – rests squarely on the legacy of its Beatles ' recordings in the 1960s , specifically the Abbey Road album of 1969 with its celebrated cover picture of the group wandering across the pedestrian crossing in the road outside the studio .
Although the crossing has since been moved , slightly , it still attracts fans from across the world and the company repaints the fence outside the studios every month to obliterate the latest graffiti posted there .
The 1831 villa became the world 's first custom - built recording studio in 1931 with Sir Edward Elgar conducting the London Symphony Orchestra in Land of Hope and Glory .
One of its advantages is that the studio is large enough to accommodate a full orchestra – Sir Malcolm Sargent , who lived round the corner regularly popped in – and so can record everything from symphonies to film scores for movies such as the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter series .
In Studio 2 , Cliff Richard performed what is regarded as the first European rock 'n ' roll record , Move It , in 1958 ; the Beatles recorded most of their albums and singles in the 1960s ; Pink Floyd produced Dark Side of the Moon and Manic Street Preachers , Travis and Blur have also featured there .
In the new , hi-tech world in which bands can record on laptops , however , its studios are said to have become too expensive .
The FT quoted a media lawyer saying : " The brand is worth more than the building … what you have is a very expensive piece of heritage .
If an artist goes to a label and asks to record at Abbey Road they will be met with maniacal laughter . "
How to Succeed by Failing Fast
Once you understand that failing leads to positive results , then it ’s not a question of whether you will fail , but how fast and often you are able to do so .
Are you afraid of failing ?
Do n’t worry if you are , because I am too .
But think hard about everything you are at least semi - good at .
Were you this good when you first started ?
It Applies to Hobbies
My wife Emma is a great cook .
So much so that EVERYONE , without exception , who tasted her homemade food agrees .
Yet , I ’m pretty sure she did n’t start out knowing which ingredient to put into her dishes .
I mean , she could be a born cooking genius for all I know , but not every dish she ’s ever cooked in her life was universally regarded as “ tasty ” .
If she never put in the wrong ingredients before , how will she ever understand that certain spices just do n’t mix ?
Even if she never failed , the first dinner she ’s ever prepared cannot possibly compare to what she cooks now .
The secret to her success may have something to do with her natural abilities , but more importantly , it ’s her relentless pursuit to try new recipes and improve her skills .
It Works with Debt and Investing Too
Are you putting off your debt repayment plan because you do n’t think the tiny extra payment matters ?
Or perhaps you do n’t have debt but have been putting off your contribution to your 401k ?
Let me be honest , because you are right in many ways .
Watching your 401k balance when you first start your contribution is like waiting for ants to transport bread across the room .
It ’s boring and it seems to take forever .
I can see how unmotivated you may feel at first , but read the stories of people who built a six figure balance with a meager salary .
If they can do it , so can you .
Consistency pays , no matter how impossible it seems at the beginning .
It ’s the Key to Making Money
So many people wait for the perfect opportunity to start a business .
The perfect time , the perfect partners , and the perfect business plan .
Yet , many successful business start off with no plans at all .
It ’s not that planning is bad , but because events happen in real time and plans need to adapt .
The economy can change , business partners can leave , and the grand vision may not even be viable once you get into it .
Businesses try new things all the time .
They may fail , but then they just try again until something sticks .
Maybe you want to make more money but you are afraid that your skills are n’t good enough .
Well , guess what ?
The more you do it , the better you will be at it .
And you want to know something ?
You will always get criticism along the way .
Take my Save Money on Everything ebook for example .
Two days ago , I published a snippet of it and one reader wrote this comment .
Oh David , it pains me to say this but what ’s the point ?
This content is glaringly obvious and does not encourage readers to return .
Yikes .
But when I check the numbers , there were 14 other people on the same day that decided to get the free ebook because of that article .
There will always be people who wo n’t like what you do , think you charge too much or throw cold water at your ideas , but it does n’t mean it ’s not worth your troubles .
Every idea may not start out good , and you will fail and feel discouraged .
The key to greatness is almost never how you start , but the constant refinements along the way .
After all , you are judged by the current product , not how many times you had to improve it .
Actually , if you think about it , Mike ’s comment is so valuable .
In many ways , he was right , and his insight can only make the ebook better .
If I never let others access to the article , how could I improve on it in the future ?
Do n’t be Afraid
No one starts out being successful .
We learn , adapt , change , and eventually are able to produce something of quality .
Natural abilities are important , but hard work and constant improvement is what makes cents .
Sara will eventually learn how to walk .
She wo n’t be afraid to fail , and she will eventually succeed .
That , I think we all know .

NIAMEY ( Reuters ) - Mutinous troops led by an army colonel captured Niger ’s President Mamadou Tandja after a gun battle on Thursday , and said they were suspending the constitution and dissolving all political institutions .
Tensions had been high in the west African uranium exporter since Tandja changed the constitution to extend his rule last year , a move that drew widespread criticism at home and led to international sanctions .
“ We , the security and defence forces , have decided to take responsibility for putting an end to the tense political situation that you are already aware of , ” a spokesman for the military junta , which called itself the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy ( CSRD ) , said in a statement on state television late on Thursday evening .
The statement made no mention of Tandja , but military sources said he had been seized along with several ministers .
They said soldiers led by Colonel Adamou Harouna had stormed the presidential palace in a four - hour gun battle in the heart of the capital , Niamey .
The new military rulers ’ statement said they had closed the borders and imposed an overnight curfew .
They gave no indication of how long they intended to hold power but called on Nigeriens and the international community to support their actions .
The West African economic body ECOWAS said it would punish any unconstitutional power - grab .
During the day , plumes of smoke were seen rising from the palace amid heavy gunfire .
Hospital sources said at least three soldiers were killed in the clashes .
A Reuters witness saw five injured soldiers at a hospital .
Later a Niamey resident told Reuters : “ Calm has returned and tanks have taken up positions close to the barracks , where Tandja and members of his government were rumoured to be held . ”
The resident , who asked not to be named , said a soldier living next door had told her not to worry as there would be no more resistance since the entire army supported the coup .
EXPANSION OF POWER
Harouna , previously thought to be a major , heads Niger ’s ECOWAS standby force .
Analysts and local journalists played down the possibility of a counter - coup , saying Tandja ’s presidential guard was divided and heavy weapons had been taken to barracks under the junta ’s control .
Tandja drew criticism and sanctions after dissolving parliament and orchestrating a constitutional reform in 2009 that gave him added powers and extended his term beyond his second five - year mandate , which expired in December .
The reform removed most checks on his authority , abolished term limits , and gave him an initial three more years in power without an election .
Tandja said he needed extra time to complete large - scale investment projects .
In Washington , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the situation was “ very fluid ” in Niger and the United States was closely monitoring it .
“ Clearly , we do not in any way , shape or form , you know , defend violence of this nature , but clearly we think this underscores that Niger needs to move ahead with the elections and the formation of a new government , ” he said .
ECOWAS , which has for months tried to broker a solution to the deadlock between Tandja and the opposition , suspended Niger after Tandja extended his term .
The United States terminated trade benefits , while former colonial power France also criticised Tandja last year .
Despite the political turmoil , Niger has attracted billions of dollars in investment from major international firms seeking to tap its vast mineral resources , including French nuclear plant builder Areva and Canada ’s Cameco .
Areva , which has been mining uranium in Niger for decades , is spending 1.2 billion euros ( $ 1.79 billion ) on a new mine .
China National Petroleum Corp signed a $ 5 billion deal there in 2008 to pump oil within three years .
Tandja has faced a rebellion by northern Tuareg - led rebels .
Analysts said they were unlikely to be involved in the coup .
What a great idea .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Because the private sector never , ever cuts corners to save a buck !
Okay , even assuming nothing goes wrong , where is the upside for the United States ?
That we get to applaud a space shuttle with the PayPal logo painted on the side ?
Gives me that fuzzy , warm feeling just thinking about it :
The White House has decided to begin funding private companies to carry NASA astronauts into space , but the proposal faces major political and budget hurdles , according to people familiar with the matter .
The controversial proposal , expected to be included in the Obama administration 's next budget , would open a new chapter in the U.S. space program .
The goal is to set up a multiyear , multi-billion - dollar initiative allowing private firms , including some start - ups , to compete to build and operate spacecraft capable of ferrying U.S. astronauts into orbit — and eventually deeper into the solar system .
Congress is likely to challenge the concept 's safety and may balk at shifting dollars from existing National Aeronautics and Space Administration programs already hurting for funding to the new initiative .
The White House 's ultimate commitment to the initiative is murky , according to these people , because the budget is n't expected to outline a clear , long - term funding plan . [...]
The idea of outsourcing a portion of NASA 's manned space program to the private sector gained momentum after recommendations from a presidential panel appointed last year .
The panel , chaired by former Lockheed Martin Corp .
Chairman Norman Augustine , argued that allowing companies to build and launch their own rockets and spacecraft to carry American astronauts into orbit would save money and also free up NASA to focus on more ambitious , longer - term goals .
What a coincidence , that the former Lockheed Martin chair would think this was a good idea !
In a move that comes as no surprise yet nevertheless feels surprising ( if that makes any sense and it probably does n’t ) , Howard Balzer reports via Twitter that Rams quarterback Marc Bulger has cleaned out his locker .
Bulger , a former West Virginia quarterback who attended the same high school as Dan Marino , entered the league in 2000 as a sixth - round pick of the Saints .
He ultimately landed with the Rams , where he rose to prominence as the successor to Kurt Warner .
But once Bulger cashed in with a big contract , his passer rating plunged from the 90s to the 70s .
Three seasons later , the Rams simply can’t justify paying Bulger $ 8.5 million in 2010 , given that neither G.M. Billy Devaney nor coach Steve Spagnuolo had any role in acquiring Bulger or financially rewarding him .
So if Bulger is released before March 5 , he ’ll hit the free - agent market before the market officially opens , giving agent Tom Condon plenty of time to find a new home for him .
How about a reunion with former Rams coach Mike Martz in Chicago ?
As Martz learned in 1999 , the guy at the top of the depth chart in August might not be the guy who ’s holding the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season .
So if Jay Cutler takes a helmet to the knee in the preseason , the Bears will need someone other than whoever it is that backs up Cutler .
And that should be good for about 20 e-mails telling us who it is , and one or two identifying the number Ike Hilliard wore in Tampa .

Anti-smoking watchdogs are up in arms about Sigourney Weaver 's character lighting up in the movie Avatar , but James Cameron says that her character 's cigarette habit was a critique of videogamers .
In Sunday 's New York Times , the director defended himself against critics , saying that Weaver 's character Grace Augustine was never meant to be a role model for young people .
In fact , he said , her smoking was meant to be a commentary on the character 's obsession with climbing into her blue meat puppet .
" We were showing that Grace does n’t care about her human body , only her avatar body , " Cameron said .
Augustine 's destructive behavior " is a negative comment about people in our real world living too much in their avatars , meaning online and in video games . ”
So the next time you watch Avatar , let it be a reminder : Raiding Ice Crown Citadel for new gear is fine , just do n't forget to take your real - world toon for a walk every now and then .

Overview
Gwydion will be built around Dylan [ 2 ] , a new object - oriented DYnamic LANguage being designed by Apple Computer , with some input from our group and from other collaborators .
Dylan incorporates many ideas from AI - oriented languages such as Smalltalk , Scheme , and Common Lisp , but with a new emphasis on practical , real - world programming .
Dylan is being designed to appeal to mainstream programmers who are now working in static languages such as C and C ++.
( See section [ * ] . )
As part of this project , we will develop a Dylan compiler that will produce efficient executable code whose size and speed are competitive with C and Fortran .
The following key ideas will guide our work on Gwydion :
A single , unified development environment should be used throughout the life - cycle of a software system , from initial prototyping though testing , refinement , deployment of a high - quality system , and post - deployment modification .
( See section [* ] . )
Fast initial prototyping and easy modification at later stages can best be achieved in an object - oriented dynamic language such as Dylan .
( Section [* ] .)
In order to support software projects all the way to deployment and post - deployment maintenance , the Gwydion environment must include a Dylan compiler that produces executable code whose speed and size are competitive with C and Fortran .
( Section [* ] . )
While Gwydion will primarily support the development of new code in the Dylan language , it must also provide excellent support for combining Dylan code with modules written in existing languages , particularly C , C++ , and Ada .
A dynamic , object - oriented language can serve as very flexible glue for creating heterogeneous software systems .
( Section [* ] . )
Programmers will be more productive and programs will be more reliable if the programming environment provides a very large library of pre-existing software modules , plus some simple , flexible glue for linking these pieces together .
Gwydion will support this model , and will provide excellent " librarian " software to maximize software re-use .

A program should no longer be thought of as a linear string of ASCII characters with ( maybe ) a few supporting documents .
The Gwydion environment will deal in hypercode , analogous to hypertext .
A program in Gwydion will be a complex linked data structure stored in an object - oriented database .
This data structure will contain source code linked with documentation and all the other information needed to support the software system throughout its entire life - cycle .
( Section [* ] . )
For hypercoding to be effective , Gwydion must provide multiple ways of viewing and editing hypercode , customized to match the user 's preferences and immediate needs .
( Section [* ] .)
To aid in fast prototyping and ongoing maintenance , Gwydion will provide advisors , demon processes that continually monitor the consistency of the software being developed , keeping track of missing modules , interface violations , and so on .
( Section [* ] . )
Program execution , profiling , and debugging will be monitored via animated views relating the program 's activity to specific locations in the hypercode .

Evolutionary Software Development
A single language integrated with an environment that produces efficient and maintainable code has great advantages for evolving software that can be used with code developed in other languages .
The Need For An Evolutionary Approach
For some tasks , especially for very large programs and those that must meet strict safety requirements , this strict division of labor may be appropriate and even necessary .
For such tasks , conventional software - engineering methodologies and languages like Ada and Pascal are the best tools available .
However , there is a growing realization that most software systems cannot be fully specified in advance .
Usually , the ``customer '' begins with only a vague idea of what he wants .
A working prototype is developed , and experience with this prototype enables the user to understand more clearly what it is that he really wants .
Changes are made , the revised prototype is tested , and so on .
This cycle of testing and revision often continues throughout the lifetime of the software .
For most successfully deployed programs , more money is spent on post - deployment modification than was spent during the program 's initial development .
Even if the specification writers were perfect , deployed programs would still have to be modified as the mission , the environment , and the computing systems change over time .
If we accept the idea that most software development is evolutionary , whether or not it is intended to be , then we need software tools designed to support the evolutionary process , not to suppress it .
Instead of emphasizing program ``correctness , '' in the sense of matching a fixed specification , we need tools that make it fast and easy to get a prototype program running , to test and debug it , and to modify the program 's behavior after it is running .
A Single Language for the Entire Software Life - Cycle
As people have gained an appreciation for the necessity of evolutionary programming , some have proposed the development of separate ``fast prototyping '' languages , perhaps specialized for use in a particular application domain .
We think that this idea is a bit off the mark .
The prototype - language paradigm suggests that each program should be written two or three times , using a different language each time .
First , a specification of some kind is written , either in very precise English or in some formal specification language .
Second , an executable prototype is created using some special language designed for fast prototyping .
This version is tested and changed until the program is close enough to what the customer really wants .
However , the revised prototype often cannot be deployed ``as is '' because it is slow and perhaps not very reliable .
So the prototype is translated into a more conventional language for deployment , and this time more attention is paid to efficiency issues .
Program documentation may be considered a fourth version of the program 's description , since the original specification may not be readable by the average user or maintainer , and may no longer be up to date .
Most programmers resist this methodology .
They prefer to write the program only once , in their favorite programming language and using their favorite tools .
They believe that they can get the program right in that environment , and that the translation from one version to another is likely to introduce more problems than it solves .
In many cases , they will be right .
If multiple human - maintained definitions of a complex system exist , they are almost certain to be inconsistent with one another .
The idea of using separate languages for prototyping and delivery has another major problem : the transition is designed to be one - way .
Once you move from the prototyping language to the deployment language , you have to stay there .
If you want to make substantial changes to the production version of the program , you lose all the advantages of working the prototyping environment .
Our view is that a single language and environment should be used throughout the program 's life cycle , from the initial sketch of the program , through a series of executable prototypes , and on to final deployment and maintenance phases .
The transition from a flexible , easily modified prototype program to an efficient version suitable for deployment would not require translating the program by hand , but instead would be a mechanical transformation - - a sort of compilation .
Changes would always be made and tested in the prototyping environment .
Initially , the program would have a simple structure dictated by the desired behavior .
Even this simple early sketch should be executable , using default choices for implementation decisions the user has not yet specified .
For testing purposes , any modules that are not yet fully specified would be represented by " dummy " versions , perhaps with a value being supplied by the human operator .
As program development progresses , the programmer will begin to make more detailed choices relating to implementation and efficiency questions rather than functionality .
We believe that Dylan will be an excellent choice for this central evolutionary language .
The ``AI languages '' such as Lisp , Smalltalk , and Scheme have always emphasized fast - prototyping and evolutionary development , but without paying much attention to the concerns of mainstream programmers working on real projects .
Dylan incorporates many of the best ideas from these ``AI languages , '' but with a new emphasis on the development of practical applications .
High - Quality Compilation for Delivery
The success of this ``one language , one environment '' approach depends critically on the ability of the system to produce Dylan programs that are as efficient and robust as programs developed in static languages .
If the quality demanded for delivery is not easily attainable , then there will be continual pressure to translate the code ( irreversibly ) into a language with adequate efficiency and static error detection .
There is a difficult problem here : a dynamic language like Dylan allows the user to change the definition of a function or a class at any time , perhaps even while the program is running .
This is one of the reasons that such dynamic languages are attractive for evolutionary programming .
But the ability to replace a module at any time means that the seams between redefinable parts of the program cannot be welded as tightly as they are in conventional programs .
Furthermore , as the user makes changes , he may want to call on new routines from the library of available functions , so this library must be kept around at all times .
The result is a system that is excellent for fast prototyping and easy modification , but one that is rather slow and that requires a huge runtime environment .
The solution , we believe , is to cleanly separate development mode from delivery mode .
While developing and modifying a Dylan program , the programmer will use the Gwydion environment in development mode , with full access to the extensive libraries of existing code .
Code can be compiled and run in this environment , but the functions and classes will be bound together rather loosely , so that changes can be made easily .
Code speed can be reasonably good in the development environment , but it will never be quite as good as in conventional languages ( given comparable compiler technology ) .
However , at any point , the user can ask Gwydion to compile the program in delivery mode .
The delivery version will never be changed ( though it may be replaced with a later version ) , so the program can be compiled as a single block , taking full advantage of opportunities for global optimization .
No new functionality will be added to the delivery module , so there is no need to carry along the full library .
The delivery module will include only those parts of the code library that the module actually uses .
Some runtime error checking code will normally be included ( the user can specify how much safety he wants ) , so that any problems can be detected and diagnosed , but fixes and changes are never made in the delivery module .
For any changes or repairs the user goes back to the Gwydion development environment , which provides full support for modification , testing , and logging of changes .
Since the delivery module is not designed for easy modification , there is no excuse for it to be slower or larger than an executable produced by C or Fortran .
In fact , since the entire program can be analyzed as a whole , comprehensive inter-module optimization and static error checking can be done , resulting in better efficiency and correctness guarantees than are provided by conventional file - at - a - time compilers .
Compiler Technology .
At this point , code quality just comes down to the quality of the optimizing compiler .
Our experience in developing the Python compiler for CMU Common Lisp gives us confidence that we can develop a Dylan compiler that will offer good performance in development mode and excellent performance in delivery mode .
Python performs extensive flow analysis and type - inference on the program , which allows for a high degree of optimization .
Floating - point code is particularly fast under Python , as is ``safe ' ' code with a high degree of runtime error checking .
If the programmer has left out information ( e.g. type declarations ) that the compiler needs in order to produce optimal code , the compiler will ( optionally ) engage the user in a sort of dialog , explaining what additional information is needed and the performance consequences of various implementation decisions .
Python 's code - generation machinery is largely table - driven , which makes it easy to retarget the compiler for new machines .
Automatic Storage Allocation .
Gwydion 's Dylan implementation will employ the latest and best GC technology , probably using the facilities of the GC toolkit developed by Eliot Moss at the University of Massachusetts .
This advanced generation - scavenging GC can be very efficient and almost invisible to the user .
However , even this advanced GC technology may not be the right answer for embedded real - time applications .
Gwydion will provide a special static storage allocation mode for developing and testing such applications .
The GC machinery in the Gwydion development environment will be used to verify the operation of code that , in delivery mode , will run without a garbage collector .
The GC can be used to catch exactly the kinds of subtle storage - allocation bugs described above before the system is deployed .
This technique has been used successfully in some of the more advanced commercial C++ environments such as Object Center .
The Glue and Library Model
The best existing tools for fast prototyping and evolutionary development employ what we call the ``glue and library '' model .
This means that instead of programming everything at the lowest level , the user selects existing pieces of software from a very extensive library , and combines these pieces using some very simple , flexible syntax -- a sort of ``universal glue . ''
We see something like this even in the C / Unix world , in which small programs with a standard interface are strung together into a larger system by means of Unix pipes .
This is a rather awkward system , since the pipes carry only bytes of ASCII text and the grain size of the modules is rather large .
Nevertheless , this primitive system is responsible for much of Unix 's celebrated power and flexibility .
The Lisp world provides a better sort of universal glue in the Lisp function call .
This can handle data objects ( arguments ) of any type , and can be compiled into an efficient form .
A key point is that the same ``universal glue '' syntax is used at every level of the program , whether you are tying an expert system to a display package or just accessing an array .
Object - oriented programming , as implemented in CLOS and Dylan , is just a more flexible kind of glue .
The program is built up from classes of objects ( organized in a hierarchy ) , along with the specialized operations that affect each class .
Robust software comes , in part , from building large systems in small , manageable steps .
An individual Lisp function or Dylan method is usually much shorter than a screenful of code .
Small functions are easy to build and easy to get right .
Each function is relatively self - contained ; it has a stated purpose ( text attached to the definition ) and an interface that adheres to the standard conventions .
Each function can be tested before it is combined with others into larger structures .
Larger pieces of code can similarly be assembled without viewing the internal structure of library elements .
A visual programming model can be used by the librarian to paste together entries into more powerful components , with user knowledge limited to the functionality and advertised interface of each module .
The point of all this is that both fast prototyping and later modification of programs can be much easier , and less prone to errors , if the code is organized into small independent functions connected in a uniform way .
It becomes very easy to pop the parts of a program apart and to rearrange them in some new way .
Combine this idea with a large library of pre-existing functions , and you have a very powerful evolutionary programming environment .
Add a compiler smart enough to compile this call - intensive code efficiently , and you will have a good deployment language as well .
Dylan 's universal glue ( object - oriented function call ) is very similar to that of Common Lisp with CLOS , but a clear distinction is made in the Dylan language between the core language and the libraries .
Gwydion will be designed to support arbitrarily large libraries of hypercode , with librarian software to help the user find the code module that best fits his current needs .
Searches might be performed using an index of keywords , some of which may be automatically extracted from the text associated with each module .
It might be possible to look for all programs that have certain structural features or that are used in certain ways .
The library might be kept on the local machine , or it might exist on a set of server machines somewhere on the Internet .
Some research will be required to refine the interface for this library facility .
The idea of application - specific programming languages is very popular in some quarters , but there are problems with this approach : first , with separate languages it is hard to mix and match code written for different applications ; second , there is much duplication of effort in creating development tools for each of these many languages .
Dylan may be viewed as a single , general - purpose language which can be made application specific though the addition of libraries .
Or , if you prefer , it may be viewed as a common toolkit in which any number of applications - specific languages can easily be created .
In any case , the programs written in Dylan will all share a common set of development tools and a common syntax and structure that allows easy mixing and matching .
Other languages might also serve this " common toolkit " function , but Dylan has several advantages :
First , the object - oriented model used in Dylan makes it easy to combine libraries of code and object - classes that were developed separately .
Second , Dylan provides a very rich and extensible set of data structures and styles of programming that can support the specialized needs of any application domain .
Third , Dylan 's powerful macro system makes it possible to alter the surface syntax of the language to meet any specialized needs , and even to add new compiler optimizations .
Heterogeneous Programming
It is our goal to produce an implementation of Dylan that is so easy to use and so efficient that it will be the natural choice for most tasks .
However , we recognize that a very large amount of useful code will still be produced in languages such as C++ and Ada .
The environment must therefore provide excellent facilities for integrating pieces of foreign code with code written in Dylan .
In a sense , this is a natural extension of the ``glue and library ' ' philosophy , but with the library modules written in many different languages .
We will support function calls in both directions and the sharing of structured data objects from ( at least ) C , C++ , and Ada .
One important technique is to automate the building of interface code for foreign objects by reading the foreign - language source files -- the C record declarations and routine headers , for example .
The Dylan Language
Object oriented programming ( OOP ) , in one form or other , has been used in AI languages like Smalltalk and Lisp for almost 20 years -- long before the current object - oriented fad took off in mainstream languages .
OOP is an important tool for evolutionary programming .
It provides a more flexible and powerful form of ``universal glue '' than the standard function call .
OOP is especially valuable in task involving simulation and graphics .
The real world , and ( and its image on a computer display ) is naturally described in terms of objects , classes , attributes , relationships , and class - specific operations .
The object - oriented paradigm preserves this natural structure .
But while object - oriented programming is an important tool for evolutionary programming , it is not the whole story .
It is equally important to provide a dynamic software development environment .
A language like C++ , in which some object - oriented facilities are grafted onto an old - fashioned static language , does not deliver the full benefit of object - oriented programming .
By ``dynamic '' we mean four things :
Dynamic Linking and Loading .
During program development , it must be possible to change the definition of a specific function or method without stopping to recompile and re-link the entire system .
Dynamic Type System .
During development , it must be possible to create new classes or change the definition of old ones , again without stopping to recompile and rebuild the universe .
It must be possible to create variables and operations that can accept objects of any type , or of a specified range of types .
Dynamic Memory Management .
For fast prototyping , it is essential to have automatic storage allocation for new objects and some sort of garbage collection of old , unused objects .
This frees the programmer from having to worry about these issues , and eliminates a common source of very subtle bugs .
Dynamic Debugging and Program - Development Tools .
For maximum effectiveness , all parts of the programming environment must be designed with a dynamic program - development style in mind .
This includes program editors , interactive debugging tools , performance measurement tools , etc .
In our initial planning for the Gwydion project , we examined existing programming languages and came to the conclusion that a new language was needed if we were to bring the full benefit of evolutionary programming to a wider range of programmers and real - world software projects .
Of existing languages , Common Lisp with CLOS is perhaps the best example of an object - oriented dynamic language .
CLOS provides more advanced object - oriented facilities than are found in Smalltalk or C++ , and Common Lisp was fully dynamic from the start .
However , Common Lisp has some serious problems as well :
The CLOS system was grafted into Common Lisp late in the game , so the object system is not well - integrated with some other parts of the language .
Common Lisp is considered by many programmers to be too large for everyday use , both in the size of delivered applications and in the overwhelming amount of material a programmer must learn .
It is one thing to have an extensive library of available functions , but quite another to present it all as a single monolithic language .
The Common Lisp syntax , with its nested parentheses , is considered by many programmers to be unreadable .
Common Lisp provides poor support for modularity and ``programming in the large , '' and poor separation between the development and runtime environments .
While some of these problems can be fixed , others are now locked in due to the ANSI standardization of Common Lisp .
In any case , many potential users are now convinced that these problems are inherent in Common Lisp .
We were about to propose the development of a new object - oriented dynamic language that would eliminate these problems and thus be attractive to a wider range of programmers .
However , we were worried that yet another language , especially coming from a university group without solid industrial backing , would not be well received .
Then we learned about the Dylan project at Apple 's Cambridge Research Laboratory , then under the direction of Ike Nassi .
Upon investigation , we found that Apple 's goals for Dylan ( the language itself , not the programming environment ) were nearly identical to our goals for a new evolutionary - programming language .
Dylan has the solid backing of Apple , and is also attracting interest from other companies and research groups .
A group at Digital Equipment Corporation has implemented and released Thomas , a ``quick and dirty '' prototype implementation of Dylan on top of Scheme .
Harlequin ( a Common Lisp vendor based in England ) is developing a Dylan implementation with Esprit funding .
Apple has sent out several thousand hardcopies of the Dylan manual to individuals who have requested them , and there is lively discussion of the language design on the Internet .
Several stories about Dylan have appeared in the industry press .
While Dylan is a trademark of Apple , they have stated that this control will be used only for quality - control purposes .
They intend to license the use of the Dylan name to any implementation that passes their test suite .
Apple plans to complete the Dylan language specification in the spring of 1994 .
The Gwydion Environment
The Gwydion environment is designed to support the flexible interleaving of the design , implementation , testing , and tuning phases of software development , before and after deployment .
As part of its programmer support it captures knowledge about the requirements and design rationale .
The Gwydion environment can also provide reverse - engineering tools for advising the programmer the best way to make some modifications with minimal ripple effects on the rest of the system .
Hypercode
Levels of Detail .
Hypercode is not just text ; it also will contain graphical objects that illustrate various concepts , data structures , and abstractions , linked to one another and to code strings .
The code viewer allows consistent manipulation of code strings , templates , and modules in one framework , all the while preserving the programmer 's ability to view and edit the code at different levels of abstraction .
The relationship between objects , for example the call dependencies between functions , are designed to be part of the graphical interface used by Gwydion , and these relationships can be traversed and selectively viewed .
The user could jump directly from a function to a list of its callers , and from there to some specific caller .
People who have maintained large object - oriented systems are aware of the problem of ``object spaghetti' ' :
If you look at the DRAW method for the BATTLESHIP class , you may find a routine that draws a gun turret and then defers to the more general DRAW method for WARSHIP .
It can take a great deal of searching through the type hierarchy to find all the modifiers and the routine that actually does the bulk of the work ( if there is such a central routine ) .
Upon command , Gwydion will collect all of the code relevant to a certain operation or class for inspection by the user .
When the user makes a change , Gwydion will keep track of what other parts of the program are affected by that change .
Integrated Documentation and Testing .
The hypercode view that a programmer finds most useful will be easily adjustable and will track the user 's actions even across sessions .
This means that the tools and modes that the system developer finds most useful will be readily available whenever they are needed .
There should be no need to maintain a ``profile '' or ``initialization file '' by hand .
Past views , a software history .
Programming in the Large .
Given the facilities for logging changes and re-building consistent versions of the system , Gwydion should be an excellent environment for supporting cooperative work by a large group of people .
Instead of locking files or directories while changes are being made , it should be possible to lock semantically meaningful parts of the applications , such a ``lock this function and every function that calls it . ''
Advisors and Animated Views
The environment includes a set of advisor demons ( co-routines or processes ) that run in the background as the user works on a software system .
These demons continually monitor the user 's actions and the state of the system .
They can provide advice at any time , but the user is not required to follow it , so the user is free to develop the hypercode in his own way and in any order .
Rather than following the dictates of a rigid structure editor , the programmer may choose to build code that is temporarily inconsistent or incomplete .
When the time comes for final cleanup , the advisors will help him to locate all the loose ends .
At the lowest level , an advisor will observe the user 's code , noting any syntactic or data - type mismatches , keeping track of any functions or data structures that have been used but not yet defined , and suggesting consistent default values for some parts of the program .
A debugging advisor can keep track of breakpoints , testing code , and temporary changes , with explanations for each .
A module - level advisor will monitor interface consistency and name conflicts .
A system - level advisor may keep track of large - scale system configuration issues and possible problems introduced when many programmers work the same system at once .
All of these observations are linked into appropriate places in the hypercode , so that the user can jump directly to the location or locations in question .
While Gwydion will primarily support the development of new code in the Dylan language , it must also provide excellent support for combining Dylan code with modules written in existing languages , particularly C , C++ , and Ada .
The advisors will have knowledge of the interface requirements for linking to libraries and call - outs to a limited set of other languages .
As a programmer incrementally compiles , loads and runs code fragments the advisory process is a set of snapshots of portions of the code database .
When a larger subset of the object database and code is compiled , the environment will string these together to animate the progression .
This can be combined with graphic displays to profile the activities of the system in a more human readable form than conventional profiling tools .
The Gwydion Project
We are in the startup phase of a three - year project to create the Gwydion environment and make it widely available to the research community and to industry .
We want the system to be widely used on real application projects so that we will get good feedback on the design .
We have already implemented a prototype Dylan implementation built on top of CMU Common Lisp which is tracking ( and sometimes anticipating ) the Dylan design as it evolves .
We expect to produce a good - quality stand - alone Dylan implementation within the next year .
After an initial period of bootstrapping , Gwydion will be written in Dylan and later versions of Gwydion will be developed under early versions of the Gwydion environment .
Resources
The Gwydion project team currently consists of Scott Fahlman plus five full - time staff members , all veterans of the CMU Common Lisp and the Gandalf projects .
The Gandalf project explored advanced software - development environments for more traditional programming languages .
In addition , the project currently employs four very good undergraduates as part - time programmers .
This team brings unique skills and experience to a project such as Gwydion .
The CMU CL project ( known in the early days as Spice Lisp ) has been involved in the implementation of advanced Lisp systems and programming environments on standard workstations for over a decade .
We played a central role in the design , implementation , and popularization of Common Lisp as that language grew from a mere suggestion by ARPA to a widely - used standard that forms the foundation of the worldwide AI industry .
Our code made it possible for many companies to get into the Common Lisp game while minimizing their initial cost and risk .
Much of our effort over the past few years has been spent developing and integrating our new Python compiler for Common Lisp .
Python sets a new standard for Lisp compilers in a number of areas ( see section [* ] .)
Another area of expertise is in the integration of static and dynamic languages : our Alien facility embeds conventional data structures into Lisp 's dynamic type system in a way that is both natural and highly efficient ( see section [* ] .)
We also have considerable experience in programming environment development : the Hemlock editor is tightly integrated with the compiler and run-time system , and provides many incremental development and browsing capabilities that have only recently become available in commercial products .
With the release of CMU CL for Sparc / SunOS in the fall of 1991 , we suddenly found ourselves supporting a user community of several hundred individuals and projects worldwide .
In addition to the impoverished university researchers and a few large projects for whom unrestricted access to our sources is important , we also find that CMU CL is being used for small " bootleg " projects in many companies and government labs .
Apparently these people need to prove that Lisp is the right tool for some task before trying to persuade their management to buy a commercial Common Lisp license .
We intend to play a similar role in the growth and widespread acceptance of the Dylan language , which we see as a significant improvement over Common Lisp for many kinds of programming .
In fact , we have already been told by a number of other groups that our participation in Dylan gives them confidence that the language will be a widespread success , and not just an internal project of Apple .
We believe that the Gwydion environment will showcase the capabilities of Dylan in the best possible light .
Our group is still supporting CMU Common Lisp because we feel a certain responsibility to our external users and because we are using CMU CL as a cross - development platform in the initial phases of Gwydion .
However , this support is at a much - reduced level , since CMU CL is no longer our primary task .
We are currently starting up a Gwydion consortium for companies that want to work with us to commercialize the products of our research .
Consortium members will receive a license to use our code and documents commercially and will have easy access to the Gwydion design team .
We want to work closely with these industrial partners to make sure the system meets their real - world needs .
In particular , our decisions about which machines and operating systems to support will be strongly influenced by the desires of our industrial partners .

Two students / researchers at the University of Stuttgart in Germany have created a black hole simulator of sorts .
The simulation “ takes into account the position of 118,000 stars , the distortion caused by the black hole ’s gravitational lens , and even Fraunhofer diffraction , to present the most realistic shot possible . ”
Video after the break .
Even crazier , the simulation models how the stars would appear to change color as the Doppler effect took action on a viewer falling towards the singularity at nearly the speed of light .
A 57 - year - old man has become the 12th pedestrian to die this month in the GTA after he was struck by a dump truck near Broadview and Danforth avenues Friday morning .
Police say the man was crossing the road from the west side to the east side of Broadview Ave. , when he was struck by a dump truck , which was making a right turn onto Broadview Ave. from Danforth Ave .
“ It appears that both the pedestrian and the driver had green lights , but in that case , the pedestrian would have right - of - way , ” Sgt. Tim Burrows said .
Several witnesses told the Star that the victim was an Asian man who had polio in at least one of his legs .
They said they had seen the man walk to the City Adult Learning Centre in the area .
A pair of silver crutches lay next to the body , covered by an orange sheet , in the middle of the intersection .
An EMS spokesperson said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene .
About 50 metres away , the area around a brown dump truck was taped off as police investigated .
Police had shut down the intersection to investigate the collision , which happened around 11:30 a.m .
The TTC had cancelled streetcar service on Broadview Ave. and was running shuttle buses .
The intersection has since re-opened and service resumed around 3 p.m .
“ Speed and alcohol are not considered factors at this point , ” said Burrows , adding that the driver remained at the scene of the accident and was unhurt .
Burrows said the investigation is ongoing and that it is too early to say if charges will be laid .

Isikoff relays more disturbing details from the OPR report :
At the core of the legal arguments were the views of Yoo , strongly backed by David Addington , Vice President Dick Cheney 's legal counsel , that the president 's wartime powers were essentially unlimited and included the authority to override laws passed by Congress , such as a statute banning the use of torture .
Pressed on his views in an interview with OPR investigators , Yoo was asked :
" What about ordering a village of resistants to be massacred ? ...
Is that a power that the president could legally "
" Yeah , " Yoo replied , according to a partial transcript included in the report .
" Although , let me say this :
So , certainly , that would fall within the commander - in - chief 's power over tactical decisions . "
" To order a village of civilians to be [ exterminated ] ? " the OPR investigator asked again .
" Sure , " said Yoo .
Internet Explorer just cannot catch a break these days .
The German Federal Office for Security in Information Technology has officially advised people to stop using Internet Explorer , all versions , until Microsoft releases a new patch for the latest gaping security hole .
If you were not aware , in Internet Explorer there is a current security problem that allows a webpage to maliciously inject code onto the machine running the browser .
This bug was used by “ Operation Aurora , ” which hacked Google and other companies in recent days .
Consider this …if it is a large enough problem to hack Google , your site is not safe .
In a statement , the BSI ( German Federal Office for Information Security ) recommends that until a full patch is released for this “ zero day ” flaw , that Internet Explorer is not safe , even if users run IE in protected mode .
Given that the majority of the world still runs on Internet Explorer , it seems unlikely that any major impact will be made to IE market share , but at least in Germany the powers that be are making direct moves to protect their citizens .
You can read the Microsoft report on the bug here , which outlines it as a “ publicly exploited vulnerability in Internet Explorer . ”
In other words : IE is broken , and hackers know how to abuse the bug .
At least Germany is doing something about it .

1,000 people were asked their thoughts about fashion on the telly , and two - thirds of the Top Gear crew received the dubious honor of being called the scruffiest presenters on televsion .
James May and Jeremy Clarkson apparently need to head to Carnaby Street and ditch the open collars and jeans .
Richard Hammond did n't get away unscathed , either .
He was voted the fifth worst dressed .
Most of the people polled want their presenters to wear ties , and nearly half think jeans should be out , too .
The personalities deemed the best - dressed were Sir Trevor McDonald , a long - serving veteran , and the wise and dapper Bruce Forsyth .
Taking this report to heart , we 'll be speaking with our tailors directly .

Dallas office dispatched agents yesterday afternoon to be on the ground in Austin

Thursday , February 18 , 2010
A trusted source has told this office that the FBI knew Austin was going to be attacked today and had dispatched officers from its Dallas headquarters yesterday afternoon to be in place for today ’s incident .
The source claims that a confidential memo was circulated yesterday detailing that a building in Austin was going to be the target of an attack today .
He was told this by an informant who works in the Dallas FBI office .
Four FBI agents hurriedly left the Dallas office yesterday to be ready and on the scene for the aftermath of the incident , according to the informant , who was shaken when he saw events unfolding today and put two and two together .
We cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim but the source is known to us and has no motivation for inventing the story .
The fact that pilot Joe Stack changed his manifesto at least 27 times before the final version suggests that he had been writing it for days and this could have been what tipped off the FBI in the build up to the attack .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The claim dovetails with reports we are receiving from Austin residents that the FBI were immediately on the scene after the plane crash and were filming both the building and eyewitnesses .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A separate witness told KXAN News that there were Hazmat teams and fire trucks in place across the street before the plane struck the building .
Infowars reporters who spoke to neighbors at Stack ’s house , which he had burned down before crashing the plane , expressed surprise at how quick emergency services responded to the fire .
One neighbor , named Elbert , said that emergency crews arrived five minutes after he made the 911 call .
Whether the attack was the work of a lone individual or part of a larger set - up , the aftermath is being exploited to the full by the corporate media and people like Glenn Beck , who are blaming the incident on Constitutionalists and the liberty movement , implying that anyone who shares any of the grievances outlined in Stack ’s lengthy manifesto are also intent on crashing planes into buildings .
Of course , the previous staged terror attack , the Christmas Day underwear bomber incident , was proven to be a set - up and the authorities repeatedly had to change their cover story after eyewitness Kurt Haskell , who was initially derided by the media , was eventually proven right in the fact that the bomber was allowed to board Flight 253 by order of the State Department .
Authorities were similarly prepared in advance of the 9/11 attacks in New York City .
As part of the Tripod II exercise , FEMA deployed on September 10 to set up a command post at Pier 29 supposedly in preparation for a biowarfare exercise scheduled for September 12 .
We are providing the following tip line for people in Austin to send their eyewitness and news tips about this incident to us .
The number is 512-646-4444 .

Comment on this article
The Internet played an important role in electing Barack Obama : it can play a major role in defeating Stephen Harper and his Conservatives .
Recently two Facebook groups have shown how quickly negative opinion can be mobilized , and expressed .
The playful " Can this Onion Ring get more fans than Stephen Harper " page resulted in a nearly six to one victory over the 30,000 Harper fans .
The " Canadians Against Proroguing Parliament " page grew quickly to over 225,000 members , attracting mainstream media comment .
By keeping public attention focused on the shutdown of Parliament , it gets some of the credit for the recent shift in voting intentions away from Harper 's Conservatives .
The rules of political engagement are changing .
Managing the media , the key to political success in the age of politics as public relations , is no longer enough .
The various mantras : less is more , one message a day , politicos communicate mainly through television so keep visual images under tight control , restrict media access and crush critics , were not designed for the world of Twitter , Facebook and smart phones .
Obama won North Carolina because 75,000 volunteers recruited on Facebook got out the vote in a state no local Republican imagined losing .
Social media helped Obama defeat Hillary Clinton , who looked unbeatable ... until she lost the Iowa caucuses to him , in their first head - to - head battle .
Social media smarts do not just happen .
The Obama campaign had a Facebook founder on board his campaign from the beginning .
And , obviously , an Obama - like candidate does not happen along very often either .
In the next Canadian election , the Conservatives could win more seats than any of the others , or ( gasp ! ) win more seats than all of the others , but it does not have to happen .
Canadians who do not want to live through more Conservative minority , or the disaster of a Conservative majority , can use the Internet to defeat them .
We do not have to wait for another party or leader to emerge as an alternative .
A negative campaign will do very well , provided it comes from the Net roots .
Defeating Harper entails setting out a riding - by - riding Internet strategy to make each Conservative Member of Parliament pay electorally for voting to shut down Parliament twice .
Defeat our Conservative MP
Facebook groups need to emerge across the country in every Conservative held riding .
The Conservatives can be defeated by a combination of the opposition parties , but the opposition parties are not going to combine in order to defeat them .
The Liberals want to replace the Conservatives as government , the NDP wants to replace the Liberals as the official opposition , the Greens want to replace the NDP as the conscience of Parliament ( and the voice for what comes next ) and the Bloc just wants to hold on against all comers to what it has got .
These partisan objectives override the common objective of defeating the government .
In the last election , Vote for the Environment , an activist Internet campaign helped New Democrat Linda Duncan defeat a sitting Conservative , in Harper 's home province .
In preparing for the next election , it is up to Internet activists to devise a way of making the same thing happen , in as many Conservative ridings as possible .
Supporting the opposition candidate with the best chance of beating the local candidate base on the results of the last election is an obvious way to go .
Past calls for strategic voting floundered because they were not local enough .
Deciding which candidate to back against a Conservative cannot be decided by a centralized campaign .
Citizens wanting to throw out their Conservative MP need to be " built - in " to the campaign to do it .
Nobody can give a prime minister a mandate to send parliamentarians home , just because he fears what they might do to his career .
Only citizens coalescing in a democratic spirit can send the following message to any future prime minister : citizens elect a Parliament , and expect it to meet ;
MPs that vote to shut themselves down , deserve to be barred from doing it again .
Duncan Cameron writes from Montreal .
But Apple would like this to go to trial on some trademark issues and other matters , which it sees as not mooted at all .
It says it intends to seek disgorgement of Psystar 's ill - gotten gains , by the way .
And because Psystar can't possibly pay damages , it argues for a permanent injunction , but despite the recent ruling regarding Snow Leopard not being included in this litigation , Apple asks the court to fashion the injunction to include all its copyrighted Mac OS X software , not just Leopard , so Psystar can't continue to hop about infringing merrily along with each new version of Mac OS X .
As you recall , each side has filed summary judgment motions , with Apple opposing Psystar 's motion but Psystar merely responding to Apple's .
It knows it can't possibly win , I think , so it 's just trying to minimize damages .
It 's particularly in these arguments regarding summary judgment that we get the clearest picture yet of what this lawsuit has been all about .
But in addition , there is a really nasty dog fight on the side over confidentiality , with Psystar attempting to get the court to unseal technical information about how to bypass Apple 's encryption , information Apple views as a trade secret and which it would like to keep sealed .
I view this argument less as core to the litigation , but more as lawyer - jockeying for advantage on Psytar 's part .
I 'll show you what I mean .
First , here 's how Apple views the confidentiality issue , in brief :
Psystar has unlawfully circumvented the security mechanism in Apple 's Macintosh computers and its Mac OS X operating system software .
Now Psystar wants to use the judicial process by which Apple has acted to halt this illegal conduct to reveal Apple 's proprietary security mechanism to the world ....
The relevant facts needed to understand the significance of this case are that Apple uses an encryption method and Psystar has found a way to circumvent it .
Publishing the encryption scheme and the circumvention method in the Court 's files will simply invite others to engage in the same unlawful conduct .
Apple and Psystar have been filing documents partially sealed to protect tech info on how Psystar bypasses Apple 's encryption .
Psystar seemed to me to be redacting a lot more than Apple , which puzzled me until now .
I gather Psystar wanted the court to view Apple as over - sealing , so it could ask for sanctions .
Sometimes that 's the only way to win , and that 's why I think Psystar argues for it .
The parties have met and conferred , and Apple lists some documents it says can be unsealed , but it wants to keep its trade secrets secret .
Psystar says the method to bypass Apple 's encryption has already been revealed , that you can find it all over the Internet , so where 's the trade secret ?
But Apple produces case after case where courts ruled code was still a trade secret despite some having published it on the Internet .
Psystar 's other argument is that with dispositive motions , which is what summary judgment motions are , the rule is transparency , with narrow exceptions , and that this judge warned the parties that any attempts to overseal risked having the filing in question tossed out .
Of course , that is the relief Psystar asks for .
Like I say , sometimes that is the only way to win .
If you think you wo n't win on the merits , you might look for a technicality you can try .
SCO tried something similar , trying to accuse IBM of discovery abuse , but it went absolutely nowhere .
And now Psystar asks the judge to sanction Apple for seeking to overseal portions of its summary judgment motion .
Obviously , if Apple 's motion for summary judgment were tossed out , it would protect Psystar from Apple 's disgorgement , punitive damages , and trademark claims , in short , all the reap - what - you - sow part of their business strategy .
Outside of the courtroom , Psystar invites us to violate Apple license with them by offering , for around $ 50 bucks , something new called Rebel EFI , an application it says " allows for the easy installation of multiple operating systems , " including Mac OS X , natch .
TUAW says this about it :
Besides bypassing EFI requirements , Rebel EFI can also detect for Mac OS X compatible and incompatible hardware , and automatically download appropriate drivers .
Skeptical ?
No worries : the app is free to try ( as an ISO download ) , with a two hour time limit .
I found it particularly interesting to see how Apple handles the recent ruling in Vernor v. Autodesk .
Essentially , Apple describes it as a decision out of harmony with cases both before it and since .
But even if the decision were correct , and Apple obviously thinks it was not , the facts are so different that Apple 's position is that it does n't apply to Psystar anyway .
As for the Vernor court 's reliance on United States v. Wise and the concept of permanent ownership meaning a sale and not a license , Apple shows that the court missed an important sentence or two in the Wise decision , which show that certain terms in a license , all of which Apple says it includes , mean that it remains a license no matter what it says about keeping a copy .
Also interesting is that while Psystar says it only passes along the retail DVDs it purchases of Mac OSX , Apple says Psystar has n't proven that with any evidence , and in fact by Apple 's count , Psystar has sold more copies than it paid for , even if first sale covered its activities , which Apple says it does n't .
At most , even if the numbers were identical , first sale would only cover one copy , not the five that Apple claims Psystar makes , nor would it cover the " wholesale " modification and distribution .
" Psystar indisputably adapts Mac OS X when adding , deleting , and substituting kernel extensions to make Mac OS X operate on non-Apple hardware , " Apple states .
Here 's Psystar 's argument in a nutshell about unsealing the documents :
In its order granting the joint motion for a confidentiality order , this Court explained that it was granting the joint motion subject to a list of four conditions .
The fourth condition , citing Kamakana v. Honolulu , 447 F.3d 1172 , 1179 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) , explains that a compelling reason is necessary to seal any part of a dispositive motion and that such a compelling reason will exist only with respect to trade secrets analogous to the recipe for Coca Cola .
See Docket No. 55 at 2 . Certainly material that is publicly available on the Internet does not qualify for Coke - like protection .
Certainly this Court would not close the courtroom for essentially all of the trial in this case , as would be required if all the material designated by Apple as Confidential or Attorneys 
Eyes
Only really merited sealing in a dispositive motion .
The official Coca - Cola recipe has been kept a secret successfully since a medicinal chemist called John Pemberton first wrote it down in 1886 .
These days it is supposedly kept under 24 - hour guard in a vault in Atlanta , Georgia , even though author Mark Pendergrast published it in his exposé of the cola industry For God , Country & Coca - Cola in 1993 .
The company maintains that this recipe is not the same as the one it uses .
I notice that Coke 's recipe did n't lose its trade secret status because of the book .
You can buy that book here .
Here 's the recipe for OpenCola , speaking of recipes , and it 's under the GPL , too .
Did you know that there was a Coke dispenser on the Space Shuttle [ PDF ] in the '90s ?
Yup .
For research purposes , heh heh :
The Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus - 2 ( FGBA - 2 ) payload represents an evolutionary step in carbonated fluids management technology .
For the Coca - Cola Company , the primary corporate sponsor , FGBA - 2 will provide a test bed to determine if carbonated beverages can be produced from separately stored carbon dioxide , water and flavored syrups and determine if the resulting fluids can be made available for consumption without bubble nucleation and resulting foam formation .
Coca - Cola also will be verifying and obtaining additional data on the effects of space flight on changes in taste perception .
Such data might aid in understanding altered tastes in specific target populations on Earth , such as the elderly , and eventually lead to altered beverage formulations that could increase hydration for such individuals and for astronauts .
The sponsor -- BioServe Space Technologies -- is using the technology and lessons learned from this mission to apply to other commercial space life sciences activities including the development of plant growth and cell culture biotechnology facilities , closed environment research facilities and other projects that require management of two - phase fluids .
Payload health and engineering data will be collected along with video images documenting behavior of the carbonated beverages during transfer operations .
I digress .
Apple 's position is that it's a famous trademark , and they get special protection , and on the first - sale issue , it says this : first , Psystar is n't an owner of the copy it buys , it 's a licensee ; and second , even if it were an owner , its behavior goes beyond what first sale allows , in that Psystar modifies and distributes also :
Psystar admits that it copies , modifies and distributes Apple 's copyrighted software , Mac OS X , without Apple 's consent .
Psystar admits that it circumvents - also without Apple 's consent - technological protection measures in Mac OS X in order to cause it to operate on computers that were not designed by Apple and for which the software was never intended .
Thus , unless Psystar can demonstrate that its conduct falls within narrow exceptions to the statutes - and it cannot - Psystar has violated both the Copyright Act , 17 U.S.c. §§ 101 , et seq. , and the Digital Milennium Copyright Act , 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 , et seq .
Psystar attempts to defend against Apple 's copyright infringement and DMCA claims by arguing that it is the " owner " of copies of Mac OS X and , therefore , can do with those copies as it pleases .
This argument fails for two reasons .
First , Psystar is not the owner ; it is a licensee of Mac OS X , and Psystar 's right to use the software is strictly limited by Apple 's license .
Second , even if , contrary to the facts , Psystar were an owner of a copy of Mac OS X , Psystar 's infringing conduct exceeds the limited activities permitted by the " first sale " and " essential step " exceptions in the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. §§ 109 and 117 .
The law squarely prohibits Psystar from modifying , reproducing and distributing Apple 's copyrighted software without Apple 's permission , even if Psystar were deemed an owner of a particular copy .
If Psystar 's interpretation of these doctrines was correct , a customer who purchases a book , movie or music CD would be free to make and sell unlimited reproductions of that work and to publish and distribute derivative works all because the customer is the " owner " of a single copy .
Such a result would completely eviscerate the copyright laws .
Despite its insistence that it has not infringed Apple 's rights , Psystar nevertheless states that it will stipulate to a permanent injunction and an award of nominal damages against it , and then contends that the remainder of Apple 's claims against it are moot .
The relief that Psystar proposes is insufficient .
While Psystar 's infringement should be enjoined , any injunction must be broad enough to prohibit Psystar 's continued unlawful conduct and protect Apple against the recurrence of such conduct .
Furthermore , a trier of fact must determine whether Psystar must disgorge its sales revenue , whether Psystar 's infringement has been willful , and whether punitive damages are appropriate .
So much for the argument that Psystar just buys a copy and then sells it on under the protection of the first - sale doctrine , eh ?
Here 's why Apple would like a broad , permanent injunction :
Second , Apple 's integrated business model will be severely undermined if Psystar is not permanently enjoined from infringing Apple 's copyrights and circumventing its technological protection measures .
Nothing else will stop Psystar from continuing to sell unauthorized copies of Apple software on non-Apple computers .
There is litte doubt that Psystar will use each release of a new version of Mac OS X as a new opportunity to mass reproduce and distribute unauthorized copies of Apple software .
And , if the Court declines to grant a permanent injunction , other software pirates , like Psystar , wil argue that by simply purchasing a retail DVD version of Mac OS X , they too are entitled to mass produce and sell software that Apple has spent many years and hundreds of milions of dollars developing .
I 'll bet you never thought you 'd see Psystar saying this :
It should be clear from the papers that Apple has filed that Apple has spent millions of dollars pursuing this family business , trying to destroy them .
The record is replete with Apples admissions that this entire suit is based on a fierce motive to protect Apples market position by any means possible , legal or otherwise .
This Court should end this vexatious litigation .
It s been millions too much .
Rudy and Robert Pedraza are the founders and , for the moment , remain the dedicated leaders of Psystar .
Here are all the filings :
So , let 's take a look at four of the documents .
I 've left off the headers , except for the titles , and the certificates of service , and the list of cases , and exhibits , just for space and also so I do n't go bananas with details , so look to the PDFs for all that .
There is also a lot more I could describe and explain , but the truth is , just getting all this transcribed was such a chore , and one I could n't delegate , that I need to stop here .
Maybe I can swing back around once I recuperate .
If you were wondering where I 've been all weekend , this is where .
What ?
You thought I flew to Rio to party on the beach ?
I wish .
I 'll start with Psystar 's response to Apple 's summary judgment motion , and then Apple 's opposition to Psystar 's motion for summary judgment , and then the filings about the sealing issue .
I 'm providing links to them because there is so much material , my hope is the links will help you to jump to the parts that interest you most and to go back and forth between the various arguments .
Of course the court filings do n't have those , and I also had to distinguish the footnotes in the various filings .
For anything that matters , then , go by the PDFs , as always .
So , then , it goes like this :
Also , Psystar has now replied to Apple 's motion :

Here then , as text , are the above filings , but not the update by Psystar , in the order of the list I made :
*************************
PSYSTARS RESPONSE TO
APPLES MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
Psystar develops software to enable OS X to run on non-Apple hardware .
Psystar 's software interacts with OS X at its lowest level , the OS X xnu kernel ( " Xnu " ) .
A kernel ( such as Xnu ) provides an interface between higher - level software and underlying hardware resources , and serves to facilitate communications among the various programs a user might run on a computer .

Since Darwin is open source , any member of the public can download the software and use it under the terms of Apples and other parties  open - source licenses .
6
Or they can buy a modified version of Darwin with the proprietary graphical user interface known as OS X :

The construction of a kernel extension is not a hack .
It is something Apple knows about and encourages .
Apple produces and distributes documentation and tools that help programmers with

5
Psystar makes use of Xnus inherent architectural flexibility .
Psystar has written kernel extensions that allow Xnu to run on non-Apple computers .
It is clear that Psystar is free to modify and distribute code that allows Darwin to run on non-Apple hardware .

[ redacted ]
To prevail on its copyright claims , Apple must show that Psystar violated an exclusive right granted to Apple by the Copyright Act .
If Psystar has not violated any such right , then it does not matter , for purposes of analyzing a copyright claim , whether Psystar has violated the SLA .
This is because the breach of a promise in the SLA cannot convert an act that was not copyright infringement into one that is infringement ; at most , breach of the SLA gives rise to a breach - of - contract claim .
Put another way , if Psystars business activities do not invade Apples rights under the Copyright Act , then Psystar does not need any license from Apple to engage in those activities and need not comply with the terms of any such license in order to avoid committing copyright infringement .
A license agreement can be relevant to determining whether a defendant has committed copyright infringement , but only if the defendant has first violated an exclusive right granted by the Copyright Act .
This is because a license can permit what would otherwise be a violation .
Moreover , even if the defendant has violated an exclusive right granted by the Copyright Act and has done so in violation of a license agreement , the defendant has not necessarily committed copyright infringement .
It is copyright infringement only if the term of the license that the defendant violated is a condition of the license , and not a mere covenant .
See , e.g. , Sun Microsystems , Inc. v. Microsoft
8
This Court need not reach the question whether Psystar violated the SLA because Psystar does not rely on any license from Apple .
Psystar contends , instead , that its business activities do not violate any exclusive right that the Copyright Act grants Apple .
Because Psystar does not invade any of Apples copyright rights , it does not need any license from Apple to avoid copyright infringement .
This Court can safely ignore all those parts of Apples motion for summary judgment that rely on the SLA rather than the Copyright Act .
III .
PSYSTAR DID NOT ENGAGE IN COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
Apple contends that Psystar violated three of the exclusive rights granted by the Copyright Act : the reproduction right ; the distribution right ; and the right to create derivative works .
See M. at
9
A. Psystar Does Not Violate Apples Reproduction Right Because Of § 117 And , In The Alternative , Fair Use
[ redacted ]
These copies are made in the course of the imaging process by which Psystar installs copies of Mac OS X on the computers that it sells to end users .
Unauthorized Copy One. [ redacted ]
This is not copyright infringement because it falls under 17 U.S.C. § 117 .
When Psystar installs a copy of OS X on its imaging - station computer , it is merely installing a copy of OS X that it lawfully purchased , as permitted by § 117 .
This would be entirely clear if Psystar were installing OS X on the imaging - station computer directly from the OS X DVD .
Apple contends that installing OS X on the imaging - station computer from the Mac Mini instead of from the OS X DVD transforms this copying into copyright infringement .
Section 117 provides that it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make . . . another copy or adaptation of that computer program . . . as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine .
When Psystar copies OS X to the imaging - station computer , it is the lawful owner of a copy of OS X and is installing a copy of OS X on a computer .
See Psystars Motion for Summary Judgment at 59 .
This is precisely what § 117 permits .
See Psystars Motion for Summary Judgment at 9 -11 .
Section 117 nowhere requires that the copy that is installed on the computer be made directly from the copy of a computer program that the owner owns .
Section 117 provides that the owner of a DVD containing OS X Leopard , as the owner of a copy of a computer program ,  can install OS X Leopard on his computer .
It does not require that this installation be done directly from that DVD .
10
Moreover , in the alternative , it is fair use for Psystar to install copies of OS X that it has a right , as an owner of one OS X DVD per Psystar computer , to install in a more efficient way than by inserting the DVDs in Psystar computers one by one .
In Wall Data , the Ninth Circuit considered the Los Angeles Sheriffs Departments decision to install software on 6,007 computers when it had a license for only 3,663 computers .
The Sheriffs Department claimed that this was fair use because it took steps to ensure that no more than 3,663 users were using the software at any time , even though the software was installed on 6,007 different computers .
The Ninth Circuit rejected this claim of fair use , but stated that using imaging for 6,007 installations would not , in itself , be a problem :
To be clear , we do not hold that a fair use defense is not available simply because the infringer uses technology to make efficient use of its licenses .
The problematic aspect of the Sheriffs Departments use is that it took in excess of what it bargained for , not that it was technologically efficient .
Thus , for example , if the Sheriffs Department had saved time and money by hard drive imaging RUMBA software onto the number of computers for which it had licenses , its ' efficiency ' would not create a problem .
Unauthorized Copy Two .
[ redacted ]
This copying is not copyright infringement for the same reasons as apply to allegedly unauthorized copy one : § 117 permits Psystar to install copies of OS X that it buys on Psystar computers ; and it is fair use to use an imaging station to make the
11
Unauthorized Copy Three .
Copying a computer program into RAM as a result of installing and running that program is precisely the copying that § 117 provides does not constitute copyright infringement for an owner of a computer program .
As the Ninth Circuit explained , permitting copies like this was § 117s purpose :
Section 117 was enacted on the recommendation of CONTU , which noted that [ b ] ecause the placement of any copyrighted work into a computer is the preparation of a copy [ since the program is loaded into the computers memory ] , the law should provide that persons in rightful possession of copies of programs be able to use them freely without fear of exposure to copyright liability .
CONTU Report at 13 .
B. Psystar Does Not Violate Apples Distribution Right Because Of § 109 .
[ redacted ]
As discussed in the next section , Psystar does not agree that the addition of Psystars bootloader and kernel extensions constitutes a modification of OS X. Instead , Psystar contends that it is bundling OS X , unmodified , with Psystars own interoperable software .
It is just as though Psystar were selling computers with both OS X and Microsoft Word installed : it would not be the case in that situation that Psystar had modified 
OS X to include Microsoft Word ( or vice versa ) ; it would be appropriate to say , instead , that Psystar had bundled OS X with Microsoft Word while modifying neither .
Stripped of the inaccurate modification  description , Apples allegation is that Psystar violated its distribution right by selling a package consisting of ( 1 ) a Psystar computer , ( 2 ) a copy of OS X , and ( 3 ) a copy of Psystars bootloader and kernel extensions .
It is only ( 2 ) , the resale of a
12
[ T ]he first sale doctrine provides that where a copyright owner parts with title to a particular copy of his copyrighted work , he divests himself of his exclusive right to vend that particular copy .
While the proprietors other copyright rights ( reprinting , copying , etc. ) remain unimpaired , the exclusive right to vend the transferred copy rests with the vendee , who is not restricted by statute from further transfers of that copy , even though in breach of an agreement restricting its sale .
C. Psystar Does Not Violate Apples Right To Create Derivative Works Because
Psystar Does Not Create Derivative Works
[ redacted ] .
Psystar responds that adding to or replacing parts of OS X without modifying the OS X source or object code and solely as a result of installing on the same computer additional , separate software written by Psystar is not the creation of a derivative work of OS X .
1. Installing multiple pieces of software on a computer does not create a set of derivative works
13
Another way of saying this is that the changes made by Psystar are entirely functional in nature .
With the addition of Psystars kernel extensions , OS X is extended to run on non-Apple computers .
Functional changes to a compilation do not create a new works of authorship ( a necessary element in the creation of a derivative work ) .
See Silverstein v. Penguin Putnam , Inc. , 368 F.3d 77 ( 2d Cir. 2004 ) ( citing Torah Soft Ltd. v. Drosnin , 136 F.Supp.2d 276 , 287 ( S.D.N.Y.2001 ) ) .
2. Apples cases 
Dun & Bradstreet , Strohon , and Artic  are inapposite because they concern defendants who modified the plaintiffs source code or object code , something that Psystar did not do .
This modification was ' large scale , ' and included compilation , link editing , and testing of GMI W - 2 software with the DBS code at customer sites , and modifying the Geac program language code .
He [ a Grace witness ] further stated unequivocally that in fixing bugs and in adding features , Grace consultants have modified DBSs source code .
14
After all , on the contrary view , would the result of installing Microsoft Word be a derivative work not only of Apples OS X but also of Microsofts Word ?
The multiplication of derivative - work claims resulting from Apples view as applied to an ordinary computer running third - party software from many different manufacturers would be bizarre .
Every major software company would need to cross -license its work with the owners of all other programs that it could expect to be installed on the same computer .
This is not the law .
Rather , the law is that installing two programs on the same computer does not create a derivative work even if the result of installing one program is to modify some of the ones and zeroes that make up the other program and even if one programs purpose is to improve or expand the total capabilities of the computer system .
Cf. Wells Fargo & Co. v. WhenU.com , Inc. , 293 F. Supp. 2d 734 , 769 ( E.D. Mich . 2003 ) (  Even if the presence of an overlapping window could be said to change the appearance of the underlying window on a computer screen , the mere alteration of the manner in which an individual consumers computer displays content sent by plaintiffs  websites does not create a ' derivative work . ' " ) .
Apples other two cases both involve two video games from the 1980s , Galaxian and PacMan .
In Strohon , a district - court case from Illinois , the defendant sold physical ROMs ( silicon chips ) that could be plugged into a Pac - Man arcade game in place of some of the Pac - Man ROMs to
15
Strohon and Artic are like Dun & Bradstreet in that the defendant took a base of code made by the plaintiff and modified that code to make a new , upgraded version of the plaintiffs product that the defendant called his own .
Strohon and Artic are OS Eleven cases .
Neither case is analogous to the case at bar because , here , Psystar does not create a new and upgraded operating system ; it merely installs its own code along with OS X .
This code enhances the operation of the resulting computer , just as third - party drivers help a computer work with hardware like scanners or printers and just as third - party application software like Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer helps a computer to surf the web or do other tasks .
But the fact that third - party code lets a computer do what it could not do before does not mean that installing that code creates a derivative work of the operating system .
It is only when the third - party code creates a new version of the operating system , and not a separate and distinct program , that a derivative - work problem arises .
D. Psystar Owns The Copies Of OS X That It Buys .
[ redacted ]
16
E. Section 117 Applies To Psystars Installation Of Copies Of OS X .
[ redacted ] .
1. Psystar has not waived its § 117 defense .
However , to the extent that the court finds § 117 is an affirmative defense , Psystar has pled it .
The eighth affirmative defense states that Psystar has not infringed any alleged copyright in this case .
Psystar Corporations Answer to Apple Inc.s First Amended Complaint , p. 18 .
While not mentioning the section by name , Psystar describes the substance of a § 117 defense : that a narrow category of copying is lawful .
17
2. Section 117 applies to Psystar even though Psystar installs copies of OS X for the ultimate purpose of resale to end users .
Formula I has nothing to do with § 117 at all .
The case nowhere considers whether § 117 would protect the defendants actions .
Indeed , it is not clear whether the defendant owned legitimate copies of Apples software or , instead , owned pirated copies , in which case § 117 would not apply .
At issue was whether Apples software programs were copyrightable expressive works or uncopyrightable ideas or algorithms .
See Formula I , 562 F. Supp. at 77883 .
This ( except as to the haiku when used as a key ) is not at issue in the case at bar .
Formula II considers whether purchasing a lawful copy of Apple software then copying that software not onto a computer , but onto silicon chips that can be plugged into a computer by the end user , is protected by § 117 .
The court held that this copying was not protected for two alternative
18
Neither reason stated in Formula II is applicable to Psystar .
Psystar does not sell kit computers ; like Dell , it assembles complete computer systems and sells these working computers to end -users .
Because Psystar installs Apples software on its own computers as an essential step for the use of Apples software on those computers , Psystar falls squarely within § 117 .
Even while the computers are at Psystar , Psystar can use them to run OS X .
The installation is an internal use . 
Moreover , because OS X , unlike the Apple software at issue in Formula II , cannot be run from the disk , the installation of that software is an essential step in using OS X so that this installation falls within § 117 .
Psystar does not make a copy of OS X onto a separate component for later , external installation in a computer ; it installs its copies of OS X onto working computers internally at Psystar .
IV . PSYSTAR DID NOT VIOLATE THE DMCA .
[ redacted ]
Psystar responds that it did not violate the DMCA because ( 1 ) any circumvention did not facilitate infringement and therefore did not violate the DMCA , see Chamberlain Group , Inc. v. Skylink Technologies , Inc. , 381 F.3d 1178 ( 7th Cir. 2004 ) ; Realnetworks , Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Assn , No. C-08-4548-MHP , 2009 WL 2475338 ( N.D. Cal. 2009 ) ( adopting Chamberlain ) ; Storage Technology Corp. v. Custom Hardware Engineering & Consulting Inc. , 421 F.3d 1307 ( Fed. Cir. 2005 ) ; and ( 2 ) Apples anti-circumvention technology is wholly ineffective because the key has been publicly available on the Internet for years , see Lexmark Intl , Inc. v. Static Control Components , Inc. , 387 F.3d 522 , 547 ( 6th Cir. 2004 ) .
19
V. COPYRIGHT MISUSE
Apple misstates the doctrine of copyright misuse .
First , neither proof of an antitrust violation nor a showing of market power is necessary to prevail on a defense of copyright misuse .
See Practice Mgmt. Info . Corp. v. American Med. Ass'n , 121 F.3d 516 , 521 ( 9th Cir. 1997 ) ( " a defendant in a copyright infringement suit need not prove an antitrust violation to prevail on a copyright misuse defense ) .
Second , public policy underlying copyright strongly opposes a copyright owner using his copyrights to gain commercial control over products that are not protected under copyright law .
In re Napster , Inc. , Copyright Litigation , 191 F. Supp. 2d 1087 , 1105 ( N.D. Cal. 2004 ) ( noting that unduly restrictive copyright licensing agreements  can constitute misuse ) .
The cases cited by Apple bear no resemblance to the issues at hand .
In Bell Atlantic Business Systems Services , Inc. v. Hitachi Data Systems Corp. , the court rejected the misuse defense because the defendant had alleged no other basis for copyright misuse . . . [ b ] eyond the [ dismissed ] antitrust claims . 
1995 WL 836331 at * 11 ( N.D. Cal . ) .
Similarly , in Service & Training , Inc. v. Data General Corp. , the court held that even though 'a misuse need not be a violation of antitrust law in order to comprise an equitable defense to an infringement action ,  appellants have offered no evidence of copyright misuse beyond the previously rejected tying claim .
963 F.2d 680 ( 4th Cir. 1992 ) .
Here , by contrast , Psystar does not offer recycled theories of antitrust violations .
Apples contention that courts have consistently upheld the license restrictions  found in the SLA is not supported by the two cases it cites ( never mind the irrelevance of this argument ) .
In fact , Apples first case , Triad Systems , is an excellent case to support Psystars position that the sale of software copies extinguishes certain copyrights in the copyright holder :
Triad software customers are subject to three different contractual arrangements .
From 1976 to 1985 , Triad sold its software outright to customers (  Regime 1  ) .
Because
20
Regime 1 customers own their software , they have rights under the Copyright Act to make or authorize the making of copies in the operation of their computers .
As a result , such copies are noninfringing , even if they are made by Southeastern in the course of servicing Regime 1 customers ' computers .
Triad therefore concedes that Southeastern cannot be barred from making use of software owned by Regime 1 customers .
Apples second case , Microsoft Corp. v. BEC Computer Co. , Inc. , arose from the defendants distribution of stand - alone copies of the licensed software , which the license prohibited , for less than the prices required in the license agreement .
818 F. Supp. 1313 ( C.D. Cal. 1992 ) .
Because Psystar paid for every copy of OS X Leopard that it installed , BEC Computer is inapposite .
We now know from the record that Apple fully intended  with singular focus  to use copyright law to enforce the tethering of OS X to Apple hardware .
Witness after witness presented by Apple testified to Apples intention to implement certain technological features whose sole purpose is to provide offensive legal weaponry against any user that attempts to use OS X on nonApple hardware :

VI . MILLIONS TOO MUCH
We need not repeat the misuse arguments made in Psystars Motion for Summary Judgment at 20  24 ( incorporated by reference ) .
Instead , we simply and respectfully request that the Court deny Apple 's motion and provide Psystar the relief it deserves .
Psystar is a company not unlike many thousands of other small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy .
Rudy and Robert Pedraza are the founders and , for the moment , remain the dedicated leaders of Psystar .
They are assisted by a small group of employees , many of whom are also family .
The Pedrazas are proud Cuban - Americans who embody the spirit of innovation and hard work of which all of us , as Americans , are so justly proud .
It should be clear from the papers that Apple has filed that Apple has spent millions of dollars pursuing this family business , trying to destroy them .

**********************************************
APPLE INC .'S OPPOSITION TO
PSYSTAR CORPORATION'S MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
PUBLIC VERSION
[ REDACTED ]
[ back to top ]
I. INTRODUCTION
Psystar admits that it copies , modifies and distributes Apple 's copyrighted software , Mac OS X , without Apple 's consent .
Psystar admits that it circumvents - also without Apple 's consent - technological protection measures in Mac OS X in order to cause it to operate on computers that were not designed by Apple and for which the software was never intended .
Thus , unless Psystar can demonstrate that its conduct falls within narrow exceptions to the statutes - and it cannot - Psystar has violated both the Copyright Act , 17 U.S.c. §§ 101 , et seq. , and the Digital Milennium Copyright Act , 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 , et seq .
Psystar attempts to defend against Apple 's copyright infringement and DMCA claims by arguing that it is the " owner " of copies of Mac OS X and , therefore , can do with those copies as it pleases .
This argument fails for two reasons .
First , Psystar is not the owner ; it is a licensee of Mac OS X , and Psystar 's right to use the software is strictly limited by Apple 's license .
Second , even if , contrary to the facts , Psystar were an owner of a copy of Mac OS X , Psystar 's infringing conduct exceeds the limited activities permitted by the " first sale " and " essential step " exceptions in the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. §§ 109 and 117 .
The law squarely prohibits Psystar from modifying , reproducing and distributing Apple 's copyrighted software without Apple 's permission , even if Psystar were deemed an owner of a particular copy .
If Psystar 's interpretation of these doctrines was correct , a customer who purchases a book , movie or music CD would be free to make and sell unlimited reproductions of that work and to publish and distribute derivative works all because the customer is the " owner " of a single copy .
Such a result would completely eviscerate the copyright laws .
Psystar argues that even if it has infringed , Apple cannot enforce its copyrights because it has misused them .
But Psystar has presented no evidence to support either ground for copyright misuse .
First , there is no evidence that Apple has market power and has misused it , an issue already addressed earlier in this case .
Second , Psystar offers no evidence - because none exists - that Apple has used its copyrights to subvert the goals of the Copyright Act.
Psystar 's argument that it is not liable for trademark and trade dress infringement should similarly be rejected .
Psystar admits that it uses Apple 's trademarks and trade dress to promote
1
Despite its insistence that it has not infringed Apple 's rights , Psystar nevertheless states that it wil stipulate to a permanent injunction and an award of nominal damages against it , and then contends that the remainder of Apple 's claims against it are moot .
The relief that Psystar proposes is insufficient .
While Psystar 's infringement should be enjoined , any injunction must be broad enough to prohibit Psystar 's continued unlawful conduct and protect Apple against the recurrence of such conduct .
Furthermore , a trier of fact must determine whether Psystar must disgorge its sales revenue , whether Psystar 's infringement has been wilful , and whether punitive damages are appropriate .
As revealed by their simultaneous motions for summary judgment , Apple and Psystar agree there are no material issues of fact regarding Apple 's claims that Psystar has engaged in copyright infringement and violated the DMCA .
As demonstrated below , and in Apple 's motion for summary judgment , the law and facts require entry of judgment in Apple 's favor on those claims .
II .
STATEMENT OF FACTS
The statement of facts Psystar includes in its motion is incomplete and misleading .
Moreover , when describing its own activities , Psystar 's statement of facts is totally devoid of citations to admissible evidence .
Nonetheless , the facts that are actually relevant to this case , which are set forth below , are undisputed .
A. Apple 's Software License Agreement
It is uncontested that Apple sells boxes containing DVDs on which its copyrighted Mac OS X software is written .
( Psystar Br. at 5 . ) Apple includes a Software License Agreement ( " SLA " ) with its software that specifically states that " Apple and / or Apple 's licensor ( s ) retain ownership of the Apple Software itself . "
( Psystar Br. at 6 and Ex . A at § 1 . )
The SLA also states :
2
BY USING THE APPLE SOFTWARE , YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE .
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE , DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE .
This License allows you to install , use and run one ( 1 ) copy of a single Apple - labeled computer as at time .
You agree not to install , use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple - labeled computer , or to enable others to do so .
B. Psystar Copies And Modifies Mac OS X To Create A Psystar Computer
Psystar contends that it purchases a Mac OS X DVD at retail ( the " Retail DVD Version " ) for each computer it sells , and Psystar claims that it includes the Retail DVD Version with each computer it ships to its customers .
( Psystar Br. at 9 - 10 . )
But Psystar does not install the software written on that Retail DVD Version onto each Psystar computer .
Instead , as ilustrated below , Psystar makes at least three infringing copies of Mac OS X during its manufacturing process and never actually utilizes the Retail DVD Version that it allegedly includes with each computer .
3
Psystar 's Copying Process
Psystar copies the hard drive of a Macintosh computer containing Mac OS X ( as depicted above on the left side of the diagram ) onto its " imaging station " computer ( shown in the middle of the diagram ) .
This is the first unlawful copy .
Psystar then modifies this copy of Mac OS X to create a " master copy " that wil run on non-Apple computers .
A1 Psystar next uses " hard drive imaging " to install copies of its " master copy " of Mac OS XA1 from the imaging station onto each computer it assembles .
A3
This is the second unlawful copy ( a process repeated many times ) .
Finally , every time Psystar turns on any of the Psystar computers running Mac OS X , which it
4
does before shipping each computer , Psystar necessarily makes a separate modified copy of Mac OS X in Random Access Memory , or " RAM . " A4 This is the third unlawful copy .
As this process shows , the Mac OS X software installed on Psystar computers is a different copy of the software than the Retail DVD Version .
The installed version has been modified so that it can run on Psystar 's hardware .
Indeed , when Psystar demonstrated its manufacturing process to Apple 's expert , Dr. John Kelly , he confirmed that Psystar never uses the Retail DVD Version Psystar claims to include with the computers it sells .
A5
It is undisputed that Psystar modifies Mac OS X and circumvents Apple 's technological protection measures so that Mac OS X is capable of running on Psystar computers .
A6 Psystar agrees that Apple 's expert , Dr. Kelly , " clearly describe[s ] " Psystar 's method for circumventing Apple 's security mechanism in Mac OS X. ( Psystar Br. at 15 . )
A7
5
C. Psystar Uses Apple 's Trademarks And Trade Dress To Advertise Its Computers
When Psystar advertises and sells its computers running Mac OS X , it knowingly trades on Apple 's famous trademarks and its trade dress to deliberately target customers already interested in buying an Apple computer .
In an obvious attempt to capitalize on Apple 's goodwil , Psystar first called its computer the " OpenMac . " ( Psystar Answer ¶ 12 . )
Psystar 's advertisements extensively use Apple 's trade dress and Apple and Mac logos .
A11 More than 75 percent of Psystar 's text ads include an Apple trademark or trade name .
A13
In addition , Psystar uses Apple 's word marks APPLE and MAC in the address of certain pages within its website ( the URL ) , such as " www.Psystar.com/OpenMac. " A14 Also , Psystar created URLs that will deliberately attract people seeking to buy an Apple computer .
A15 And Psystar purchased search terms from Google and Yahoo ! based upon Apple 's marks and products , so that Google or Yahoo !
users searching for an Apple computer or Mac OS X are distracted , confused , and diverted by Psystar ads .
A16 Thus , Psystar has deliberately targeted its advertising to consumers already interested in buying an Apple computer .
III .
ARGUMENT
Psystar has presented no evidence to dispute that it copies , modifies , and distributes Mac OS X without Apple 's consent .
The facts set forth above , and in Apple 's Motion for Summary Judgment , establish that Psystar has infringed Apple 's copyrights and trademarks and violated the DMCA .
Psystar therefore relies on certain legal defenses , including the first sale and essential
6
step doctrines , copyright misuse , and nominative fair use in an attempt to defend against Apple 's claims .
For the reasons set forth below , each of Psystar 's arguments fails .
A. The First Sale Doctrine Does Not Excuse Psystar 's Conduct
Psystar cannot excuse its infringement of Apple 's copyrights by relying on the " first sale " doctrine .
The " first sale " rule , 17 U.S.C. § 109 ( a ) , only allows the owner of a " particular copy " to " dispose of the possession of that copy . "
This applies strictly to the " particular " physical copy as " purchased and nothing else . "
Mirage Editions , Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co. , 856 F.2d 1341 , 1344 ( 9th Cir. 1988 ) ( emphasis added ) .
" Section 109 does not authorize adaptation and reproduction of a copyrighted work . "
Midway Mfg. Co. v. Strohon , 564 F. Supp. 741 , 745 ( N.D. Ill. 1983 ) .
Moreover , section 109 does not supersede the copyright holder 's exclusive right to create derivative works .
Mirage , 856 F.2d at 1341 , 1344 ; Midway , 564 F. Supp. at 741 .
Psystar argues that because it " owns " the DVD on which Mac OS X is written , it is entitled to ( 1 ) modify Mac OS X and create derivative works , ( 2 ) make and distribute unlimited copies of Mac OS X , and ( 3 ) circumvent Apple 's technological protection measures .
Psystar 's argument is profoundly wrong .
1. Psystar May Not Assert The First Sale Doctrine Because It Is A Licensee , Not An Owner , Of Mac OS X
7
The SLA 's express terms , which impose significant limitations and prohibitions on the use and disposition of Apple 's software , confirm that the purchasers of Mac OS X are licensees , not owners , and therefore are not entitled to assert section 109 as a defense to infringement .
Among the SLA 's restrictions are ( 1 ) prohibitions against unauthorized uses ofthe software ( SLA § 2A ) ; prohibitions against renting , redistributing , or sub-licensing ( SLA § 3 ) ; ( 3 ) limitations on transfer ( SLA § 3 ) ; ( 4 ) limitations on copying the software ( SLA §§ 2C and 2 F ) ; ( 4 ) prohibitions on modifying the software ( SLA § 2 F ) ; ( 5 ) automatic termination in case of breach ( SLA § 5 ) ; and ( 6 ) mandatory destruction of the software in case of breach ( SLA § 5 ) .
Such profound restrictions are wholly inconsistent with Psystar 's claimed " ownership " of the software and , instead , conclusively identify a license transaction .
See , e.g. , Stargate Software , 216 F. Supp. 2d at 1057 - 58 ( finding that terms similar to the SLA " substantially and undeniably interfere [ d ] with . . . [ the ] ability to distribute and / or convey title to the products in question " ) ; One Stop Micro , 84 F. Supp. 2d at 1091 - 92 ( " [ N]umerous restrictions imposed by Adobe indicate a license rather than a sale because they undeniably interfere with the reseller 's ability to further distribute the software . " ) ;
Novell , Inc. v. Unicom Sales , Inc. , No. C-03-2785 , 2004 WL 1839117 , at * 11 ( N.D. CaL. 2004 ) ( reservation by copyright owner of all rights not expressly granted and automatic termination for breach indicate a license ) .
Psystar quotes a single clause from the SLA providing that the licensee owns the " media on which the Apple software is recorded , " and argues that this somehow supports Psystar 's ownership of the software .
Psystar is wrong .
The plain meaning of this phrase is that Psystar owns only the disk , not the software written upon it .
The Copyright Act makes clear that " [ o ] wnership of a copyright , or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright , is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied . "
17 U.S.C. § 202 . Transfer of the " material object " in which the work is " fixed " does not convey rights in the work itself .
Id. ; see also Serv. & Training , Inc. V. Data Gen. Corp. , 963 F.2d 680 , 687 n.13 ( 4th Cir. 1992 ) .
8
Vernor v. Autodesk provides little support for Psystar 's argument that it owns a copy of Mac OS X and is therefore entitled to assert first sale and essential step defenses .
Vernor v. Autodesk , Inc. , 555 F. Supp. 2d 1164 ( W.D. Wash . 2008 ) ( " Vernor l " ) and Vernor v. Autodesk , Inc. , No. C07-1189 , 2009 WL 3187613 ( W.D. Wash . Sept. 30 , 2009 ) ( " Vernor II " ) .
First , as the Vernor court itself noted , its holding is inconsistent with recent Ninth Circuit case law finding that software licenses precluded the defendants in those cases from asserting the first sale and essential step doctrines : Wall Data , Inc. v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department , 447 F.3d 769 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) , Triad Systems Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co. , 64 F.3d 1330 ( 9th Cir. 1995 ) and MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer , Inc. , 991 F.2d 511 ( 9th Cir. 1993 ) .
The Vernor court acknowledged that :
If the court were to apply this trio of precedent ( the " MAI trio " ) to the license before it , it would conclude that Autodesk did not sell AutoCAD copies to ( the purchaser ) .
The terms of the Autodesk License are either indistinguishably similar to or more restrictive than the licenses found not to be sales in the MAI trio .
Furthermore , even if Vernor did apply , the holding is extremely narrow .
The court found that Mr. Vernor could resell on eBay the genuine AutoCAD software discs he had purchased .
Mr. Vernor did not modify the AutoCAD software ; he did not create a master copy of the software to use for mass duplication ; he did not pre-install the AutoCAD software onto computers while retaining the master copy ; nor did he circumvent a technological protection measure to do all of the above .
None of these infringing activities is permitted by section 109 , even if the infringer is deemed an owner .
Because Psystar does all of these things , Vernor does not immunize Psystar 's infringement .
Similarly , Psystar 's argument that United States v. Wise , 550 F.2d 1180 ( 9th Cir. 1977 ) , the case on which Vernor primarily relies , excuses its actions , should be rejected .
Wise addressed whether the transfer of certain film reels and prints constituted sales .
Psystar argues that under Vernor and Wise , because a " buyer " of a Mac OS X DVD " may keep the DVD indefinitely , " a
9
The only transaction the court in Wise determined was a " sale " was the so - called Redgrave Contract ( Wise , 550 F.2d at 1191 - 92 ) , in which Warner Brothers gave actress Vanessa Redgrave a print of " Camelot . "
The Redgrave Contract nowhere stated that it was a license .
Instead it stated that Redgrave " will pay [ Warner Brothers ] our cost for said print " and " [ s ] aid print is furnished for your personal use and enjoyment and shall be retained in your possession at all times . "
Wise , 550 F.2d at 1192 .
The Redgrave Contract further had no termination or destruction provisions .
Id.A20 By contrast , Apple 's SLA states unequivocally that it is a license and includes destruction and termination provisions .
See also Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp. , 279 F.2d at 103 ( agreement is a license where rights are " expressly restricted " and the agreement is called a " license " - even if there " was no requirement that outstanding prints and negatives were to be returned " ) .
10
2. Even If Psystar May Assert The First Sale Doctrine , Psystar 's Copying , Modifcation , And Distribution Of Mac OS X Constitute Copyright Infringement
Furthermore , the undisputed facts establish that Psystar modifies every copy of Mac OS X that it installs so that Mac OS X can run on Psystar 's computers .
None of these modified copies is permitted by section 109 because none constitutes the " particular copy " of Mac OS X that Psystar purchased .
Mirage , 856 F.2d at 1344 ( first sale doctrine did not apply to the defendant 's sale of prints that the defendant removed from a book it purchased and then framed and resold ; " the derivative works right , remains unimpaired and with the copyright proprietor " ) .
Thus , even if Psystar owns a particular copy of Mac OS X , it stil has infringed Apple 's copyrights by modifying Mac OS X and creating multiple unauthorized derivative works .
Psystar 's argument that it is absolved of liability for copyright infringement because it allegedly purchases and redistributes a genuine Retail DVD Version of Mac OS X with each of its computers should be rejected .
Psystar offers no evidence that it actually ships a Retail DVD Version of Mac OS X with each of its computers , and its motion fails for this lack of admissible
11
evidence alone .21
Even assuming Psystar could prove that it included the Retail DVD Version with each computer it shipped , Psystar would at most be entitled to assert the first sale doctrine with respect to that particular copy of the Retail DVD Version .
As discussed above , Psystar is not entitled to assert the first sale doctrine with respect to the three types of unauthorized copies and any modified copies that Psystar makes , and all of these copies infringe Apple 's copyrights .
B. Psystar 's Copying Is Not Excused By The " Essential Step " Exception
Psystar glosses over the clear limitations of the " essential step " rule , which establishes a narrow exception to the general prohibition against unlawful copying of copyrighted works and further restricts distribution of such copies .
See 17 U.S.C. § 117(a ) -( b ) .
Psystar waived this defense by not pleading it22 and , in any event , it has no merit .
The " essential step " defense is intended to ensure only that an owner - user of software can make a single copy of the software program by loading it onto a computer and using it , or can transfer that " exact copy " without violating copyright law .
See 17 U.S.C. § 117 ; Apple Computer , Inc. v. Formula Int'l , Inc. , 594 F. Supp. 617 , 621-22 ( C.D. Cal. 1984 ) , aff'd 725 F.2d 521 ( 9th Cir. 1984 ) .
Nothing in the statute , or cases interpreting it , suggests that section 117 immunizes Psystar 's wholesale copying and modification of Mac OS X for the purpose of distributing it for commercial gain on unauthorized platforms to Apple 's competitive disadvantage .
12
1. Psystar May Not Assert A Section 117 Defense Because It Is Not An " Owner " Of The Software
2. Psystar 's Conduct Exceeds The Narrow Scope Of Section 117's Essential Step Defense
13
Psystar argues that Krause v. Titleserv , Inc. , 402 F.3d 119 ( 2d Cir. 2005 ) , somehow indicates that section 117 would protect its unauthorized copying , modification , and distribution of Mac OS X .
To the contrary , the Krause court expressly recognized that section 117 permits the owner to take only those steps necessary for the owner to enable the use for which the copyrighted
14
work was both sold and purchased .
Id. at 128 .
As the SLA expressly provides , Mac OS X is sold exclusively for use on Apple computers .
Psystar 's copying and adaptation of Mac OS X are directly contrary to that purpose .
Furthermore , the Krause court noted that the rights permitted under section 117 " could 'only be exercised so long as they did not harm the interests of the copyright proprietor . ' "
Id. at 129 ( quoting Final Report of the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works ( 1978 ) at 13 , available at http://digital-law-online.info/CONTU/PDF/index.html ( hereinafter cited as the " CONTU Report " ) ) .
The court stated that section 117 therefore would not apply " if the altered copy of [ plaintiff 's ] work were to be marketed by the owner of the copy . "
Id. at 129 .
Psystar modifies Mac OS X , markets the modified copies of Mac OS X , and sells them in competition with Apple .
That activity is not allowed by section 117 under any circumstance .
See , e.g. , Apple Computer , Inc. v. Formula Int'l , Inc. , 562 F. Supp. 775 ( C.D. CaL. 1984 ) , aff'd 725 F.2d 521 ( 9th Cir. 1984 ) ; Apple Computer , Inc. v. Formula , Int'l , Inc. , 594 F. Supp. at 620 ( rejecting arguments that section 117 authorized creation and distribution of computer " kits " using copies of Apple 's operating system software ) .
[ redacted ]
Psystar has infringed Apple 's copyrights with respect to " Mac OS , Mac OS X , Mac OS X version 10.5 , and Mac OS X Server , individual files constituting components of Mac OS , Mac OS X , Mac OS X version 10.5 , and Mac OS X Server , as well as various files constituting components of other Apple software and firmware found on Apple labeled computers . "
( Amended Complaint ( Docket No. 38 ) ¶ 26 . )
It is undisputed that an operating system , like Mac OS X , is entitled to copyright protection .
See , e.g. , Triad Sys. , 64 F.2d at 1333 .
Indeed , in Lexmark Int'l Inc. v. Static Control Components , Inc. , 387 F.3d 522 ( 6th Cir. 2004 ) , the case upon which Psystar relies , the court
15
emphasized that unlike the printer lock - out code at issue in that case , Apple 's operating system is precisely the type of creative expression entitled to copyright protection .

The Lexmark court stated that Apple Computer , Inc. v. Formula Int'l , 725 F.2d at 525 , which the plaintiff had cited , was distinguishable from Lexmark , noting that comparing Apple 's operating system to the plaintiff 's lock - out code was like comparing " the Sears Tower ... to a lamppost . "
Id . Distinguishing Apple 's operating software , the Lexmark court stated , " Given the nature of the Apple program , it would have been exceedingly difficult to say that practical alternative means of expression did not exist and indeed no defendant in the cases advanced that argument . "

D. Apple Has Not Misused Its Copyrights
Although Psystar contends that Apple has misused its copyrights , Psystar has failed to explain what Apple has done that allegedly constitutes copyright misuse .
Psystar does not contend that the SLA provisions constitute copyright misuse ; indeed , Psystar admits that Apple can lawfully license its software for use only on non-Apple hardware .
( Psystar Br. at 3 . )
While Psystar 's brief has a footnote citing a few early antitrust cases , it makes no effort whatsoever to introduce evidence that Apple has acted in any anticompetitive way because there is no such evidence .
( Psystar Br. at 21 , n. 7 . ) This Court already rejected Psystar 's antitrust allegations , stating : " Apple asks its customers to purchase Mac OS knowing that it is to be used only with Apple computers .
It is certainly entitled to do so . "
Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp. , 586 F. Supp. 2d 1190 , 1201 ( N.D. Cal. 2008 ) ( also available at Docket No. 33 at 14 ) .
Rather , it appears Psystar is arguing that Apple has misused its copyrights by filing this lawsuit and " continu[ing ] to prosecute " allegedly invalid copyright infringement and DMCA claims .
( Psystar Br. at 22 ; 23 -24 ) .
Psystar cites several cases , none of which support this baseless assertion and all of which are factually distinguishable .
See Altera Corp. v. Clear Logic , Inc. , 424 F.3d 1079 , 1090 ( 9th Cir. 2005 ) ( finding copyright misuse defense could not apply where the plaintiff had not asserted copyright infringement claims ) ; Assessment Techs. of WI LLC v. WIREdata , Inc. , 350 F.3d 640 , 647-648 ( 7th Cir. 2003 ) ( finding copyright misuse when plaintiff asserted copyright infringement against defendant for seeking access to public data that was not copyrighted ) ; Qad , Inc. v. ALN Assoc. , Inc. , 770 F. Supp. 1261 , 1267-1270 ( N.D. Ill. 1991 ) , aff'd 974 F.2d 834 ( 7th Cir. 1992 ) ( finding copyright misuse when the plaintiff alleged copying of software that it had copied itself and in which it had no rights ) ; Schloss v. Sweeney , 515 F. Supp. 2d 1068 , 1079 - 81 ( N.D. Cal. 2007 ) ( refusing to grant motion to dismiss claim for copyright misuse when defendant had no copyrights in medical records and other materials ) .
A29
17
As demonstrated above , Apple 's copyright and DMCA claims are meritorious and their filing cannot constitute copyright misuse .
To the contrary , Apple has a constitutional right to enforce its copyrights in federal court unless the lawsuit is both objectively baseless and filed for an improper purpose .
Prof'l Real Estate Investors v. Columbia Pictures , 508 U.S. 49 , 60 - 61 , 113 S. Ct. 1920 , 1928 ( 1993 ) ; Freeman v. Lasky , Haas & Cohler , 410 F.3d 1180 , 1183 - 85 ( 9th Cir. 2005 ) .
Psystar makes no attempt to prove either that this lawsuit is a sham or was filed for an improper purpose , and it is not .
Therefore , this lawsuit itself cannot be the basis for a claim of copyright misuse .
A30
E. Psystar Fails To Establish Any Defense To Apple 's DMCA Claims
To succeed on its DMCA circumvention ( section 1201 ( a ) ( 1 ) ) and trafficking ( sections 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) and 1201 ( b ) ) claims ,
Apple need only show that its technological protection measures prevent access to or copying of copyrighted material ( here , Mac OS X ) and that Psystar 's circumvention technology facilitates access to or copying of the software .
Davidson & Assocs. v. Jung , 422 F.3d 630,640 ( 8th Cir. 2005 ) ; Universal City Studios , Inc. v. Corley , 273 F.3d 429 , 441 ( 2d Cir. 2001 ) ; RealNetworks " Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n , _ F. Supp. 2d _ , 2009 WL 2475338 ( N.D. Cal. Aug. 11 , 2009 ) ; 321 Studios v. Metro- Goldwyn - Mayer Studios , Inc. , 307 F. Supp. 2d 1085 , 1094 ( N.D. Cal. 2004 ) .
As set forth more fully in Apple 's Motion for Summary Judgment , the facts entitling Apple to prevail on its DMCA claims are not in dispute .
( Apple 's Summary Judgment Br. at 22-25 . )
Apple embeds a " key " within its hardware that unlocks encrypted code and permits Mac OS X to boot up and run , measures very similar to those taken by the entertainment industry to prevent films and video games from being accessed on unauthorized platforms .
See , e.g. , Davidson , 422 F.3d at 640-41 ( CD key embedded in online video game
18
software was effective because it prohibited the games from playing on unauthorized web servers ) ;
Corley , 273 F.3d at 444 ( encryption technology with decryption keys embedded in approved DVD player hardware prevented users from viewing the DVD " on a competing platform " ) ; RealNetworks , 2009 WL 2475338 , at * 62 ( DVD decryption prevented copying or playing DVDs on an unauthorized " hard drive or portable drive " ) .
Psystar has violated the DMCA because it has used and distributed software code , [ redacted ] thus enabling the installation and copying of Mac OS X on unauthorized hardware .
1. Psystar Concedes The Facts Establishing Its Liabilty Under The DMCA
2. Psystar 's Legal Arguments Under The DMCA Are Unavailng
As a matter of law , Apple need not prove copyright infringement to succeed on its circumvention and trafficking claims .
See 17 U.S.c. § 1201 ; Universal City Studios , Inc. v. Reimerdes , 111 F. Supp. 2d 294 , 329 ( S.D.N.Y. 2000 ) ( overriding concern of the DMCA was " promoting the distribution of copyrighted works in digital form while at the same time protecting
19
those works from piracy and other violations of the exclusive rights of copyright holders " ) ( emphasis added ) .
It is irrelevant whether downstream customers use the trafficker 's technology to engage in infringing or , instead , " fair use " of the copyrighted work .
See RealNetworks , 2009 WL 2475338 , at * 27 ( " Fair use is not a defense to trafficking in products used to circumvent effective technological measures that prevent unauthorized access to , or unauthorized copying of , a copyrighted work " ) ; 321 Studios , 307 F. Supp. 2d at 1097 ( " the downstream uses of the software by the customers of 321 , whether legal or ilegal , are not relevant to determining whether 321 itself is violating the statute " ) ; Sony Computer Entm't Am. , Inc. v. Divineo , Inc. , 457 F. Supp. 2d 957 , 965 ( N.D. Cal. 2006 ) ( " downstream customers ' lawful or fair use of circumvention devices does not relieve ( defendant ) from liability for trafficking in such devices under the DMCA " ) ; see also Corley , 273 F.3d at 443 .
Requiring DMCA plaintiffs to prove copyright infringement would render the DMCA superfluous and negate the very protections the statute was intended to promote .
Apple need only establish that its technological protection measures guard material that is " reasonably related " to the interests that the Copyright Act was intended to protect .
See Chamberlain Group , Inc. v. Skylink Techs. , Inc. , 381 F.3d 1178 , 1195 ( Fed. Cir. 2004 ) .A31
Apple 's protections undoubtedly relate to interests protected by the Copyright Act because Mac OS X is a copyright - protected work .
Psystar 's emphasis on Lexmark illustrates the profound differences between that case and Apple 's claims .
Mac OS X - which is filled with expressive content - could not be more different than the simple code in Lexmark that merely checked the source of a printer cartridge .
The Lexmark court emphasized this important distinction : " Unlike the code underlying video games or DVDs , ' using ' or executing the Printer Engine Program does not in turn create any protected expression . "
Lexmark , 387 F.3d at 548 ; see also Chamberlain , 381 F.3d at 1199 ( noting that in cases finding a DMCA violation , " the access alleged in all three cases was intertwined with a
20
Psystar also argues that the DMCA was intended to prevent " piracy , " and that Apple , in order to succeed on a DMCA claim , would have to establish that its technological protection measures were designed to prevent someone from physically reproducing DVDs containing Mac OS X. ( Psystar Br. at 16 . )
But courts have refused to import any such requirement into the DMCA .
321 Studio , 307 F. Supp. 2d at 1096 ( rejecting argument that because the circumvention technology worked only with the " original DVDs , " there could be no DMCA violation ) .
Psystar quotes
Apple testimony in an attempt to create confusion over whether the Apple encrypted binaries are access protections intended to prevent the use of Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware or copy protections intended to prevent duplication .
This is an irrelevant distinction because both are entitled to DMCA protection .
Compare 17 U.S.C. § 1201 ( a ) ( access protections ) and 17 U.S.C. § 1201 ( b ) ( copy protections ) ; see Corley , 273 F.3d at 440-441 .
Furthermore , Apple 's technological protection measures are both access and copy controls because the purpose and function of Apple 's access- protection is to prevent unauthorized installation and running ( i.e. , copying ) of Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware .
See 321 Studios , 307 F. Supp. 2d at 1097 ( though defendant was " technically correct that CSS controls access to encrypted DVDs , the purpose of this access control is to control copying of those DVDs , since encrypted DVDs cannot be copied unless they are accessed " ) .
While Mac OS
X's protection mechanisms may not technically prevent the literal duplication of the media ( a futile act for the user if the software will not run on a computer ) , they nonetheless stop copyright infringement by preventing the unauthorized installation and use ( and therefore access and copying ) of Mac OS X. Davidson , 422 F.3d at 640 - 41 .

3. Apple 's Technological Protection Measures Are Effective

" ordinary consumer " or " average consumer " ) ; Reimerdes , 111 F. Supp. 2d at 318 ( finding a 40 - bit encryption key embedded within authorized hardware effective ) ; Pearl Inv. , LLC v. Standard I/O , Inc. , 257 F. Supp. 2d 326 , 350 ( D. Me. 2003 ) ; 321 Studios , 307 F. Supp. 2d at 1095 .
Apple 's witnesses testified without contradiction that Apple 's technological protection mechanisms function to protect access to Mac OS X and prohibit installation on non-Apple hardware .
Indeed , Psystar 's own pleadings concede this .35 ( Am. Countercl . ¶¶ 33,37-38 ; Psystar Br. at 16 - 17 ) .
F. Psystar Has Not Proven Nominative Fair Use Of Apple 's Famous Trademarks
Psystar briefly mentions in its " Summary of Argument " section ( Psystar Br. at 4 ) - though without offering any supporting evidence or law - that its use of Apple 's trademarks and trade dress constitutes nominative fair use .
Psystar has the burden to produce evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment .
See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317,323 ( 1986 ) ; Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Co. , 210 F.3d 1099 , 1102-03 ( 9th Cir. 2000 ) .
Thus , to sustain its nominative fair use defense on summary judgment , Psystar was required to submit evidence that ( 1 ) it used Apple 's trademarks to describe Apple 's product and not Psystar 's products , ( 2 ) the product referred to by Psystar " must not be readily identifiable without use of the mark , " ( 3 ) Psystar used " only so much of the mark ... as is reasonably necessary to identify the product " and ( 4 ) Psystar did " nothing that would , in conjunction with the mark , suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder . "
Horphag Res. Ltd. v. Pellegrini , 337 F.3d 1036 , 1041 ( 9th Cir. 2003 ) .
Having submitted no evidence whatsoever on this issue , Psystar 's motion on the trademark claims must be denied .
Apple can defeat the motion for summary judgment " without producing anything .
" A36 Nissan Fire , 210 F.3d at 1103 ; see also Id. at 1107 ( " ( A ) nonmoving party
23
has no obligation to produce anything until the moving party has carred its initial burden of production .
A37
G. Apple 's Remaining Claims Are Not Moot
1. Damages
Psystar is correct that Apple intends to seek disgorgement of Psystar 's il - gotten gains from its breach of Apple 's SLA .
However , Psystar 's understanding of California law is wrong ; California permits recovery of defendant 's unjust enrichment for breach of contract .
Ajaxo Inc. v. E*Trade Group , Inc. , 135 Cal. App. 4th 21 , 55 ( Cal. App. 2005 ) .
As in Ajaxo and the federal court cases that have applied Ajaxo , Psystar has benefitted by taking from Apple rights for which it has not bargained , and which Apple has not granted , and has thus become unjustly enriched .
Martone v. Burgess , No. 08-2379,2008 WL 3916022 , at * 4 ( N.D. Cal. Aug. 25 , 2008 ) ( restitution an available remedy for breach of contract and for theft of trade secrets ) ; Foster Poultry Farms , Inc. v. Suntrust Bank , No. 04-5513 , 2008 WL 160960 , at * 49 ( E.D. Cal. Jan. 14 , 2008 ) ( " Under California law , disgorgement of improperly obtained profits is a remedy for breach of a contract protecting trade secrets and proprietary confidential information . " ) .
Because Apple is entitled to recovery of the amount by which Psystar has been unjustly enrched , Apple 's damages claims are not mooted by Psystar 's willingness to stipulate to the award of nominal damages .
2. Apple Is Entitled To A Permanent Injunction
24
an injunction should be limited to " Psystar 's allegedly illegal activities involving OS X Leopard " . . . and " [ s ] ince neither Psystar nor Apple sells OS X Leopard any longer , it is no great burden for Psystar to agree to an injunction . "
( Id . )
Apple agrees that a permanent injunction is appropriate in this case , but an injunction limited to Mac OS X Leopard is manifestly insufficient , would not alleviate the irreparable harm that Apple suffers as a result of Psystar 's infringement , and could encourage more infringement of Apple 's copyrighted software by parties other than Psystar .
Apple is therefore entitled to broad permanent injunctive relief .
The law is clear : Apple is entitled to injunctive relief broad enough to protect it from continuing or recurring infringement .
17 U.S.C. § 502 ( a ) ( " injunction terms must prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright " ) ; 15 U.S.C. § 1116 ( " injunction must prevent the violation of any right of the registrant of a mark " ) .
Psystar has advertised that regardless of this lawsuit , it plans to continue sellng computers that infringe Mac OS X .
Therefore , in order to ensure that Apple 's copyrights are no longer infringed and to avoid the harm that Apple will necessarily suffer if Psystar is not stopped , the Court should permanently enjoin Psystar from selling its computers with any version of Mac OS X or other Apple software for the following reasons .
First , if Psystar is not permanently enjoined from copying , modifying , and distributing Mac OS X , it will essentially be granted a de facto compulsory license to continue these activities .
" In the copyright realm , it has been said that an injunction should be granted if denial would amount to a forced license to use the creative works of another . "
See SimplexGrinell LP v. Integrated Systems & Power , Inc. , _ F. Supp. 2d _ , 2009 WL 857504 , at * 23 ( S.D.N.Y . Mar. 31 , 2009 ) ( quoting Silverstein v. Penguin Putnam , Inc. , 368 F.3d 77 , 84 ( 2d Cir. 2004 ) ) ; see also A&M Records , Inc. v. Napster , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004 , 1029 ( 9th Cir. 2001 ) ( rejecting compulsory royalties and issuing injunctive relief because " [ p] laintiffs would lose the power to control their intellectual property " ) .
A38
25
Second , Apple 's integrated business model will be severely undermined if Psystar is not permanently enjoined from infringing Apple 's copyrights and circumventing its technological protection measures .
Nothing else will stop Psystar from continuing to sell unauthorized copies of Apple software on non-Apple computers .
There is litte doubt that Psystar will use each release of a new version of Mac OS X as a new opportunity to mass reproduce and distribute unauthorized copies of Apple software .
And , if the Court declines to grant a permanent injunction , other software pirates , like Psystar , wil argue that by simply purchasing a retail DVD version of Mac OS X , they too are entitled to mass produce and sell software that Apple has spent many years and hundreds of milions of dollars developing .
Third , the continued association of Apple with Psystar 's problem - ridden computers and business practices will seriously damage Apple 's brand , reputation and goodwill .
MDY Indus. , LLC v. Blizzard Entm't , Inc. , 616 F. Supp. 2d 958 , 974 ( D. Ariz. 2009 ) ( citing Rent - A - Center , Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental , Inc. , 944 F.2d 597 , 603 ( 9th Cir. 1991 ) ( " [ I ] ntangible injuries , such as damage to ongoing recruitment efforts and goodwill , qualify as irreparable harm . " ) ; MySpace , Inc. v. Wallace , 498 F. Supp. 2d . 1293 , 1305 ( C.D. CaL. 2007 ) ( " Harm to business goodwill and reputation is unquantifiable and considered irreparable . " )
Fourth , there is compelling evidence that Psystar will not be able to pay any statutory damages resulting from Psystar 's copyright infringement and DMCA violations - another factor courts consider when determining whether to grant injunctive relief .
Metro-Golden - Mayer Studios , Inc. v. Grokster , Ltd. , 518 F. Supp. 2d 1197 , 1217 ( C.D. Cal. 2007 ) .
Psystar has already filed for bankruptcy once during the course of this litigation .
See In re Psystar Corp. , Case No. 09-19921 ( S.D. Fl. 2009 ) .
Moreover , there is evidence of continuing third party infringement due to Psystar 's induced and contributory infringement of Apple 's copyrights .
Such inducement " ' greatly erodes [ plaintiffs ' ] ability to enforce their exclusive rights . "
Grokster , 518 F. Supp. 2d. at 1217 ( citing A&M Records , Inc. , 239 F.3d at 1029 ) .
Indeed , " the very need to file multiple lawsuits as a consequence of [ Psystar ' s ] inducement is itself supportive of an irreparable harm
26
finding . " Grokster at 1219 .
The facts in this case clearly support the need for a broad permanent injunction enjoining Psystar 's copyright infringement and DMCA violations .
39

For the foregoing reasons , as well as those set forth in Apple 's Motion for Summary Judgment , Psystar 's Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied in its entirety .

The court in Vernor found that under Wise , " the critical factor " in determining whether a transaction is a sale or a license is " whether the transferee kept the copy acquired from the copyright holder . "
555 F. Supp. 2d at 1170 .
The Vernor court failed to note , however , that the court in Wise cited a case where although there was no requirement that the purchaser of certain film prints and negatives return the materials , " the agreement on its face [ was ] clearly a license . "
Wise , 550 F.2d at 1189 ( discussing Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp. , 279 F .2d 100 ( 9th Cir. 1960 ) ) .
Neither did the agreement in Vernor .
There was a type of destruction provision but " the decision to accept Autodesk 's destruction requirement [ was ] entirely in the control of the licensee . "
Vernor , 2009 WL 3187613 at * 7 .
Apple 's licenses do not provide this freedom when its licensee 's rights are terminated .
Psystar has not produced , either in discovery to Apple or in support of this motion , evidence that supports this assertion .
Indeed the documents produced in discovery indicate that far fewer Mac OS X DVDs were acquired by Psystar than computers it sold .
Boroumand Smith Decl . ¶ 14 .
Psystar has waived section 117 as an affirmative defense because it did not plead the defense in its Answer .
Jorst v. D'Ambrosio Bros. Inv. Co. , No. C00-03646 , 2001 WL 969039 , *9 ( N.D. Cal. Aug. 13 , 2001 ) ( citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 ( c ) ) ; see also In re Adbox , Inc. , 488 F.3d 836 , 841 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) .
Although the Court , in its discretion , may permit a defendant to raise an unpleaded defense , the Court should do so only " where the delay does not prejudice the plaintiff . "
Jorst , 2001 WL 969039 , at * 9 .
Because the parties have proceeded through extensive litigation " including the depositions of multiple witnesses " and dispositive motion practice , Apple will be prejudiced if Psystar is permitted to raise a new , untimely defense .
Id .
Accordingly , Psystar should not be permitted to assert a section 117 defense .
Certainly Psystar cannot obtain judgment in its favor based upon a defense that it never pleaded .
Even if section 117 somehow applied to Psytar 's mass reproduction and sale of Mac OS X ( and it does not ) , Psystar itself admits that the hard drive imaging step is not " essential " for Psystar 's purposes .
Rather , as Psystar states : " it 's a time " issue , i.e. , a matter of convenience .

Psystar also refers to the Lasercomb , Practice Management and Alcatel cases - all of which involved license agreements that , unlike the one at issue here , limited competition and restrained the development of creative works .

None of these cases supports Psystar 's argument that Apple has engaged in copyright misuse by fiing meritorious copyright infringement and DMCA claims against Psystar .
All three of these cases are distinguishable .

Reynolds , 911 F.2d 970 , 978-79 ( 4th Cir. 1990 ) ( copyright misuse found where license agreement prohibited defendant , its directors , officers and employees from assisting in any manner in the development of any kind of CAD software for 99 years ) ; Practice Mgmt.

DGI Tech , Inc. , 166 F.3d 772 , 792-94 ( 5th Cir. 1999 ) ( copyright misuse found where plaintiff asserted its copyright to prevent competition where customers were locked into a single supplier ) .
Apple 's Motion for Summary Judgment addresses other possible Psystar arguments , all of which fail to establish anything approaching copyright misuse under the law .
( See Apple 's Summary Judgment Br. at 17-19 . )
See S. Rep. No. 105-190 , at 12 ( 1998 ) .
( " The prohibition in 1201 ( a ) ( 1 ) is necessary because prior to this Act , the conduct of circumvention was never before made unlawfuL .
The device limitation in 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) enforces this new prohibition on conduct .
The copyright law has long forbidden copyright infringements , so no new prohibition was necessary .
The device limitation in 1201 ( b ) enforces the longstanding prohibitions on infringements . " ) ( emphasis added ) .
Furthermore , contrary to Psystar 's argument , a DMCA plaintiff need not show that the protection mechanism itself is copyrighted , only that the material behind the protective mechanism is protected .
The legislative history specifically states that " measures that can be deemed to ' effectively control access to a work ' would be those based on encryption , scrambling , authentication , or some other measure which requires the use of a ' key ' provided by a copyright owner to gain access to a work . "
H.R. Rep. No. 105-551 , pt. 2 , at 39 ( 1998 ) ( emphasis added ) .
This is exactly what Apple does : Mac OS
X requires a key and Apple provides this key to those who are authorized to use it .
See Reimerdes , 111 F. Supp.2d at 317-18 ( finding " indefensible as a matter of law " the argument that an encryption key was not effective because it was being distributed online ) ; see also 321 Studios , 307 F. Supp. 2d at 1095 ( this would be " equivalent to a claim that , since it is easy to find skeleton keys on the black market , a deadbolt is not an effective lock to a door " ) ; Divineo , 457 F. Supp. 2d at 965 ( " The fact that circumvention devices may be widely available does not mean that a technological measure is not , as the DMCA provides , effectively protecting the rights of copyright owners ' in the ordinary course of its operation . ' " ) .
Psystar , in a half - hearted attempt to create evidence to defeat Apple 's claims submitted a half - page ambiguous , conclusory declaration from its CEO ( a ) attaching what is purported to be lines of code available on the Internet , ( b ) stating that the CEO " compiled and ran " that code , and ( c ) concluding that the CEO believes anyone could compile and run the code .
( Psystar 's Ex. I. )
Setting aside the lack of foundation , authentication , or admissibility of the purported evidence , it is not at all clear what the declaration and attached documents ( two of which were never produced in discovery ) are intended to show .
They certainly do not contradict all the evidence in the record - including Psystar 's own statements - that Apple 's security mechanism wil prevent the average consumer from accessing and installing Mac OS X in the ordinary course of operation .
( Chung Decl. Ex. 66 at PS006530 , PS006532 . )
Indeed , Psystar 's CEO testified that it took him a couple of months to create the circumvention technology and other necessary modifications to Mac OS X. ( Boroumand Smith Decl . Ex. 11 at 27:9-18 , 41:12-42:9 . )
Psystar 's unsupported allegations of course cannot be the basis for summary judgment .
See Taylor v. List , 880 F.2d 1040 , 1044 ( 9th Cir. 1989 ) .
Apple has ample evidence disproving Psystar 's nominative fair use defense .
First , Psystar used Apple 's trademarks and trade dress to describe Psystar 's products , not Apple 's products , in its advertisements , especially in light of Psystar 's modifications to Apple 's Mac OS X operating software .
( See Boroumand Smith Decl . ¶¶ 4 - 7 , Exs. 3 - 6 . )
Second , Psystar could have advertised its computers without showing Apple 's trade dress and trademarks , like other computer manufacturers who do not show Microsoft 's operating system on their computers .
( See id . ¶ 16 , Ex. 12-13 . )
Third , there is genuine issue as to whether Psystar used only so much of the mark as is reasonably necessary .
( See id . ¶¶ 4 - 7 , Exs. 3 - 6. )
Fourth , Apple will introduce survey evidence at trial which establishes that Psystar 's use of Apple 's trademark and trade dress causes consumers to think that Apple has given its permission to , or sponsored , Psystar .
( See id . ¶ 17 , Ex. 14 . )
When such factors are in dispute , the Ninth Circuit has refused to affirm summary judgment .
Downing v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , 265 F.3d 994 , 1009 ( 9th Cir. 2001 ) ; Abdul - Jabbar v. Gen. Motors Corp. , 85 F.3d 407,413 ( 9th Cir. 1996 ) ; see also Horphag , 337 F.3d at 1041 .
There is no support for Psystar 's notion that Apple is somehow less entitled to a permanent injunction because it did not seek a preliminary order .
PGBA v. U.S. , 389 F.3d 1219 , 1232 ( Fed. Cir. 2004 ) stands only for the non-controversial proposition that the lower court in that case did not err in withholding injunctive relief .
Apple is entitled to injunctive relief .
There is no support for Psystar 's notion that , because Apple did not move for a preliminary injunction , it is any less entitled to a permanent one .
Moreover , there is a presumption of irreparable harm once a trademark owner establishes a likelihood of confusion .
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Moose Creek , Inc. , 486 F.3d 629 , 634 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) .
Here Apple 's uncontested survey evidence is clear ; both Psystar 's marketing of its computers running Mac OS X and the computers themselves are likely to confuse consumers into thinking that Apple is a sponsor of , or affiliated with , Psystar computers .

PSYSTAR CORPORATION'S
OPPOSITION TO APPLE'S MOTION
TO SEAL APPLE'S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Psystar opposes
Apple 's request that the motions for summary judgment in this case , and the exhibits on which they are based , be filed under seal .
A. No " Compelling Reason " Exists To Seal The Dispositive Motions
None of the materials in either party 's motion for summary judgment contains anything approaching the type of sensitive material for which the courtroom can be sealed in the context of a dispositive motion or at trial .
See Kamakana v. Honolulu , 447 F.3d 1172 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) .
When this Court granted the joint request for a protective order governing confidentiality designations in this case , it expressly stated that it was granting that request " subject to the following conditions , including adherence to the recently announced strict caution against sealing orders by the Ninth Circuit . "
Order Approving Stipulated Protective Order Subject to Stated Conditions ( Docket No. 55 ) at 2 .
The fourth condition that this Court imposed stated in full :
In Kamakana v. Honolulu , 447 F.3d 1172 , 1179 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) , the Ninth Circuit held that more than good cause , indeed , " compelling reasons " are required to seal documents used in dispositive motions , just as compelling reasons would be needed to justify a closure of a courtroom during trial .
Otherwise , the Ninth Circuit held , public access to the work of the courts will be unduly compromised .
Therefore , no request for a sealing order will be allowed on summary judgment motions ( or other dispositive motions ) unless the movant first shows a " compelling reason , " a substantially higher standard than " good cause . "
This will be true regardless of any stipulation by the parties .
Counsel are warned that most summary judgment motions and supporting material should be completely open to public view .
Only social security numbers , names of juveniles , home addresses and phone numbers , and trade secrets of a compelling nature ( like the recipe for Coca Cola , for example ) will qualify .
If the courtroom would not be closed for the information , nor should any summary judgment proceedings , which are , in effect , a substitute for trial .
Motions in limine are also part of the trial and must likewise be laid bare absent compelling reasons .
Please comply fully .
Noncompliant submissions are liable to be stricken in their entirety .
The argument and evidence that Apple would have this Court seal falls far short of the standard for closing the courtroom .
The technological methods and other supposed trade secrets
2
described in the sealed portions of Apple 's motion for summary judgment have already been described in documents publicly available on the Internet .
See Ex. C. People have been building " Hackintosh " computers , that is , non-Apple computers that run Mac OS X , for years .
As a result , any number of publicly accessible websites describes in detail the Apple technology that is at issue in this case .
We compiled Exhibit C in about ten minutes using a few simple Google searches .
It provides a list of several web sites [ redacted ]
3
Apple cannot even claim to be unaware of this publicly available information .
[ redacted ]
4
Most of the remaining material redacted by Apple pertains to information provided by Psystar -- which does not believe that this information warrants sealed filings in the context of a dispositive motion .
Apple is attempting to hide evidence from the public in complete disregard of the applicable standards , in just the same way it designated whole swathes of documents and entire deposition transcripts as confidential or attorneys ' eyes only throughout this litigation .
Apple designated literally every word in every deposition of an Apple witness as at least " confidential " and in almost all cases " attorneys ' eyes only . "
Apple cannot claim that it was unaware of this Court 's order regarding sealing of dispositive motions ( as Apple has claimed it simply " forgot " about other court orders before ) .
On October 7 , Psystar informed Apple by email of the order and that , pursuant to it , Psystar intended to file its entire motion and supporting exhibits publicly .
See Ex. A . This email was a follow - up on earlier discussions between counsel for Psystar and counsel for Apple at which counsel for Apple stated that they did not believe that there was any special order applicable to motions for summary judgment as distinguished from trial .
Counsel for Apple replied the next day that it would regard any filing by Psystar of material designated confidential or attorneys ' eyes only as " a violation of [ the Protective Order ] subject to a motion for contempt . "
See Ex. B. Faced with this threat , Psystar redacted its motion and exhibits and filed a motion to seal in which it requested that this Court deny its motion to seal and allow its entire motion for summary judgment to be placed in the public record .
See Docket
5
This case pits the efforts of one company to dictate every aspect of the use of its technology against a much smaller company that defends itself on the law .
The public has a right to understand and a strong interest in understanding the facts and circumstances leading to the final rulings of this Court .
Many people wonder how far a large company 's power extends when it wields the saber of late - twentieth - century intellectual - property law .
This Court 's answers , and the arguments and evidence on which they are based , should be a matter of public record .
B. This Court Should Strike Apple 's Motion For Summary Judgment In Its Entirety As A
Sanction For ( Yet Again ) Flouting A Court Order .
The parties were warned when the original protective order was approved :
Please comply fully .
Noncompliant submissions are liable to be stricken in their entirety .
1 . Apple wholly ignored its obligation to produce documents as kept in the ordinary course of business or organized by document request , relying on an agreement between counsel that Apple could not produce , that former counsel for Psystar has said in writing never existed , and for which there was no written evidence at all .
2 . Apple failed to disclose a key witness , Jacques Vidrine , the head of OS X Security , whose declaration Apple then relied on in support of its motion to enjoin the Florida case , in blatant violation of a Court Order issued less than 10 days earlier barring Vidrine from this case entirely .
3 . Apple agreed to provide a witness , Phil Schiller , to testify about damages ; at his deposition , Mr. Schiller refused to testify about this subject at all , even though Apple had agreed to the deposition on that topic and had not moved for any protective order in advance of the deposition .
To this list of violations already presented , we can now add two more .
Judge Zimmerman ordered Apple to serve on Psystar a demand including calculation of attorneys ' fees 14 days before the settlement conference last week .
On the fourteenth day , no demand arrived .
Two days later ,
6
counsel for Psystar reminded counsel for Apple of the need for a demand .
Counsel for Apple replied that he simply " forgot " the order .
Two more days passed before Apple sent a demand to Psystar .
And when Apple sent its demand , it served Psystar with the confidential portion of its demand , despite an order form Judge Zimmerman that Apple serve this portion only on him and not on Psystar .
It is as though Apple could n't be bothered to look at Judge Zimmerman 's order at all .
And now we have the issue described in this opposition : Again , Apple blatantly disregarded an Order of this Court , this time to the prejudice not only of Psystar but also of the large and very interested public that is following this case .
Psystar respectfully requests that this Court de-designate all redacted materials in Apple 's motion for summary judgment , deny Apple 's motion to seal , and order that the unredacted version of Apple 's motion and all supporting materials be placed in the public file .
Psystar further submits that it would be entirely appropriate for this Court to make good on its promise that " noncompliant submissions . . . be stricken in their entirety . "

I. INTRODUCTION
Psystar has unlawfully circumvented the security mechanism in Apple 's Macintosh computers and its Mac OS X operating system software .
Now Psystar wants to use the judicial process by which Apple has acted to halt this illegal conduct to reveal Apple 's proprietary security mechanism to the world .
But the " compelling reasons " required by the Ninth Circuit justify sealing that information : revealing it would cause competitive harm to Apple and chill use of the judicial system to stop violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( " DMCA " ) .
This Court can fully resolve the parties ' cros
Intelligence is second only to smoking as a predictor of heart disease , scientists say , suggesting public health campaigns may need to be designed for people with lower IQs if they are to work .
Research by Britain 's Medical Research Council ( MRC ) found that lower intelligence quotient scores were associated with higher rates of heart disease and death , and were more important indicators than any other risk factors except smoking .
Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women in Europe , the United States and most industrialised countries .
According to the World Health Organisation , cardiovascular diseases and diabetes accounted for 32 per cent of all deaths around the world in 2005 .
It is well known that people with poorer education and lower incomes often face higher risks of ill health and a range of diseases .
Studies have pointed to many likely reasons , including limited access to health care and other resources , poorer living conditions , chronic stress and higher rates of lifestyle risk factors like smoking .
The MRC study , which analysed data from 1,145 men and women aged around 55 and followed up for 20 years , rated the top five heart disease risk factors as cigarette smoking , IQ , low income , high blood pressure and low physical activity .
The researchers , led by David Batty , said there were " a number of plausible mechanisms " which might explain why lower IQ scores could raise the risk of heart disease , in particular a person 's approach to " healthy behaviour " .
Those who ignored or failed to understand advice about the risks of smoking or benefits of good diet and exercise for heart health would be more likely to be at higher risk , they wrote in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention .
Mr Batty said it was important to recognise the public health implications of the findings ; that skills reflected in a person 's IQ may be important for managing heart disease risk .
" From a public health perspective , there is the possibility that IQ can be increased , with some mixed results from trials of early learning and school readiness programs , " he said .
The British Heart Foundation ( BHF ) advocacy group said better food labels with a simple - to - read colour code for high , medium and low - risk foods would give shoppers " at - a - glance information " and help them make healthier choices .
" To make real progress on tackling health inequalities , we need health promotion campaigns designed to reach everyone in the community , " said Fotini Rozakeas , a BHF cardiac nurse .

Bethlehem police set up a sting Wednesday night after the victim of an alleged burglary saw his two stolen guitars listed for sale on Craigslist.org .
On Jan. 5 , someone cut a lock off of two storage sheds at a storage facility on Marshall Street , police said .
The owner of one shed reported a CD player stolen , the owner of another , Stephen Nichols , reported that a slew of music - related items , including Gibson and ESP guitars were taken .
Nichols contacted investigator Bradford Jones on Tuesday and told him he saw an ad for his guitars listed on the online classified ad hub Craigslist.org .
Nichols and Jones contacted the poster , who referred to himself as " Lee , " and set up a meeting Wednesday at Rudy 's Car Wash on Stefko Boulevard .
Police said
Ramon " DJ Wild Child " Gutierrez
, 20 , arrived at 7:30 p.m. with four other men and both guitars .
Police nabbed three of the men -- Rafael Roque - Polo , Jose A. Rodriguez and Jose Rosa -- on the spot and chased Gutierrez through a thicket behind the car wash , but lost him .
The three men pointed to Gutierrez as the one who stole the guitars and orchestrated the sale .
Police later located Gutierrez at his grandmother 's home in the 1200 block of Fritz Drive .
His grandmother , Juanita Vegas , said Gutierrez was in her bedroom and that he arrived in a panic and asked her if he could have three blankets and , " hide for a couple of hours . "
Police removed Gutierrez from his grandmother 's closet .
He struggled with Jones , attempted to head butt investigator Christopher Beebe , and while he was being searched , allegedly told Beebe ,
" I 'm going to kick your gay ( behind ) . "
Gutierrez had scratches on his face from running through the thicket and may have been living in his grandmother 's storage shed , police said .
He allegedly kept the guitars in her shed and police found bolt cutters in the shed along with items used to enter cars , a small amount of marijuana , a glass bong and a cup of urine .
Gutierrez was charged with burglary , theft , receiving stolen property , aggravated assault , resisting arrest , terroristic threats , possession of an instrument of crime and drug charges .
He was sent to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $ 40,000 bail .
The guitars were recovered , police said .
The three other men allegedly involved in the sting were released pending the completion of an investigation .
so the series on bike theft continues .
here is a recent story from friend / neighbor / co- conspirator Jimmy :
So , from what I hear , this is what happens
Now when you steal bikes or bike stuff from messengers or any cyclist in downtown .
Word on the street is a couple of high school bike thieves were caught by a messenger in the act of petty larceny , e.g. stealing some commuter ’s bike wheel .
Messenger says , “ hey what ya doing ? ” and calls another messenger .
Kids try to act tough , but the amounting messenger population descending upon them like large squawking scavenger birds began to eat away at any courage and conviction they might have had left .
Instead of beating them to bloody pulp and sending them home in their own private ambulance ( like the other times that this has happened ) these messengers thought better of their opportunity : they stole back … jeans , dickies , shirts , hats , jewelry , shoes … everything save one sock and two pairs of properly soiled boxers .
The boys exclaimed that they would call the cops and right then and there a Sheriff drove past and kept up driving past with a look of bewilderment , as to say , “ these crazy kids these days . ”
The boys were sent on their way and one very responsible messenger called one of the boy ’s father on the boy ’s cell phone , told the father of the whereabouts of his son , his current condition and why it was that he was in that condition .
The father replied with a simple and firm , “ Good . ”
As for the all the stolen items , they were quickly donated to the needy homeless person who calls downtown home .
If I lose hope with the balance of the universe , which I do from time to time , I must say , it these sweet morsels of serendipity that makes up for a lot of it .
Here ’s to non-violence and [ hopefully ] how effective it can be .

Dietary Supplements and Health Freedom
Millions of Americans take dietary supplements every day , and the numbers are growing as the Baby Boom generation ages .
More and more Americans understandably are frustrated with our government - controlled health care system .
They have concluded that vitamins , minerals , and other supplements might help them stay healthy and less dependent on the system .
They use supplements because they can buy them freely at stores and research them freely on the Internet , without government interference in the form of doctors , prescriptions , HMOs , and licenses .
In other words , they use supplements because they are largely free to make their own choices , in stark contrast to the conventional medical system .
But we live in an era of unbridled government regulation of both our personal lives and the economy , and Food and Drug administration bureaucrats burn to regulate supplements in the same manner as prescription drugs .
The health nannies insist that many dietary supplements are untested and unproven , and therefore dangerous .
But the track record for FDA - approved drugs hardly inspires confidence .
In fact , far more Americans have died using approved pharmaceuticals than supplements .
Not every dietary supplement performs as claimed , but neither does every FDA drug .
The FDA simply gives people a false sense of security , while crowding out private watchdog groups that might provide truly disinterested consumer information .
It fosters a complacent attitude and a lack of personal responsibility among people who assume a government stamp of approval means a drug must be safe , and that they need not study a drug before taking it .
The FDA , like all federal agencies , ultimately uses its regulatory powers in political ways .
Certain industries and companies are rewarded , and others are punished .
No regulatory agency is immune from politics , which is why the FDA should not be trusted with power over our intimate health care decisions .
The real issue is not whether supplements really work , or whether FDA drugs really are safe .
The real issue is :
Who decides , the individual or the state ?
This is the central question in almost every political issue .
In free societies , individuals decide what medical treatments or health supplements are appropriate for them .
Over the past decade the American people have made it clear they do not want the federal government to interfere with their access to dietary supplements .
In 1994 , Congress bowed to overwhelming public pressure and passed the Dietary Supplements and Health and Education Act , which liberalized the rules regarding the regulation of dietary supplements .
Congressional offices received a record number of comments in favor of the Act , which demonstrates how strongly Americans feel about health freedom .
The FDA simply has thumbed its nose at Congress and ignored the new rules in many instances , by attempting to suppress information about health supplements .
But in 1999 a federal appellate court affirmed that the American people have a First Amendment right to such information without interference from the FDA .
However , members of Congress have had to intervene with the FDA on several occasions to ensure that they followed the court order .
My regular listeners already know about another looming threat to dietary supplement freedom .
The Codex Alimentarius Commission , an offshoot of the United Nations , is working to harmonize food and supplement rules between all nations of the world .
Under Codex rules , even basic vitamins and minerals will require a doctor ’s prescription .
As Europe moves ever closer to adopting Codex standards , it becomes more likely that the World Trade Organization will attempt to force those standards on the United States .
This is yet another example of how the WTO threatens American sovereignty .
By cooperating with Codex , the FDA is blatantly ignoring the will of Congress and the American people .

Competition for Google A German Library for the 21st Century
The German Digital Library wants to make millions of books , films , images and audio recordings accessible online .
More than 30,000 libraries , museums and archives are expected to contribute their digitized cultural artifacts .
The idea , in part , is to compete with Google Books .
But will it work ?
( CNN ) -- Supporters of a banker caught looking at photos of a semi-nude model on live TV have launched a Web site in a bid to save his job .
David Kiely , who works for Sydney - based Macquarie Private Wealth , has become a Web sensation after he was filmed on Australian television admiring pictures on his computer screen of scantily - clad Miranda Kerr .
Kiely was opening e-mailed pictures of Kerr while one of his colleagues , Martin Lakos , was being interviewed on Channel 7 news behind him on Tuesday .
His employer has said it is investigating the actions of the client investment manager who , according to Australian media reports , is said to be on gardening leave .
A Web site has now been set up calling for Kiely to be reinstated .
An email petition , Here is the City , writes : " Whether set up or not , Kiely was really only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
There but for the Grace of God . "
It says Kiely " seems like a nice bloke , the pictures were not hardcore and that he had already suffered enough . "
It adds : " There 's just too much political correctness in this world anyway . "
A posting of the clip on YouTube had attracted more than 1.3 million hits by Thursday , along with thousands of comments , with many viewers arguing Kiely was unlucky to be caught on TV .
" He looks like a nice guy and I 'm sure he must be a goodÿþ analyst since he is working there , " said one YouTube viewer .
" I really feel for him -- if I was a top shot there , I wouldnt let him go .
Listen we 've all made mistakes in our lives .
He was caught on camera , also he was n't looking at something really dirty . "
" To be fair , he was simply browsing through his emails , and perhaps he simply opened it not realising what it was ? " another viewer wrote .
WASHINGTON - Key provisions of the nation ’s primary counterterrorism law would be extended for a year under a bill passed by the House last night after Democrats retreated from adding privacy protections .
The House voted , 315 to 97 , to extend the Patriot Act , sending the bill to President Obama .
Without the bill , the provisions would expire Sunday .
The Senate approved the extension Wednesday .
The privacy protections were cast aside when Senate Democrats lacked the necessary 60 - vote supermajority to pass them .
Some in Congress had sought to increase restrictions and scrutiny on the government ’s authority to spy on Americans and seize their records .
The Democratic retreat is a political victory for Republicans and a major disappointment for Democrats and their allies who believe the Patriot Act fails to protect privacy and gives the government too much authority to spy on Americans and seize their property .
The three sections of the Patriot act that would stay in force :
■ Authorize court - approved roving wiretaps that permit surveillance on multiple phones .
■ Allow court - approved seizure of records and property in antiterrorism operations .
■ Permit surveillance against what ’s called a “ lone wolf , ’’ a non-citizen engaged in terrorism who may not be part of a recognized terrorist group .
The bill with privacy protections had been approved in the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan majority .
But that bill could not survive an expected Republican filibuster .
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said yesterday that any changes to the Patriot Act would weaken it .
“ Recent terror attacks , such as those at Fort Hood and on Christmas Day , demonstrate just how severe of a threat we are facing , ’’ Sessions said .
The Obama administration supported the Senate committee revisions .

WASHINGTON — Evangelical pastor Rick Warren ’s “ urgent ” plea for donations to sustain his megachurch has been met with amusement and mockery from gay rights advocates .
Warren posted a letter online Wednesday saying his Saddleback Church is “ $ 900,000 in the red for the year ” and pleaded with congregants to help fill the gap “ in the next 48 hours , ” the Associated Press reported .

Warren said the recession hurt funding all year , but tallied up his eleventh hour effort to the Church ’s lower - than - expected donations on Christmas .
“ This last weekend the bottom dropped out , ” he said in the letter .
The gay community , which has long been at odds with Warren ’s opposition to same - sex marriage , does n’t appear sad about the news .
A headline at the popular gay website Queerty read , “ Rick Warren ’s Budget for Hypocrisy Is $ 900,000 Short This Year . ”
The article dubbed Warren an “ anti- gay pastor ” whose church has “ gone broke and begging for cash . ”
It said that Warren “ wo n’t share explicit financial details of the church , so it ’s hard to tell whether $ 900 k is a pittance to Saddleback , or represents a gaping hole in their books . ”
While not dismissing the notion that the Church might genuinely be in need of funds , Queerty speculated that maybe “ Warren is just being greedy , and begging supporters to give him their last few pennies before the clock strikes midnight . ”

Gay told its readers , “ Rick Warren needs money .
Sends “ URGENT LETTER ” to his flock . ”
“ Hmmm , ” Joe Sudbay wrote in response to Warren ’s letter .
“ If I was in Rick Warren ’s flock , I ’d ask for an audit . ”
“ Given Warren ’s URGENT appeal for money , it sure sounds like he has n’t been listening to God when it comes to financial stewardship , ” Sudbay jested .

The GLBT news magazine On Top headlined its story , “ Anti-Gay Pastor Rick Warren Begs For $ 900,000 . ”
Tensions between gay rights advocates and Warren rose after the influential pastor ’s strong defense of California ’s Proposition 8 , which outlawed same - sex marriage .
Warren called his opposition to gay marriage “ a humanitarian and human issue , ” CBN News reported .
I had a really pleasant talk today with Roxanne Conlin a woman challenging Chuck Grassley for his Senate seat .
She was on her way back from meeting with a hearty bunch of Democratic activists in Harrison County ( the Missouri Valley , north of Council Bluffs ) .
I think it was their energy -- these are people in Steve King Country who nearly won their county for Barack Obama in 2008 -- that had her all fired up .
It was our first conversation and we were just getting to know each other for the first time , although we have mutual friends in author Mike Lux and Congressman Bruce Braley .
I was moved by Roxanne 's compelling personal story .
After her dad , struggling with alcoholism , lost his job when she was a child , the family 's comfortable middle class lifestyle collapsed .
Suddenly she knew cold and hunger and privation .
With no car and no money for medical care , a minor ear infection turned into a serious problem for the school - aged Roxanne who wound up with partial deafness in one ear .
She 's dedicated her political and civic life towards making sure that would n't happen to her neighbors ' children .
Right now she 's battling the Republican Goliath of Iowa politics , Chuck Grassley , who 's closing in on 80 years old and has been a professional politician since 1958 when he was first elected to the state legislature .
He 's been living in Washington , DC since 1974 when he was elected to Congress and had been in the Senate since 1981 .
Today thereported that Grassley 's polling number 's had slipped into the danger zone -- and this without Roxanne having even begun campaigning against him yet .
Iowans of all stripes have been disappointed that since Obama was elected Grassley has gone over to the lockstep obstructionist wing of his political party and has stopped working across the aisle for the good of regular families .
As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee , Grassley was in a position to bring both sides together in a bipartisan way .
Buckling to far right pressure from the national GOP -- and lured by the great amounts of money from special interests with their own agendas -- Grassley has been swept up in the unlikely role of an ideologue and fanatic .
A darling of special interests , he has taken in $ 1,155,179 from Agribusiness -- this year second only to corrupt Arkansas Democrat ( and Agriculture Committee chair ) Blanche Lincoln .
And in the areas overseen by his committee -- the finance sector -- he has taken in $ 2,545,050 , a clear conflict of interest .
Similarly , at the height of the battle over healthcare reform -- much of it played out in the Finance Committee , Grassley was selling his support to Big Insurance and the Medical Industrial Complex .
The so - called " Health sector " has funneled $ 2,237,789 into his political career and this year he was # 7 ( $ 342,710 , just behind corrupt North Carolina Big Pharma hack Richard Burr ) on the list of senators accepting this kind of thinly veiled bribery from the health care industry .
Unlike Grassley , Roxanne is eager to co-sponsor Dick Durbin's Fair Elections Now Act ( S. 752 ) , which will move to lessen the influence of big financial interests on American politics .
She turned down an offer from help from the Blue America PAC because she does n't accept PAC money -- not from -- and is determined to finance her campaign through grassroots contributions .
Big uphill climb , but she 's already amassed a bigger warchest than any Democrat who has ever gone up against Senator Grassley .

Introduction
Following Hamas ' June 2007 Gaza coup , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas fired its ministers from the national unity government .
Hamas , for its part , did not recognize the dismissal , nor does it recognize the legitimacy of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 's government and of Mahmoud Abbas 's presidency .
Instead , it regards Isma'il Haniya and his government as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people .
Recently , it has instructed the media to stop calling it al - hukouma al - muqala ( " the dismissed government " ) .
Hamas ' view of its government as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people was reflected in its recent response to the Goldstone report .
The response , delivered to Curt Goering , head of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Gaza , was submitted not in the name of Hamas but in the name of the PA .
Signed by Hamas ' Minister of Justice , Muhammad Faraj Al - Ghoul , it bore the PA seal and the PA Ministry of Justice letterhead ( see image below ) .
In fact , Al - Ghoul explicitly stressed that the document was not a Hamas response to the Goldstone report but rather the official response of the Palestinian Justice Ministry .
He emphasized that " the government is the one issuing the response , because it is the body handling the issue , rather than the resistance factions , " [ 1 ] thereby indicating that the Gaza government does not represent Hamas , but rather the entire Palestinian people .
Apparently , Hamas ' goal in submitting this report is to improve its international status and to gain the UN 's recognition .
The rationale is that by accepting the document , the UN would in effect be recognizing Hamas ' status as the official representative of the PA .
The Hamas response , which was published in the movement 's magazine Al - Risala , contained an apology for rocket attacks that harmed Israeli civilians ; later Hamas denied issuing an apology .
Hamas Apologizes for Harming Civilians , Then Denies the Apology
The document states , " The Palestinian government stresses the right of the occupied Palestinian people to resistance and self - defense , which are sanctioned by international law and by the U.N. Charter . "
It states further , " Though it is hard , and sometimes impossible , to reach the armed groups , the Palestinian government in Gaza has often called upon the armed Palestinian groups to refrain from harming civilians .
The armed Palestinian groups have indeed affirmed their commitment to the directives of the international humanitarian law in their media announcements , and they have also announced on several websites that they attack only military targets and avoid attacking civilian ones . "
The document also emphasizes that the resistance is not an organized army with precision weapons , and that " during firing , [ projectiles ] can veer off course , resulting in harm to civilian targets , despite the considerable efforts to avoid causing casualties among civilians .
The resistance does not deliberately aim at civilian targets . "
The document explains that the firing of rockets is a response to Israeli " aggression , " and adds : " We express sorrow over every Israeli civilian who was hurt , as well as hope that the people of Israel will understand that the ongoing harm caused us by their government is the reason for the firing of rockets , which is a limited and restrained response . " [ 2 ]
The apology evoked criticism from several quarters , including from Fatah , prompting Muhammad Faraj Al - Ghoul to issue a statement denying that the document included any " apology for hurting Zionists " during the Gaza war . [ 3 ]
Hamas leader Isma'il Haniya likewise issued a statement renouncing the apology . [ 4 ]
Fatah : The Hamas Apology Is a Capitulation to Israel
Fatah spokesman Ahmad ' Assaf expressed puzzlement that Hamas " apologizes to Israel for killing Israeli civilians , but at the same time refuses to apologize to the Palestinian people for crimes it has committed against Palestinian civilians in Gaza , for killing hundreds of Fatah members and for injuring hundreds of other Palestinians ... during and after the blood - soaked Gaza coup . " [ 5 ]
The Fatah movement in Nablus likewise rebuked Hamas harshly for its " disgraceful apology , " saying that " the number of Israeli civilians killed during the aggression in Gaza was only three , whereas the Israeli army killed 1,400 innocent Palestinian civilians , and nobody has apologized to their families or to the Palestinian people . "
The movement expressed deep sorrow that Hamas " is debasing itself in the face of the enemy and pleading [ with the enemy ] when the blood of [ senior Hamas operative Mahmoud ]
Al - Mabhouh , whose death Hamas has sworn to avenge , has not yet dried . " [ 6 ]
On the other hand , Muwaffaq Matar , columnist for the PA daily Al - Hayat Al - Jadida , attacked Hamas for denying the apology , and wondered why its leaders prefer to utter blatant lies rather than deal with the truth .
He wrote : " [ The Hamas leaders ] must be reminded that the sanctity of human life is a value that cannot be [ dismissed ] by means of tricks and interpretations that are casually thrown about . [ 7 ]
Hani Al - Masri , a columnist for the PA daily Al - Ayyam and a senior official in the PA information ministry , said that neither the PA nor Hamas had carried out any investigation of the Gaza war .
This , he contended , " reflects the lack of seriousness of both ' governments , ' and harms the image of the Palestinian cause and of the Palestinian leaders , who are unable to agree even on an issue as important as the Goldstone report ...
Hamas cannot defend itself or the Palestinian cause , nor can it reply to the accusations of the Goldstone report regarding the crimes committed by armed Palestinian groups , as long as its rule is illegitimate and nobody recognizes it . " [ 8 ]

Dr. Peiser ’s complete submission to the UK Parliamentary Committee is complete below .
Dr. Peiser was editor of the journal which handled the fraud allegations on the urban warming papers by Jones and Wang .
These papers were used to present urban warming as having a minimal effect on the surface temperature record , which is something I disagree with .
I ’m supposed to disagree as a skeptic , but the evidence of substantial urban warming bias in the temperature records is too great to ignore and requires a complete re-study , something Anthony Watts has taken on for the US in his surfacestations project .
In the Wang paper , the stations in question were stated to have well considered histories to prevent contamination caused by time of observations , station moves and instrument changes .
Keenan ’s paper in particular alleged that these claims were not accurate .
When Jones failed to answer in a timely manner , the correspondence became contentious to say the least .
Here is a relevant quote from the emails .
Regarding the Chinese meteorological data analyzed by Wang et al. [ GRL , 1990 ] and Jones et al .
[ Nature , 1990 ] , it now seems clear that there are severe problems .
In particular , the data was obtained from 84 meteorological stations that can be classified as follows .
49 have no histories 08 have inconsistent histories 18 have substantial relocations 02 have single - year relocations 07 have no relocations Furthermore , some of the relocations are very distant–over 20 km .
Others are to greatly different environments , as illustrated here : http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=1323#comment-102970
The above contradicts the published claim to have considered the histories of the stations , especially for the 49 stations that have no histories .
Yet the claim is crucial for the research conclusions .
I e-mailed you about this on April11th .
I also phoned you on April 13th : you said that you were in a meeting and would get back to me .
I have received no response .
I ask you to retract your GRL paper , in full , and to retract the claims made in Nature about the Chinese data .
If you do not do so , I intend to publicly submit an allegation of research misconduct to your university at Albany .
Douglas J. Keenan
My bold below .
H/T John Pittman and Anastassia Makarieva .
——
Memorandum submitted by Dr Benny Peiser ( CRU 38 )
1. I am the editor of CCNet and the co-editor of the journal Energy & Environment ( E&E ) .
Further details may be obtained from the CCNet and E&Ewebsites : CCNet : http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/CCNet-homepage.htmE&E: http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/121493/?p=5b7d9587cb4a4f608c91190241affac3&pi=0 .
I am prepared to give oral evidence at the Committee ’s evidence session in elaboration of my written submission .
I have no declarable interests .
2 . The CRU e-mails under investigation suggest that climate scientists ( not only at CRU but also elsewhere ) have actively sought to prevent a paper on alleged research fraud from being published in violation of principles of academic integrity .
3 . In the following , I will outline the chronology of the CRU - Keenan affair as documented in the published CRU e-mails and according to unpublished e-mail correspondence between me and Dr Jones .
4 . It should be noted that the CRU e-mails regarding the Jones - Keenan affair are incomplete .
I am in the possession of e-mail correspondence with Phil Jones about the Keenan paper that is not included in the published CRU e-mails .
The point is that the ‘ unauthorised publication ’ referred to in the terms of reference is by no means a complete publication .
There is likely to be much more other CRU email traffic bearing on the question of the CRU ’s scientific integrity , over and above the emails already disclosed .
In the interest of veracity and transparency all correspondence by CRU researchers regarding the fraud allegations in question should be disclosed in full so the exact nature and extent of attempts to prevent the publication of Keenan ’s paper can be established .
5 . In the summer of 2007 , I was a guest editor of a special issue of E&E ( “ The IPCC : Structure , Process and Policy , ” – E&E Volume 18 , Number 7 – 8 / December 2007 ) .
http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/n2541g9607j1/?p=5be0956c6848417c85c79247097c97ad&pi=0
6 . On 29 August 2007 , I received an e-mail from Doug Keenan with his paper titled “ The Fraud Allegations against Wei-Chyung Wang . ”
In this paper , Keenan accused Wei-Chyung Wang ( State University of Albany , SUNY , New York , USA ) of scientific fraud .
In his paper , Keenan documented evidence that Wang had fabricated information about Chinese meteorological weather stations .
His allegations concern two publications : a ) Jones P.D. , Groisman P.Y. , Coughlan M. , Plummer N. , Wang W.-C. , Karl T.R. ( 1990 ) , “ Assessment of urbanization effects in time series of surface air temperature over land ” , Nature , 347 : 169-172 ; and b ) Wang W.-C. , Zeng Z. , Karl T.R. ( 1990 ) , “ Urban heat islands in China ” , Geophysical Research Letters , 17 : 2377-2380 .
The study by Jones et al ( 1990 ) has been a corner stone in multiple IPCC reports about the allegedly minimal role of the effect of urban heat islands on the global temperature record .
The latest ( 2007 ) assessment report by the IPCC concluded that urbanization effects are insignificant with regards to global warming .
One of the key papers to underpin this conclusion is the study by Jones et al. ( 1990 ) .
To refute Keenan ’s claims of scientific fraud would have only required the release of documentary information about the Chinese weather stations in question which Wang has long claimed to possess .
7 . In the afternoon of the same day ( 29 August ) I sent Phil Jones an e-mail with a copy of Keenan ’s paper attached .
In my e-mail , I asked Jones whether he would be prepared to comment on the content and factual accuracy of the Keenan paper .
8. Later that day , Jones circulated the paper to Dr Wei-Chyung Wang and Dr Tom Wigley ( University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ) , informing both his colleagues that he “ wo n’t be responding ” to my request , but that he would be prepared to do so if his colleagues thought he should .
9 . The next day , 30 August , Wang e-mailed Jones to say that Jones needed to respond “ by providing E&E with a simple answer of ‘ false ’ to Keenan ’s write - up , based on the communication with me . […]
We are facing a tricky person and group , and the only way to do it is to follow the procedure to drive them crazy . [ … ]
We are not going to let Keenan doing things his way . [ … ]
We should be thinking , after the whole odeal ( sic ) is over , to take legal ( or other ) actions against Keenan . [… ] ”
10 .
In his response to Wang on the same day , Jones wrote : “ Libel is quite easy to prove in the UK as you ’re not a public figure .
Perhaps when you ’re back you ought to consider taking some legal advice from SUNY .
Assuming the paper is published that is . [ … ] . ”
11 . Later the same day , Jones e-mailed Wang and Wigley to inform them that he would not respond to my request “ until the SUNY process has run its course . ”
12 . Later still , Dr Michael E. Mann ( Pennsylvania State University ) contacted Jones [ with e-mail copies to Dr Kevin Trenberth ( National Center for Atmospheric Research ) and Dr Gavin Schmidt ( NASA ) ] to inform him about recommendations he had discussed with Schmidt : “ With respect to Peiser ’s guest editing of E&E and your review , following up on Kevin ’s suggestions , we think there are two key points .
First , if there are factual errors ( other than the fraud allegation ) it is very important that you point them out now .
If not , Keenan could later allege that he made the claims in good faith , as he provided you an opportunity to respond and you did now .
Secondly , we think you need to also focus on the legal implications .
In particular , you should mention that the publisher of a libel is also liable for damages – that might make Sonja B - C be a little wary .
Of course , if it does get published , maybe the resulting settlement would shut down E&E and Benny and Sonja all together !
We can only hope , anyway .
So maybe in an odd way its ( sic ) actually win - win for us , not them .
Lets ( sic ) see how this plays out … ”
13 . On 31 August , Tom Wigley ( a former CRU director ) e-mailed Jones to notify him that he believed Keenan ’s paper raised a valid issue : “ Seems to me that Keenan has a valid point .
The statements in the papers that he quotes seem to be incorrect statements , and that someone ( WCW at the very least ) must have known at the time that they were incorrect .
Whether or not this makes a difference is not the issue here . ”
Jones was now in possession of authoritative information that undermined his claims about the integrity of CRU data products for which he is responsible .
Confronted with the evidence from Keenan , and , most importantly , Wigley ’s advice that Keenan appeared to have a point , Jones should have been insistent on getting the data and facts out rather than keeping them secret .
14 .
In response to Wigley ’s warning , Jones now counselled him to suppress and conceal his concerns and acted as an advocate for Wang ’s defence despite the ‘ valid ’ evidence against his claims .
In an e-mail , Jones appealed to Wigley to “ keep quiet ” about his apparent backing for Keenan ’s concern .
In order to obviate any further critique or action by Wigley , Jones speciously told him that SUNY was about to take action against Keenan : “ Just for interest !
Keep quiet about both issues .
In touch with Wei-Chyung Wang .
Just agreed with him that I will send a brief response to Peiser .
The allegation by Keenan has gone to SUNY .
Keenan ’s about to be told by SUNY that submitting this has violated a confidentiality agreement he entered into with SUNY when he sent the complaint .
WCW has nothing to worry about , but it still unsettling ! ”
15 . On 5 September , Jones e-mailed me a list of objections to the Keenan paper .
Ignoring the expert advice he had received from Wigley , Jones called on me to reject the paper : “ My view is that the claims are unsubstantiated . ”
16 . I informed Jones that I would forward his objections to Keenan and stressed : “ I know this is a very sensitive matter and I will not rush any decision .
I will keep you updated and informed . ”
17 . On 10 September , I received Keenan ’s response which I forwarded to Jones on the same day .
I e-mailed Jones : “ As far as I can see , his [ Keenan ’s ] basic accusation seems unaffected by your criticism .
Unless there is any compelling evidence that Keenan ’s main claim is unjustified or unsubstantiated , I intend to publish his paper in the forthcoming issue of E&E .
Please let me know by the end of the week if you have any additional arguments that may sway me in my decision . ”
18 . On the same day , Jones forwarded my e-mail to Michael Mann and Gavin Schmidt , concluding : “ It seems as though E&E will likely publish this paper . ”
19 .
The following day , ( 11 September ) , Michael Mann responded to the new development .
In an e-mail to Jones , he suggested that Wang should threaten E&E with a libel suit : “ Wei Chyung needs to sue them , or at the least threaten a lawsuit .
If he does n’t , this will set a dangerous new precedent .
I could put him in touch w/ anleading ( sic ) attorney who would do this pro bono .
Of course , this has to be done quickly .
The threat of a lawsuit alone my ( sic ) prevent them from publishing this paper , so time is of the essence .
Please feel free to mention this directly to Wei Chyung , in particular that I think he needs to pursue a legal course her independent of whatever his university is doing .
He cannot wait for Stony Brook to complete its internal investigations !
If he does so , it will be too late to stop this . ”
20 .
Later that day , I received three e-mails by Phil Jones with additional references and objections to the Keenan paper .
Jones put additional pressure on by stressing : “ I do n’t see how any journal would ever contemplate publishing such a paper .
I hope you ’ll reconsider . ”
21 . After minor revisions of the paper following peer review , I informed Keenan on 8 October that I had accepted his paper for publication with the modified title “ The Fraud Allegation Against Some Climatic Research of Wei-Chyung Wang ” .
It was published in E&E volume 18 , number 7 - 8 , pp. 985-995 in December 2007 .
22 . The concerted efforts by a group of eminent climate scientists to prevent the publication of the Keenan paper had been unsuccessful .
However , this was mainly due to the fact that I was prepared to resist peer pressure and to be open - minded regarding Keenan ’s evidence and argumentation .
I doubt that mainstream science editors would have dared to reject the opposition by leading climate scientists who had targeted an amateur researcher .
As Phil Jones fittingly put it to me in an e-mail : ‘ How would any journal ever contemplate publishing such a paper ? ’
23 . On 1 February 2010 , The Guardian reported that Doug Keenan ’s E&E paper “ may yet result in a significant revision of a scientific paper that is still cited by the UN ’s top climate science body . [ … ]
The [ CRU ] emails suggest that [ Phil Jones ] helped to cover up flaws in temperature data from China that underpinned his research on the strength of recent global warming .
The Guardian has learned that crucial data obtained by American scientists from Chinese collaborators cannot be verified because documents containing them no longer exist .
And what data is available suggests that the findings are fundamentally flawed . ”
24 .
At no time since Keenan and Wigley raised significant doubts about the reliability of Chinese climate data has Jones taken public steps to clear up the discrepancies regarding Wang ’s claims and data .
It is unacceptable that the scientist who disseminates a data product on which international treaties are based , as well as IPCC reports and countless government policies , should actively seek to suppress information that calls the quality of the data into question , especially after one his colleagues and a leading authority has advised him that Keenan ’s evidence about the data appeared to be legitimate .
Comparable behaviour in the private sector would be subject to severe sanction .
25 .
The revelations exposed by the CRU e-mails require the full disclosure of all documents and correspondence in this alleged fraud case .
Until the whole affair is fully and publicly investigated , the reputation and integrity of leading climate scientists will remain to appear tainted and discredited .

Fourteen states have decided to allow medical uses of marijuana .
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy plans to decide on Wednesday whether to recommend that the Iowa Legislature follow suit .
But skeptics say prescription drugs already are available for those purposes , and legalizing marijuana for medical purposes could make it easier to obtain the drug for recreational use , they say .
Sixty - four percent of Iowans support allowing medical uses of marijuana , the Iowa Poll found .
Thirty - three percent oppose the idea .
Three percent are not sure .
Only 28 percent of Iowans favor legalizing marijuana for recreational use , and 70 percent oppose the idea .
Poll participant Kevin Sikkink , 44 , of Decorah agrees with the majorities on both questions .
Sikkink , who teaches part time at a community college and works in electronics , said he believes some ill people could see legitimate benefits from marijuana .
" If it 's under a doctor 's prescription , what 's the difference between that and penicillin ? " he asked .
Sikkink noted that pharmacies already sell addictive drugs , such as OxyContin , which he believes are at least as dangerous as marijuana .
Sikkink thinks legislators have more important things to worry about , including the budget , but he would support an eventual move to legalize medical uses of marijuana in Iowa .
He said he would not support legalizing recreational uses of marijuana , partly because he believes that could legitimize cocaine and other highly addictive drugs .
" I think it provides a nice gateway to the harder stuff , " he said .
Todd Berner , 42 , an engineer from Independence , opposes legalizing marijuana for any uses .
He sees the medical - marijuana campaign as a cover for people who want to get high .
" You can see what 's happened in California .
It 's become a pothead 's dreamland , " he said , referring to the hundreds of marijuana shops that have opened since that state decided to allow medical marijuana use .
Berner said that doctors already can prescribe legal prescription drugs to fight pain or nausea , and they do n't need to add marijuana to the list .
He does n't see why , after taking aggressive action to stem cigarette use , the government would loosen regulations on marijuana .
Ann O'Brien , 75 , of Dubuque said she definitely supports letting patients use marijuana to treat medical problems .
She said she also has no major problem with letting Americans use it for recreational reasons .
" You know , I do n't smoke marijuana — never have , " she said .
" But I do n't think people should go to jail for smoking it .
I do n't think it 's worse than booze . "
O'Brien is a nurse who works for a Catholic church .
She said she believes some patients could be helped by smoking marijuana , especially for pain associated with diseases such as cancer .
" I just do n't know where the harm is in it , especially for someone who is terminal , " she said .
O'Brien 's views , especially on the recreational - use question , are unusual among poll participants her age .
Only 11 percent of Iowans age 65 and older think marijuana should be legalized for recreation .
Support is stronger among younger poll participants .
Forty percent of adults younger than 35 say they support general legalization of the drug .
There is less of a generational split on the medical - marijuana question , the poll shows .
Among seniors , 52 percent favor legalizing the drug for such purposes .
Support is 67 percent among adults younger than 35 .
Iowans ' politics appear to strongly influence their views on the questions .
Support for medical marijuana is 76 percent among Democrats , 47 percent among Republicans , and 66 percent among political independents , the poll shows .
Support for general legalization of marijuana is 36 percent among Democrats , 14 percent among Republicans and 31 percent among independents .
The debate is both philosophical and scientific .
Both sides cite reams of reports on marijuana 's effectiveness and dangers , or lack thereof .
Proponents say the drug is safer and more affordable than many prescription medications .
Opponents say that it is unnecessary , and that legalizing it for medical uses would open the door for more illicit uses .
Support for loosening marijuana laws is stronger nationally than in Iowa , another recent poll found .
The ABC News / Washington
Post poll , released last month , found that 81 percent of Americans support allowing marijuana use for medical reasons , and 46 percent favor legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use in general .
New Jersey last month became the 14th state to allow medical uses of marijuana .
The others are Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington state .
The states vary in how much marijuana users may possess , how they must document their medical need , and where they may obtain the drug .
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law , but President Barack Obama 's administration has said it would not prosecute patients for using it if they follow rules states set for medical purposes .
Federal law forbids physicians from formally prescribing the drug , but they may write notes saying they approve of a patient 's use of it .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Congress ' job approval rating from Americans fell six points in the past month , from 24 % to 18 % -- the lowest reading in more than a year .
Nearly 8 in 10 ( 78 % ) now disapprove .
This decline in congressional approval is largely explained by a sharp drop in approval among rank - and - file Democrats , from 45 % in January to 30 % today .
The slight changes in approval among Republicans and independents are not statistically significant .
In a related finding , among ideological groups , approval of Congress is down mainly among liberals ( from 40 % in January to 24 % today ) .
Support from moderates was already fairly low , at 28 % , and is now 21 % .
There has been no change in approval among conservatives , at 14 % .
Looking at the partisan trends on congressional approval since the start of last year , it is clear that Democrats ' support for the body was restored shortly after President Barack Obama was sworn in , rising from 18 % in January 2009 to 43 % in February .
It rose further to 57 % in March and remained at or above 50 % for the next several months .
However , Democrats ' approval of Congress subsequently withered ( with a brief dip to 36 % last fall ) , and now stands at its lowest level since Obama took office .
Approval of Congress has consistently been below 20 % among Republicans and independents for several months .
The new poll was conducted Feb. 1 - 3 , shortly after Obama 's Jan. 27 State of the Union address in which he leveled several criticisms at Congress ( and particularly the Senate ) for failing to advance his legislative agendas on healthcare , banking , jobs , energy , and other issues .
He also pointedly called on both parties to support greater transparency for congressional earmarks and to tone down their partisanship .
The all - time low Gallup reading on congressional approval is 14 % , recorded in July 2008 .
Prior to this , 18 % was the lowest in Gallup 's history of asking this question , which dates to 1974 .
In addition to the current measure , congressional approval was at 18 % for several months in 2008 as well as in March 1992 .
It was only slightly higher in June 1979 ( 19 % ) and October 1994 ( 21 % ) .
Bottom Line
Congress enjoyed a bump in public approval at the start of last year as the Obama administration was getting underway -- fueled mostly by enhanced approval among Democrats and independents .
Nearly all of that heightened support among independents had peeled off by last fall , and now Democrats are breaking away .
President Obama's State of the Union speech may help explain Democrats ' heightened displeasure with Congress .
With 86 % of Democrats nationwide approving of the job Obama is doing as president in the latest poll , the president 's words clearly carry a great deal of weight with them : if Obama appears to be frustrated with Congress ( albeit Democrat controlled ) , then many Democrats will follow suit .
Still , it is not clear whether Democrats ' disapproval of Congress is directed more at the Republicans ( for obstructing Obama 's agenda ) or more at the Democrats ( for allowing it to languish ) .
That is something Gallup will explore in future polling .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,025 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 1 - 3 , 2010 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
The U.S. teen pregnancy rate rose by 3 percent in 2006 , the first increase in a decade , according to a study by the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute .
Its researchers posit a link between that uptick ( about 71 teen girls in 1,000 got pregnant in 2006 , up from 69 the year before ) and the Bush administration 's push for abstinence - only education programs — a link that abstinence advocates reject , noting that only a quarter of the nation 's teen sex -ed classes adopted Bush 's programs .
Did the president 's initiative leave teens clueless on how to avoid getting pregnant ?
( Watch CBS 's Katie Couric give her thoughts on the teen pregnancy rate )
Of course it did :
The drop in teen pregnancy rates we saw in the 1990s was a direct result of " increased contraception use , " says Jill Filipovic in Feministe .
Then George W. Bush came to power , Congress funnelled a fortune into abstinence - only programs , and more teens got pregnant .
It 's a no - brainer : " Telling kids just to keep it in their pants until marriage " does n't work , and telling them to use condoms does .
" Teen pregnancy and abortion up for the first time in a decade .
Thanks , abstinence - only education ! "
Delaying sex works : Research " unmistakably " proves that delaying sexual initiation is better for " the sexual health of young people than simply passing out condoms , " says Valerie Huber of the National Abstinence Education Association , as quoted in The Washington Post .
These findings only prove that we need to reach teenagers more effectively – the real culprits are a " lack of involved and positive role models , and the dominant [ cultural ] message that teen sex is expected and without consequences . "
" Rise in teenage pregnancy rate spurs new debate on arresting it "
The truth is more complicated than cultural warriors think : " As fun as it is to bash the religious right with this , " say the editors of The Economist , " the causal web " behind the rise in teen pregnancy rates is not so obvious .
For example , " North Dakota , which hasa state - funded abstinence - only program , [ boasts ] one of the lowest teen pregancy rates ; Arizona , which does n't , has one of the highest .
Researchers should consider other factors " ranging from health - care access ( particularly among the Hispanic teenagers ) " to the ' prevention fatigue ' triggered by the 1990s ' " safe - sex zeal . "
" Growing pains , cont 'd "
The Communications Minister Stephen Conroy was published in today ’s Crikey , firing back at several pieces run over the last week about his government ’s mandatory ISP filtering scheme , including one of my own .
I ’m very happy to see the minister respond personally and at length ; over the last year we have been starved of information on the plan , and the debate , such as it was , has often been in the form of quick sound bites .
Discussing the real facts for a change is a welcome development .
( Plus , it ’s nice to know that a slightly miffed Commonwealth Minister is amongst my readership . )
The fact is that this is a complex policy and there are a fair few misunderstandings out there on both sides of the issue .
If I were minister , factual inaccuracies and exaggerations would annoy me , too .
Sometimes in dealing with the media it ’s hard to get a nuanced point across and things get inadvertently misrepresented .
Personally , and as a representative of EFA , I sincerely regret any inaccuracies , and even the “ cheap shots . ”
But it ’s no point raising a fuss about them , then making your own .
Sure , I slip up from time to time , but to suggest I am “ blurring the lines , burying the facts and wilfully misleading the Australian public ” seems the sort of exaggeration Senator Conroy is himself complaining about .
So let ’s see how many mea culpas I owe .
Senator Conroy implies that perhaps the reason Australia ’s image is suffering is due to my own rabble - rousing .
I wish this were the case , but the Minister has to share some of the blame .
It ’s an inescapable fact that this filter is censorship , and that such censorship in a free country like Australia is unsettling to observers overseas .
The Minister , of course , sees the policy as benign ; that ’s fair enough from his point of view , but that does n’t change how the rest of the world sees it .
Yes , “ Iran of the South Pacific ” is an obvious exaggeration – but the filter is tarnishing our reputation .
In my piece I was reporting on the letter from Reporters Without Borders , and their Secretary - General used words I would n’t myself ( the reference to aborigines is confusing to me , too ) .
However , the anorexia , abortion and marijuana sale examples could all fall under the categories mentioned by the Minister in his very next paragraph ( crime , self - harm , drug use ) .
Surely it is a legitimate concern to speculate about what ’s at the margins of the RC system ?
It ’s neither interesting nor helpful to confine our attentions to the “ worst of the worst ” , the unavailability of which is uncontroversial .
This is also a little strange :
Jacobs argues that the government ’s policy will “ block access to inappropriate websites ” , the same language he criticised the government for using months ago as being unclear .
Am I being criticised for using vague language to describe the scheme , even though the words are his own , and I ’m expressing concern about their very vagueness ?
Most galling is the Minister ’s outrage at my statement that in the past he has implied filter opponents are “ all card - carrying members of the Child Pornorgaphy Apologists League ” .
Of course , that ’s not a direct quote – hence my use of the word “ implies ” – so I ca n’t produce such a quote .
But how about this ?
If people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography , then the Rudd - Labor Government is going to disagree . [ 1 ]
Does n’t that imply that filter opponents are advocates of more liberal child porn laws ( they are n’t ) .
Or in answer to a question in the Senate as to whether the filter will be opt - out , the Minister replied :
I trust you are not suggesting that people should have access to child pornography . [ 2 ]
Senator Ludlam , the questioner , was indeed not suggesting that .
So why smugly bring it up ?
The debate has never been about the legal status of child pornography , and to pretend that it is is , as I wrote , a distraction that simultaneously smears the filter ’s opponents .
Those are two examples I remember and I know offended many .
If you can remind me of any further examples , I ’ll chronicle them here .
The Minister ’s kind query about my whereabouts for the last nine years seems pretty irrelevant to substance of my argument .
As it happens , I was in the USA , and I did not join the EFA board until 2007 .
Nevertheless , EFA was certainly a vocal opponent of the 1999 amendments to the Broadcasting Services
Act that gave us the equally useless system we have today , including the infamous ACMA blacklist .
The fact is , the reason there is so much confusion about this policy is that while it has changed markedly over time , the government have tried to maintain that it was always as it is ; and the vagueness of the original , pre-election policy document is used to help prop up this illusion , rather than acknowledging it and providing a more detailed document for the community to dissect .
The minister concludes with the following rhetorical question :
Let me repeat the government has been clear that mandatory filtering will only apply to RC - rated content .
This content is not available in newsagencies , on library shelves , at the cinema or on DVD and you certainly can’t watch it on TV .
Why should n’t Australian ISPs be required to block access to such content ?
Because it ’s pointless , it ’s expensive , it ’s done in secret , and there are no guarantees the scope will not increase under this or a future government .
And these are exactly the points I am trying to make in the public debate .
If this is misleading , then it ’s up to you , Minister , to demonstrate why that is so .

Special Report
Israeli Organ Trafficking and Theft : From Moldova to Palestine
By Alison Weir
In August Sweden ’s largest daily newspaper published an article containing grisly evidence suggesting that Israel had been taking Palestinian internal organs .
The article , by veteran photojournalist Donald Bostrom , called for an international investigation to discover the facts .
1
Israel immediately accused Bostrom and the newspaper of “ anti-Semitism , ” and charged that suggesting Israelis could be involved in the illicit removal of body parts constituted a modern “ blood libel ” ( medieval stories of Jews killing people for their blood ) .
2
Numerous Israeli partisans repeated these accusations , including Commentary ’s Jonathan Tobin , who asserted that the story was “ merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of European funded and promoted anti-Israel hate . ”
3
Others suggested that the newspaper was “ irresponsible ” for running such an article .
4
The fact is , however , that Israeli organ harvesting — sometimes with Israeli governmental funding and the participation of high Israeli officials , prominent Israeli physicians , and Israeli ministries — has been documented for many years .
Among the victims have been Palestinians .
Nancy Scheper - Hughes is Chancellor ’s Professor of Medical Anthropology at the University of California Berkeley , the founder of Organ Watch , and the author of scholarly books and articles on organ trafficking .
She is the pundit mainstream media call upon when they need expert commentary on the topic .
5
While Scheper - Hughes emphasizes that traffickers and procurers come from numerous nations and ethnicities , including Americans and Arabs , she is unflinchingly honest in speaking about the Israeli connection :
“ Israel is at the top , ” she states .
“ It has tentacles reaching out worldwide . ”
6
In a lecture last year sponsored by New York ’s PBS 13 Forum , Scheper - Hughes explained that Israeli organ traffickers , “ had and still have a pyramid system at work that ’s awesome ... they have brokers everywhere , bank accounts everywhere ; they ’ve got recruiters , they ’ve got translators , they ’ve got travel agents who set up the visas . ”
Lest this sound simply like a successful international concern , it ’s important to understand the nature of such a business .
As Scheper - Hughes describes it , organ trafficking consists of “ paying the poor and the hungry to slowly dismantle their bodies . ”
Organ traffickers prey on the world ’s poorest , most desperate citizens — slum dwellers , inhabitants of dying villages , people without means or hope .
Traffickers promise them what seem like astronomical sums of money ( from $ 1,000 to $ 10,000 ) — which they frequently do n’t even deliver — in return for vital internal organs .
For traffickers , human body parts are commodities , to be cut out of the bodies of the poor and sold to the rich .
The organ “ donors ” receive no follow - up care and end up worse off on many levels — physically , financially , psychologically , socially — than even their original tragic situation .
Sometimes they are coerced into such “ donations . ”
Organ sales have been illegal in most countries for years .
The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , which covers prevention , enforcement and sanctions in trafficking of humans , includes in its definition of human exploitation the extraction of organs for profit .
7
Israel finally passed legislation against organ trafficking in 2008.8 , 9
In her Forum 13 lecture Scheper - Hughes discussed the two motivations of Israeli traffickers .
One was greed , she said .
The other was somewhat chilling : “ Revenge , restitution — reparation for the Holocaust . ”
She described speaking with Israeli brokers who told her “ it ’s kind of ” ˜an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
We ’re going to get every single kidney and liver and heart that we can .
The world owes it to us . ’ ”
Scheper - Hughes says that she “ even heard doctors saying that . ”
For many years Israelis in need of an internal organ have gone on what experts call “ transplant tourism ” — traveling to other nations to obtain internal organs .
Sometimes body parts are obtained from those freshly dead ; more often from the desperately needy .
While affluent people from numerous countries and ethnicities engage in this practice , Israel is unique in several significant ways .
First , Israelis engage in this at an extraordinarily high rate .
According to a 2001 BBC report , Israelis buy more kidneys per capita than any other population .
Second , Israelis have the lowest donor rate in the world — one - fifth that of Europe , according to BBC .
This is in part because there has been a widespread impression that Jewish religious law prohibits transplants as a “ desecration of the body .
” 10 The Israeli news service Ynet reports , “ the percentage of organs donated among Jews is the lowest of all the ethnic groups .
”
11
Third , the Israeli government has enabled the practice .
For many years the Israeli health system subsidized its citizens ’ “ transplant holidays , ” reimbursing Israelis $ 80,000 for medical operations abroad .
Much of the remaining costs could often be obtained from government - subsidized 12 Israeli insurance plans.13
In addition , Israel ’s Ministry of Defense was directly involved .
Scheper - Hughes discussed Israeli organ trafficking in detail in 2001 in published testimony to the Subcommittee on International Relations and Human Rights of the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
14
In her extensive testimony , Scheper - Hughes stated that although Israel had become a pariah for its organ policies , Israeli officials exhibited “ amazing tolerance ... toward outlawed ” transplant tourism . ’ ”
She described an international syndicate which was “ organized through a local business corporation in conjunction with a leading transplant surgeon , operating out of a major medical center not far from Tel Aviv , ” and which had forged links with transplant surgeons in Turkey , Russia , Moldavia , Estonia , Georgia , Romania , and New York City .
The Israeli Ministry of Defense was directly involved in what Scheper - Hughes called Israel ’s “ ” illicit [ in other nations ] national ” ˜program ’ of transplant tourism ... Members of the Ministry of Defense or those closely related to them ” accompanied transplant junkets .
In her Forum 13 lecture , Scheper - Hughes said that investigating Israeli organ trafficking over the past decade had taken her “ from country to country to country to country . ”
One of these is Moldova , the poorest country in Europe — and homeland of Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman — where 90 percent of the people earn less than $ 2 a day .
A 2001 BBC report on organ trafficking described the situation : “ Hundreds of Israelis have created a production line that starts in the villages of Moldova , where men today are walking around with one kidney .
15
Another is Brazil , where a legislative commission found that 30 [ it may actually have been as high as 60 ]
Brazilians from impoverished neighborhoods had sold their kidneys to a trafficking ring headed by Israelis , with Israeli citizens receiving almost all of the organs , and the Israeli government providing most of the funding .
16
The ring had also begun inquiring about buying other vital organs from poor residents , including lungs , livers and corneas.17
An Inter Press Service ( IPS ) news story from the time reported that Scheper - Hughes testified to the commission that international trafficking of human organs had begun some 12 years earlier , promoted by Zaki Shapira , head of kidney transplant services at Bellinson Medical Center , near Tel Aviv .
Scheper - Hughes reported that Shapira had performed more than 300 kidney transplants , sometimes accompanying his patients to other countries such as Turkey .
The recipients were very wealthy or had very good health insurance , and the “ donors ” very poor people from Eastern Europe , the Philippines and other developing countries .
The chairman of the Brazilian commission , physician Raimundo Pimentel , was outraged at Israeli policies , pointing out that trafficking can only take place on a large scale if there is a major source of financing , such as the Israeli health system .
Pimentel charged that the resources provided by the Israeli health system “ were a determining factor ” in enabling a network that preyed on society ’s poorest populations .
In 2004 there were reports that Israeli traffickers had added China to their target donor populations .
18
In one recent case an Israeli paid an organ broker $ 100,000 for a kidney transplant in China from an 18 - year - old Chinese girl .
She received $ 5,000 and died following surgery .
19
New York Times reporter Larry Rohter pointed out that allowing brokers to operate with few restrictions benefited Israel “ by exporting Israel ’s organ shortage overseas . ”
Rohter cites a kidney specialist at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem who explained that patients who go abroad “ ” save the country a lot of money ; not only in terms of what does n’t have to be spent on dialysis , but also by opening places for other people who are on the list . ’” 20
Many people find governmental complicity in organ trafficking deeply troubling on moral and philosophical grounds .
As Scheper - Hughes testified : “ The sale of human organs and tissues requires that certain disadvantaged individuals , populations , and even nations have been reduced to the role of ” suppliers . ’
“ It is a scenario in which only certain bodies are broken , dismembered , fragmented , transported , processed , and sold in the interests of a more socially advantaged population ... of receivers . ”
She believes that the risks and benefits of organ transplant surgery should be more equally distributed among nations , ethnic groups , and social classes .
ORGAN THEFT
It is difficult to know how often Israeli trafficking involves outright theft of vital organs from living human beings .
It is not rare for the “ donor ” to receive little or none of the compensation promised .
For example , in 2007 Israel ’s Haaretz newspaper reported that two Israelis had confessed to persuading Palestinians “ from the Galilee and central Israel who were developmentally challenged or mentally ill to agree to have a kidney removed for payment . ”
According to the Haaretz report , after the organ had been taken the traffickers refused to pay for them .
On occasion , people are coerced into giving up their organs .
For example , Levy Izhak Rosenbaum , the alleged Brooklyn trafficker recently arrested in an FBI sweep in New Jersey , reportedly carried a gun .
When a potential organ seller would try to back out , Rosenbaum would use his finger to simulate firing a gun at the person ’s head .
The Rosenbaum case , reportedly part of a ring centered in Israel , is the first case of trafficking to be prosecuted in the US .
His arrest and the substantial evidence against him may have surprised State Department Countermisinformation Director Todd Leventhal , who had characterized organ trafficking as an “ urban legend , ” stating , “ It would be impossible to successfully conceal a clandestine organ - trafficking ring . ”
Leventhal called such reports “ irresponsible and totally unsubstantiated . ”
More often organ theft involves dead bodies — or those alleged to be dead .
Israel ’s very first successful heart transplant , in fact , used a stolen heart .
In 1968 Avraham Sadegat unexpectedly died two days after being hospitalized in Beilinson Hospital in Israel ’s Petah Tikva for a stroke .
When his family finally was able to retrieve his body ( the hospital initially refused to release it ) they found his chest covered with bandages ; odd , they thought , for a stroke victim .
Upon removing these they discovered that the chest cavity was stuffed with bandages and the heart was missing .
21
During this time , the Israeli press was heralding the historic heart transplant , performed by a team of surgeons who were to become some of Israel ’s most celebrated physicians , among them Dr. Morris Levy , Dr. Bernardo Vidne , and Dr Jack Solomon , who harvested the heart .
22
When the family began to ask questions , the hospital denied any connection .
After the man ’s wife and brother had raised a media furor , petitioned three cabinet ministers — and agreed to sign a document that they would not sue — the hospital finally admitted it was Sadegat ’s heart that had been used .
Haaretz quoted Sadegat ’s tearful wife : “ They treated him like an alley cat .
From the moment he entered the hospital , they apparently saw him only as a potential source of organs and not as a man in need of treatment .
They only thought about how to do the deed without us knowing . ”
Sadegat ’s medical condition before his heart was removed has not been made public .
It is possible — perhaps probable — that up until his heart was removed it was still beating ; according to an Israeli media report , “ once a heart stops beating , it is no longer fit for transplantation . ”
23
Even if he was what is now termed “ brain dead , ” the general view is that family members should at least be a party to decisions regarding the patient : first , whether to “ pull the plug , ” and , second , whether to donate an organ .
At the time , however , Israeli law allowed organs to be harvested without the family ’s consent .
Forty years later the hospital held an anniversary celebration of the transplant , despite the fact that , according to Haaretz , the heart had been obtained “ through deceit and trickery . ”
The festivities , which honored surviving members of the transplant team , featured balloons and a red , heart - shaped cake .
In this incident of organ theft ( and from a possibly living body ) , the family was Israeli .
Had the wife and brother been Palestinians from the West Bank or Gaza , they would not have possessed the power to force a confession from the hospital , and it is likely that those individuals today calling the Swedish article a “ blood libel ” or “ irresponsible journalism ” would have applied the same epithets to journalists reporting questions concerning the historic Israeli heart transplant — if any reporters even bothered or dared to do so .
YEHUDA HISS , KEEPER OF THE MORGUE
Perhaps one of the most long - term and high - level cases of organ theft — and one that involves Palestinian as well as Israeli organs — concerns an extraordinarily high official : Dr. Yehuda Hiss , Israel ’s chief pathologist and , from 1988 through 2004 , director of Israel ’s state morgue , the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir .
An early indication of malfeasance came to light in 1998 and concerned a Scottish man named Alisdair Sinclair , who had died under questionable circumstances after being taken into custody at Israel ’s Ben-Gurion Airport .
The Israeli story , as reported by the Israeli news magazine Jerusalem Report , is that Sinclair had confessed to transporting drugs , even though none were found , although he was in possession of 9,000 German marks ( $ 5,000 ) .
He then , the police claim , hanged himself by looping his shoelaces and T - shirt around a towel bar about a meter off the ground and slipped the improvised noose around his neck .
From a squatting position , the police story goes , he repeatedly threw his bodyweight downward , choking himself .
Sinclair did not die , however , and medics were able to restore a heartbeat .
He was transferred to a hospital where , according to the magazine report , the hospital ’s associate director , Dr. Yigal Halperin , said that Sinclair “ had suffered irreversible brain damage , and there was little doctors could do for him .
Left in a corner of the emergency room , he died at 7 p.m .
[ It ’s unknown whether he had been put on life support . ]
His corpse was transferred to the Institute for Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir for an autopsy . ”
Afterwards , Israeli authorities located Sinclair ’s family and gave them three weeks to dispose of the body .
They suggested that he be buried in a Christian cemetery in Israel , pointing out that this would be one - third the cost of shipping the body back to Scotland .
However , the grieving family scraped up the money to bring him home .
They had a second autopsy performed by Glasgow University , only to discover that Sinclair ’s heart and a small bone in his throat called the hyoid were missing .
The British Embassy filed a complaint with Israel , and a heart was sent to Scotland .
According to the Jerusalem Report , the family “ wanted the Forensic Institute to pay for a DNA test to confirm that this heart was indeed their brother ’s , but the Institute ’s director , Prof. Jehuda Hiss , refused , citing the prohibitive cost . ”
Despite a protest from the British government , Israel refused to supply Hiss ’s pathology findings or the police report .
According to the British government and a report in the Israeli media , around the time of Sinclair ’s death a doctor at Tel Aviv ’s Ichilov Hospital put in a request for a hyoid bone for research purposes — and eventually received a bill for shipping costs .
24 Israel retained Sinclair ’s $ 5,000 .
Through the years Hiss and the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic medicine continued to be accused of organ theft .
In 2000 the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot published an investigative report alleging that Hiss had been extracting organs without permission and then packing the bodies with broomsticks and cotton wool to fill in cavities before burial .
The report charged that under Hiss the institute had been involved in organ sales of body parts — “ legs , thighs , ovaries , breasts and testicles , ” allegedly to medical institutions .
In 2001 a district judge found the Institute had performed hundreds of autopsies and had removed body parts without the families ’ permission — and sometimes in direct opposition to their expressed wishes .
25
One report described a “ museum of skulls ” at the institute .
Little was done , however , and complaints continued — often by the parents of dead Israeli soldiers horrified to discover that body parts had been taken from their sons .
Finally , in 2004 Israel ’s health minister transferred directorship of the morgue itself away from Hiss .
Hiss , however , retained his position as Israel ’s chief pathologist , a post it appears he holds to this day .
26 , 27
Hiss had also been connected with two previous national scandals , both of which may have involved powerful people in Israel , which may account for his longevity in Israel ’s medical establishment despite years of proven wrongdoing .
The first controversy concerned the “ Yemenite Children ’s Affair ” — a situation , largely from the early 1950s , in which a thousand babies and small children of recent immigrants to Israel had “ disappeared . ”
When the immigrants had arrived as part of Israel ’s “ ingathering of the exiles , ” babies were immediately taken from their mothers and placed in children ’s houses .
Many were hospitalized for a variety of ills , and hundreds died , their deaths coming in such large numbers that they were announced over loudspeakers .
The distraught parents often never saw the body or received a death certificate , and there were growing suspicions that not all had died — some , it was believed , had been “ given ” to Ashkenazi parents .
One author writes : “ It was a well - known fact within the Jewish community in the United States that if a family wanted a child they could go to [ baby brokers , both rabbis ] and simply pay the necessary fee .
” 28
Some Israeli investigators have found considerable evidence for these charges , and indications of complicity at multiple levels of the power structure .
In fact , one researcher charges : “ People in positions of power at the time that the State of Israel was established profited from the abduction and sale of children from poor immigrant families . ” 29
Hiss ’ connection comes in 1997 , when Israel finally had formed a committee to investigate the disappearance of Yemenite and other Jewish children in the years 1948 - 1954 .
Among those testifying before this committee was a California woman who had come to Israel searching for her biological mother — and , according to DNA testing by a geneticist at Hebrew University , had found her .
The committee demanded that another DNA test be conducted at the Abu Kabir forensic institute .
As at least one observer predicted ahead of time , Hiss ’s test came up negative , and the government was allegedly exonerated , despite the fact that the geneticist who had conducted the first tests stood by his results .
30
Hiss also plays a role in some conspiracy theories regarding the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin , who had begun a peace process with Palestinians .
In March 1999 a group of academics presented findings alleging that Hiss had submitted false evidence to the commission that investigated the killing .
31
PALESTINIAN VICTIMS
Israelis have also targeted Palestinians , a particularly vulnerable population on numerous levels .
In her congressional subcommittee testimony , Scheper - Hughes reported that before he moved overseas , Israeli hospital transplant head Zaki Shapira had located kidney sellers “ amongst strapped Palestinian workers in Gaza and the West Bank . ”
She said that his “ hand was slapped by an ethics board , ” and he moved his practice overseas .
For decades numerous Palestinians and others have charged Israel with taking body parts from Palestinians they had wounded or killed .
In her subcommittee testimony , Scheper - Hughes testified that toward the end of the apartheid period in South Africa , “ human rights groups in the West Bank complained to me of tissue and organs stealing of slain Palestinians by Israeli pathologists at the national Israeli legal medical institute in Tel Aviv . ”
A Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , for Middle East Affairs article by Mary Barrett ( see “ Autopsies and Executions , ” April 1990 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , p. 21 ) reported “ widespread anxiety over organ thefts which has gripped Gaza and the West Bank since the intifada began in December of 1987 . ”
Barrett quotes a forensic physician : “ There are indications that for one reason or another , organs , especially eyes and kidneys , were removed from the bodies during the first year or year and a half .
There were just too many reports by credible people for there to be nothing happening .
If someone is shot in the head and comes home in a plastic bag without internal organs , what will people assume ? ”
A 2002 news story from IRNA reported that three Palestinian boys aged 14 - 15 had been killed by Israeli forces on Dec. 30 , their bodies finally being returned for burial on Jan .
6 . According to the report : “ shortly before burial , Palestinian medical authorities examined the bodies and found out that the main vital organs were missing from the bodies . ”
In an interview on Al Jazeera , President Yasser Arafat held up photos of the boys , saying , “ They murder our kids and use their organs as spare parts . ”
Journalist Khalid Amayreh , recently investigating this topic further , found that “ several other Palestinians gave a similar narrative , recounting how they received the bodies of their murdered relatives , mostly men in their early twenties , with vital organs taken away by the Israeli authorities . ”
Israel has consistently characterized such accusations as “ anti-Semitic , ” and numerous other journalists have discounted them as exaggerations .
However , according to the pro-Israel Forward magazine , the truth of these charges was , in fact , confirmed by an Israeli governmental investigation a number of years ago .
In a recent story critical of the Swedish article , the Forward actually confirmed its main point , that Israel had been taking the body parts of slain Palestinians .
The Forward article reported that one of the governmental investigations into Hiss had revealed that “ he seemed to view every body that ended up in his morgue , whether Israeli or Palestinian , as fair game for organ harvesting .
” 32
Over the years , a great many Palestinian bodies have “ ended up ” in the Israeli morgue .
In numerous cases Israeli occupation forces have taken custody of wounded or dead Palestinians .
Sometimes their bodies are never returned to their grieving families — Palestinian NGOs say there are at least 250 such cases .
In other cases the bodies have been returned to the families days later , with crudely stitched naval - to - chin incisions .
On many occasions Israeli soldiers have delivered the bodies late at night and required the bereaved families to bury their children , husbands , and brothers immediately , under Israeli military guard , sometimes with the electricity shut off .
In 2005 an Israeli soldier33 described a military doctor who gave “ medics lessons in anatomy ” using the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces .
Haaretz reports :
“ The soldier said that the Palestinian ’s body had been riddled with bullets and that some of his internal organs had spilled out .
The doctor pronounced the man dead and then ” ˜took out a knife and began to cut off parts of the body , ’ the soldier said .
“ ” He explained the various parts to us — the membrane that covers the lungs , the layers of the skin , the liver , stuff like that , ’ the soldier continued .
” I did n’t say anything because I was still new in the army .
Two of the medics moved away , and one of them threw up .
It was all done very brutally .
It was simply contempt for the body . ’” 34
While most Israeli investigations into organ theft have largely ignored the Palestinian component , a number of significant facts are known :
Palestinian organs were harvested during years of an astonishingly lax system in which the body parts even of Jewish Israelis were extracted illicitly at the national morgue by the chief pathologist and exchanged for money .
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are largely a captive population .
Numerous reports by highly reputable Israeli and international organizations have documented a situation in which Palestinians have few if any real rights ; Israeli forces have killed civilians with impunity , imprisoned massive numbers of people without benefit of trials , and routinely abused prisoners .
Israeli authorities have conducted numerous autopsies of Palestinians without permission of their families , without even a semblance of public transparency , and without , it appears , accompanying reports .
For example , the families of those who were taken while still alive are not provided with a medical report stating time and cause of death .
A very small but significant minority of Israelis , including military officers and governmental ministers , hold extremist supremacist views relevant to organ extraction .
In 1996 , Jewish Week reported that Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburgh , a leader of the Lubavitch sect of Judaism and the dean of a religious Jewish school in a West Bank settlement , stated : “ If a Jew needs a liver , can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him ?
The Torah would probably permit that . ”
Ginzburgh elaborated : “ Jewish life has infinite value .
There is something infinitely more holy and unique about Jewish life than non-Jewish life . ”
[ The Jewish Week , April 26 , 1996 , pp. 12 , 31 ]
While most Israelis strenuously repudiate such beliefs , Rabbi Moshe Greenberg , an Israeli scholar on Jewish scriptural views on racism and ethnic chauvinism , has said , “ The sad thing is , these statements are in our books . ”
Greenberg , who was a professor at Hebrew University , pointed out that such Talmudic texts were “ purely theoretical ” at the time of their writing , because Jews did not have the power to carry them out .
Now , he pointed out , “ they ’re carried over into circumstances where Jews have a state and are empowered . ”
While it is impossible to know whether any Israelis have ever acted on such religious permission to kill a non-Jew in order to provide body parts to Jews , some observers have considered this a possibility .
Dr. A. Clare Brandabur , a distinguished American scholar who has lived and traveled extensively in Palestine , writes that the information published in the Swedish article “ resonates with reports from Palestinians in Gaza which I heard during the first intifada . ”
She comments , “ When I interviewed Dr. Haidar Abdul Shafi , head of the Red Crescent in Gaza , I mentioned to him reports of shootings of Palestinian children at times when there were no ” clashes ’ going on — a solitary 6 - year - old entering his schoolyard in the morning with his bookbag on his back .
The soldiers abducted the wounded child at gunpoint , then his body would be returned a few days later having undergone an ” autopsy at Abu Kabir Hospital . ’ ”
She says : “ I asked Dr. Shafi if he had considered the possibility that these killings were being done for organ transplant , since ( as Israel Shahak notes in Jewish History , Jewish Religion ) , it is not allowed to take Jewish organs to save a Jewish life , but it is allowed to take the organs of non-Jews to save Jewish lives .
Dr. Shafi said he had suspected such things but since they had no access to the records of Abu Kabir Hospital , there was no way to verify these suspicions . ”
Scheper - Hughes , in her congressional testimony , describes the danger of “ organs got by any means possible including ( I was told by one guilt - ridden practitioner ) chemically inducing the signs of brain death in dying patients of no means and with access to minimal social support or family surveillance . ”
Whether or not there have ever been organ - inspired murders in Israel as it appears there have elsewhere , numerous groups around the world are urging an international investigation into Israel ’s handling of Palestinian bodies in its custody .
However , the Israeli government and its powerful advocates abroad , who regularly block investigations into Israeli actions , are doing their utmost to prevent this one .35 , 36 Several lawsuits have been filed against the Swedish newspaper , the largest by Israeli lawyer and IDF officer Guy Ophir , who filed a $ 7.5 million lawsuit in New York against the newspaper and Bostrom .
Ophir declared that Israel must “ silence the reporter and the newspaper . ”
37
International investigations , of course , have two results : the innocent are absolved , the guilty discovered .
It is clear which category Israel believes it falls into .
Alison Weir is executive director of If Americans Knew and is on the board of the Council for the National Interest .

So can you blame a news outlet for using shortcuts and falling into the same old mistakes and cliches over and over again , just to fill space ?
Reporting the news is really hard .
We 've seen those poor guys standing in the hurricanes , trying to hold on to their microphone while debris flies by .
And it 's a good thing we have them ; blogs and Twitter are nice , but to find out what 's really going on in the world , at some point you need good old - fashioned journalism .
5 Let 's Ask the Idiots About Science

When it comes to matters of opinion or personal beliefs , it is absolutely the duty of the news media to report both sides ( and any extra sides there may be , on those rare odd occasions when there are somehow more than two ) .
It does n't matter which one they agree with , they need to acknowledge the fact that some people think gay marriage is a right and others think the gays are forming a unicorn army that will kill us all .

When it comes to matters of fact , however , they absolutely do not have that duty .
Particularly when it comes to technical or scientific matters where it takes somebody with training to speak knowledgably on the subject .
If we 're talking about if , say , vaccines cause autism , we need to hear from scientists .
That 's a scientific issue .
We do not need to hear from Jenny McCarthy or Jim fucking Carrey , in the name of giving " both sides . "
Jim and Jenny do n't get a side .
They have no background in the subject , and it's one that requires fucking background .
Once this happens , your opinion on medicine does n't matter .

Sure , they can talk about poisonous vaccines to Oprah or whoever is sitting next to them at the Lakers game all they want .
They have freedom of speech .
That freedom does not guarantee them a seat on a panel of experts .
Yet , this kind of stupidity happens constantly .
You get articles like this one from the Toronto Star , explaining how an investigation revealed how World Trade Center building 7 collapsed :
Scientists with the National Institute of Standards and Technology say their three - year investigation of the collapse determined the demise of WTC 7 was the first time in the world a fire caused the total failure of a modern skyscraper .
Okay , one more time , Rudy Giuliani said today :
We had no domestic attacks under Bush ; we ’ve had one under Obama .
Wow .
I saw this at Political Wire where Taegan noted , Rudy was “ apparently forgetting one big day . ”
Rudy and Bush built their political careers around that one unforgettable domestic attack , which killed over 3,000 people .
Media Matters documents several other terrorist attacks in the U.S. while Bush was in charge .
Including the shoe bomber , the Anthrax attacks on the US Congress …
Warner Brothers with Legendary Films made official just now what everybody in Hollywood already knew : its upcoming slate will be filled with 3D titles .
Its feature film Clash of the Titans will be released in 3D worldwide and simultaneously in 2D on Easter Weekend April 2nd .
( Which prompted several studios to hastily move release dates so as not to compete . )
Doing the visual effects work will be Prime Focus , which received an Oscar nod today for Avatar .
Additional titles in 2010 that will be released in 3D ( in addition to 2D ) include Cats & Dogs : The Revenge of Kitty Galore ( July ) , Guardians of Ga’Hoole ( September ) , and Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows , Part 1 ( November ) — and I ’m told Part II as well at a later date
Said Dan Fellman , President , Domestic Distribution , Warner Bros Pictures , in the announcement , “ We are experienced and have been successful in the conversion of 2D to 3D going back to such hits as The Polar Express , select scenes in Superman Returns and the last two Harry Potter films . ”
Fellman continued , “ The results for Clash of the Titans will be presented onscreen with the highest - quality images available today . ”
Jeff Robinov , President , Warner Bros Picture Group , said , “ We ’re excited about 3D and look forward to bringing a rich , involving visual experience to audiences around the world . ”

' True , I did make a pretty decent picture , but the harsh reality is I am just lucky to be around talking about it today . '

An armed Oruzgan District militia member carrying a RPG and others with heavy weapons flood into the bunker area near the Oruzgan District Chief compound in Afghanistan .
There is one image from the past ten years that brings a smile to my face while also reminding me of just how stupid and naïve I can be at times and just how lucky I am to be here today .
In 2004 , while on a week - long mission with a US Special Forces team in Afghanistan , I found myself looking down a hillside with armed men appearing from doors and buildings running up a hill directly towards me .
What I did n’t realize at the time was the Special Forces team members had all very quickly moved to defensive positions .
Me , I just stood on a hill making pictures of guys with weapons heading my way .
In the few seconds before things began to register , I still had the camera up to my face and continued making pictures .
Standing very vulnerable and very much in the open , I forgot the simple fact that this was war .
Very naive and very irresponsible .
True , I did make a pretty decent picture , but the harsh reality is I am just lucky to be around talking about it today .
As that young man carrying an RPG on his shoulder followed by other gunmen climbed closer to me , realization finally took hold of just how bad the situation was .
I remember perfectly the moment I realized just how badly I had screwed up .
I was in trouble .
Serious trouble .
I do n’t know if it was luck or just self - preservation but I dropped the camera from my face and confronted this stone faced man with the RPG now just yards away from me .
I have no idea why but I looked directly into the man ’s eyes and I opened up with one of the cheesiest smiles of all time .
All teeth
Believe it or not , the guy looking back at me broke out into a most memorable smile as well and he pushed right by me .
Continuing up the hill along with the others following his lead leaving me untouched and unharmed .
That simple photograph of a man running up a hill with an RPG in Afghanistan reminds me everyday of second chances and the importance of my choices and the consequences that follow those choices .

Why hello there , slightly smaller Droid !
I have so many questions for you .
Like , why do you have Motoblur ?
How much do you cost ?
When can people buy you ?
Why are n't you officially part of the " Droid " line ?
Advertisement
Apparently nobody 's awake in Motorola land right now , so I 'll hazard a guess at answer these questions myself , in order : Because Motorola is inexplicably obsessed with Motoblur , which can make any Android phone feel like a feature phone ; less than the Droid , and probably about the same as the Droid Eris ( $ 100 or less ) ; the beginning of next month ; and I have no idea , because this phone has more in common with the Droid than the Droid Eris does .
But anyway , here 's what Motorola does tell us the Devour comes with , much of which we were fully expecting :
Advertisement
• A touch - sensitive navigation pad
• A 3.1 " capacitive touch screen ( to the Droid 's 3.7 - inch screen )
• Pre-loaded applications such as Gmail , Google Talk , YouTube , Google Search and Google Maps with Google Maps Navigation , which implies that the software is at least Android 1.6 , though hopefully 2.0 or 2.1 .
• MOTOBLUR , and all the social network -y business that entails .
• An 8 GB microSD card
What we have here is a competent little phone , shrouded in artificially enforced mystery .
Is it worth your time ?
I honestly have no idea , until we have a price .
Here 's the Full press release below .

UPDATE : Aaaand for a little perspective , here 's what it looks like next to a Nexus One .

Statement from the CIA on the 2001 Peru Shootdown
The CIA says no cover - up occurred , and called the shootdown 'a tragic episode . '
Feb . 3 , 2010  --
The CIA provided this statement in response to Wednesday 's ABC News report on the 2001 Shootdown of Plane Carrying American Missionaries Over Peru
Statement from CIA 's Office of Public Affairs on the 2001 Peru Shootdown
The program to deny drug traffickers an " air bridge " ended in 2001 and was run by a foreign government .
CIA personnel had no authority either to direct or prohibit actions by that government .
CIA officers did not shoot down any airplane .
In the case of the tragic downing of April 21st , 2001 , CIA personnel protested the identification of the missionary plane as a suspect drug trafficker .
Shortly after the tragedy , CIA 's Inspector General and the Department of Justice began a joint investigation .
This episode was also reviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee .
The Department of Justice declined to prosecute any CIA official in February 2005 .
With that decision made , the Office of Inspector General delivered its report in August 2008 .
In December 2008 , after reviewing the document , CIA Director Hayden convened an Agency Accountability Board .
The Accountability Board conducted its own thorough review .
While it found that procedures associated with this counternarcotics initiative eroded over time , it found no evidence of a cover - up .
Director Panetta , upon reviewing the Accountability Board 's work , issued sanctions for 16 individuals , including current and former Agency officials .
Those sanctions were for shortcomings in reporting and supervision .
The Board also determined that " reasonable suspicion " — the basis on which to identify a plane as suspect — was established in every shootdown except that of April 21st , 2001 , when , tragically , innocent lives were lost .
The Board concluded that no CIA officer acted inappropriately with respect to the 2001 shootdown .
This program , now long over , has been looked at very carefully , inside and outside the CIA .
The Agency has briefed the oversight committees of Congress on the actions the Agency has taken in this matter .
Any talk of a cover - up , let alone improper attempts to persuade the Department of Justice not to pursue prosecutions , is flat wrong .
This was a tragic episode that the Agency has dealt with in a professional and thorough manner .
Unfortunately , some have been willing to twist facts to imply otherwise .
In so doing , they do a tremendous disservice to CIA officers , serving and retired , who have risked their lives for America 's national security .
German boffins have carried out a groundbreaking study into the habits of fat birds as compared to thin ones .
They say that the plumper subjects in their sample had more one - night stands than the slim ones , and that the chubbies in general achieved sexual congress sooner than their lightweight counterparts .
According to a statement issued by the Max Planck Institutes :
While pockets of flab accumulated over the winter months may be a source of frustration for some , it can be a cause of joy for others ...
The researchers fitted ten fat birds and ten lean birds on the Italian island of Ventotene with temporary adhesive radio transmitters .
Monitoring their test subjects using the stick - on surveillance bugs , the German boffins found that the more rotund ones had sex sooner and generally slept only one night in any given location .
Plumpness led to sexual success for the wobblebottomed group , while their spindly counterparts took longer to get any action - and tended to make longer stays of more than one night , too .
" We assume that the majority of the birds arrived on the island the morning we caught them , " says Wolfgang Goymann of the Max Planck Gesellschaft .
Full details of the research into warblers can be read courtesy of the Royal Society journal Biology Letters , here . ®
The 24 Best Chat Roulette Screenshots [ NSFW ]
Chat Roulette is quickly becoming the go to site if you want to chat with the most socially depraved people you will ever interact with .
It 's mostly dudes masturbating , but every now and then you 'll get a good laugh out of it .
[ Update : Here are 30 More Great Chat Roulette Screenshots ]
The next time your partner is n't in the mood for some nookie , how about tempting him or her with a piece of ... er... pork ?
It may sound strange , but Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez swears that a little bit of pig has a whole lot of pop to it .
quotes the president :
Reuters
" I 've just been told something I did n't know ; that eating pork improves your sex life ...
I 'd say it 's a lot nicer to eat a bit of grilled pork than take Viagra , " President Cristina Fernandez said to leaders of the pig farming industry .
She said she recently ate pork and " things went very well that weekend , so it could well be true . "
Well , maybe pork could spice things up in the bedroom , but plenty of other foods have previously been rumored to be aphrodisiacs , like oysters , bananas , figs , strawberries , raspberries , sweet basil , and garlic .
It also helps to remember that President Fernandez made this remark while addressing bigwigs from the pig farming industry , and that the country is trying to get beef - happy Argentinians to eat more pork .
Speaking of pigs , there 's related news from Europe .
A new law approved by the upper house of the Dutch parliament bans human sex with animals , which until now was legal in the Netherlands , providing the animal was unharmed .
The new law also prohibits the production or distribution of animal pornography , dealing a body blow to -- ahem - - animal lovers around the world .
Reuters reports :
Given the illicit nature of the product , precise figures on animal pornography video sales are difficult to find , but the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad , in a 2007 survey , found that distributors in the Netherlands were responsible for some 80 percent of bestiality videos worldwide .
So , no more crazy horse - lady - man - tortoise videos anymore .
Which could potentially be a blow to frustrated Chinese migrant workers who , the Chinese government worries , are n't getting enough action .
Guangdong province , whose export industries are powered by millions of migrant workers from across China , is home to many men who have left their wives behind -- and 36 percent of those married men , according to a new China Daily survey , are sexually repressed .
The provincial government is now anxious that these men could be out and about , indulging in unsafe sex .
Meanwhile , women may also be corrupted , China Daily reported , and could be turning to the internet for release -- going as far as " participating in the online sex industry , such as chatting to men online while nude . "

By Doug Wead
Once more , after being written out of the script by the newspapers and television producers , the scrappy congressman from Texas , Ron Paul is back in the mix .
And big time .
Sarah Palin , of all people , put him there .
After turning down thousands of speaking invitations over a six month period Sarah Palin finally accepted a gig for the National Tea Party , a grass roots phenomenon that owes its life to that unstoppable old man from Texas .
And then the news that she is endorsing Rand Paul , the congressman ’s son , and an emerging star in the Kentucky Senate race .
Who says Sarah Palin is dumb ?
She is tapping into the hottest political movement going .
This is no accident for it is Ron Paul , the old congressman , not Mitt Romney or Mike Huckabee , or Newt Gingrich that now stands between her and a shoe - in for the GOP nomination .
Palin is a fighter .
She will quickly approve TV ads blasting away on Romney ’s flip flops from his Massachusetts gubernatorial days .
He is already reportedly moving more to the center , writing off some southern states .
Using that momentum she will likely push him all the way off the leftist edge .
Her commercials will make Huckabee ’s 2008 Iowa Romney attack ads look puny by comparison .
And as for Huck ?
After the Arkansas parole board scandals he will see those revolving door – Willie Horton ads resurrected and showing ad nauseum on untraceable You Tubes .
Newt Gingrich can go on James Dobson ’s radio show and repent as much as he wants , he can even publicly cry like Jimmy Swaggart , but Palin ’s people will anonymously spoon feed Dateline and 20 /20 every tiny morsel of his private life .
Palin is no softy .
The fact is , Sarah Palin can only be stopped on her way to her GOP coronation by a Ron Paul ambush in Iowa .
Only Paul has activists who will fall on their swords for him and will go to work early enough to make a difference .
Yes , I know .
Ron Paul is too old .
And he did not poll well last time .
But his base only really discovered him late in the process and they have been very busy since .
He has grown on a lot of people .
What looked nutty in 2008 , like actually auditing the Federal Reserve , is now widely accepted as common sense .
The national Tea Party sprang from his loins .
But the biggest and most powerful issue that separates Ron Paul from the pack is the ongoing War on Terror .
Every major candidate in both parties buys into the idea of a “ just war . ”
Palin praised Obama ’s speech to the Nobel Prize Committee in Oslo , actually claiming that the President had picked up on themes she , herself , had written in her memoir Going Rogue .
“ Wow , that really sounded familiar , ” Palin said to USA Today .
Newt Gingrich was quoted as saying President Obama gave a “ very historic speech . ”
Ron Paul would say , “ Hogwash . ”
He believes that by waging wars in distant lands we create ten new terrorists for every one we kill .
And only Ron Paul , among all public figures , states this clearly and has held this position consistently .
While former vice president Dick Cheney and current vice president Joe Biden argue over degrees and who supported the surge when , only Ron Paul says that “ no war ” is better than any new and improved version .
Now this is significant for a very important reason .
For the first time last summer national polls showed that a majority of Americans , 51 % agreed that the war is not working .
Less than half , 47 % thought it was worth the price we were paying in dead Americans .
Can Ron Paul , the fringe candidate of 2008 actually emerge in the upcoming presidential election ?
Well , here is some simple arithmetic for you to ponder .
Obama , Palin , Clinton , Biden , Huckabee , Romney , Gingrich , Cheney and all the rest can split the 47 % of the American public who think that it is economical sound and morally effective to spend $ 500 million and 50 young lives to re-conquer for the third time a windswept city of 100,000 , where the Taliban once lived but have now mostly abandoned .
And they will not even notice when we give the city back again next year .
Meanwhile , Ron Paul , alone will speak for the 51 % who would bring back our boys .
Does he have a chance ?
If the war becomes the issue , Ron Paul , who appeals to right and left , young and old , Democrat and Republican , gay and straight can pull an upset .
When Palin appeared at the Tea Party event last week all the television networks and major newspapers covered the moment .
But not a single journalist even mentioned that this grass roots phenomenon was inspired by the Ron Paul movement .
No one dared suggest that Sarah Palin was trying to co-opt the incorruptible old , iconoclastic congressman from Texas .
The media remains fiercely disciplined in excluding Ron Paul from any exposure , even when his absence is itself newsworthy .
The people paying those media salaries apparently do n’t want to see an audit of the Federal Reserve or an end to government subsidized banks or an end to profits from foreign wars .
But nothing they write or say or fail to write or fail to say can hide the truth from the millions of Americans who have heard the clarion call .
In 2008 Ron Paul slipped through their nets and onto television in the Republican Debates .
And America will never be the same .
Sarah Palin has the right idea , and give her credit for trying .
But I know Ron Paul .
He is a friend of mine .
And Sarah Palin , you are no Ron Paul .

“ People are waking up in a America where suddenly their deepest core moral convictions — they ’re being told are immoral and should be the legal equivalent of racism .
It ’s pretty striking and people are pretty scared . ” — NOM chief Maggie Gallagher , speaking Wednesday at the CATO Institute ’s panel on conservatism , after taking what appears to be a decades - long nap , from which she ’s awoken to see America has actually grown in its promise for equal rights for all Americans ( via )
C's # pragma exists so we can pass various nonstandard information to the C compiler .
As alluded to above , it is n't necessarily well - liked by compilerers .
Why not ?
After all , there are lots of good reasons to want to communicate some nonstandard information to your C compiler .
If this information is not necessary to compile the program , but only to reduce warnings or produce better code , why not use # pragma ?
On its own , # pragma is n't standard enough to be useful
Of course .
It 's meant for nonstandard features .
Only most " nonstandard " features will still be supported by almost all compilers .
And each will do it differently .
Let 's look at a typical example .
Many C compilers support inlining of functions ( at least within the same source file compilation unit ) .
Some heuristics are used to determine inlinability , but you might want to override them .
Surely we can use # pragma to do it !
Well , almost .
SGI 's C compiler lets you say # pragma inline global function ( as well as some more complex options to fine - tune the inlining ) to inline function wherever it appears .
If you say just # pragma inline function then inlining occurs only within that scope .
( as well as some more complex options to fine - tune the inlining ) to inline function wherever it appears .
If you say just then inlining occurs only within that scope .
Sun 's Forte C compiler lets you say # pragma inline function .
It has fewer options than SGI 's # pragma inline ( SGI is more of a supercomputing company than Sun ) .
In fairness , judicious placement of # pragma inline can yield the same intended effect in both compilers , as long as you just want expansion throughout the file .
The #pragma must appear after the function has already been declared .
.
It has fewer options than SGI 's ( SGI is more of a supercomputing company than Sun ) .
Compaq 's C compiler requires brackets around the function names .
Luckily , the brackets do no harm in the other 2 compilers .
# pragma inline ( function )
# pragma inline
Dealing with compiler dependencies
By sheer luck , the form , placed after the function has already been declared , works on all 3 compilers .
Except if it 's not in the top - most scope , in which case it will have different semantics on SGI .
And if our function is recursive , we 'll have to predeclare it thenit to get one level of recursion inlined on all our platform s .
The way to deal with compiler dependencies like this ( and they are unavoidable ) is to use #ifdef to determine which compiler we 're using .
So we could say
/* Define function , then ... */ # ifdef __sgi # pragma inline global function # elif defined ( __alpha ) # pragma inline ( function ) # elif defined ( __sun ) # pragma inline function #endif
Abstracting #ifdef s away
which has a fighting chance of being understood by an experienced user of the compiler on her native platform .
The code above is a maintenance nightmare .
If we want to add support for the new ariel Si Si compiler , we have to add a #elif clause on every inlining .
The solution to this is abstraction : create some higher level construct INLINE ( function ) and use that instead .
The definition of the construct will use #ifdef s , but they 'll all be in one spot , and easy to maintain and modify .
Presumably , INLINE will be a macro , and we 'll #define it appropriately .
Excuse me , did someone say " macro " ?
Because you cannot standardly use macros and preprocess constructs .
And anything beginning with # belongs to the preprocessor .
So there is no maintainable way to use # pragma s in your code .

Update : Eagle - eyed reader PresidentPez found this wider version of the image over on the Sun 's website , featuring an extra monster :
TOKYO -- Olivia Burrell , a 32 - year - old Canadian gospel singer , was fed up with living in Lilliputian studio apartments in Tokyo where she could see ( and smell ) her kitchen from her bed .
Three months ago , she took the plunge and moved in with five Japanese women living in a spacious 6 - bedroom apartment in Harajuku , a buzzy neighborhood in the city center .
But , so far , her roommate experience has n't quite been the Japanese version of " Friends " she had envisioned .
Ms. Burrell walked into the kitchen one evening to find no fewer than eight separate bottles of dishwashing liquid on the kitchen counter , all neatly lined up and labeled with their owners ' names .
" My roommates are neat and very courteous , " says Ms. Burrell , who has lived in Japan for seven years and who had lived with roommates in Canada .
" But this whole concept is new here , and people do n't naturally want to share things as much . "
Japan has no real tradition of roommates : People have preferred to live in their own tiny places .
Now , fed up with a dearth of reasonably priced apartments in desirable Tokyo neighborhoods , a growing number of relatively affluent women in their 20s and 30s have started to create demand for a radical new segment of the Japanese real - estate market : apartments to share .
Ross Brawn has said Michael Schumacher will become the 2010 Formula One world champion .
Brawn , who heads the Mercedes team , formerly Brawn GP , will be reunited with the seven - times world champion when Schumacher makes a return to Formula One after an absence of three years .
Schumacher will bring the quota of world champions competing in 2010 to four as he joins Fernando Alonso , Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button and the German newspaper Bild this week quoted Brawn as saying : " If I had to bet on any of them then it is clear that Michael will become world champion . "
Brawn said : " I was asked which of the four champions was likely to win the title and , naturally , I said Michael !
In any case , I really believe he has just as good a chance as the others .
Michael is now more relaxed .
When he retired in 2006 , F1 was a burden for him .
Now I can sense his old enthusiasm . "
Brawn added that Schumacher had already impressed and energised the British - based team with his motivation and professionalism during a recent visit to the headquarters in Brackley in Northamptonshire .
Brawn guided the 41 - year - old Schumacher to all of his world titles when they worked together at Benetton and then Ferrari .
" I do n't think he will come out and win the first grand prix , " said Brawn .
" He will need a few races to familiarise himself with the other cars and the many new drivers .
Then I hope to see the old Schumacher .
This has always been his strength : to learn and adapt amazingly quickly . "
Schumacher , who is not allowed to drive a current Formula One car until the first official pre-season test in Valencia on 1 February , spent much of last week testing in a GP2 car .
The revamped Mercedes team will be formally introduced in Stuttgart next Monday with a 2009 car displaying the new team colours .
The 2010 Mercedes F1 car will make its first appearance at the test in Spain .
Schumacher will share the testing with Nico Rosberg , who has moved to Mercedes after four years with Williams .
Schumacher took Button 's seat after the 2009 world champion joined Hamilton at McLaren - Mercedes .
The season 's opening race is in Bahrain on 14 March .
A German court has rejected a demand for the return of thousands of acres of land to the family of an anti-Nazi aristocrat who was tortured by the Gestapo and stripped of all his property as punishment for taking part in the abortive Second World War plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler .
Prince Friedrich zu Solms - Baruth was one of a handful of German aristocrats who took part in the failed attempt to blow up the Nazi leader on 20 July 1944 .
The Gestapo arrested him the next day and forced him to sign a legal contract formally handing over 17,300 acres of family estates and castles to Heinrich Himmler , the Gestapo chief .
But a legal bid by the Prince 's grandson , Prince Friedrich zu Solms - Baruth V , to have the properties returned failed yesterday .
A court in the city of Potsdam rejected pleas for their restitution ; arguing that the contract which led to their being relinquished to the Gestapo was legal because German law still recognised Nazi Germany as a constitutional state in which the rule of law prevailed .
The verdict provoked a furious response from members of the zu Solms - Baruth family , German legal experts and historians specialising in the Nazi-era .
" The court 's ruling is outrageous , " Prince Friedrich V told The Independent .
" My grandfather was coerced into signing away his estates to Himmler .
He had to do it to save his own life and that of his family .
The whole world knows that the Nazis put a veneer of legality on their criminal activities . "
Antony Beevor , the British historian and Nazi-era expert , said the mere fact that the prince 's grandfather signed over his estates while being held prisoner in the Gestapo 's infamous Berlin headquarters rendered the signature invalid .
" It is quite simply unimaginable that a document presented to a prisoner arrested in connection with the 20 July plot could be deemed to have been a contract entered into willingly and without coercion , " he said .
The prince 's grandfather , a renowned anti-Nazi , joined the so - called " Valkyrie " plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944 .
His country estates were used as meeting places for the conspirators .
In the run-up to the assassination attempt , led by Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg , he slept in a different room every night with a pistol under his pillow .
The prince was arrested during a Gestapo raid on his estates the day after the failed attempt to blow up Hitler at his " Wolf 's Lair " headquarters in Eastern Prussia .
He was taken to Gestapo HQ in Berlin where he was held in a cell for weeks and tortured .
After his release , the prince remained banished from his estates under pain of death .
He left Germany for Sweden after the Second World War and emigrated to Namibia , where he started farming .
As the bulk of the estates confiscated from the family lay in communist East Germany after the war , legal attempts to have them returned were only begun following Germany 's reunification in 1990 .
Most of the family property now officially belongs to the state of Brandenburg and the town of Baruth .
The Conan O'Brien , Jay Leno , Jeff Zucker poll we put up -- Who 's the Bad Guy ? -- has been hacked ... according to some people who work over at NBC .
There has indeed been a seismic shift over the last few hours .
Here are the facts :
9:30 AM ET today -- Only 5 % of users voted for Conan .
Zucker was in the lead .
Jay was second .
7:20 PM ET .
A huge turnaround .
Conan is the bad guy , with 40 % .
And , the number of people who have voted exploded in the last two hours -- it went from just over 200,000 to 547,000 .
A cynical NBC source scoffs at the tampering allegation , telling TMZ , " NBC could n't get it together fast enough to know how to do that . "
We 're checking to see if the poll has been hacked .
UPDATE : 8:42 PM ET THE POLL IS GOING CRAZY !!!
With nearly a million votes , Zucker now leads with 49 % .
Jay is second with 26 % .
Conan has 25 % .
For the past couple years , Comcast has been testing and advocating for the widespread adoption of DNS Security extensions ( also known as DNSSEC ) .
If you do n’t know what DNSSEC is , you ’re probably not alone .
Basically , it allows websites to secure their domain information so that ISPs can validate and make sure nothing has been tampered with .
This prevents hackers from injecting false information ( aka DNS ‘ poisoning ’ ) that re-directs you to a fake or nefarious site .
The process needed to secure domains as well as validate them is very complex and that is why we are taking time over the next year to make sure everything works .
We plan to implement DNSSEC for the websites we manage , such as comcast.com , comcast.net and xfinity.com , by the first quarter of 2011 , if not sooner .
By the end of 2011 , we plan to implement DNSSEC validation for all of our customers .
You wo n’t need to make any changes to start using DNSSEC ; it will happen automatically if you are currently using our DNS .
If you do n’t want to wait until 2011 , you can participate in our DNSSEC customer trial , which starts today .
Opt - in by changing your DNS server IP addresses to 75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76 ( we ’ll be adding IPv6 addresses soon ) .
The servers supporting this are deployed nationally in the same locations as our other DNS servers that millions of customers use everyday .
As the nation ’s largest ISP , we have spent a lot of time in the last few years making our DNS the best and most secure platform on the Internet .
We hope that our efforts in DNSSEC will encourage others to adopt similar measures to strengthen Internet security .
Polemic : anyone who believes that any specific general purpose programming language is inherently unmaintainable has opinions on software development worth ignoring .
Many people claim that the design of Perl 5 has such significant flaws that render it far too difficult to write and maintain useful programs .
Many of the supporting arguments are syntactic preferences .
" I do n't like sigils ! " " Context make no senses to my ! "
" Real men do n't need your sissy curly braces to accompany our manly indentation ! "
" Is n't bless a little bit cutesy for our Serious Enterprise Business Application ? "
Other arguments ... well , you 've heard them .
Perl 5 has some design flaws , but I believe that syntax is such a small part of maintainability that only the most facile discussions focus on syntax to the exclusion of more important concerns .
The next time you have trouble maintaining a Perl 5 program , ask yourself :
Have I learned the language by reading documentation and working through tutorials , or am I fiddling with changing things by trial and error and guesswork and intuition based on experience in other languages ?
Do I know how to use perldoc to look up builtins and language features ?
to look up builtins and language features ?
Have I skimmed the Perl FAQ included in every Perl 5 distribution ?
Have I used Perl : : Tidy to unify the formatting into a consistent style ?
Do I know the difference between void , scalar , and list context ?
Can I identify them ?
Do I know how to use B:: Deparse to explain the evaluation plan of complex constructs ?
Does this program have a set of automated tests I can trust ?
Did the original programmer understand the problem domain ?
Do I ?
Did the original programmer " borrow " this code from elsewhere , change a few lines , and add a modified copyright statement ?
Did this program grow from a throwaway idea into a critical business component without planning , design , or refactoring ?
Is the original author available to answer questions , whether in person or through some sort of design notes ?
Is the program well - factored ?
Does the program include appropriate documentation for its purpose , its major systems , its APIs , and any surprising design decisions ?
Do I have a clear understanding of what the program does and why ?
Does the program have a modular design , with well - enforced encapsulation boundaries between components ?
Can I configure and build the program on my local system ?
Can I deploy it ?
Does the code show examples of idiomatic programming from authors fluent in the language , or is it a pastiche of styles cribbed from documentation and witch - doctor expermentation ?
Did the original author know how to program in any language ?
Did the original author take advantage of obvious strengths of the host language in appropriate ways ( or did he distrust arrays and continually write to and read from a temporary file instead — I have seen this with my own eyes , and the host language was not Perl ) ?
Does the program take advantage of well - known and trustworthy external libraries ?
Does the build process spew compiler errors and warnings ?
Does the program spew warnings and errors when deployed ?
Does the program contain obvious repetition and near repetition ?
Would you be proud of writing the program in six months ?
Note how few of these concerns have anything to do with Perl — and , of those that do , trivial rewording would make them appropriate for other languages .
It is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament
Treason laws which reportedly could be used against someone who places a stamp upside down on a letter were also cited by those polled by UKTV Gold .
Nearly 4,000 people picked laws on a list compiled by UKTV Gold researchers .
It examined laws that have never been repealed even though statutes could have rendered them obsolete .
A UKTV Gold spokeswoman said many of the regulations were referenced in the book The Strange Laws of Old England by Nigel Cawthorne .
A total of 27 % of those questioned by UKTV Gold thought the law against dying in the Houses of Parliament was the most absurd .
Mr Cawthorne told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that anyone who dies in Parliament is technically entitled to a state funeral and the law is in place to ensure this does not happen .
However , a spokesman for the House of Commons said : " The people who know about these things here say there is no basis for such a law , not to say it does not exist somewhere in writing . "
Cannon firing
Other lesser - known laws making the list included one banning eating mince pies on Christmas Day and another from 1313 stating it is illegal to enter the Houses of Parliament wearing a suit of armour .
Almost half of those asked confessed to breaking the mince pie law , which was brought in by Oliver Cromwell in the 17th Century .
Last year , the Law Society highlighted a number of bizarre laws still in existence on the statute book in England and Wales .
These included a ban on firing a cannon close to a dwelling house ( Met Police Act 1839 ) ; a ban on the use of any slide upon ice or snow ( Town Police Clauses Act 1847 ) ; and the prohibition of driving cattle through the streets of London ( Metropolitan Streets Act 1867 ) .
An ongoing cull of obsolete laws by the statute law revision team , has seen 2,000 abolished since 1965 .
Dead whales
Among the most ridiculous laws listed by UKTV Gold were :
It is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament ( 27 % )
It could be regarded an act of treason to place a postage stamp bearing the British king or queen 's image upside - down ( 7 % )
Eating mince pies on Christmas Day is banned ( 5 % )
In the UK , a pregnant woman can legally relieve herself anywhere she wants ( 4 % )
The head of any dead whale found on the British coast automatically becomes the property of the King , and the tail of the Queen ( 3.5 % )
It is illegal not to tell the tax man anything you do not want him to know , but legal not to tell him information you do not mind him knowing ( 3 % )
It is illegal to enter the Houses of Parliament wearing a suit of armour ( 3 % )
* This is an amended version of an earlier story which included several examples of laws from the survey which we have been unable to verify , and these have been removed .
Earth 's cities are visible at night from space because of their artificial lights , so populated exoplanets might give off light pollution of their own .
But finding it might not be easy .
Even if all the world 's electricity were used to produce light , it would still be thousands of times fainter than a glint of sunlight reflected off the Earth 's surface .
( Image : NASA / GSFC )
We could also hunt for evidence of chemical pollutants in the atmospheres of exoplanets .
Artificial compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , could leave traces that might be observed from afar .
Because they strongly absorb infrared light at characteristic wavelengths , CFCs may be detectable even when present at concentrations as low as parts per trillion .
But it could take an exceptionally sensitive telescope , far beyond the capabilities of present - day instruments , to pick up such traces .

Dumping nuclear waste in a star could leave it with suspiciously large abundances of rare elements produced by nuclear fission , such as technetium or neodymium , which we might detect in its starlight .
But creating a recognisable signature may require a colossal amount of material – for example , 100,000 tonnes of technetium , according to an estimate by Guillermo Lemarchand of the National University of Quilmes in Argentina .
By contrast , Earth 's nuclear reactors have produced only 100 tonnes or so of technetium in the past century , says Richard Carrigan .

An extraterrestrial civilisation might also reveal itself through colossal feats of engineering called Dyson spheres , hypothetical structures that would cocoon stars to collect solar energy .
A Dyson sphere would partially or fully block a star ’s visible light .
But because the sphere would still be warmed by its star , it would radiate infrared light that might be detectable from Earth .
Astronomers have found no Dyson spheres for certain – the few candidates they have flagged up could be explained just as easily as clouds of hydrogen gas , dust engulfing ancient stars or even asteroids .
( Image : Vedexent / Wikimedia Commons )
Rather than blocking the light of just one star , a sprawling extraterrestrial civilisation might build Dyson spheres around many stars , creating a noticeable dark patch in its home galaxy called a Fermi bubble .
Like individual Dyson spheres , Fermi bubbles would still radiate heat , making them visible in infrared light .
But finding them could still be tricky .
Spiral galaxies , like the Pinwheel galaxy ( shown here ) , are full of dust and dark gaps .
Galaxies that are naturally more uniform in brightness , like elliptical galaxies , might be better candidates in the hunt for ET .

Geheimprotokoll zu Gorleben : Kalter Krieg ums Endlager
Bislang streng geheime Kabinettsprotokolle belegen : Bei der Standortwahl von Gorleben spielten geologische Aspekte fast keine Rolle – die Religion der Anwohner umso mehr .
Seit 33 Jahren gilt Gorleben als künftiger Standort des deutschen Endlagers für hochradioaktiven Müll .
Eineinhalb Milliarden Euro sind dort im Salz versenkt worden : beim " Erkundung " genannten Bau eines Endlagerbergwerks und beim Aufrechterhalten des Bergwerksbetriebes .
Die Bundesregierung will das Bergwerk nun schnell weiter ausbauen .
Die Bürgerinitiative ( BI ) Lüchow - Dannenberg nennt die Grube im östlichsten Zipfel Niedersachsens hingegen " Investitionsruine " .
Im Dunkeln lag aber immer , warum gerade der Salzstock Gorleben am 22 .
Februar 1977 vom damaligen niedersächsischen Ministerpräsidenten Ernst Albrecht ( CDU ) als Entsorgungsstandort ausgewählt wurde .
Auf Druck des Landtags wurden nun alte Kabinettsvorlagen zugänglich gemacht .
Einsehbar sind zudem Dokumente einer interministeriellen Arbeitsgruppe , die 1976 aus 140 niedersächsischen Salzstöcken den angeblich geeignetsten Standort auswählte .
Der taz liegen die bislang streng vertraulichen Unterlagen vor .
Sie zeigen : Die Geologie , die für die Auswahl eines Standorts für ein Endlagerbergwerk entscheidend sein sollte , spielte allenfalls am Rande eine Rolle .
Ministerpräsident Albrecht behandelte das geplante " Nukleare Entsorgungszentrum " , das damals noch aus Wiederaufarbeitungsanlage ( WAA ) , diversen Zwischenlagern und Endlager bestehen sollte , als gigantische Industrieansiedlung , die ein strukturschwaches Gebiet beglücken konnte .
Den Ausschlag für den damals nur vier Kilometer von der DDR - Grenze entfernten Salzstock Gorleben gab ein Streit zwischen Albrecht mit dem damaligen Bundeskanzler Helmut Schmidt ( SPD ) .
Der Bund sah das nukleare Entsorgungszentrum als zivil - militärische Anlage an .
Nach einem Treffen hochrangiger Beamter aus sieben Bundes - und Landesministerium verlangte die niedersächsische Seite im Oktober 1976 in einem Vermerk zur " Bedeutung des Entsorgungszentrums " die " Präzisierung der Bundesaussage , dass eine Entsorgungsanlage nicht nur wirtschaftlich notwendig , sondern auch sicherheitspolitisch unbedingt erforderlich ist " .
Gorleben aktuell Das im Atomkonsens vereinbarte 10 - jährige Gorleben - Moratorium läuft Ende September aus .
Bürgerinitiative : Die BI Lüchow - Dannenberg hat schon eine Klage gegen eine weitere Verlängerung des aus dem Jahr 1983 stammenden " Rahmenbetriebsplans " angekündigt .
Allwöchentlich ziehen derzeit AKW - Gegner zum Gorlebener Bergwerksgelände .
Die BI plant u. a. für den 4 . Juni , den 30 .
Jahrestag der spektakulären Räumung der " Republik freies Wendland " , eine Umzingelung der Gorlebener Atomanlagen .
Die BI - Vorsitzende Kerstin Rudek rechnet zudem " mit den größten Protesten in der Geschichte der Castortransporte " beim nächsten Castortransport im November .
Untersuchungsausschuss : Die AKW - Gegner hoffen zudem auf Unterstützung durch die Oppositionsfraktionen des Bundestags .
SPD , Grüne und Linke im Bundestag wollen mit einen Untersuchungsausschuss verhindern , dass die Bundesregierung unter dem Deckmantel der weiteren Erkundung den Endlagerbau in Gorleben fortsetzt .
Der Ausschuss soll klären , wie es in den 70 ern " überhaupt zur Auswahl Gorlebens als Endlagerstandort kam , ob Kritik an der mangelhaften Geologie des Salzstocks unterdrückt wurde und warum man nie Alternativen untersuchte .
" Wir wollen überprüfen , inwieweit es bei der Auswahl und Erkundung des Standorts zu Fehlentscheidungen kam und wer hierfür die Verantwortung trägt " , sagt die Atomexpertin der Grünen - Bundestagsfraktion , Sylvia Kotting - Uhl .
Nach Angaben von SPD - Fraktionsvize Ulrich Kelber wird der gemeinsame Antrag derzeit noch von Juristen überarbeitet .
Auch Kelber will klären , ob der Endlagerstandort Gorleben nach wissenschaftlichen oder nach politischen Kriterien ausgewählt wurde und ob dabei internationale Standards eingehalten wurden .
Die Bundesregierung befürchtete , dass die Auswahl des grenznahen Gorleben " Schwierigkeiten für die Beziehungen zwischen der Bundesrepublik und der DDR aufwerfen könnte " .
Der Bund hielt für eine WAA in Grenznähe gemeinsame Notfall - und Katastrophenschutzpläne mit der DDR für erforderlich und sah einen innerdeutschen " Zwang zu vertraglichen Vereinbarungen einschließlich finanzieller Konsequenzen " .
Im Klartext : Man fürchtete Geldforderungen der chronisch klammen DDR .
Hinzu kamen handfeste militärische Bedenken gegen eine DDR - nahe Plutoniumfabrik .
" Die Bundesressorts sind der Auffassung , dass ein Entsorgungslager auf dem Salzstock Gorleben von der DDR durch eine , Handstreichaktion ' unterhalb der Schwelle der kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen in Besitz genommen werden könnte " , heißt es in einer Kabinettsvorlage .
Der Bund prüfe , ob die Möglichkeit einer Handstreichaktion " wegen des eventuell strategisch bedeutsamen Materials in dem Entsorgungszentrum eine Einschaltung der Nato erfordere " .
Der Bund trug seine Bedenken gegen Gorleben seinerzeit mehrfach bei Ministertreffen vor .
Am 11 .
Februar 1977 trafen sich auch Ministerpräsident Albrecht und Kanzler Schmidt zum Gespräch .
" Ich habe ferner nachdrücklich auf die Bedenken der Bundesregierung gegen den Standort Gorleben hingewiesen " , schrieb Schmidt danach .
Die Mahnungen der sozialliberalen Bundesregierung blieben ohne Wirkung .
Kurz vor der öffentlichen Bekanntgabe informierte Albrecht den Landesenergiebeirat über die Entscheidung für Gorleben .
Nach Angaben des Geologen Gerd Lüttig stellte der CDU - Politiker dabei die Wahl Gorlebens als Retourkutsche für das ebenfalls direkt an der Grenze gelegene DDR - Endlager Morsleben dar .
Albrecht habe sinngemäß gesagt : " Die ärgern uns doch mit Morsleben , ich gehe in Gorleben auch an die Zonengrenze , und da werden sich die in der Ostzone richtig ärgern " , erinnert sich der 83 - jährige Lüttig .
Professor Lüttig war als Vizepräsident der Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe und des Niedersächsischen Landesamts für Bodenforschung damals der ranghöchste Geologe des Landes .
Albrecht habe seinerzeit vor dem Energiebeirat als weiteren Grund für die Wahl Gorlebens die Strukturschwäche des Zonenrandgebietes genannt .
Er selbst habe dann auf geologische Mängel des Gorlebener Salzstocks hingewiesen , sagt Lüttig .
" Ich sagte : Gorleben gehört gar nicht zu den Standorten der ersten Kategorie .
Er antwortete nur : Ihr Geologen kommt auch noch dran . "
Für das geplante Nuklearzentrum gab es in den 70er - Jahren gleich zwei Auswahlverfahren .
Im ersten begutachteten der Geologe Lüttig und Rudolf Wager im Auftrag des Bundes und der Kernbrennstoff - Wiederaufarbeitungs - Gesellschaft ( Kewa ) mögliche Standorte .
Das zweite mit dem Ergebnis Gorleben führte ganz im Stillen die erwähnte interministerielle Arbeitsgruppe der niedersächsischen Landesregierung durch .
Beide Auswahlverfahren beschränkten sich auf Salz als Endlagermedium , was heute nicht mehr statthaft wäre .
Zudem suchte man in beiden Verfahren vordringlich einen Salzstock , über dem auch das Entsorgungszentrum Platz hatte .
Lüttig veranschlagte dafür eine Fläche von 8 , die interministerielle Arbeitsgruppe sogar eine von 12 Quadratkilometern .
Die obertägigen Anlagen des Erkundungsbergwerkes Gorleben bedecken heute eine Fläche von gut 30 Hektar , also rund ein Vierzigstel des damals gesuchten Areals .
Lüttig führte das Auswahlverfahren in den Jahren 1972 bis 1975 durch und bezog dabei nach eigenen Angaben bundesweit 250 Salzstöcke ein .
Schon damals wurden die möglichen Standorte mithilfe eines Fragenkatalogs keineswegs nur geologisch beurteilt .
" Da wurde auch noch nach der Religion der Anwohner gefragt und ob sie mal aufmüpfig waren bis zurück zum Bauernkrieg " , erinnert sich Lüttig .
Angesichtes geologischer Probleme " war Gorleben am Ende nicht dabei " , berichtete Lüttig .
In der Nähe habe man leicht wasserlösliches Karnalit gefunden und es sei zu Ablaugungen der Salzstockoberfläche gekommen .
Bei Lüttigs und Wagers Auswahlverfahren blieben am Ende drei Standorte in Niedersachsen übrig , die durch Bohrungen weiter exploriert werden sollten .
Nachdem Albrecht im Februar 1976 mithilfe von Überläufern aus der zuvor regierenden SPD / FDP - Koalition überraschend zum Ministerpräsidenten gewählt worden war , stoppte er die Bohrungen .
Zugleich wurde schon im März 1976 die interministerielle Arbeitsgruppe eingesetzt , die dann das zweite rein niedersächsische Auswahlverfahren oder , richtiger , Ausschlussverfahren durchführte .
Von 140 niedersächsischen
Salzstöcken schlossen die Beamten 117 wieder aus , weil es über diesen keinen Platz für ein 12 Quadratkilometer großes Atomzentrum gab .
Die verbleibenden Standorte bewerteten die Beamten mithilfe einer Punktetabelle , die sehr auf die Wiederaufarbeitungsanlage zugeschnitten war : Nur maximal 32 von 266 erreichbaren Punkten entfielen auf die Geologie des Salzstocks .
Ansonsten gab es etwa Punkte für Wasserversorgung , Verkehrsanbindung , geringe Gebietsnutzung , geringes Einkommen , hohe Arbeitslosenquote , Abwesenheit von Luftverkehr oder für Erdbebensicherheit .
Die beiden geologischen Kriterien " Salzstockteufenlage " und " Zentralität " , die 12,8 Prozent der Gesamtpunktzahl ausmachten , waren sehr allgemein : Der Salzstock durfte nicht zu tief und das WAA - Gelände musste zentral über ihm liegen .
Mithilfe der Punktebewertung identifizierten die Beamten sieben mögliche Standorte .
Bis auf Gorleben fanden laut den Dokumenten alle Standorte die Zustimmung des Bundes .
Praktisch keine Einwände hatten die Beamten gegen Lichtenhorst am Rande der Lüneburger Heide .
Beim Standort Gorleben problematisierte die letzte und entscheidende Kabinettsvorlage ein eventuelles Gasvorkommen unter dem Salzstock , das vielleicht auch die DDR ausbeuten könne .
" Ausgesprochen vorteilhaft " fand sie , dass sich in Gorleben die 12 Quadratkilometer große Fläche " im Wesentlichen im Eigentum eines Eigentümers befindet " .
Dieser , Andreas Graf Bernstorff , ist allerdings bis heute Gegner der Gorlebener Atomanlagen und hat nie verkauft .
A new medical camera designed to take pictures of internal organs is about to revolutionize the way you take snapshots .
Soon you 'll be able to take simultaneous video and stills of events that your naked eye could never see .
The best part ?
The camera was invented by two Oxford medical researchers out of off - the - shelf parts .

Faced with the prospect of paying $ 50,000 for a scientific grade camera that could record an underwhelming 80x80 images at 2000 fps , Oxford researcher Dr. Gil Bub hacked together an array out of existing camera components and projector parts .
He not only created a much lower cost camera , but one that can simultaneously record images and video , and store the resulting data in a single image file .
Said Dr. Bub :
" Normally , I 'd have to use one of these expensive very low res , high speed camera and a second high res slow camera to capture the data , split the light optically , and go to the trouble of aligning each pixel by pixel . "

The technique was termed Temporal Pixel Multiplexing ( TPM ) , and the group took a camera sensor and placed in front of it a Texas Instruments DMD micromirror array , which has millions of tiny mirrors that can be flipped thousands of times a second .
With this the researchers could precisely control which pixels were being hit by light at which point in time .

From this , each pixel was unveiled in a specific sequence , over the entire length of the exposure .
In the example above , a 36 pixel sensor would be exposed in four batches .
By using the mirror to precisely control each area of the sensor , two things happened : a large high resolution image was created by using data from the entire sensor ; and by stringing together the sequential pixels , a high speed movie was created .
The example below , the still image was recorded at 25 fps ( 1/25 of a second exposure ) , while the video was 400fps

In addition to creating a device capable of recording both images and video at once , the team figured out how to combine the files into a single still photo .
Tucked away in the blurred motion trails of that image is the high speed content , embedded in the image ( click here to see a full sized version ) .
If you enlarge the high resolution area sufficiently , you can actually see them .
Since these areas are meant to be fuzzy anyway , the frames can fit there without being visually distracting .
The longer the video recording , the longer the still exposure , so more blurry areas in which to embed the data .
This does n't even take much computer crunching , as Bub says :
" One neat thing is that there 's very little processing involved .
The way to think about the blurred regions is that if you were taking a TPM picture of a stationary object , there is n't any blur , but at the same time there is n't any motion to capture .
If something moves , then the amount of motion is proportional to the size of the blur ( more motion=more blur ) .
But theres no real processing involved , just reordering the pixels . "

The advantage to this system is that it 's less expensive than the dedicated scientific hardware ; and faster , higher resolution and functions at lower light levels than the consumer high speed cameras , like those by Casio .
While this working model was only 1360 x 1024 pixels , the concept could easily be scaled up .
Dr. Mark Pitter of Nottingham University is currently set to work on a CMOS version of the chip , which would n't require the mirror system , and could fit in a normal camera — with a working prototype expected within a year .
Within the scientific world Cairn Research , a UK based scientific instrument manufacturer is looking into the technology .

Not only is Modern Warfare the best game ever made on any system , it also teaches you several very important videogame life lessons .
Do you not believe me ?
Then you 're a fool .
Through the magic of mediocre artistic expressionism , I will share with you the important life lessons I have learned from Modern Warfare 2 .
Sit down , take a seat , and hold on to your underbriches , I 'm about to take you on a learning adventure .
Take notes , there will be a test .
As we all know , grenades blow shit up .
But what you did n't know is that grenades can be launched two football field lengths away and still be as accurate as a sniper rifle .
You do n't even have to try that hard , just pull the trigger and you 'll probably blow something up .
At least , unless you are me .
Scientistoligists have pondered the study of teleportation for years now , little did they know the secret had already been discovered by MW2 .
With the use of Commandos , regular people can teleport behind unsuspecting victims and stab them in the back .
Rigorous experimentation has proved no solution to this method , other than a shotgun blast to the face .
Well ... except for the fact that ...
Humans have apparently developed a thick outer shell that occasionally allows them to absorb two , or even three , consecutive shotgun blasts to the head or body .
It is unknown why this plasma shield technology does not always work , but it is known to be of alien origin .
Because I said so .
But at least kaboomels still work , right ?
Wrong .
Kaboomels , as they are called in the military , are in fact quite unreliable .
Sometimes they explode prematurely , other times they do n't explode at all .
They eat all the Fritos , change the channel on the TV , and always fail to flush the toilet .
In fact , it has been proven that rocks are more reliable military weapons compared to claymores .
I mean , Kaboomels .
At least I can spaw .... wait , what happened ?
I died , that 's what happened .
Maybe that 's because ...
Whether it's a Predatory missile or a helicopter , apparently I am the sole target of all these things .
In fact , after digging through lines of code , I have discovered IW actually coded my Gamertag into the game , which is why all of these things kill me .
That 's pretty bullshit .
In the 6th Century BC , Chinese warrior Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War .
It has been the definitive treatise on waging war for 26 centuries now .
Only thirteen chapters , it was translated first in 1782 when a French Jesuit priest living in China , Joseph Amiot , acquired a copy of it , and translated it into French .
Subsequent translations have honed the text into English .
The book is available for free through The Gutenberg Project at : The Art of War .
I strongly recommend this short read , as the truth can be used in many areas of human interaction .
For this article , I shall concentrate on his writings about waging war by deception .
Here are some of his thoughts .
Chapter 1:18
All war is based on deception .
Chapter 2:2
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy ’s resistance without fighting .
Chapter 2:18
If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles .
If you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat .
Chapter 6:8
That general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend ; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack .
Chapter 6:9 O divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
Through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy ’s fate in our hands .
Chapter 6:12
If we do not wish to fight , we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground .
All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way .
The Art of War by Sun ... Tzu , Sun Best Price : $ 2.09 Buy New $ 2.99 ( as of 10:35 EST - Details )
The general concept that I want you to take away from these verses is that in order to win many battles , you must keep your enemy off balance , deceived and confused about your strategies and tactics .
If you can attack him at many weak points , he will have to respond , and therefore , you control both the location and the tempo of the battle .
This will be important in the thoughts and questions below .
I ’ve been writing lately about secession and the well - regulated militia , and how they should be inextricably tied to one another .
From the reactions I ’m receiving from readers , this concept seems to be somewhat new to them .
Specifically , I and other writers have referred to the truest meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution , which states : " A well - regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a Free State , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
How many millions of words have been written about the Second Amendment ?
Starting with the 1856 Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court , to the National Firearms Act of 1934 and up to this day , Americans have seen infringement upon infringement piled upon them .
But , do you remember in your lifetime hearing of ANY of those regulations that dealt with the security of a Free State ?
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Could it be that the arguments made over the last 150 years about gun control … the laws and regulations passed by states and the Federal government … and any talk about personal safety , crime prevention , hunting and sport shooting … have been a clever diversion away from the clear intention of the words of the Second Amendment ?
Think about it from a purely tactical viewpoint .
If you and I are in an argument about a certain topic , and I can get you to engage in a related topic that looks important , but completely diverts you from the real issue , I ’ve won .
I can drag you around by your nose ring for as long as you want to argue about what matters LEAST .
Meanwhile , I can do pretty much what I want in regard to the real issue .
It is the same as General Tzu ’s admonition to attack the enemy where he is weakest , combined with his recommendations to attack at multiple weak locations simultaneously .
The enemy will expend itself defending its weak points while you conquer .
Is n’t this what Washington and most of the states have done ?
They have enacted gun legislation and regulations that force citizens to challenge them in the very courts that the tyrants control .
Meanwhile , the politicians subtly changed our states and our nation .
The Second Amendment is the effort of the Founders to guarantee that the sovereign states would protect a mechanism whereby the states might thwart Federal tyranny through armed resistance , if only as a last resort .
Now , there is nothing in the Amendment about any " last resort . "
Common sense dictates that all efforts to settle any difference would proceed peaceably first .
And , when a well - regulated state militia is a day - to - day reality , it acts as a deterrent merely by its existence .
Thugs seldom attack armed people .
Go ask Switzerland if a militia works .
They have n’t been invaded in nearly 500 years .
Washington and the state legislatures have bleached out the reality of the well - regulated state militia from the American fabric .
Meanwhile , Americans have been hoodwinked into fighting about whether or not they can carry a gun with or without a permit , or packing heat in a bar or restaurant .
While those turf wars raged , Washington absorbed the sovereignty of the states , and made the states into serfdoms .
So , can you now see that because " A well - regulated Militia …is … necessary to the security of a Free State , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ? "
States need to reclaim their sovereignty by revitalizing their state militias .
Through the militia , states will once again gain their true freedom to regulate the Federal Government that once was their servant .
And , in the failure of the exertion of state sovereignty to control the actions of Washington , the unhappy states may secede knowing that they are capable of defending their decision from all who would attempt to use force to prevent their exit .

The open source Linux operating system is arguably a major force in the mobile and embedded space and can be found on a growing number of popular devices ranging from the TiVo to Amazon 's Kindle .
It 's not surprising that the proverbial penguin has a strong presence at CES this week , where gadget makers from around the world are unveiling their latest and greatest toys .
Touchscreen devices are the new hotness this year and are arriving with Linux in a number of different form factors and configurations .
There are some new touchscreen Internet dashboards for the home , including ICD 's 15 - inch Vega , an Android - based tablet with NVIDIA 's Tegra SoC .
Another compelling product in this category is the Sony Dash , a 7 - inch touchscreen device that that runs Chumby 's Linux platform and doubles as an alarm clock .
Dell lifted the curtain on its mysterious slate computer , a five - inch touchscreen device that comes with an Android - based software platform and will reportedly function as a phone .
Dell also announced that its more conventional Android smartphones — previously only available in China — are coming to the United States .
Dell is among several companies that AT&T has identified as its Android hardware partners .
Linux is still a strong player in the little laptop market .
MSI has announced that Novell 's new mashup of Moblin and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop will be available as an option on the upcoming 10 - inch MSI U135 netbook .
Smartbooks have finally arrived and are making a big splash at CES .
HP has an Android - based smartbook with a 10 - inch resistive touchscreen , and Lenovo announced its slim Skylight with a Web- oriented Linux OS .
Both products ship with the 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM processor .
One of the most intriguing products that has emerged so far from CES is Lenovo 's IdeaPad U1 Hybrid , a laptop with an 11 - inch touchscreen display that detaches and can be used as a standalone tablet device .
The laptop runs Windows and is powered by an Intel chip , but the tablet part runs Linux and is powered by a Snapdragon .
Meg Whitman 's sons , Griff and Will Harsh , have been kicked out of prep schools , an eating club , dormitories , and Princeton 's class of 2008 , say people who know them .
One incident involving the n-word is already internet famous .
Yesterday we documented big brother Griff 's beer - throwing and sheltered ways .
Today , a glimpse at Will Harsh 's little brother blues — and how he compensated with white entitlement , according to a tipster / commenter and classmate :
Griff 's non-refundable membership to Cottage [ eating club ] was paid in full when he got suspended .
So some of the officers would let Will attend some meals and formals events in his brother 's place until Will got banned from there .
The story goes that Will yelled " what are all these niggers doing here " one night when all the members of the Black Arts Company where there to celebrate a show they had performed .
Cottage is know as one of the whiter clubs on campus so I assume that he was shocked to see so many black people there in a night .
He was already on notice with Cottage officers because of an altercation he started with a bouncer early in the year .
This account varies from Guest of a Guest 's version , which has Will hurling the n-word at a specific person .
Unless , of course , there was more than one epithet - related ban ?
Sources say Will was kicked out of two prep schools ( one New England boarding school and one local private school ) and was eventually forced to endure the humiliation of — gasp !— public high school .
While we 're on the subject of scholarship , here 's another item on Griff , which is actually quite sad :
Griff did n't walk at graduation .
I was one of the students working the checkout fair and was responsible for giving students their cap / gowns .
Griff would n't take one because he said that he would be traveling .
Sure , walking at graduation is overrated , especially if it 's outdoors and you 're trapped in the sun in one of those awful , heavy black gowns .
But there 's something profound about the scion of one of the university 's most generous and celebrated donors declining to walk .
Was it too embarrassing ?
To him , or to his mother ?
( And , more powerfully : Why ? )
Or did Griff simply not care enough to move his vacation back a couple days ?
By his senior year , Griff may have tuned out on campus life , anyway — he had allegedly been banned from living in the dorms , including the $ 30 M residential complex his mother built .
As for life after graduation , Griff 's old Linked In profile ( image below ) lists private equity firm Solamere , founded by Tagg Romney .
Tagg , of course , is a significantly more enthusiastic political son / heir .
I wonder what their conversations are like .
The Whitman - Harsh camp has yet to reply to our emails , but if any of them want to set the record straight , we 're all ears .
A mere three days before President Obama 's supposedly bipartisan health - care summit , the White House yesterday released a new blueprint that Democrats say they will ram through Congress with or without Republican support .
So after election defeats in Virginia , New Jersey and even Massachusetts , and amid overwhelming public opposition , Democrats have decided to give the voters what they do n't want anyway .
Ah , the glory of " progressive " governance and democratic consent .

It ’s quite popular to bash the Windows Registry in non-technical or lightly technical terms .
I ’ve just spent a couple of weeks reverse engineering the binary format completely for our hivex library and shell which now supports both reading and writing to the registry .
So now I can tell you why the Registry sucks from a technical point of view too .
1 . It ’s a half - arsed implementation of a filesystem
It ’s often said that the Registry is a “ monolithic file ” , compared to storing configuration in lots of discrete files like , say , Unix does under /etc .
This misses the point : the Registry is a filesystem .
Sure it ’s stored in a file , but so is ext3 if you choose to store it in a loopback mount .
The Registry binary format has all the aspects of a filesystem : things corresponding to directories , inodes , extended attributes etc .
The major difference is that this Registry filesystem format is half - arsed .
The format is badly constructed , fragile , endian - specific , underspecified and slow .
The format changes from release to release of Windows .
Parts are undocumented , seemingly to the Windows developers themselves ( judging by the NT debug symbols that one paper has reproduced ) .
Parts of the format waste space , while in other parts silly “ optimizations ” are made to save a handful of bytes ( at the cost of making access much more complex ) .
2. Hello Microsoft programmers , a memory dump is not a file format
The format is essentially a dump of 32 bit C structures in a C memory heap .
This was probably done originally for speed , but it opens the format to all sorts of issues :
You can hide stuff away in unused blocks .
You can create registries containing unreachable blocks or loops or pointers outside the heap , and cause Windows to fail or hang ( see point 3 ) .
It ’s endian and wordsize specific .
It depends on the structure packing of the original compiler circa 1992 .
3 . The implementation of reading / writing the Registry in Windows NT is poor
You might expect , given how critical the Registry is to Window ’s integrity , that the people who wrote the code that loads it would have spent a bit of time thinking about checking the file for consistency , but apparently this is not done .
All versions of Windows tested will simply ignore blocks which are not aligned correctly .
Ditto , will ignore directory entries which are not in alphabetical order ( it just stops reading at the first place it finds a subdirectory named B > next entry A ) .
Ditto , will ignore file entries which contain various sorts of invalid field .
The upshot of this is you can easily hide stuff in the Registry binary which is completely invisible to Windows , but will be apparent in other tools .
From the point of view of other tools ( like our hivex tool ) we have to write exactly the same bits that Windows would write , to be sure that Windows will be able to read it .
Any mistakes we make , even apparently innocuous ones , are silently punished .
Compare this to using an established filesystem format , where everyone knows the rules , and consistency ( eg. fsck / chkdsk ) matters .
Writing sucks too , because the programmers do n’t correctly zero out fields , so you ’ll find parts ( particularly the Registry header ) which contain random bits of memory , presumably kernel memory , dumped into the file .
I did n’t find anything interesting there yet …
I also found Registries containing unreachable blocks ( and not , I might add , ones which I ’d tried modifying ) .
I find it very strange that relatively newly created Windows 7 VMs which do n’t have any sort of virus infection , have visible Registry corruption .
4 . Types are not well specified
Each registry field superficially is typed , so REG_SZ is a string , and REG_EXPAND_SZ is , erm , also a string .
Good , right ?
No , because what counts as a “ string ” is not well - defined .
A string might be encoded in 7 bit ASCII , or UTF - 16 - LE .
The only way to know is to know what versions of Windows will use the registry .
Strings are also stored in REG_BINARY fields ( in various encodings ) , but also raw binary data is stored in these fields .
Count yourself lucky if you only access official Microsoft fields though because some applications do n’t confine themselves to the published types at all , and just use the type field for whatever they feel like .
And what ’s up with having REG_DWORD ( little - endian of course ) and REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN , and REG_QWORD , but no REG_QWORD_BIG_ENDIAN ?
5 . Interchange formats are not well specified
A critical part of installing many drivers is making registry edits , and for this a text format ( .REG ) is used along with the REGEDIT program .
The thing is though that the .REG format is not well - specified in terms of backslash escaping .
You can find examples of .REG files that have both :
" Name " = " \Value "
and
" Name " = " \\ Value "
In addition the encoding of strings is again not specified .
It seems to depend on the encoding of the actual .REG file , as far as anyone can tell .
eg .
If your .REG file itself is UTF - 16 - LE , then REGEDIT will encode all strings you define this way .
Presumably if you transfer the .REG file to a system that changes the encoding , then you ’ll get different results when you load the registry .
6 . The Registry arrangement is a mess
Take a look at this forensic view of interesting Registry keys ( PDF ) .
List of mounted drives ?
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices .
But what the user sees is stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software \Microsoft \Windows \CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2\CPC
\Volume\ .
Unless you mean USB devices which might be in the above list , or in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR
.
And the entries in those lists are by no means obvious — containing impenetrable binary fields and strange Windows paths .
If you browse through the Registry some time you ’ll see it ’s a giant accreted mess of non-standardized , overlapping information stored in random places .
Some of it is configuration , much of it is runtime data .
This is a far cry from /etc/ progname.conf in Linux .
7 . The Registry is a filesystem
Back to point 1 , the Registry is a half - assed , poor quality implementation of a filesystem .
Importantly , it ’s not a database .
It should be a database !
It could benefit from indices to allow quick lookups , but instead we have to manually and linearly traverse it .
This leads to really strange Registry keys like :
\ ControlSet001 \Control \CriticalDeviceDatabase\pci#ven_1af4&dev_1001&subsys_00000000
which are crying out to be implemented as indexed columns in a real database .
8. Security , ha ha , let ’s pretend
Despite the fact that the Registry is just a plain file that you can modify using all sorts of external tools ( eg. our hivex shell ) , you can create “ unreadable ” and “ unwritable ” keys .
These are “ secure ” from the point of view of Windows , unless you just modify the Registry binary file directly .
Windows also uses an unhealthy dose of security - through - obscurity .
It hides password salts in the obscure “ ClassName ” field of the Registry key .
The “ security ” here relies entirely on the fact that the default Windows REGEDIT program cannot view or edit the ClassName of a key .
Anyone with a binary editor can get around this restriction trivially .
9 . The Registry is obsolete , sorta
Well the good news is the Registry is obsolete .
The bad news is that Vista has introduced another , incompatible way to store application data , in AppData / Local and AppData / LocalLow directories , but that Windows Vista and Windows 7 continue to rely on the Registry for all sorts of critical data , and it does n’t look like this mess is going to go away any time soon .

libguestfs on Fedora now provides the tools you need to manage the Registry in Windows virtual machines .

1473 : Nicolaus Copernicus is born in Torun , Poland , of German parents , leading both countries to claim him as their own .
The astronomer was not so eagerly embraced by the Catholic Church , however , after becoming the most prominent advocate of the heliocentric theory that placed Earth in orbit around a stationary sun , an idea that stood in direct opposition to both conventional wisdom and Catholic dogma .
The heliocentric theory had existed for centuries but in largely fragmented form , buried by time and religious repression .
In what is now known as the Copernican system , Copernicus outlined seven basic theoretical principles and presented them in his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium , or in English , On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres :
There is no one center of all the celestial spheres [ orbits ] .
The Earth 's center is not the center of the universe .
The center of the universe is near the sun .
The distance of the Earth to the sun is imperceptible compared with the distance to the stars .
The rotation of the Earth accounts for the apparent daily rotation of the stars .
The apparent annual cycle of movements of the sun is caused by the Earth revolving around the sun .
The apparent retrograde motion of the planets is caused by the motion of the Earth , from which one observes .
Unsurprisingly , Rome banned the book .
Copernican theory not only obliterated the universe as understood by Ptolemy and the ancients , it had a profound effect on other astronomers of the scientific age , including Galileo and Johannes Kepler .
It is thus considered a defining moment in the history of science .

Runners have been competing in the annual stair race up the Empire State Building .
Competitors have to run up a total of 1,576 steps to the Observatory deck on the 86th floor of the New York skyscraper .
The men's race was won by Germany 's Thomas Dold , 25 , for the fifth year running , in 10 minutes and 16 seconds .
The women 's champion was 40 - year - old New Zealander Melissa Moon , who finished in 13 minutes and 13 seconds .
Wow , just wow !
What a start for 2010 !
Well done , Feliks , I 'm glad to see you actually grew up for the challange !
Amazing solves , and the fact that you already had the WR in 4 solves makes it even more incredible !
It reminds me to the 11.76 average by Yu Jeong - Min , after he did sub - 12 eventually many others followed him , I hope it 's going to be the same with sub -10 .
Congrats Feliks !
A loosely organized group of " thugs " from central Canada and the U.S. that attaches itself to any cause and promotes anarchy formed part of the group of protesters who turned violent in downtown Vancouver 's streets Saturday , police said .
" These protesters have within their ranks people we have n't seen before , " Vancouver police Chief Jim Chu told reporters .
Police said the anarchists travel to any event that attracts media coverage and " promote anarchy wherever they go . "
They also employ a tactic called " black bloc " where they dress in black and cover their heads and faces .
" That makes it difficult in terms of identifying them for specific criminal acts , " Chu said .
" And , as I said , their tactic is to hide among the ranks of legitimate protesters . "
A CTV News crew followed a group of individuals as they ran away from the scene of the protest and changed out of black clothes and into regular street clothes behind a garbage Dumpster .
According to police , the protesters smashed department store windows , kicked and spray painted cars and knocked down newspaper boxes .
While some protesters beat drums and chanted slogans , such as " Homes not Games " and " No Olympics on stolen native land , " others marched down the streets chanting " Revolution " and " Insurrection . "
SFU security expert Andre Gerolymatos told ctvbc.ca
Saturday that anarchists might latch on to whatever issues there are in the communities they are in , but their ultimate goal is to provoke police and make them look bad in front of TV cameras .
" They look at legitimate authority as the enemy and see themselves as the solution , " he said .
Anarchism saw a resurgence in the 1990s , particularly in Europe and the U.S. , he said .
In December 2008 , anarchists -- upset over the fatal shooting by police of a teenager -- threw Molotov cocktails and rocks , smashed windows of shops and hotels in central Athens .
It was among some of the worst rioting seen in Greece in decades .
Gerolymatos said it would not surprise him if the anarchists escalated their violence in Vancouver in the days ahead .
" I suspect they may have retreated and will come back , " he said .
These orange cookies came to me " by accident " .
I was making my anisette cookies and I had a divine revelation .
OK , I really did n't .
But I thought , " What the heck , lemme experiment with orange zest and fresh squeezed orange juice .
And WOW - I looooooove these .
Now , do n't panic because of the anise .
It 's very very very slight and YOU DON'T have to use it .
We use it tons in Italian cookie recipes .
But , you 're the cook .
You 're in charge .
Yes !
The kitchen is one of the places I get my way .
( Ok I get my way a lot - but I do n't let my family think I do . )
These orange cookies are wonderfully fresh - IF you actually squeeze your orange juice .
BUT do n't panic .
There many substitutions and ideas you can check those out below .
These are one of those one bowl easy to make cookies .
So if your hurting your brain for a last minute idea - here you go !

Parker Griffith ’s Staff Exits Stage Left
Created : January 04 , 2010 09:07 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee gleefully sends along news that Rep. Parker Griffith ’s ( R - Ala . ) staff has resigned en masse , rebelling against their boss ’s decision to switch from the Democratic Party .
The full list : Sharon Wheeler ( Chief of Staff ) , Megan Swearingen ( Legislative Director ) , Brian Greer ( Senior Legislative Assistant ) , Will Crain ( Legislative Assistant ) , Sean Magers ( Press Secretary ) , Arinze Ifekauche ( Legislative Correspondent ) , Chase Chesser ( Legislative Correspondent ) , Mary Lou Hughston ( Staff Assistant ) , Dr. Anjali Shah Kastorf ( Congressional Fellow ) , Leslee Oden ( Congressional Fellow ) , and Andrew Menefee ( Intern ) .
After the initial anger wore down , Griffith ’s decision has been a source of Democratic schadenfreude — especially after Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) made a ham - handed play to get another conservative Democrat to change parties and came up short .
Tax calculator
With their ballots in hand , Oregon voters are weighing the two proposed tax increases , Measures 66 and 67 .
At the same time , campaigners , bloggers , TV ads and the media are putting out a blizzard of information , some of it contradictory , much of it confusing .
Here are the basics to help sort through the noise .
Measure 66
Q : Who would pay ?
A : Households with taxable income of $ 250,000 or more and single filers with taxable incomes above $ 125,000 .
Q : How much would this add to their tax bills ?
A : Right now , nearly all Oregonians ' income is taxed at 9 percent .
For the high - income people specified above , any taxable income above $ 125,000 ( single ) or $ 250,000 ( taxpayers who file
jointly or are head of household ) would be taxed at a higher rate of 10.8 percent .
For those who earn more than twice that much taxable income ( $ 250,000 single or $ 500,000 joint ) , earnings above those figures would be taxed at 11 percent .
Q : Give me examples .
A : Let 's say a family took in $ 320,000 in 2009 , had $ 20,000 in deductions , leaving it a taxable income of $ 300,000 .
It would pay an additional $ 900 in state income taxes under Measure 66 .
A family that made $ 40,000 would pay no additional taxes , nor would a family that made $ 200,000 .
A family with $ 2 million in taxable income would pay $ 34,500 more in state taxes .
Q : How many people would pay more taxes ?
A : The Legislative Revenue Office estimates about 2.5 percent of all Oregon tax filers would see an increase in their taxes , or about 38,000 out of 1.5 million filers .
Q : Are these permanent increases ?
A : They apply to tax years 2009 , 2010 and 2011 .
As of 2012 , the marginal rate for income above $ 125,000 ( single ) and $ 250,000 ( household ) would drop to 9.9 percent .
Q : Would anyone see their taxes decrease ?
A : Yes .
People receiving unemployment checks .
The measure would exempt the first $ 2,400 from state taxes .
Q : Any other effects ?
A : Yes .
The ability to subtract federal taxes would phase out for single filers making between $ 125,000 and $ 145,000 and for joint filers making between $ 250,000 and $ 290,000 .
This would add as much as $ 500 to those taxpayers '
Oregon tax bill .
Measure 67
Q : Who would pay ?
A : This is more complicated .
The measure applies to corporations doing business in Oregon , but it applies differently to different types of corporations .
Q : Different how ?
A : The biggest change is for businesses that are organized as C - corporations -- those allowed to have an unlimited number of shareholders and considered distinct entities for tax purposes .
S- corporations , partnerships and Limited Liability Corporations would see fewer changes .
Q : So , who pays what ?
A : Let 's start with C- corporations .
There are about 34,000 of them in Oregon , and about 25,000 -- or about two - thirds -- report no profits on their Oregon sales and pay a minimum state income tax of $ 10 .
Measure 67 uses a sliding scale to increase that minimum , depending on their Oregon sales .
The scale ranges from a low of $ 150 to a maximum of $ 100,000 .
Q : Can you give me some examples ?
A : A corporation with Oregon sales of $ 500,000 or less would pay $ 150 .
Those with sales between $ 1 million and $ 2 million would pay $ 1,000 .
Sales between $ 7 million and $ 10 million result in a tax of $ 7,500 .
Sales of over $ 100 million would mean a tax of $ 100,000 .
Q : To be clear , that means that a C - corporation that reports no profits could still pay taxes ?
A : Yes .
The tax equals one - tenth of 1 percent of a corporation 's sales .
A company that reports $ 75 million in Oregon sales , but no profit , would pay $ 75,000 in taxes .
Q : How many corporations would have to pay the $ 100,000 minimum tax ?
A : The state estimates 104 .
Of those , 77 are companies based out of state .
Q : What about profitable C- corporations – what would they pay ?
A : Net income -- or profit -- up to $ 250,000 would be taxed at the current rate of 6.6 percent .
Profits above $ 250,000 would be subject to a higher rate of 7.9 percent .
Q : How many C- corporations would pay a higher tax on their profits ?
A : Fewer than 1,700 , or about 5 percent .
Q : What kind of businesses are we talking about ?
A : Banks , insurance companies , utilities , retailers and wholesalers account for most of the corporations with the biggest sales or profits in the state .
Q : What about S - corporations , partnerships and LLCs ?
A : Partnerships and LLCs , which pay nothing now , would pay $ 150 .
S - corporations would see their taxes go from $ 10 to $ 150 .
Q : And these are permanent increases ?
A : The higher minimum taxes would be permanent .
The higher marginal rate on corporate profits , however , would decrease to 7.6 percent for 2011 and 2012 .
Starting in 2013 , the current tax rate of 6.6 percent would apply to all net income up to $ 10 million .
Income above that amount would be taxed at a rate of 7.6 percent .
Q : Any other effects of the measure ?
A : Yes .
The measure also would increase fees businesses pay to register with the state .
In addition to the current $ 50 flat annual rate , in - state companies would pay another $ 50 and out - of - state companies another $ 225 .
Q : I 've heard these tax increases are retroactive .
A : Yes , both measures would apply to the 2009 tax year .
Q : How much money would the measures raise ?
A : An estimated total of $ 727 million .
Measure 66 would raise $ 472 million ; Measure 67 would raise $ 255 million .
Q : How would the money be spent ?
A : The Legislature , which approved the tax increases last June , already has allocated the money as part of the $ 14.3 billion general fund budget for 2009 - 11 .
Most of the money would pay for public schools , health care and public safety .
I have observed with some alarm the Christian fad of interracial adoption .
More and more people I know are doing this and I thought a contrary perspective might be useful .
Since the spirit of our postmodern age is to meet any disagreement with one ’s lifestyle choices with personal offense , it is best that this critique is offered anonymously here .
I understand that I will change few minds , especially among those who have already adopted interracially .
Nevertheless , I feel I must say my piece and perhaps influence and encourage a few souls out there who feel social pressure ( masquerading as superior spirituality ) to do this but know somehow it ’s probably a bad idea .
This is addressed particularly to men , who as heads of their families may be able to better evaluate this choice in an objective manner .
Let ’s discuss a number of reasons why interracial adoption might be a bad idea .
1. The Feminization of Christianity
This reason is fundamental to the rest , as all of my arguments are to some extent based on reason .
However , in most of the evangelical church these days , reason is seen as unspiritual while following the wisps of one ’s emotions is seen as very spiritual .
Life , of course , would be meaningless without emotion , but emotion without reason is insanity .
The head must lead the heart , yet much of Christianity today consists of Christians using their heart ( which they assume is the true voice of God in their life ) to overcome the perfectly rational objections of their head .
For example , churches go into deep debt to build new facilities because the pastor has a vision , and the emotion of that vision trumps the Biblical wisdom on debt .
Much of this can be attributed to the feminization of the church , where the male tendency to analyze objective facts to arrive at a decision is derided as inferior spiritually to the more feminine decision making process .
Biblically , of course , both approaches are important , but it is also clear the husband is placed in authority over the wife at least partially because of this difference in reasoning styles .
Neither is superior , as both are necessary for good decisions , but ultimately facts and reason must enjoy a privileged position over emotion .
Men and women are fallen creatures who can use their emotions to justify any decision , whereas facts tend to be more stubborn things and more resistant to our vanity .
In interracial adoptions , I have noticed that many if not most of these are driven by the female half of the couple , and the decision is reached very emotionally .
First , the excitement of discovery that you could adopt and the natural excitement that accompanies the idea of a new child .
Second , the reluctance and fear of the unknown .
Third , the thrill of the rescue fantasy , which appeals to our vanity as we think of ourselves as “ rich Americans ” ( Americans are rich in debt as a rule , but little else ) traveling the world to save a poor little orphan .
Fourth , the drama of the process , meeting the child , and taking them home .
For many people , this process produces an emotional high more attractive than simply bearing their own child ( though in many cases it must be noted these adoptions are done by Christians who cannot have any or more children for whatever reason ) .
The man in the relationship is at a significant disadvantage in attempting to process this through his natural thinking process .
Any objection is either chalked up to A ) the devil is trying to stop us or B ) you ’re not as spiritual as me because you wo n’t “ let go and let God ” .
It never occurs to them that ANY foolish idea can be justified in this manner , where rationally assessed roadblocks are seen as tools of Satan and any progress is interpreted as a “ sign ” of God ’s approval .
The truth is that God ’s Will is simply whatever happens , and it ’s impossible to know in advance what His Will is , because it ’s impossible to know the future as a human being .
The best we can do is pray for wisdom and use the brain God gave us to make a good decision .
This endless spiritual navel - gazing , tea - leaf - reading and drama is not Christianity .
I really wish every Christian would read the book Just Do Something .
There ’s really not a whole lot I can add to that book ’s take on the will of God .
It ’s quite liberating for those stuck in “ prayer paralysis . ”
So let ’s move on to the practical reasons .
Feel free to disagree with one or all , but here they are .
2. The Fundamental Nature of Race and Tribe
The Bible is very big on tribes and genealogy .
Western individualism is a foreign concept to Old Testament Hebrews , who were very aware that tribal and racial distinctions were important to God .
I will not belabor this point , as it will be covered more thoroughly in a subsequent post on interracial marriage , but let us just consider an example .
The logical end result of interracial adoption and interracial marriage is a world of people with no identifiable single racial heritage , a total mixing of all peoples , tongues and nations .
Such a situation is ideal for the establishment of a world government .
I believe the Bible makes it clear at Babel that such an outcome would multiply evil in our world .
John Calvin attempts to explain the Providence of national and racial distinctions :
“ Just as there are in a military camp separate lines for each platoon and section , men are placed on the earth so that each nation may be content with its own boundaries .
[ In this manner , ] God , by his providence , reduces to order that which is confused . ”
3. Potential Psychological Issues Among Adopted Interracial Children
One obvious problem with interracial adoption is that the child knows they are obviously different from the rest of the family from a very young age .
One benefit of intra-racial adoption from birth is that the tender child enjoys a time of “ plausible deniability ” and the fact of their adoption can be dealt with when the child is more mature and able to handle the situation .
Race and tribe are also fundamental parts of who we are .
The child already has the emotional burden of not being raised by their biological family , but also the burden of not even being raised among their own people , but being raised by strangers in a strange land .
Since everyone wants to have an ethnic identity , this could lead to serious problems as the child approaches adulthood and starts to form their self - image .
For example , see here .
Barack Obama is the epitome of the psychological issues associated with mixed race families .
Here is a man abandoned by his black African father , raised by his white mother , Asian stepfather and white grandparents .
Yet his whole life he has desperately sought to prove himself “ black enough ” because of his confused heritage .
Though a talented individual , he has embraced poisonous left - wing ideology in a continual attempt to earn his father ’s approval .
4. Financial Issues
Part of the reasoning of international , transracial adoption is the idea that we as Christians in America are very “ blessed ” and we should seek to share this blessing .
You would think America was a nation of people living on majestic estates , nobly allowing foreign peasants to work their fields .
In reality , the middle class lifestyle enjoyed by many American Christians is a hollow edifice built on easy credit and debt .
These adoptions can cost north of $ 20,000 net of travel , fees , etc .
Most of the people paying this outrageous amount do n’t even own their house , not to mention car notes and student loans .
American Christians assume the good times will go on forever and so think nothing of spending this kind of money on an adoption .
The fantasy of being someone ’s benefactor is irresistible to people who are in reality debt and wage slaves in need of liberation themselves .
If the family ’s income were cut in half , how long could these “ rich ” American Christians maintain their lifestyle ?
If their house were paid for , would they borrow against their equity to pay for the adoption ?
It ’s the same question when Christians put $ 20,000 towards an unnecessary expense like international adoption , money that could be used to liberate themselves from debt bondage .
The New Testament commands us to ( legally ) seek our freedom if we are slaves .
Debt slavery is in some ways worse , as it gives the illusion of freedom and hides the true nature of our situation .
5. Moral Issues with Some Transracial Adoption
Many of the children adopted are special needs .
While it is truly a terrible lot to be born special needs in a poor country , why do you think their home countries are willing to allow Americans to adopt them ?
Simply , because exporting these children relieves their home countries of social costs and places them on American society .
American laws require employer health insurance to cover adopted special needs children the same as natural born children , some of whom immediately need hundreds of thousands in medical treatments , and a lifetime of continuing care ( disabled children can remain on their parent ’s health insurance indefinitely regardless of age ) .
I am an employer who runs a small business .
We have a group policy whose cost is driven by the usage of the plan .
If one of my employees were to deliberately seek out a special needs child to adopt , that child ’s immediate and continuing medical needs would drive the premiums for the rest of our group sky - high .
It ’s one thing if a natural born child is afflicted with a problem .
This is the purpose of insurance , to insure against unpredictable risks .
But when we deliberately add known risks to an insurance pool , it unfairly drives up costs for everyone .
So “ rich ” American Christians delay paying off or go into debt to finance the adoption , and then sponge on their employer ’s health insurance to pay for special needs medical care .
Everyone pays the cost in increased insurance premiums , but the individual family gets the credit for “ saving ” a child from a Third World existence .
It is fundamentally immoral in my view to burden one ’s employer and fellow employees in this way .
No one has the right to force someone else , even under cover of law , to participate in their charity .
6. Birthright / Legacy Issues
My postmillenial tendencies cause me to take a long view of my family .
My natural - born children have a birthright in their inheritance , the accumulated capital of their family .
This is the vision of the Biblical trustee family .
I do not believe it is fair to force my natural born children to share with someone who is not , and to seek this out .
However , most Christians are debt slaves with no capital to speak of , and when they “ die broke ” there ’s nothing left for any children to get anyway .
This is yet another problem with the debt slave mentality of most American Christians , always seeking out a short - term spiritual high instead of focusing on a multi-generational legacy .
7. Technology Issues
Adoption has historically been a local act of charity , most often among relatives and sometimes among unrelated people of the same race and nation , to meet a specific need of a specific orphaned child .
There is a world of need out there , and technology makes it easy to find this need .
However , there is more need out there than can ever be met with the limited supply of charity available .
Simply , adopting the Third World is not a sustainable strategy for helping the Third World ( many Americans have a provincial naivety of the sheer number of people out there : there are 5 billion people on this planet poorer than the average Mexican ) , though the importation of millions of Third Worlders can certainly ruin a First World country .
Bottom line :
I would only consider adoption if Providence literally placed it in my path : a relative or local orphan with no other options who could be easily integrated in my family .
If I could not in good conscience integrate the child , I would work hard to find a family who could so the child could grow up with as natural an environment as possible .
Google is making more changes to its new Google Buzz service after users complained that it had terrible default privacy controls and publicly exposed too much of their private information , essentially a list of who they regularly email and IM with .
In a blog post today , Google product manager Todd Jackson apologized for the hitches and admitted that Google would be making several changes to Buzz as a result of the privacy outcry .
Specifically :
Starting this week , Google will stop auto - following the people you regularly email and chat with , but will instead suggest that you follow these people when you first start using Buzz .
You 'll be shown a bunch of faces and checkboxes to make sure you 're really interested in following these people .
This is a good change , and will give you a chance to make sure that you do n't follow anyone you do n't want to be associated with .
But it would be even better if the faces were NOT checked by default , to make sure people who shoot through dialog boxes without reading them -- probably much of the general public -- are better protected .
You 'll be shown a bunch of faces and checkboxes to make sure you 're really interested in following these people .
This is a good change , and will give you a chance to make sure that you do n't follow anyone you do n't want to be associated with .
But it would be even better if the faces were NOT checked by default , to make sure people who shoot through dialog boxes without reading them -- probably much of the general public -- are better protected .
It will also roll this box out to existing users to make sure they 're interested in following all the people they 're already following .
Buzz " will no longer connect your public Picasa Web Albums and Google Reader shared items automatically . "
Google is adding a new " Buzz " tab to your Gmail settings so you can disable it or hide it from Gmail .
Google did NOT make one specific change that some people may still be upset about -- Google Buzz will still show your follower / following lists publicly by default , and you must still manually make these private .
Having these lists public by default is no doubt better for Google , and may be better for most users .
Browsing your friends ' follower lists are a great way to find new people to follow .
And admittedly , these lists will be less potentially damaging now that new users will be given more information about the " following " process and wo n't be auto - following anyone .
But while Google Buzz is in some senses a social network , where follower lists are almost always public , it 's still primarily an attachment to peoples ' email accounts -- for which people have serious privacy expectations .
If Google were seriously foremost interested in protecting peoples ' privacy , follower lists would be private by default .
This month , Sen . Al Franken , D - Minn. , surpassed what should have been his one - year anniversary in the Senate .
Instead , his swearing - in was delayed six months while the state sorted out an achingly close election that resulted in a 312 - vote victory for Franken and a late arrival in Washington , D.C. , that made him the 100th senator .
Painted by some Republicans as a potentially hyper- partisan member of the world ’s most exclusive club , Franken has kept his head down … mostly .
While Franken has refused any national television appearances , his celebrity status has led to interest in how he ’s doing as a senator .
Nevertheless , his six - month tenure so far has been eventful .
He recently visited Afghanistan as part of a U.S. delegation , and he ’s passed two bills : one providing service dogs to wounded veterans and the other prohibiting government contracts with defense contractors who make employee arbitration mandatory , even in cases of assault .
The latter is based on the case of Jamie Leigh Jones , a former KBR employee in Iraq who sued after allegedly being drugged by co-workers , gang - raped and held in a shipping container .
Franken also got attention during the contentious health care debate , not only for his support of the public option but also for inserting a rule into the bill requiring insurers to spend 85 percent of premiums on health care .
And he lit up the blogosphere when he refused Joe Lieberman extra time to make a speech ( as a freshman , Franken ’s hands were tied ) and tangling with South Dakota Sen .
John
Thune over the senior Republican ’s characterization of the health care bill moving through Congress .
The Pioneer Press spoke to Franken recently about his first six months on the job .
The interview has been edited for length :
Q Well , that was an eventful six months , was n’t it ?
A Yeah , I came at a good time .
A consequential period .
Q You went in saying you did n’t want to be the 100th senator , but the second Minnesota senator .
How would you rate your first six months in office ?
A Well , I think I did very well by Minnesota .
I kept my head down and did my job .
There was a couple areas in which I was helping Minnesota agriculture .
Got the ( U.S. ) Department of Agriculture to purchase $ 50 million in pork to help our pork farmers . …
And on dairy , there were a number of dairy states that got ( Secretary of Agriculture ) Tom Vilsack to raise supports .
So , just in direct response to the crisis in both of those , especially in dairy but also in pork , ( I ) acted on behalf of our farmers .
In the health care debate , I really think , you know , representing a state that delivers very high - quality care for relatively low cost , was an advantage for me in the debate .
And then I got the medical - loss ratio put in there .
And there ’s no reason that all insurance companies ca n’t get to 85 percent .
And you know what that means .
It means that they have to use 85 percent of the premiums it receives to deliver actual health care .
And I think that in sort of the absence of the public option , it ’s one of the strongest tools that we have in the whole bill … to keep costs down , to keep insurance companies honest .
Q Is there a proudest accomplishment for you ?
A I ’d say the proudest accomplishment is just the overall impact I had on the health care bill .
It may not have been the highest - profile stuff , but I think it ’s stuff that both reflects Minnesota ’s values and what Minnesota has done well , and will also ultimately not just benefit Minnesota , but benefit the whole way that health care is delivered .
I ’m also very proud of the Jamie Leigh Jones amendment . …
And the service - dogs bill is also something that I really , really cared about , and it just made a lot of sense .
Q You get a lot of attention on the blogs and elsewhere , maybe second only to Michele Bachmann among Minnesota politicians .
People seem to follow your every step .
Does that affect what you can do in the Senate ?
Does it help ?
Does it hurt ?
A I try to ignore that stuff .
I know we got all this attention on the Lieberman thing , which was really much ado about nothing , and so — I have very good relations with Joe .
At least half my bills are co-sponsored by Republicans .
Part of the blogosphere is trying to say there ’s a rift between me and Republican colleagues .
And that ’s certainly not true .
Q What was the most surprising thing to you about becoming a U.S. senator ?
A I think the most surprising ( is ) sort of the lack of real debate , especially between the two parties , especially on the health care thing . …
I must have done between 10 and 15 roundtables on health care , with providers , doctors and hospitals , with insurance companies , nurses , health care economists , with public health people , rural health , one on health care disparities .
And , you know , that was because I wanted to reform health care .
…
And every member of the Democratic caucus did the same .
And I felt like the Republican caucus in the Senate did not do that .
And that they were not invested in reforming health care ; they were invested in stopping the Democratic … reform of health care .
What was disappointing to me was what came from the other side , or from opponents of health care .
( It ) seemed to be kind of talking points .
There was n’t much behind them .
And also quite a bit of disinformation .
Q Polls show voters have an extremely low opinion of Congress .
Why do you think that is , and how can it be changed ?
A I think it ’s because they see things like that .
I was sort of saddened by that .
I would like to see give and take .
Q So part of the problem is the rancor ?
A The rancor comes and goes .
That ’s one of the things I ’ve learned .
There ’s some times that you go after each other on the floor .
It used to be more that you ’d go after each other on the floor , and then you ’d go out to dinner .
Now , there ’s less of that .
There ’s a lot more going back home on Thursday .
And that ’s good .
I like coming back home to Minnesota and I think it ’s very important to do that .
The loss is sort of that the members do n’t have time to play poker or go out with members of the other party to dinner , and get their wives to know each other , and their children . …
I think that there ’s been a change in the culture that has not been good for the tone .
Q Health care , of course , dominated the year .
You were a strong supporter of the public option .
Is this still a good bill without it ?
Is this still health care reform without the public option ?
A Oh , yeah .
It ’s doing so much .
It ’s going to cover 31 million more people .
It ’s going to make these insurance reforms to make people ’s health insurance a lot more secure — the pre-existing condition exclusion , getting rid of that , ( and ) annual or lifetime ( coverage ) limits .
There ’s so much in this , and there ’s so much on the other side on cost control on things that I believe will … slow the increase in the cost .
I think this is a very good bill .
I would remind folks who are very disappointed , as I was , about the public option not surviving that one , the creator of the public option , Jacob Hacker , is for the bill .
And secondly that Social Security , when it started , was for widows and orphans .
And that was it .
So this is n’t the end of this .
Q There are political consequences to tackling big issues .
Did the White House make a mistake by taking on health care in the first year ?
A No . I think it was a huge part of the debate during the campaign .
I think they were wise to do it .
I wish it had gone faster .
Q You made a point of trying to keep your head down and work hard , as you ’ve said , but there was a moment when the feisty Al Franken showed up .
Talk about what happened with John
Thune on the floor that day .
A What happened was that ( Thune ) had this ( health care ) chart out , saying that taxes start in ( 18 ) days , and benefits do n’t start for 1,400 days .
The gist of it was that nothing started until 2014 .
And that just is n’t the case . …
So I went up to him and said , “ John , did you include any of the things that are kicking in right away ? ”
There ’s a lot of stuff that is kicking in right away — your kid will be covered until their 27th birthday , there ’ll be subsidies for small businesses , there ’ll be many new policies that eliminate these ( coverage ) exclusions .
There ’s a whole bunch of stuff .
The ( Medicare Part D ) doughnut hole will be mostly closed for seniors , et cetera .
And he said , “ No . ”
So the most egregious thing I did was I did n’t know that ( on the floor ) you cannot characterize a conversation that you had with a colleague . …
I kind of knew that and kind of thought it was n’t that controversial because he ’d just given the speech .
And I said : “ I ’ve just talked to my colleague .
He has this chart here ; I asked him if he had mentioned anything and he said , ‘ No . ’ ” So that was a no - no , what I did .
So for that , I actually went and apologized to him for , but what I did n’t apologize for was , John had said things like , “ This will not extend the solvency of Medicare for even one day . ”
And , the ( Congressional Budget Office ) says nine years .
And I used the old ( Sen. Daniel Patrick )
Moynihan thing that you ’re entitled to your own opinions , you ’re not entitled to your own facts .
Q We ’ve talked a little bit about you working with Republicans on the other side of the aisle on some of the bills and other things .
Is it also true you co-wrote a song with Orrin Hatch ?
A Yes .
Basically , I ’d actually heard some of Orrin ’s songs a while ago , which were more devotional songs .
This is from years ago .
And they were pretty good .
They were OK .
So then the first or second day there , I told Orrin , “ You know , I just want to hear some of your music . ” …
So then it occurred to me that I had written a song which was a duet , a country duet , called “ We Stay Together for the Kids . ”
And that it needed a bridge .
And I had done a demo , too .
I ’d actually been in Nashville once and got some session musicians together and a woman singer and we ’d done a version of it .
And I really liked the song except it really needs a bridge .
So I said to Orrin , “ Can I send you a song ?
I ’d like to write a bridge with you . ” …
And so the last week of our session , we sat in his office for about an hour and a half and wrote the bridge .
I think his assistant was wondering what was going on because we were laughing a lot .
I think we finished the bridge in about 45 minutes and spent about 45 minutes talking about all kinds of things .
Q This year , does Congress lay low coming off this huge , contentious health care debate ?
Or can it still tackle things like climate change ?
A That ’s a really good question .
We need an energy bill , because I think an energy bill is a jobs bill .
I ’m a little afraid that this incredible contentiousness is going to make it a little harder to do something that includes cap - and - trade and may put that on a slower track .
But I do know that we ’re going to turn our attention right away to jobs .
I go to all kinds of meetings with mayors and city councils and chambers of commerce around the state , and I ’m hearing that we ’re not getting money to Main Street . …
I ’ve written a letter with a number of other senators saying we need to get at least $ 40 billion of the TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) money directly to Main Street , and we can do that through community banks , the kind of banks that were n’t bailed out during the TARP . …
And there ’s other kinds of jobs .
We ’re retrofitting buildings , homes , put people in the building trades to upgrade our building stock , our housing stock , and save energy all at the same time .
Q How do you and your wife , Franni , like living in D.C. ?
A We really like it , but we work really hard .
We ’re not going out much . …
We sit and do our homework .
We ’re not like gallivanting around town going to , you know , ( retired Washington Post editor ) Ben Bradlee ’s house .
I ’m not sure what the big parties are , what the salons are in Washington .
I have n’t been to one of those .
It ’d be fine , I ’d like to . …
We ’re very happy , we ’re very happy .
I can walk to my office .
My life is pretty much sort of that walk to the office .
Here is an interesting email from " Jason " regarding high schools in Central Falls Rhode Island .
Jason writes :
Hi Mish ,
As I 'm sure you 're aware , Rhode Island has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation .
Central Falls is one of the poorest towns in the state .
It looks like the pictures everyone 's seen of Detroit or Flint .
There are lots of boarded up windows , abandoned buildings , decrepit factories with broken windows , etc .
It 's an absolutely depressed community .
According to Wikipedia , the median income in the town is $ 22 k .
Teacher salaries at the high school average $ 72-78 k .
Apparently 50 % of the students at the school are failing all of their classes , and the graduation rate is also under 50 % .
In an effort to turn the school around , the superintendent requested some changes be made whereby the school day would be slightly extended , teachers would perform some extra tutoring , etc .
The union balked and refused the terms , so now she is firing the entire teaching staff of the high school and replacing them .
This is yet another example of unions digging their own graves by refusing to negotiate or accept reasonable terms .
Sentiment is on the side of the superintendent , at least among the folks I have discussed the issue with .

The teachers did n’t blink .
Under threat of losing their jobs if they did n’t go along with extra work for not a lot of extra pay , the Central Falls Teachers ’ Union refused Friday morning to accept a reform plan for one of the worst - performing high schools in the state .
The superintendent did n’t blink either .
After learning of the union ’s position , School Supt .
Frances Gallo notified the state that she was switching to an alternative she was hoping to avoid : firing the entire staff at Central Falls High School .
In total , about 100 teachers , administrators and assistants will lose their jobs .
Gallo blamed the union ’s “ callous disregard ” for the situation , saying union leaders “ knew full well what would happen ” if they rejected the six conditions Gallo said were crucial to improving the school .
The conditions are adding 25 minutes to the school day , providing tutoring on a rotating schedule before and after school , eating lunch with students once a week , submitting to more rigorous evaluations , attending weekly after - school planning sessions with other teachers and participating in two weeks of training in the summer .
Tale Of The Missed Deadline
Gallo decided to give the teachers one more chance to embrace her ambitious reform plan after listening to the comments of several teachers and students at a packed School Board of Trustees meeting Tuesday night .
But , the superintendent said in a phone interview Wednesday , she is determined to fix the high school ’s deep - rooted problems and she is not going to waver from doing everything that must be done to meet the needs of the 800 students there .
For the first time , Gallo knows she can get it done because state Education Commissioner Deborah A. Gist has mandated the overhaul , giving Gallo federal and state authority to transform the school .
“ We have a graduation rate of 48 percent .
I have 19 - year - olds in classes with 14 - year - olds .
It ’s the middle of the school year and 50 percent of the students at the high school are failing all of their classes , ” Gallo said .
Gallo said she offered to pay teachers $ 30 an hour for two additional weeks of training in the summer .
Gallo also said she would try to find grant money to pay teachers for 90 minutes a week of after - school planning time , also at $ 30 an hour .
But she says she has no extra money to pay for other changes she is pushing for , including lengthening the instructional day by 25 minutes , so teachers work 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of 7:50 a.m. to 2:25 p.m .
She wants teachers to formalize a rotating tutoring schedule , so a teacher is available to help students for an hour before or after school , and she wants teachers to have lunch with students one day a week .
The average teacher ’s salary at the high school ranges between $ 72,000 and $ 78,000 a year , because most are at the district ’s top step , Gallo said .
Union officials have been pushing for $ 90 per hour and want the district to pay for more of the additional responsibilities .
Matter of Principle

Here ’s how the studio describes the action - comedy , opening in theaters on April 23 :
Only one American hero has earned the rank of Green Beret , Navy SEAL and Army Ranger .
Just one operative has been awarded 16 purple hearts , 3 Congressional Medals of Honor and 7 presidential medals of bravery .
And only one guy is man enough to still sport a mullet .
In 2010 , Will Forte brings “ Saturday Night Live ’s ” clueless soldier of fortune to the big screen in the action comedy “ MacGruber . ”
In the 10 years since his fiancée was killed , special op MacGruber has sworn off a life of fighting crime with his bare hands .
But when he learns that his country needs him to find a nuclear warhead that ’s been stolen by his sworn enemy , Dieter Von Cunth ( Val Kilmer ) , MacGruber figures he ’s the only one tough enough for the job .
Assembling an elite team of experts–Lt. Dixon Piper ( Ryan Phillippe ) and Vicki St. Elmo ( Kristen Wiig ) –MacGruber will navigate an army of assassins to hunt down Cunth and bring him to justice .
His methods may be unorthodox .
His crime scenes may get messy .
But if you want the world saved right , you call in MacGruber .
It ’s been a slow death , but Miramax dies on Thursday .
The New York and Los Angeles offices of the arthouse movie studio owned by Disney will close .
Eighty people will lose their jobs .
The six movies waiting distribution — " Last Night , " " The Debt , " " The Tempest ” among them — will be shelved , to gather dust , or win a tepid release .
It ’s not clear that anyone at the studio will care .
But a lot of other people around the movie business mourned the impending loss of a label that once set the bar for taste and artistry .
( Update Thursday : A Disney spokeswoman called to protest that Miramax is not ‘ dead . ’
" Miramax will consoldiate its operations within Walt Disney Studios , and will be releasing a smaller number of films than in previous years .
But it will continue to operate within the Walt Disney Studios , " she said . )
Over 31 years , the movie company that for most of its existence was led by founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein brought the public enduring stories that plumbed the depths of human emotion ( “ My Left Foot ” ) and pushed the boundaries of cultural barriers ( “ Reservoir Dogs ” ) .
When we think of the movies that defined the latter part of the 20th century — the movies that mattered , that stories that hit pop culture like a hammer and left a dent — more often than not they came from Miramax .
“ The Piano . ” “ Pulp Fiction . ”
“ Sex , Lies and Videotape . ” “ Clerks . ” “ The English Patient . ” ( See slideshow . )
All too often , we may find ourselves saying :
Why does n’t Hollywood make those movies anymore ?
Maybe the movie industry does n’t know how to .
Miramax , for well over a decade , was something special .
“ Miramax was n’t just a bad - boy clubhouse , it was a 20th century Olympus , ” filmmaker Kevin Smith wrote to TheWrap .
“ Throw a can of Diet Coke and you hit a modern - day deity .
And for one brief , shining moment , it was an age of magic and wonders . ” ( Read Kevin Smith ’s full Hollyblog . )
With these in the vault : “ Shakespeare in Love ” ( Oscar : Gwyneth Paltrow ) .
“ The Crying Game ” ( Oscar , Neil Jordan ) .
“ The Talented Mr. Ripley ” ( 5 noms ) .
“ Chicago ” ( 6 Oscar wins ) .
“ If there was any company that contributed more to the shaping of a generation and a sensibility — I do n’t know it , ” said veteran publicist Fredell Pogodin , lamenting the closure .
There were lots of overambitious flops , or movies that tried too hard — “ The Aviator . ” “ The Shipping News . ” “ The Four Feathers . ” “ Cold Mountain . ”
But there was also lots of plain audacious filmmaking , movies that nobody else would dare make , much less ride to awards glory : “ Kill Bill I and II . ” “ The Ciderhouse Rules . ” “ Good Will Hunting . ” “ Swingers . ”
The story of Miramax has been told and retold : Scrappy New York brothers name the studio after their parents , wheel and deal to hold their movie company together , bully business partners , seduce filmmakers and spend loads of money on Oscar campaigns .
Then came the sale to Disney .
The success , the hubris , the Oscars , the overspending .
The loss of identity , the desperate attempts to reconcile with Michael Eisner followed by the bitter divorce , and the quiet takeover by Daniel Battsek .
The final chapter has been short and bitter .
Battsek was squeezed to a smaller and smaller size by Disney , despite releasing some respectable movies including “ The Queen , ” “ Tsotsi ” and “ The Diving Bell and the Butterfly . ”
The studio endured endless rumors of its impending closure .
On Oct. 2 , Disney announced that “ Miramax Films will reduce the number of films it releases annually while consolidating certain of its operations . ”
Dick Cook , the former chairman of the studio , told me last summer that while reduced in size , the studio would continue .
But by year - end , Dick Cook was gone , and Rich Ross had taken over .
Soon after , Daniel Battsek was gone , too .
Remained the final sweep - up — the firing of the remnant staff as part of the Ross reboot of the larger Disney studio , focused on a digital future with great , big , global brands .
I asked Harvey Weinstein how he felt on Wednesday .
He wrote :
" I ’m feeling very nostalgic right now .
I know the movies made on my and my brother Bob ’s watch will live on as well as the fantastic films made under the direction of Daniel Battsek .
Miramax has some brilliant people working within the organization and I know they will go on to do great things in the industry . "
The Weinsteins have tried to buy the name of their former company back .
Disney has not responded .
But Bob
Iger has made it known that he would be willing to sell Miramax outright — for about $ 1.5 billion .
Too rich for the Weinsteins , and probably anybody else .
So on Thursday , one more arthouse film outlet goes away .
Some in this business just ca n’t believe it .
“ I refuse to believe it will go away forever , ” said Amanda Lundberg of 42 West , who spent eight years of her life at the company .
“ I think Miramax is too strong a brand to not exist in some incarnation .
Maybe not this year or in five years , but the library is huge and the brand is big .
I ca n’t imagine it will disappear . ”
Longtime Vikings fan Prince has put his love of the team into song , an item on Rap Radar reports .

This week the Burberry fashion house broadcast its annual catwalk show in 3D , which is fairly amusing since most fashion models are themselves only 2D .
Filming something entirely flat must be quite a challenge for a 3D filmmaker .
Presumably they left the price tags on the dresses so there was something large and scary to leap out at the viewer .
I 've only been to see one 3D movie and already I 'm over it .
Actually , I was over it about five minutes in , when the glasses started itching and my friend Amanda threw up due to motion sickness .
It seems 3D has this effect on some people .
Hollywood 's old slogan will have to be rewritten : " Make 'em laugh , make 'em cry , make 'em chunder . "
The 3D technology added much to the price of the tickets but little to the experience .
As soon as I became involved in the story and the characters , I became oblivious to the technology .
It was the flipside of the experience I 've had watching subtitled foreign films : within a few minutes you find yourself " hearing " the words , unaware that you are reading .
I think this comes from deep within the human brain .
We have storytelling and story - hearing genes within us .
We bring them to any narrative , whether it's in 3D , 2D , black - and - white or audio .
When Jimmy Stewart looms into shot in a black - and - white classic such as , our brains render him as flesh and blood .
We sympathise with him as if we 'd spent the last hour walking beside him .
The differences in technology are entirely bland compared with this story - hearing technology in our heads .
The introduction of 3D is like pimping a 1200 cc motorbike by mounting a battery - operated fan on its rear .
This story - hearing technology is even more powerful when you read a great novel .
Enter the world of , say , Hilary Mantel 's and you 'll find characters who do more than simply " leap from the screen " , to quote the 3D sales pitch .
Mantel 's Thomas Cromwell clambers from the page , follows you out of the room and becomes — for a week or two — a lively presence in the rest of your life .
I found him constantly lurking behind my shoulder , commenting on what I was doing , sometimes cannily advising me in the art of realpolitik .
It was beyond 3D ; he was impossible to shake off , entering my dreams and my waking hours .
Did you know that the second Monday in February is Clean Out Your Computer Day ?
Just do n't tell Google 's Sam Schillace .
The unsentimental engineer who built the precursor to Google Docs would rather throw an older computer in the trash than spend any time vacuuming crumbs out of the keyboard .
" I 'm not in love with my computer , " Shillace said .
" It 's just a tool . "
With that Spartan attitude , Schillace has built or overseen many of Google 's minimalist Web programs , including Gmail and Google Calendar .
Most notably , Schillace built Writely , a Web - based word processor that was acquired by the search giant and became Google Docs .
As Google 's engineering director for communications products , he now manages several teams of developers as an engineering director .
He has a reputation around the Googleplex .
A Google spokeswoman introduced him by saying , " He hates computers . "
You do n't say ?
And he 's your computer engineering director ?
Hours after two TSA agents served a civil subpoena on blogger Steven Frischling last week to uncover the anonymous source of a leaked document , an unusual message appeared on the blogger 's Twitter account .
" To the gentleman who sent Flying With Fish the TSA Security Directive ... Thank You !
Can you drop me an email ?
I have a question .
Thanks - Fish . "
Now conflicting stories about origins of the message have emerged , underscoring the unusual measures taken by the TSA in tracking down the leak , and the actions of a blogger under extraordinary pressure over the publication of unclassified government information .
According to someone familiar with the incident , one of the TSA agents , while in possession of Frischling 's BlackBerry , typed the message in the blogger 's Twitter account .
He then handed the BlackBerry back to Frischling and asked him to click on the " send " button to post the message to his Flying With Fish Twitter page , the source offered to Threat Level .
The honeypot message was intended to draw the source out of hiding so that agents could obtain his e-mail address , which would allow investigators to subpoena the source 's e-mail provider to obtain his IP address .
Once the agent had written the message , he handed the BlackBerry back to Frischling to publish it , " So that they could then say we did n't send that , " the source told Threat Level .
A TSA spokeswoman , however , has denied that either of the agents drafted or wrote the message or asked Frischling to hit a button to post the message online .
Frischling , a freelance travel writer and photographer in Connecticut , did n't respond to calls for comment about the tweet and never mentioned the Twitter message during several conversations with Threat Level last week .
He has indicated in subsequent messages on his Twitter account that he would not identify who wrote the message that was directed at his source .
The controversy adds yet another twist to an investigation that has been described as heavy - handed and excessive .
A blogger named Dennis Schaal speculated on Saturday that the TSA might have written the tweet message and asked Frischling about the timestamp on the message .
Frischling told Schaal that the BlackBerry from which the message was posted to Twitter was set to Pacific standard time and that the local time in Connecticut was around 10 pm when the message was posted .
Frischling previously told Threat Level that the TSA agents were at his house from 7 pm to about 9 pm , when they left briefly before returning around 10 pm and staying for another hour or so .
This would put them in his home around the time the message was sent .
Schaal suggested that Frischling 's cooperation in sending the message to ensnare his source made him more of an accomplice in the TSA 's investigation than he has previously acknowledged .
" Identifying the author of the tweet is important because Frischling argues that he acted appropriately in facing the TSA onslaught , " Schaal writes .
" But , the Dec. 29 tweet from Frischling ’s account makes it appear that he became part of the hunt to help the TSA identify the source of the leaked document . … "
The TSA 's denial suggests that Frischling was solely responsible for the message .
Frischling has been criticized by TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington for cooperating with the agents , saying that Frischling " caved " to the TSA .
Arrington argues that bloggers have the same responsibility as mainstream journalists to protect their sources if they want to be taken seriously as journalists .
Frischling and another blogger named Christopher Elliott received home visits from Transportation Security Administration agents last Tuesday after the agency published a controversial , new directive that revised screening procedures and put new restrictions on passengers in the wake of the Christmas Day bombing attempt by the so - called underwear bomber .
The agents served each of the bloggers with a civil subpoena demanding information on the anonymous source who provided them with the TSA document .
The document was not classified – but was marked Sensitive Security Information , or SSI .
Although it is not illegal for journalists or bloggers to publish SSI , government employees can lose their job for disclosing the information to unauthorized people .
Elliott refused to comply with the subpoena and indicated to the TSA that he would challenge it in federal court .
Frischling cooperated fully and allowed agents to search his BlackBerry , iPhone and laptop .
The TSA has been heavily criticized for its tactics in trying to uncover the identity of the person who leaked the document .
The TSA directive was sent to airport and airline personnel around the world , a list that likely included thousands of recipients .
The use of a subpoena to uncover a journalist 's source is considered extraordinary .
Even in the case of the 2005 New York Times story about the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping , the Justice Department refrained from using that tool against the reporters who published the information .
Frischling , who writes a blog for the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines as well as a personal blog , told Threat Level last week that his anonymous source had sent him the TSA directive after he'd posted messages to his Twitter account describing his frustrated attempts to obtain more information from the TSA about the new security procedures .
Both he and Elliott received the document separately and published it within minutes of each other on Dec. 27 .
Two days later , two agents visited Frischling at his home arrived around 7 p.m .
One of the visitors was TSA Special Agent John Enright .
Frischling told Threat Level that the two agents threatened to get Frischling fired from his KLM contract and indicated they could get him designated a security risk , which would make it difficult for him to travel and do his job , unless he identified his source .
Frischling said the source had sent him the document anonymously using a Gmail account , but he had already deleted the e-mail after publishing the security directive and could n't remember the sender 's full address .
The Gmail address consisted of the name “ Mike , ” followed by random numbers and letters .
Frischling determined , after speaking with an attorney , that he might as well cooperate with the TSA agents since he had little information about the source and there was no federal shield law to protect him .
The agents searched through Frischling ’s BlackBerry and iPhone , but could n't find anything from the source .
The agents then told Frischling that they wanted to take an image of his hard drive .
They went to WalMart to buy a hard drive , but when they returned , they were unable to get it to work .
The agents left around 11 p.m. , after which Frischling began tweeting about the experience , tipping off the source and anyone else who was reading his Twitter account that the TSA was investigating the leak of the document .
" It is not fun being visited by two US Federal Special Agents with two kids behind you in the living room & one in your arms , " he wrote in a couple of tweets .
" Yesterday I was joking about the DHS reading my blog & the black helicopters ... it was n't quite as amusing this evening .
. . .
I was visited by the Feds tonight . "
The agents returned to his house Wednesday morning and , with Frischling ’s consent , seized his laptop , which they later returned after copying the hard drive .
Last Thursday , in the wake of public outcry against the TSA for serving civil subpoenas on the bloggers , the government agency canceled the legal action and apologized for the strong - arm tactics agents used .
According to a source who spoke with Threat Level , the administration said it had obtained what it needed and therefore the subpoenas were no longer necessary .
This post was updated with a response from the TSA .

The First Afghan War :
The British colonies in India in the early 19th Century were held by the Honourable East India Company , a powerful trading corporation based in London , answerable to its shareholders and to the British Parliament .
In the first half of the century France as the British bogeyman gave way to Russia , leading finally to the Crimean War in 1854 .
In 1839 the obsession in British India was that the Russians , extending the Tsar ’s empire east into Asia , would invade India through Afghanistan .
This widely held obsession led Lord Auckland , the British governor general in India , to enter into the First Afghan War , one of Britain ’s most ill - advised and disastrous wars .
Until the First Afghan War the Sirkar ( the Indian colloquial name for the East India Company ) had an overwhelming reputation for efficiency and good luck .
The British were considered to be unconquerable and omnipotent .
The Afghan War severely undermined this view .
The retreat from Kabul in January 1842 and the annihilation of Elphinstone ’s Kabul garrison dealt a mortal blow to British prestige in the East only rivalled by the fall of Singapore 100 years later .
The causes of the disaster are easily stated : the difficulties of campaigning in Afghanistan ’s inhospitable mountainous terrain with its extremes of weather , the turbulent politics of the country and its armed and refractory population and finally the failure of the British authorities to appoint senior officers capable of conducting the campaign competently and decisively .
The substantially Hindu East India Company army crossed the Indus with trepidation , fearing to lose caste by leaving Hindustan and appalled by the country they were entering .
The troops died of heat , disease and lack of supplies on the desolate route to Kandahar , subject , in the mountain passes , to constant attack by the Afghan tribes .
Once in Kabul the army was reduced to a perilously small force and left in the command of incompetents .
As Sita Ram in his memoirs complained : “ If only the army had been commanded by the memsahibs all might have been well . ”
The disaster of the First Afghan War was a substantial contributing factor to the outbreak of the Great Mutiny in the Bengal Army in 1857 .
The successful defence of Jellalabad and the progress of the Army of Retribution in 1842 could do only a little in retrieving the loss of the East India Company ’s reputation .
Account of the Battle of Kabul and the Retreat to Gandamak :
Following the British capture of Kandahar and Ghuznee , Dost Mohammed , whose replacement on the throne in Kabul by Shah Shujah was the purpose of the British expedition into Afghanistan , despairing of the support of his army fled to the hills .
On 7th August 1839 Shah Shujah and the British and Indian Army entered Kabul .
The British official controlling the expedition was Sir William Macnaghten , the Viceroy ’s Envoy , acting with his staff of political officers .
At first all went well .
British money and the powerful Anglo - Indian Army kept the Afghan tribes in controllable bounds , pacifying the Ameers with bribes and forays into the surrounding districts .
In November 1840 during a raid into Kohistan , two squadrons of Bengal cavalry failed to follow their officers in a charge against a small force of Afghans led by Dost Mohammed himself .
Soon afterwards , despairing of his life in the mountains , Dost Mohammed surrendered to Macnaghten and went into exile in India , escorted by a division of British and Indian troops no longer required in Afghanistan and accompanied by the commander in chief Sir Willoughby Cotton .
In December 1840 , Shah Shujah and Macnaghten withdrew to Jellalabad for the ferocious Afghan winter , returning to Kabul in the spring of 1841 .
On the assumption that the establishment of Shah Shujah as Ameer was complete , the British and Indian troops were required to move out of the Balla Hissar , a fortified palace of considerable strength outside Kabul , and build for themselves conventional cantonments .
A further complete brigade of the force was withdrawn , leaving the remaining regiments to settle into garrison life as if in India , summoning families to join them , building a race course and disporting themselves under the increasingly menacing Afghan gaze .
There were plenty of signs of trouble .
The Ghilzai tribes in the Khyber repeatedly attacked British supply columns from India .
Tribal revolt made Northern Baluchistan virtually ungovernable .
Shah Shujah ’s writ did not run outside the main cities , particularly in the south - western areas around the Helmond River .
Sir William Cotton was replaced as commander in chief of the British and Indian forces by General Elphinstone , an elderly invalid now incapable of directing an army in the field , but with sufficient spirit to prevent any other officer from exercising proper command in his place .
The fate of the British and Indian forces in Afghanistan in the winter of 1840 to 1841 provides a striking illustration of the collapse of morale and military efficiency , where the officers in command are indecisive and lacking in initiative and self - confidence .
The only senior officer left in Afghanistan with any ability was Brigadier Nott , the garrison commander at Kandahar .
Crisis struck in October 1841 .
In that month , Brigadier Sale took his brigade out of Kabul as part of the force reductions and began the march through the mountain passes to Peshawar and India .
During the journey , his column was subjected to repeated attack by Ghilzai tribesmen and the armed retainers of the Kabul Ameers .
Sale ’s brigade , which included the 13th Foot , fought through to Gandamak , where a message was received summoning the force back to Kabul , Sale did not comply with the order and continued to Jellalabad .
In Kabul , serious trouble had broken out .
On 2nd November 1841 , an Afghan mob stormed the house of Sir Alexander Burnes , one of the senior British political officers , and murdered him and several of his staff .
It is the authoritative assessment that if the British had reacted with vigour and severity the Kabul rising could have been controlled .
But such a reaction was beyond Elphinstone ’s abilities .
All he could do was refuse to give his deputy , Brigadier Shelton , the discretion to take such measures .
Until the end of the year the situation of the Kabul force deteriorated , as the Afghans harried them and deprived them of supplies and pressed them more closely .
On 23rd December 1841 Macnaghten was lured to a meeting with several Afghan Ameers and murdered .
While the Kabulis awaited a swift retribution the British and Indian regiments cowered fearful in their cantonments .
Attempts to clear the high ground that enabled the Afghans to dominate the cantonments failed miserably , because the troops were too cowed to be capable of aggressive action .
The beginning of the end came on 6th January 1842 , when the British and Indian garrison , 4,500 soldiers , including 690 Europeans , and 12,000 wives , children and civilian servants , following a purported agreement with the Ameers guaranteeing safe conduct to India , marched out of the cantonments and began the terrible journey to the Khyber Pass and on to India .
As part of the agreement with the Ameers , all the guns were to be left to the Afghans except for one horse artillery battery and three mountain guns , and a number of British officers and their families were required to surrender as hostages , taking them from the nightmare slaughter of the march into relative security .
In spite of the binding undertaking to protect the retreating army , the column was attacked from the moment it left the Kabul cantonments .
The army managed to march six miles on the first day .
The night was spent without tents or cover , many troops and camp followers dying of cold .
The next day , 7th January 1842 , the march continued .
Brigadier Shelton , after his ineffectiveness as Elphinstone ’s deputy , showed his worth by leading the counter attacks of the rear - guard to cover the main body .
At Bootkhak , the Kabul Ameer , Akbar Khan , arrived , claiming he had been deputed to ensure the army completed its journey without further harassment .
He insisted that the column halt and camp , extorting a large sum of money and insisting that further officers be given up as hostages .
One of the conditions negotiated was that the British abandon Kandahar and Jellalabad .
Akbar Khan required the hostages to ensure Brigadier Sale left Jellalabad and withdrew to India .
The next day found the force so debilitated by the freezing night that few of the soldiers were fit for duty .
The column struggled into the narrow five - mile - long Khoord Cabul pass , to be fired on for its whole length by the tribesmen posted on the heights on each side .
The rear - guard was formed of men from the 44th Regiment , who fought to keep the tribesmen at bay .
3,000 casualties were left in the gorge .
On 9th January 1842 , Akbar Khan required further hostages , being the remaining married officers with their families .
For the next two days , the column pushed on through the passes , fighting off the incessant attacks of the tribesmen .
On the evening of 11th January 1842 , Akbar Khan compelled General Elphinstone and Brigadier Shelton to surrender as hostages , leaving the command to Brigadier Anquetil .
The troops reached the Jugdulluk crest to find the road blocked by a thorn abatis manned by Ghilzai tribesmen .
A desperate attack was mounted , the horse artillery driving their remaining guns at the abatis , but few managed to pass this fatal obstruction .
The final stand took place at Gandamak on the morning of 13th January 1842 in the snow .
20 officers and 45 European soldiers , mostly from the 44th Foot , found themselves surrounded on a hillock .
The Afghans attempted to persuade the soldiers that they intended them no harm .
Then the sniping began , followed a series of rushes .
Captain Souter wrapped the colours of the regiment around his body and was dragged into captivity with two or three soldiers .
The remainder were shot or cut down .
Only six mounted officers escaped .
Of these , five were murdered along the road .
On the afternoon of 13th January 1842 , the British troops in Jellalabad , watching for their comrades of the Kabul garrison , saw a single figure ride up to the town walls .
It was Dr Brydon , the sole survivor of the column .
Casualties at the Battle of Kabul and the Retreat to Gandamak :
The entire force of 690 British soldiers , 2,840 Indian soldiers and 12,000 followers were killed , or , in a few cases , taken prisoner .
The 44th Foot lost 22 officers and 645 soldiers , mostly killed .
Afghan casualties , largely Ghilzai tribesmen , are unknown .
Follow - up to the Battle of Kabul and the Retreat to Gandamak :
The massacre of this substantial British and Indian force caused a profound shock throughout the British Empire .
Lord Auckland , the Viceroy of India , is said to have suffered a stroke on hearing the news .
Brigadier Sale and his troops in Jellalabad for a time contemplated retreating to India , but more resolute councils prevailed , particularly from Captains Broadfoot and Havelock , and the garrison hung on to act as the springboard for the entry of the ‘ Army of Retribution ’ into Afghanistan the next year .
Anecdotes and traditions from the Battle of Kabul and the Retreat to Gandamak :
The First Afghan War provided the clear lesson to the British authorities that , while it may be relatively straightforward to invade Afghanistan , it is wholly impracticable to occupy the country or attempt to impose a government not welcomed by the inhabitants .
The only result will be failure and great expense in treasure and lives .
The British Army learnt a number of lessons from this sorry episode .
One was that the political officers must not be permitted to predominate over military judgments .
The War provides a fascinating illustration of how the character and determination of its leaders can be decisive in determining the morale and success of a military expedition .
It is extraordinary that officers , particularly senior officers like Elphinstone and Shelton , felt able to surrender themselves as hostages , thereby ensuring their survival , while their soldiers struggled on , to be massacred by the Afghans .

Designer jeans labeled “ Made in North Korea ” will go on sale this Friday at a trendy department store in the Swedish capital , marking a first foray into Western fashion for the reclusive communist state .
The jeans , marketed under the “ Noko ” brand , carry a price tag of 1,500 Swedish crowns ( $ 215 ) and will share shelf space at Stockholm ’s PUB store with brands such as Guess and Levi’s .
Noko ’s founders told Reuters they had spent over a year trying to gain access to factory operators in North Korea , and struggled with poor communications and an unfamiliar approach to doing business once inside the country .
“ There is a political gap , there is a mental gap , and there is an economic gap , ” said Jacob Astrom , one of three Swedish advertising executives behind the project .
“ All contacts with the country are difficult and remain so to this day . ”
The idea for the project was born out of curiosity for North Korea , which has grown increasingly isolated in recent years under Western criticism of its human rights record and nuclear ambitions .
“ The reason we did this was to come closer to a country that was very difficult to get into contact with , ” Astrom said .
North Korea , a country better known for its reclusive nature than fashionable clothes , rarely allows outsiders within its borders and has virtually no trade or diplomatic relations with most Western countries .
Sweden , one of only seven countries to have an embassy in North Korea , is an exception .
But the process of agreeing a deal to produce just 1,100 pairs of jeans -- the first ever produced by the country , according to the founders -- often proved baffling .
E-mails vanished into a void and communications were strained .
At one point they were asked to bring a zinc smelting oven into the country , and a trade representative once asked them to help him find a pirated version of the computer program Adobe Acrobat so he could read files they were sending him .
“ Everyone is a manager .
Even our chauffeur was some sort of manager , ” said founder Jakob Ohlsson , adding that North Korean titles were often confusing .
After being turned down by North Korea ’s largest textile company , the group managed to secure a manufacturing deal with its largest mining company , Trade 4 , which also happens to run a small textile operations on its site .
“ This is often the way it works in North Korea , ” said Ohlsson .
“ Companies seldom specialize and therefore often manage several operations that differ completely from one another . ”
During the summer , the trio travelled to the factory in North Korea to oversee the production process and ensure that workers there were treated according to Noko ’s guidelines .
“ We were forced to operate by micro-management , ” Ohlsson said , referring to his experience on the factory floor .
Fashionable novelty seekers can order Noko jeans from the company ’s website www.nokojeans.com after December 4 , but you are not likely to see a pair on the streets of Pyongyang , North Korea ’s capital , anytime soon .
Socialist dress code forbids them .
The massive federal bailouts that Congress passed in 2008 and 2009 were supposed to stabilize the banking system and breathe new life into the U.S. economy .
We were told over and over that the major banks were “ too big too fail ” and that the U.S. government was helping “ Main Street ” by giving massive bailouts to Wall Street .
But unfortunately all that is not working out too well .
Instead , the major banks ( which got the bailouts ) have cut their collective small business lending for the seventh month in a row while the feds are letting all the small banks die like dogs .
The truth is that the major Wall Street banks that had friends positioned in the U.S. government were able to get massive bailouts during the economic collapse of 2008 / 2009 , but all of the small banks that have been so good to so many communities across the United States for so many years are not getting any help .
In fact , there are rumors that they are purposely being allowed to fail .
In 2009 , 140 banks and S&Ls failed .
In addition , 31 credit unions went under .
So that makes a total of 171 lending institutions that were allowed to collapse in 2009 .
It is estimated that the bank failures during this financial crisis have already cost the FDIC ten times more than the entire S&L crisis of the 1980s did .
But the crisis is far from over .
In fact , some analysts are now projecting that 200 banks will fail in the U.S. in 2010 .
The FDIC is officially in the red and it is rapidly hemorrhaging cash and there is no sign that the bleeding is going to stop any time soon .
Small banks are failing at a rate that is beyond alarming .
But do you know what they are being told when they turn to the U.S. government for help ?
They are being told to go find a big bank that is willing to gobble them up .
In fact , there are persistent rumors that the banking system is being consolidated by design .
So if that is the case , expect to see a lot more small banks continue to fail and get gobbled up by the sharks for pennies on the dollar .
Meanwhile , the big boys on Wall Street are being criticized for the gigantic year end bonuses that their top executives will be receiving .
Life is good if you are a bankster .
So are all of those big Wall Street banks helping out “ Main Street ” by lending to small businesses ?
No way .
In fact , the biggest banks in the U.S. cut their collective small business lending balance by another $ 1 billion in November .
That drop was the seventh monthly decline in a row .
The truth is that in modern America , small businesses are incredibly dependent on credit .
For many small businesses , no credit means that they simply will not have the capital to operate .
But the big fat cats who got all of those bailouts have reduced their lending to small businesses each of the past seven months .
So , no , “ Main Street ” is not reaping the benefits of all of those bailouts .
Apparently the big banks needed to save up cash to pay all of those outrageous bonuses .
So all of the big banks are hoarding cash , and hundreds of small banks are being allowed to die like dogs .
What a mess !
Anyone have any ideas for cleaning it up ?
1 . My name is Ryan Slobojan , I am here with Adam Wiggins , co-founder of Heroku .
Adam , can you tell us a little bit about Heroku ?
Heroku is a cloud application platform , if you have a web app that is written in Ruby or Ruby on Rails you can deploy it to us using our automated system and we run and maintain and , most importantly , scale it for you .
2 . So which version of Ruby are you using as the engine for Heroku ?
On our servers for users applications we have 1.8.6 because we still think that 's basically the gold standard , and basically the conservative choice .
Obviously we have our eye on all the up and coming ones and I personally use Ruby 1.9 on my work station , experimenting with the other ones as well .
But our primary focus is to provide a really stable and solid platform rather than the latest technology .
So we are looking forward to introducing some of the new VMs as an option in the future .
3 . And what about from the Rails prospective ?
I think we have got all the latest Rails gems installed ; whenever it comes out we just install it .
On of the things that we really emphasized in our stack right from the beginning is making sure that it 's really standard components in terms of what the user code interacts with .
So , the rack , the Gems that you are relying on , the Ruby VM we are not modifying any of that stuff , we are not using anything that is different from what you would install out of the box .
We are very standards oriented and that way you have no lock - in both loading your applications and it is very easy because if you had it working in a standard environment it'll work here , and likewise if you want to export your application later there is no barriers to doing that .
And of course , outside of what the user code interacts with we have a lot more opportunity to build magic components and in there we use more interesting technologies but for what faces the user we try to keep it really solid , conservative and standard stack .
4 . When Rails 3 is released , do you intend to do a full world upgrade from Rails 2 to Rails 3 , or do you plan to run the two in parallel ?
Definitely in parallel , that 's a choice that each user 's application should be making .
Luckily the versioning for RubyGems makes that really easy , so we install the gems on our servers the day it comes out .
We can actually use it today by vendoring it into your application and pushing it up .
So it 's better to use the system Gems just because your application is more lightweight , and we can distribute it across our cluster of dyno servers more quickly , but we will offer that gem as soon as it comes out .
But you will always have complete flexibility to run any version of Rails that you want , or in fact any framework , so you can use Sinatra or Merb or anything else because we are fully rack compatible .
5 . What are the important things that you are waiting to see happen with Ruby 1.9 before you migrate from your existing 1.8 to that ?
In my own use Ruby 1.9 is already totally solid .
There are minor incompatibilities here and there but I found them very easy to clean up .
I think it 's really a matter of , one , customer demand ; I think people are loading on applications that for the most part work on either .
And our dyno system makes it so that scaling up is very easy and therefore speed is n't a huge concern .
That to me it 's the biggest win of Ruby 1.9 I feel it as I am using just the speed at which even a rib session launches , it 's dramatically better .
And that 's certainly a win and when people start demanding that we will certainly make it a priority but I do n't think we are waiting for any feature in particular it 's definitely better , and it 's got some really great stuff .
I really like Fibers , although those have been backported to 1.8.6 as well .
I do n't think we are waiting for anything but I think there will come some tipping point in the community where people say " This is something that I am building applications for this , I am using 1.9 specific features or I just want the speed , and I need the place where I am deploying my application to support that " and of course we 'll happily do that .
6 . You mentioned other Ruby implementations .
What would be the impetus for adopting one of those like JRuby or Rubinius ?
Similar to 1.9 like the big win there is going to be a matter of performance , or being able to deploy the infrastructure differently so it 's kind of a pretty low level decision in a lot of ways , when people deploy their applications to Heroku there is sort of outsourcing their system administration to us .
So a lot of times that kind of choice is something that users do n't even necessarily care that much about they just care that their application works and that it 's fast .
So obviously I have been keeping a close eye , we have all been keeping a close eye on JRuby and Rubinius , MacRuby which is a really interesting one , LLVM is going to be a corner stone to the future of VMs for many languages .
We still need to experiment with that but again we'd have to see a pretty big win in terms of performance or scalability , or maybe security sandboxing , in order to overcome , people like those binary , there are a lot of binary Gems that people are depending upon and so they would complain if they did n't work or you could give them alternatives and that sort of things , that 's great .
But again we are trying to do something that is going to be best for our users and right now it seams to be just adding compatibility with all the historic binary Gems seems to be the best thing to do but definitely we are keeping a close eye on those VMs .
7 . Can you tell us a little more about what a dyno is ?
Yes , absolutely , a dyno is a measure of concurrency that we use on our platform .
You can think of it like being some equivalent like a mongrel or a thin or a single thread in Unicorn or Passenger , but we actually count in with that everything down to the operating system level , and up to including the web stack , including like the http cache and all that stuff .
So having this unit of concurrency is very useful when you have the capability to scale by just moving a slider on a platform which is the case .
So instead of thinking in terms of " Well , I am going to get three web servers and let me run , I will run two , three mongrels on each of those , and that is nine and then if I want to scale up do I want to add an extra mongrel on each server or do I want to add a new server and put three mongrels on that ? "
You do n't have that decision point because you are not thinking about servers when you are using Heroku you just say " Ok , I am at six dynos and I would like to go to eight " you move that slider up and we distribute that intelligently across our cluster of application servers in a way that it prevents you to worry about what the server topography is .
8 . With this distribution across the application severs how do you insure that the Gems that have been selected from your given application are present on all these dynos ?
And how do you keep them separate ?
Absolutely .
There is a couple key things , like from a partitioning stand point the main thing we do is we basically rely on Unix users partitioning which is really rock solid , very battle tested over the years and so we rely on that and that works great .
We do n't try to do anything like for example sand boxing , inside the Ruby VM , or like preventing you from doing certain things .
You have full access you are just prevented from reaching outside your sand box by Unix 's permissions .
What was the question ?
How do you put the Gems in each application , ok .
We have a base set of gems that are installed across the application servers just because they are still common , like Rails or a couple of big ORMs or rack and stuff like that .
But of course you often have special gems that you want to use so what we do is during slug compiler process which is another unique piece of our infrastructure , when you do a git push to deploy you see the normal git output .
But right after that you see some Heroku specific output , that 's actually running out on pre-receive hook outside our git server and that gets to this compile process where it takes the code in your repository and it turns that into this compressed , optimized what we call a slug that can be very very rapidly fired up across our application servers .
This is a much better way to distribute application code than using revision control or using a big tarball or something like that .
And one of the things we do during that slug compile process you can specify Gems in your Gem 's manifest .
And this is cool because it 's actually better than vendoring because it allows you to get around the binary problem .
Which is that you do n't want to vendor a binary gem that you built on your OS X laptop and push it up to a server that 's running an AMD64 Linux distribution .
So this will actually build the gem , at the time the slug is compiled , and it will bundle it into the gem so it 's all right there .
So you have this kind of self contained application bundle which includes the dependencies , and we can fire that up to our application servers , and you have the full diversity of gems at your disposal , without us needing to install every gem that 's ever been made on our apps servers .
9 . Add - on support is something that was recently added to Heroku , can you tell us a little more about that ?
Yes , absolutely that was something that we were really excited about , the Heroku add - ons system is a way that we can extend and give potentially infinite flexibility to the platform because a lot of people , we built this core product , which is really good for just deploying an application , you have got your SQL database , you have got your varnish cache , you 've got a couple of other pieces , but then the next question is always " Well , my application needs something specific , it needs full text search , it needs to do something with sending and receiving email , it needs to do something with exceptions or performance monitoring " , or on and on and on , there is a very long list .
So what we have done is rather than try to throw all those features in the core platform , and have it become not so stream lined anymore , instead we basically followed the model of Firefox , Firefox has add - ons and that allowed them to , if you look in the history and probably a lot of us used Mozilla when that was kind of up and coming and they kept adding features to it , and it started to get kind of big and crufty , and everyone wanted their little features so what do you do ?
And Firefox kind of cut the Gordian node on that , by keeping a core piece of software that was really solid that does one thing well that everyone needs which is browsing the web , but then you have this add - ons system where you can add in whatever special thing you need like if you are a web developer for example , like I am , there is Firebug and other things that are indispensable but which would be essentially cruft to people that are not web developers or JavaScript developers .
So we were very inspired by that and we wanted to do something like that for our platform where we can , when we add - on things like a memcache or that can be a little bit external to the core product and that also allows us to have third party vendors be able to provide their services to users of our could , and that would be a very integrated and streamlined experience , but it pulls all that flexibility together in a way that does n't bloat the core product .
10 .
Did you run into Ruby specific problems , such as low speed or lots of garbage collection or anything like that ?
I think the answer to that Ruby is n't a very fast language question is that if you want something that you need to be very fast , write it in something else .
Everything in our system that needs to be high speed , highly concurrent , highly reliable we use Erlang , so we are a very big fan of that but it turns out that that is actually a really small portions , like just in terms of over total code that is actually a really small portion .
There is this crucial bottle neck points that need to be really fast and really concurrent and everything else is not so much and having a highly agile language to develop in , which is what Ruby offers of course , is much more important than just speed of execution .
So it 's really the right tool for the right job kind of thing .
And I think we certainly are in the category of the direction a lot of developers and companies are moving which is kind of the polyglot language and technology , like use what is the right tool for your job .
Ruby is a great tool for honestly most programming jobs , but there are certain ones , high speed being one , great example , where it is not the right tool , so use a different one , so I would say no , we have n't run into that because we are using it in the places where it is appropriate .
11 . And further determining the places where it is appropriate , did you identify those based on testing and bottlenecks or did you look at that and say " I know this is going to be a problem ? "
How did you approach those ?
I think there are some things where it is obvious right from the start like the component that our major Erlang component replaced was originally written in C .
And it was part of the web front it handles every single web request across our system which numbers in the billions so it was clear right from the start that was n't something we wanted to write in Ruby .
I think in other places yes , you potentially prototype it out in a scripting language and you discover " Ok , this works well in concept , but as soon as we put some load on it , it falls apart , or it 's starts to take up a lot of memory " so at that point you can port it to something else .
To judge by the right - wing terror machine , this portends not merely the end of the world and the downfall of civilization but an abrogation of the Constitution that must not be tolerated .
It is the assertion of rabid christianists that the founders were all christians who intended the the US be a christian theocracy .
That this is demonstrably false is of little consequence .
The screaming and moaning and gnashing of teeth from the right was utterly predictable and delivered on cue and by the usual suspects , some setting new personal bests for hyperbole .
Bill Donohue was bleeding from his eyes and Pat Roberson 's head literally exploded .
They are pushing the same old dominionist nonsense , that America is a christian nation and that atheists are evil people who are unworthy of civility or equal participation .
They berate Atheism as a religion , but one that should not be tolerated .
Yada yada yada .
I am surprised that no one on the right has yet conflated this unconscionable assault on Christian America as being responsible for the earthquake in Chile or the record snowfall in Central Park .
Nevertheless , the most ignorant , backwards , and hateful wet dreams of the wannabe American Talibaners have been well discussed on the blogs .
The fact is that Atheists are full citizens of the United States .
Our rights are equal to those of the most extreme christianists and we share exactly the same protections under our Constitution .
We are fully entitled to our opinions and the right to state the facts as we understand them to be .
For example , we are fully entitled to point out that religion - all religion - is utter nonsense , unsupported by a single shred of evidence .
We can freely say that religion is not only false , but that it causes great harm .
We can point out that many of its most ardent followers are hateful , mindless bigots with some pretty crazy notions about exactly how the universe works and about what their alleged sky gods are allegedly telling them to do .
We can point to some pretty despicable behavior done in the name of religion and question the validity of the religion that justifies such behavior .
We can utterly disagree with the insanity , the genocide , and the misogyny of the bible .
We can freely observe that the bible is full of bad history , bad astronomy , bad biology , bad cosmology and bad geography , and suggest that reasonable people are better off disregarding the bible as a useful guide for ... well , anything .
We can also point to the greed , the lies , the corruption , and the hypocrisy of the televangelist class and we can openly dispute the obscene notion that it is , in any way , justifiable to indulge bigotry or exercise violence or oppression in the name of any mythical deity .
We can even suggest that Bill Donohue is a tool of a foreign theocracy that meddles in our politics at the highest levels and who could not give less of a shit about your freedom of religion , denies you right to freedom from religion , and who denies that the Constitutional separation of religion from governance even exists .
As for Pat Robertson , nothing even needs to be said .
If history has a lesson for us it is that no one likes having someone else 's religion imposed upon them - a lesson entirely lost upon the right wing superstition and urban legend lobby .
Another lesson entirely missed by them is that the Constitution in no way endorses the notion of theocracy .
The Constitution is a firewall against theocracy .
But the biggest lesson for the lunatic right is that there are somewhere between 30 and 60 million good and true American citizens who do not believe in any religious nonsense , who cannot and will not be coerced into belief or participation in any religion .
Fortunately , we now have a President who recognizes this and seeks to include every American into the community of citizens where we can all be accepted as equals under the law and equally enjoy the benefits and protections afforded by our secular Constitution .
What could be fairer than that ?
That this causes vein - bulging apoplexy in the lunatic fringe is just the thick creamy icing on the cake .

The international league of war criminals
17 December 2009
The issuing of a British arrest warrant for former Israeli Foreign Minister and current leader of the opposition Tzipi Livni is only the latest event confirming an international body of legal opinion that Israel should be tried for war crimes over its treatment of the Palestinians .
Livni was a member of the war cabinet during Operation Cast Lead , the offensive against Gaza between December 27 , 2008 and January 18 this year .
Some 1,400 Palestinians — the majority of them civilians , including 400 women and children — were killed , at least 5,000 people were injured , and 21,000 homes and other vital infrastructure were destroyed .
In October , the United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed a report by South African Judge Richard Goldstone stating that the war was “ a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorise a civilian population , radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself , and to force upon it an ever - increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability . ”
The warrant against Livni was issued by Westminster Magistrates ' Court at the request of lawyers acting on behalf of 16 Palestinian plaintiffs .
Livni was due to address the Jewish National Fund conference on December 13 .
It is being claimed she had cancelled her appearance some time ago due to a “ scheduling conflict . ”
However , the New York Times reported Thursday that Livni was tipped off about the warrant and the threat of arrest .
This is far from the first time that an Israeli political or military figure has faced the threat of prosecution .
In 2001 , a warrant was issued in Belgium for the arrest of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , former Army Chief - of - Staff Raphael Eitan and former head of the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) Northern Command , Amos Yaron , for their roles in the Sabra and Shatila massacres in 1982 .
In September 2005 , former head of IDF Southern Command Doron Almog faced arrest in the UK for ordering the demolition of 59 civilian Palestinian homes .
The arrest warrant was supposedly issued secretly under UK law , but Israeli diplomats were tipped off and Almog refused to leave his plane for two hours until it took off again for Israel .
An arrest warrant was also issued by Spain for seven Israelis involved in the July 2002 bombing of an apartment building in Gaza City that killed Hamas military leader Salah Shehadeh and 14 civilians , including his wife and several children .
Moshe Ya'alon , the Israeli deputy prime minister and strategic affairs minister , and the former defence minister , Benjamin Ben-Eliezer , were amongst the accused .
In September , the Westminster Court was asked to issue an arrest warrant for Ehud Barak , Israel ’s defence minister , under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act , for his involvement in the Gaza War .
The court accepted the assertion by the Foreign Office that he was a serving minister who would be meeting his British counterparts and therefore enjoyed immunity under the State Immunity Act of 1978 .
Ex-ministers , not on official business , such as Livni , enjoy no such immunity .
For this reason both Ya'alon and Avi Dichter , the public security minister and head of the Shin Bet security agency , have turned down invitations to events in Britain .
The government of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has mounted a campaign to end all possibility of future arrests under universal jurisdiction provisions of the Geneva Conventions and other international laws .
As far as Israel ’s allies are concerned , however , Tel Aviv is kicking against an open door .
Whenever there has been a prosecution threatened against an Israeli official , Washington has brought pressure to bear to prevent it .
This led to the dropping of Belgium ’s charges against Sharon , et al and changes to Belgian law to lessen the possibility of similar prosecutions in the future .
In June this year , a Spanish court shelved its investigation into the Gaza City bombings .
In addition , the US led a block of six nations that voted against acceptance of the Goldstone report , while Britain and France abstained .
Britain ’s response to Israel ’s official protests against the warrant issued for Livni was more than merely fawning .
It led to promises by Foreign Secretary David Miliband and Prime Minister Gordon Brown to change the law allowing non-citizens to be brought before British courts .
In the naked language of imperialist realpolitik , Miliband declared , “ Israel is a strategic partner and a close friend of the United Kingdom .
We are determined to protect and develop those ties . ”
So much for Western claims to uphold international law and democratic rights !
As with the position taken by the US , much more is involved in the UK ’s response than mere loyalty to an ally .
There is a basic issue of self - preservation .
Time and again Israeli spokesmen have warned that the leaders of the major powers — including George Bush and Tony Blair over Iraq and Brown and President Barack Obama over Afghanistan — are threatened with prosecutions under universal jurisdiction provisions .
Netanyahu himself warned , regarding Goldstone ’s report , “ It ’s not just our problem …
If they accused IDF officers , IDF commanders , IDF soldiers , IDF pilots and even leaders , they will accuse you too .
What , NATO is n’t fighting in various places ?
What , Russia is n’t fighting in various places ? ”
The concept of universal jurisdiction allows prosecution by international or national courts when the case is deemed to be a crime against humanity and not likely to be tried in the allegedly guilty party ’s own state .
It underlies the creation of a range of institutions such as the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , established in 2002 , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , and the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) .
The US and other major powers have been happy to see these bodies utilized against those regimes they have targeted as hostile to their interests , such as Serbia .
But like Israel , the US opposes universal jurisdiction over itself and therefore endorses neither the ICC nor the ICJ .
When Obama gave his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize last week , he argued explicitly for war as an instrument of US foreign policy , defending military action whose purpose “ extends beyond self - defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor . ”
He insisted that such pre-emptive imperialist wars — of the kind already conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan — were essential to the US maintaining its position at the centre of the “ architecture to keep the peace ” set up in the aftermath of World War II .
This supposedly included abiding by “ certain rules of conduct ” and the US acting as “ a standard bearer in the conduct of war . ”
To this end , he made great play of having personally reaffirmed “ America 's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions ” and “ other international laws of war . ”
This is one lie amongst many .
Some newspapers have claimed that Spain and Britain pioneered the concept of universal jurisdiction , with the 1998 extradition warrant by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
In point of fact , the concept is rooted in the Geneva Conventions , adopted on August 12 , 1949 .
Regarding war crimes , the Conventions require signatory nations , such as Britain and the US , to pass the necessary laws and “ provide effective penal sanctions ” for persons “ committing , or ordering to be committed ” any “ grave breaches ” of the Conventions .
Article 129 goes on to state that each signatory “ shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed , or to have ordered to be committed , such grave breaches , and shall bring such persons , regardless of their nationality , before its own courts . ”
That is why the Goldstone report made an explicit call to countries that are signatories to the Conventions to use their “ universal jurisdiction ” to search for and prosecute those Israelis , as well as leaders of Hamas , it accused of war crimes .
In reality , the imperialist powers and their allies operate as a de facto international league of war criminals — dedicated to their mutual defence and self - preservation .
That is why the US rejects universal jurisdiction when it comes to its friends , as well as its own politicians and military personnel .
Now Brown and Miliband have made clear that they too will abrogate the independence of the courts in order to prevent any prosecution for war crimes that runs contrary to the strategic interests of British imperialism .
In doing so , they may hope to save themselves from the possibility of being brought to justice .
But they should know that some crimes are too great for prosecution to be avoided forever .

The " American Idol " host was the villain of a rare get - together for the Los Angeles rock group .
The audio was broadcast live on BBC " Radio 5 Live . "
A camera crew was also present , so expect footage to eventually show up online along with a possible DVD release .
The concert was to promote the band 's single , " Killing in the Name " -- which is actually a song from 1992 .
In a good ol ' British romp , Rage Against the Machine is pitting the 17 - year - old track against a single by Joe McElderry , the Cowell - backed pop singer , for the title of Britain 's No. 1 Christmas single .
Rage Against the Machine 's merry battleground has mostly been on Facebook , where fans are rallying for " Killing in the Name . "
Bad news for McElderry , who won Cowell 's " X Factor " British reality TV show -- his cutesy song is trailing .
Now , we get the whole benefiting homeless thing , and sure , Cowell is a twit , but what 's the big deal ?
Rage guitarist Tom Morello is publicly expressing his sickness of all the manufactured ballads and the dumbing down of popular music .
Yeah , we get that junk in the States , too , old chap .
Venting about Cowell , the band 's frontman Zach de la Rocha told NME , " He seems to have profited greatly off humiliating people on television and has a unique position of capturing the attention of people on television , but also the airwaves . "
Paul McCartney , one of the biggest pop stars of all time and one who has appeared on that " X Factor " program , chimed in , saying , " It would be kind of funny if Rage Against the Machine got it , because it would prove a point . "
Funny is right .
We 're going to grab a cup of tea , and watch merrily as the machine gets raged against .

Get the Lead Out : Printer Uses Pencil Stubs and Old Erasers
Printer cartridges are expensive and made of environmentally - unfriendly plastic .
So far , the best alternative has been to refill empty cartridges or buy recycled ones , but designer Hoyoung Lee came up with a radically different idea : use pencil stubs as “ ink ” for a printer that also uses old erasers to get rid of mistakes .
It ’s called the Pencil Printer , and it ’s an impractical – if very attractive - looking – design .
The designer proposes feeding small pencil stubs ( sans metal bits or erasers ) into a small hole in the printer .
The printer then grinds and burns the pencil bits , making them into ink .
We ca n’t quite figure out why a printer would need an eraser – unless you would feed already - printed papers back into the printer after discovering mistakes .
According to the designer , this revolutionary printer would save trees .
For people who use pencils often enough to have stubs lying all over ( artists , for example ) , this may even be a perfect solution for clearing up the clutter around the home or office .
Of course , you probably could n’t count on those graphite - printed papers to be legible forever , but you ’d be recycling them as soon as you ’re done anyway , right ?
To escape , or abscond with something .

Just imagine yourself playing the ‘ New Super Mario Bros Wii’ , while stuffing yourself with these yummy Mario theme looking truffles .
Ana Fuji , ‘ Queen of the Truffle World ’ , as I would call her , has made an entire set of truffles using a variety of video game characters .
The details on each design is just extraordinary and carefully crafted .
Simply put , these looks much better than Godivas .
I can only hope they would taste just as good .

Meet GJ 1214b , the most Earth - like planet ever found outside our solar system .
It 's not exactly Earth 's twin :
It 's about six times bigger , a whole lot hotter and made mostly of water .
But compared to the giant gas balls that account for nearly every other extrasolar planet ever found , it 's pretty darn close .
And through a fortunate happenstance of cosmic geometry , astronomers will be able to study GJ 1214b in great detail .
" If you want to describe in one sentence what this planet is , it 's a big , hot ocean , " said Harvard University astronomer David Charbonneau .
" We can even study its atmosphere .
This planet will occupy us for years .
That 's part of what 's so exciting about it . "
Described by Charbonneau and 17 other astronomers in a paper published Wednesday in Nature , GJ 1214b is the latest of roughly 400 planets detected by earthly telescopes .
Of these , 28 are considered " super - Earths " — planets with a mass roughly comparable to our own .
The super - Earths themselves are too distant to be seen .
Instead , astronomers infer their presence from subtle distortions in starlight , caused when photons travel through the super - Earths ' gravitational fields .
Depending on the degree of distortion , astronomers can even calculate a planet 's mass .
That 's how Corot - 7b , a rocky planet with roughly twice the heft of Earth , was spotted in February .
Ditto Gliese 581c , identified two months later , and orbiting its star at a distance consistent with human notions of habitability .
Unfortunately , not much more will ever be known about those planets .
Corot - 7b is 500 light - years away , too distant for our telescopes to discern more detail .
And from our viewing angle , Gliese 581c never quite crosses directly in front of its sun , causing photons to warp in ways that would reveal its atmospheric character .
GJ 1214 b does pass in front of its sun .
Separated from Earth by a distance of just 42 light years , it 's close enough to be studied .
Scientists will finally get to look at another Earth - like world .
" Only rarely does a long - sought scientific frontier loom so prominently just beyond the horizon , that the next generation of instruments seems sure to reach it , " wrote Geoffrey Marcey , a University of California , Berkeley astronomer , in a commentary accompanying the findings .
" They provide the most - watertight evidence so far for a planet that is something like our own Earth , outside our solar system . "
Based on its radius and mass — about 2.7 and 6.6 times that of Earth's — Charbonneau and the other astronomers have calculated GJ 1214 b 's density .
It appears to be composed of extraordinarily deep oceans , surrounding a rocky core .
The planet 's atmosphere and precise composition remain a mystery , but it 's likely composed of many of the same elements found elsewhere at sites of planetary formation , in swirling disks of dust and gas that have yet to accrete : hydrogen , helium , nitrogen , magnesium , oxygen , carbon .
That list of ingredients raises at least the possibility of life .
With an estimated temperature of 370 degrees Fahrenheit , GJ 1214b is an unlikely incubator ( Earth 's toughest extremophile , a microbe that lives in deep - sea volcanic vents , maxes out at 284 degrees ) but it 's not impossible .
" I do n't want to imply that there 's any indication of life as we know it .
It might have life , but it would have to be a strange kind of life , " said Charbonneau .
The telescopes sure to be trained on GJ 1214b in the near future will try to answer that question .
But even if it proves barren , other planets await .
The telescopes that spotted GJ 1214 b were custom designed to find Earth - like planets around nearby stars , and had only operated for a few months before striking water .
" We only look at a handful of stars before finding this planet , said Charbonneau .
" Either we got lucky , or the planets are very common . "

Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
Call me childish , but I reckon this is one of the best gadgets I 've seen in years .
The SoundRacer plugs into the cigarette lighter socket of your boring family car , then sends an FM signal to your car stereo that makes your car sound like a roaring V8 , faithfully matching revs and basically making the meekest of cars feel like a monster truck .
So you can enjoy a ribald hoon factor from the driver 's seat without looking or sounding like a petrolhead to passers - by or the local constabulary .
We had a blast making the demo video :
Shonky and the Supercar V8
There 's nothing quite like the feeling of giving a highly tuned performance car a proper gumboot full .
The screech of the tyres , the acceleration as it pushes you back into your seat - and the glorious , heart - stirring noise !
But tyres and noise pollution tickets are expensive - and the prevailing attitude to road safety these days is that anything fun is to be punished in the harshest way possible - so the majority of cars are becoming quieter , more economical and generally less exciting to drive than ever before .
Which makes the SoundRacer V8 such a great idea .
It 's an incredibly simple device to use - plug it into your car 's cigarette lighter socket , select a radio station , and tune your car radio to that frequency .
Instantly , the sound of a highly tuned V8 engine starts coming out of your stereo speakers , matched to the revs of your own car 's engine in real time .
The effect is outstanding - the cardigan - wearing Kia Sportage we used in the video felt like a 20 foot high monster truck the second we turned up the stereo volume .
And nobody outside the car has a clue why you 're laughing your head off in the driver 's seat .
It 's entirely guilt - free fun - you 're not harming the environment by running a straight - through exhaust , you 're not wasting the amount of petrol you 'd normally need to to get this kind of noise , and you 're not waking up any old ladies .
A warning though - it 's almost impossible to stick to the speed limit when your car sounds this damn good .
So beware !
When you 're not in the mood to tear up the streets in a muscle car , the SoundRacer doubles as a resender for your MP3 player , so you can listen to your iPod through the car stereo if the stereo does n't have a 3.5 mm input jack .
A nice touch .
The version we tested was the V8 , but there 's a V10 model as well that gives your car the sound of a Lamborghini .
Yay !
You can get the SoundRacer throughout America , Europe , Asia and Australia .
We paid around AUD50 - you can find a local dealer through the SoundRacer website .
Temperature is a measure of molecular motion By Chad Palmer , USATODAY.com
Air temperature is one of those things that everyone is familiar with , which turns out to be more complicated than it might seem at first .
Source : USA TODAY research by Chad Palmer A thermometer actually measures the average kinetic energy of the various gs molecules that make up the air around it - let 's call them " air molecules . "
As you can see in the graphic above , air molecules in colder air move slowly compared to those in warmer air .
The kinetic energy of an air molecule is directly proportional to the velocity of the molecule .
This means that colder air has less kinetic energy than warmer air .
When air molecules collide with a thermometer , kinetic energy is transferred from the air molecules to the glass and then to the mercury molecules inside the thermometer .
As the mercury molecules begin moving faster they move farther apart , pushing the mercury up in the thermometer .
In colder air , the energy from the air molecules colliding with the thermometer transferring to the mercury molecules is less than the energy from warmer air .
As a result , the mercury molecules move slower in the colder air and the mercury inside the thermometer does not expand as far up the tube as it does in the warmer air .

An order this week from a New Jersey judge has electronic voting critics and e-voting machine maker Sequoia Voting Systems both claiming some level of victory in a six - year - old lawsuit seeking to decommission the machines .
Mercer County Superior Court Judge Linda Feinberg issued an opinion Monday finding Sequoia 's paperless , direct record electronic ( DRE ) voting machines to be safe and reliable absent any " premeditated criminal activity . "
But Feinberg also ordered that the state 's 11,000 voting machines be re-evaluated by a panel of computer experts , with the panel determining whether the state should continue using them .
Sequoia praised the judge 's ruling .
The decision " affirms what Sequoia and our customers throughout New Jersey and the United States have long known and experienced -- that our voting equipment is indeed safe , accurate and reliable , " Jack Blaine , the company 's CEO , said in a statement .
While critics of e-voting machines praised Feinberg for ordering the re-evaluation , some of the judge 's determinations in the ruling left them baffled .
Feinberg , in the 191 - page ruling , seemed to reject the need for paper backups as a way to recount votes recorded on e-voting machines .
" There is simply no evidence to conclude that absent complete access , coupled with malicious intent to alter the results of an election , the voting machines have failed to correctly and accurately count every vote cast , " Feinberg wrote .
" The court rejects the notion that the AVC ( Advantage from Sequoia Voting Systems ) is not reliable because it cannot be secured from tampering . "
Without paper backups , there 's no way to know , countered Pamela Smith , president of VerifiedVoting.org , a group pushing for changes to e-voting machines .
" That 's kind of a stunning statement , " she said .
" My sense was that she has a lot of faith that the state would sort of do the right things ... but I felt like there were some things that she did n't understand . "
The lawsuit was filed in 2004 by the Rutgers School of Law - Newark on behalf of a group of voting rights advocates , including the Princeton - based Coalition for Peace Action .
The groups had sought a restraining order against the use of DREs in the state .
Feinberg discounted testimony describing Sequoia machine hacks by university researchers , instead saying there 's no evidence of a Sequoia machine being compromised during an election since the first machines went into operation in 1979 .
" Not one witness presented evidence that the AVC , outside of a controlled academic setting , has ever been hacked , " she wrote .
" There is no evidence of tampering of an AVC ( Advantage ) in any election in this state , or any impermissible alteration of any vote .
Instead , the record is replete with testimony from state and county election officials that , over the many years of use , not one election result in the state has been adversely affected . "
Critics of the system were holding it to an impossible perfection standard , the judge said .
Smith disagreed , saying critics know no voting system is perfect .
" I felt like she kind of missed some pretty basic things , " Smith said .
" You have to have a way to audit the system .
New Jersey can't audit what they 've got , and until they can , there 's no reason for the public to have confidence , regardless of what the state does . "
Rutgers law professor Penny Venetis , who represented the plaintiffs in the case , said she was happy the judge ordered a new review of the Sequoia system , although Feinberg gave only 120 days for the review to happen .
The judge also ordered the state to disconnect any e-voting and vote - tallying machines from the Internet , to conduct criminal background checks on anyone who works with the machines , and to put in place a new protocol to inspect the machines for tampering .
" It 's kind of an odd ruling , " Venetis said .
" We clearly proved our case that the machines are vulnerable .
She 's taking some steps to fix a system that 's clearly broken . "
The plaintiffs are still considering their next step , Venetis said .
She said she 's disappointed that Feinberg rejected the work of computer scientists that showed the system vulnerable .
Researchers have shown several hacks of Sequoia machines .
" We should not be promoting systems that are vulnerable , " she said .
The plaintiffs should not be claiming partial victory , said Michelle Shafer , vice president of communications and external affairs for Sequoia .
The plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the voting equipment , and instead Feinberg rejected claims that it violated voting rights , she said .
" It was very clear from the plaintiffs ' testimony that they wanted Sequoia 's voting equipment tossed out of New Jersey on its ear and shown to be unconstitutional , " Shafer said .
" They brought this case forward with that intent .
That did not happen , so in spite of what the plaintiffs and Ms. Venitis are spinning to the media and the public , they lost their case . "
The judge found some structural problems in the state 's voting system certification process , and the " limited " re-examination of the voting machines will look at those issues , Shafer said .
But Eugene Spafford , an e-voting critic and computer science professor at Purdue University , called the ruling a " narrow decision on some points of law . "
The decision was not a technical review , he said .
" The judge 's statements repeatedly note that no problems have been detected so far : there may have been undetected ( or unreported ) problems that were therefore unavailable for the court to consider , " Spafford wrote in an e-mail .
" Also , simply because something has not happened yet does not mean it will not happen . "
The judge 's decision should not be considered a " green light " for jurisdictions to buy e-voting machines , Spafford added .
" Instead , municipalities purchasing new voting equipment should strive to get the best , unbiased advice available to obtain equipment that meets the highest standards of dependability , auditability , security , and accuracy to protect the voting process , " he said .
Osama Bin Laden is wanted by the US over the 9/11 attacks Saudi Arabia has urged Iran to allow a daughter of Osama Bin Laden to leave the country after the Iranians acknowledged she was in Tehran .
The Saudi Foreign Minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal , said his government was in talks with Iran over freeing the fugitive al - Qaeda leader 's daughter .
Iman Bin Laden , 17 , is said to have recently escaped from a compound where she and others were under house arrest .
She took refuge in the Saudi embassy in Tehran .
Iman and five siblings have been held under house arrest by Iran since the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 , Saudi newspaper Asharq al - Awsat reported last month .
The newspaper , which is owned by a cousin of Prince Saud , says the embassy has issued her with a travel permit to allow her to return to Saudi Arabia .
It also quoted Zaina Bin Laden , the wife of Bin Laden 's fourth son Omar , as saying that Bin Laden children and Bin Laden 's wife Khayriyah were living in a residential compound on the outskirts of Tehran .
The " Bin Laden children are living in adjacent houses with gardens , they have a laptop but no internet access , and there is a swimming pool in the compound " , Zaina Bin Laden was quoted as saying .
Both she and her husband Omar , who live in Qatar , had spoken to one of the children by telephone , the paper said , adding that Zaina hoped to visit Tehran .
' Humanitarian issue ' Speaking in the Saudi capital , Riyadh , Prince Faisal said his country considered the matter to be a " humanitarian issue " .
" We are negotiating with the Iranian government on this basis , " he added .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said last week that he had been informed that Bin Laden 's daughter Iman was staying in Tehran .
He said it was " unclear " how she she had got there but she could leave if she obtained the right travel documents .
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been marked by rivalry and suspicion , due in part to sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims , analysts say .
Osama Bin Laden , accused of 9/11 and other attacks , was born into a wealthy Saudi family but was expelled from the country in 1991 because of his anti-government activities .
Omar Bin Laden was quoted by Asharq al - Awsat as saying his relatives in Tehran had nothing to do with " accusations of terrorism made against " his father .

And evictions , in turn , can easily throw families into cascades of turmoil and debt .
“ Just as incarceration has become typical in the lives of poor black men , eviction has become typical in the lives of poor black women , ” said Matthew Desmond , a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin whose research on trends in Milwaukee since 2002 provides a rare portrait of gender patterns in inner-city rentals .
The study found that one of every 25 renter - occupied households in the city is evicted each year .
In black neighborhoods , the rate is one in 14 .
These figures include only court - ordered evictions ; the true toll , experts say , is greater because far more tenants , under threat of eviction , move in with relatives , into more run-down apartments or , sometimes , into homeless shelters .
Women from largely black neighborhoods in Milwaukee constitute 13 percent of the city ’s population , but 40 percent of those evicted .
Housing lawyers in Los Angeles and New York described a similar predominance of minority women , including Hispanic women , in eviction cases .
( The figures do not include displaced renters from foreclosed properties . )
Even for working mothers , evictions and the ensuing damage to social ties , schooling and credit ratings can be an ever - hovering threat .
Clarissa Adams , 38 , a mother of three in Milwaukee , has been evicted four times in 10 years and is now trying desperately to break the pattern .
Since July she has shared a $ 570 - a- month two - bedroom apartment with her daughters , ages 15 , 18 and 23 , and two small grandchildren .
She is studying for a degree in social services and lost her job as a cashier in the fall after a dispute with her boss .
Matt Damon Dishes About His Irish Lockdown in Radio Interview
In an interview with a Dublin radio station , the actor praised the people of Dalkey , the coastal town whose residents have adopted him as one of their own during the coronavirus epidemic .
WASHINGTON  Before 10,000 troops marched through central Helmand Province to wrest control of a small Afghan town from a few hundred entrenched Taliban fighters , American officials did something more typical of political than military campaigns : they took some polls .
Perhaps no other feature of the offensive now under way in and around the town , Marja , speaks so clearly to its central characteristic : it is a campaign meant to shift perceptions as much as to alter the military balance , crush an enemy army or seize some vital crossroads .
The polling was aimed at understanding what local residents wanted ; how they viewed local security ; what they thought of the Americans , the Taliban and the foreign jihadis fighting for local control ; and what might give them confidence in the central government in Kabul .
Whatever the limitations of this opinion sampling  what is the margin of error when there are whole neighborhoods where it is deadly to knock on doors ?
 what the commanders learned helped shape the entire campaign .
Among other things , those living in the area still harbor some friendly feelings for the Americans , remembering how years ago they built dams in the region , and strongly favor an effort to oust the Taliban .
Christina Hendricks Covers NY Magazine in Corset ( PHOTOS , VIDEO )
" Mad Men " star Christina Hendricks graces the cover of New York magazine 's Spring Fashion issue , available on newsstands beginning February 15 , 2010 .
As seen above , the vivacious and voluptuous actress is wearing a very revealing low cut corset .
The 34 - year - old appears to be sending out mixed messages by dressing provocatively and in the next breath admitting that her feeling were hurt last month after she received a great deal of " body scrutiny " over her Golden Globes red carpet appearance .
She said , " It kind of hurt my feelings at first .
Anytime someone talks about your figure constantly , you get nervous , you get really self - conscious .
I am working my butt off on the show , and then all anyone was talking about was my body ! "
Dare we suggest that the newest issue of New York magazine may well generate another round of " body scrutiny " .
Surely Christina can understand cause and effect .
We 're just saying ...

Wanting to do something nice for his son , a huge fan of Transformers ’
Optimus Prime , that would also be useful around the house , a Taiwanese man built a 14 - foot - tall replica of the famous Autobot and used it as support for his laundry drier .
The DIY replica of Optimus Prime cost $ 1,600 worth of scrap metal to make .
It ’s nice the dad put so much effort into building something this awesome for his son , but using it to dry laundry ?
It does n’t get more degrading for a Transformer .

While it's true that the Internet was initially nominated by the Italian version of Wired - - who are obviously going to push forth something within their wheelhouse ( we should probably consider ourselves lucky that it was n't " AirSoft Guns " or XKCD ) -- it has since been backed by some serious folks : 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi ; esteemed professor Umberto Veronesi ; even fashion designer Giorgio Armani .

Two clouded leopard cubs made their arrival on Valentine 's Day at the National Zoo's Front Royal Campus .
They were born weighing about half a pound each .
Staff had been on a pregnancy watch for four days before the birth , the Zoo said in a press release .
Parents Jao Chu and Hannibal , who are both three and a half years ago , had two male cubs in March 2009 and a female in July .
Jao Chu and Hannibal , born in a collaborative breeding and research program in Thailand , are considered to be genetically valuable as they 're only one or two generations removed from the wild .
The survival of their species faces challenges such as deforestation , hunting , decreased mating and high cub mortality .
The National Zoo's been working with clouded leopards since 1978 , and is currently raising money to upgrade their habitat at the Front Royal campus .
You can obsess over -- uh , we mean , watch -- the cubs on the Zoo 's webcam .
So much for all of that Washington talk about a midcourse change of political direction .
If President Obama took any lesson from his party 's recent drubbing in Massachusetts , and its decline in the polls , it seems to be that he should keep doing what he 's been doing , only with a little more humility , and a touch more bipartisanship .
That 's our reading of last night 's lengthy State of the Union address , which mostly repackaged the President 's first - year agenda in more modest political wrapping .
" Our administration has had some political setbacks this year , and some of them were deserved , " he said , in his most notable grace note .
He also showed more willingness to engage with Republicans than he or his party have shown during the last year of bending to the left on Capitol Hill .
But whether this outreach is anything more than rhetoric will depend on a change of policy .
And on that score , we heard mostly what Democrats used to say about George W. Bush and Iraq : Stay the course .
That was especially true on the two most important domestic issues of his Presidency — health care and the economy .
On health care , Mr. Obama offered a Willy Loman - esque soliloquy on his year - long effort , as if his bill 's underlying virtues and his own hard work have n't been truly appreciated by the American public .
He showed no particular willingness to compromise , save for a claim that he was open to other ideas .
Despite the fact that the news was recently leaked by the Czech Eurogamer website , Bioware CEO Ray Muzyka has announced that the first expansion to Dragon Age : Origins will be known as Dragon Age : Awakening .
The expansion pack will launch on March 16th for PC , Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and contain roughly 15 hours of content .
The events laid out in the expansion take place after the events of the Dragon Age : Origins , and features the player either importing their own character from the original , or taking control over an entirely new character while trying to re-establish the order of the Grey Wardens .
Futhermore , players will also encounter more Darkspawn and embark on a quest to discover how they manage to still menace the lands despite the defeat of the Archdemon .
Overall , the expansion will add an all new character , a Grey Warden Commander from Orlais , a new region known as Amaranthine , five new possible party members , new enemies including new types of Darkspawn , a Spectral Dragon and Inferno Golems as well as obviously , many more quests to complete .
New features include an increased level cap , new spells , specializations and abilities along with the possibility of respeccing characters under your control .

According to a statement made by Bioware , the expansion will require an original copy of Dragon Age : Origins to be played .
Ed. note :
It can be pretty expensive ( and a big pain ) to install a wired , whole - house speaker system , but reader Tom O'Brien writes in with his low - tech solution : Route your speakers through the phone lines already installed in your house .

Here 's
Tom 's set - up :
Using existing telephone wire and powered speakers , it 's fairly simple to connect speakers throughout the house via existing phone lines .
This will work only if the lines have 3 extra wires , such as when no land line is in use , or if the house has 6 ( very common ) or 8 strand telephone wire .
Cat 3 wire is 8 strand .
Each audio jack in the setup can connect to any source or supply output to speakers .
All power is supplied by the input and output components .
This is just a big complicated extension cable .
I live in an old 3 level house .
This permits the same audio to be played throughout .
Off / on and volume controls are on the remote speakers , as with any powered speaker .
This will possibly violate the sensibilities of audiophiles , but the sound is fine for me .
Materials include : 3.5 mm headphone jacks from Radio Shack
Repurposed Cat 5 or Cat 3 junction boxes drilled out for audio jacks .
Home Depot 's are cheapest .
Tools : Soldering iron

A reader recently suggested I write about modular arithmetic ( aka “ taking the remainder ” ) .
I had n’t given it much thought , but realized the modulo is extremely powerful : it should be in our mental toolbox next to addition and multiplication .
Instead of hitting you in the face with formulas , let ’s explore an idea we ’ve been subtly exposed to for years .
There ’s a nice article on modular arithmetic that inspired this post .
Odd , Even and Threeven
Shortly after discovering whole numbers ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 … ) we realized they fall into two groups :
Even : divisible by 2 ( 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 .. )
Odd : not divisible by 2 ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 … )
Why ’s this distinction important ?
It ’s the beginning of abstraction — we ’re noticing the properties of a number ( like being even or odd ) and not just the number itself ( “ 37 ” ) .
This is huge — it lets us explore math at a deeper level and find relationships between types of numbers , not specific ones .
For example , we can make rules like this :
Even x Even = Even
Odd x Odd = Odd
Even x Odd = Even
These rules are general — they work at the property level .
( Intuitively , I have a chemical analogy that “ evenness ” is a molecule some numbers have , and can not be removed by multiplication . )
But even / odd is a very specific property : division by 2 .
What about the number 3 ?
How about this :
“ Threeven ” means a number is divisbile by 3 ( 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 … )
“ Throdd ” means you are not divisible by 3 ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 … )
Weird , but workable .
You ’ll notice a few things : there ’s two types of throdd .
A number like “ 4 ” is 1 away from being threeven ( remainder 1 ) , while the number 5 is two away ( remainder 2 ) .
Being “ threeven ” is just another property of a number .
Perhaps not as immediately useful as even / odd , but it ’s there : we can make rules like “ threeven x threeven = threeven ” and so on .
But it ’s getting crazy .
We ca n’t make new words all the time .
Enter the Modulo
The modulo operation ( abbreviated “ mod ” , or “ % ” in many programming languages ) is the remainder when dividing .
For example , “ 5 mod 3 = 2 ” which means 2 is the remainder when you divide 5 by 3 .
Converting everyday terms to math , an “ even number ” is one where it ’s “ 0 mod 2 ” — that is , it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 .
An odd number is “ 1 mod 2 ” ( has remainder 1 ) .
Why ’s this cool ?
Well , our “ odd / even ” rules become this :
Even x Even = 0 x 0 = 0 [ even ]
Odd x Odd = 1 x 1 = 1 [ odd ]
Even x Odd = 0 x 1 = 0 [ even ]
Cool , huh ?
Pretty easy to work out — we converted “ properties ” into actual equations and found some new facts .
What ’s even x even x odd x odd ?
Well , it ’s 0 x 0 x 1 x 1 = 0 .
In fact , you can see if there ’s an even being multiplied anywhere the entire result is going to be zero… I mean even :) .
Clock Math
The sneaky thing about modular math is we ’ve already been using it for keeping time — sometimes called “ clock arithmetic ” .
For example : it ’s 7:00 ( am / pm does n’t matter ) .
Where will the hour hand be in 7 hours ?
Hrm. 7 + 7 = 14 , but we ca n’t show “ 14:00 ” on a clock .
So it must be 2 .
We do this reasoning intuitively , and in math terms :
( 7 + 7 ) mod 12 = ( 14 ) mod 12 = 2 mod 12 [ 2 is the remainder when 14 is divided by 12 ]
The equation “ 14 mod 12 = 2 mod 12 ” means , “ 14 o’clock ” and “ 2 o’clock ” look the same on a 12 - hour clock .
They are congruent , indicated by a triple - equals sign : 14 ≡ 2 mod 12 .
Another example : it ’s 8:00 .
Where will the big hand be in 25 hours ?
Instead of adding 25 to 8 , you might realize that 25 hours is just “ 1 day + 1 hour ” .
So , the clock will end up 1 hour ahead , at 9:00 .
( 8 + 25 ) mod 12 ≡ ( 8 ) mod 12 + ( 25 ) mod 12 ≡ ( 8 ) mod 12 + ( 1 ) mod 12 ≡ 9 mod 12
You intuitively converted 25 to 1 , and added that to 8 .
Fun Property : Math just works
Using clocks as an analogy , we can figure out whether the rules of modular arithmetic “ just work ” ( they do ) .
Addition / Subtraction
Let ’s say two times look the same on our clock ( “ 2:00 ” and “ 14:00 ” ) .
If we add the same “ x ” hours to both , what happens ?
Well , they change to the same amount on the clock !
2:00 + 5 hours ≡ 14:00 + 5 hours — both will show 7:00 .
Why ?
Well , we never cared about the excess “ 12:00 ” that the 14 was carrying around .
We can just add 5 to the 2 remainder that both have , and they advance the same .
For all congruent numbers ( 2 and 14 ) , adding and subtracting has the same result .
Multiplication
It ’s harder to see whether multiplication stays the same .
If 14 ≡ 2 ( mod 12 ) , can we multiply both sides and get the same result ?
Let ’s see — what happens when we multiply by 3 ?
Well , 2:00 * 3 ≡ 6:00 .
But what ’s “ 14:00 ” * 3 ?
Remember , 14 = 12 + 2 .
So , we can say
14 * 3 = ( 12 + 2 ) * 3 = ( 12 * 3 ) + ( 2 * 3 ) mod 12
The first part ( 12 * 3 ) can be ignored !
The “ 12 hour overflow ” that 14 is carrying around just gets repeated a few times .
But who cares ?
We ignore the overflow anyway .
When multiplying , it ’s only the remainder that matters , which is the same 2 hours for 14:00 and 2:00 .
Intuitively , this is how I see that multiplication does n’t change relationships with modular math ( you can multiply both sides of a modular relationship and get the same result ) .
See the above link for more rigorous proofs — these are my intuitive pencil lines .
Uses Of Modular Arithmetic
Now the fun part — why is modular arithmetic useful ?
Simple time calculations
We do this intuitively , but it ’s nice to give it a name .
You have a flight arriving at 3 pm .
It ’s getting delayed 14 hours .
What time will it land ?
Well , 14 ≡ 2 mod 12 .
So I think of it as “ 2 hours and an am / pm switch ” , so I know it will be “ 3 + 2 = 5 am ” .
This is a bit more involved than a plain modulo operator , but the principle is the same .
Putting Items In Random Groups
Suppose you have people who bought movie tickets , with a confirmation number .
You want to divide them into 2 groups .
What do you do ?
“ Odds over here , evens over there ” .
You do n’t need to know how many tickets were issued ( first half , second half ) , everyone can figure out their group instantly ( without contacting a central authority ) , and the scheme works as more people buy tickets .
Need 3 groups ?
Divide by 3 and take the remainder ( aka mod 3 ) .
You ’ll have groups “ 0 ” , “ 1 ” and “ 2 ” .
In programming , taking the modulo is how you can fit items into a hash table : if your table has N entries , convert the item key to a number , do mod N , and put the item in that bucket ( perhaps keeping a linked list there ) .
As your hash table grows in size , you can recompute the modulo for the keys .
Picking A Random Item
I use the modulo in real life .
Really .
We have 4 people playing a game and need to pick someone to go first .
Play the mod N mini - game !
Give people numbers 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Now everyone goes “ one , two , three , shoot ! ” and puts out a random number of fingers .
Add them up and divide by 4 — whoever gets the remainder exactly goes first .
( For example : if the sum of fingers is 11 , whoever had “ 3 ” gets to go first , since 11 mod 4 = 3 ) .
It ’s fast and it works .
Running Tasks On A Cycle
Suppose tasks need to happen on a certain schedule :
Task A runs 3x / hour
Task B runs 6x / hour
Task C runs 1x / hour
How do you store this information and make a schedule ?
One way :
Have a timer running every minute ( keep track of the minute as “ n ” )
3x / hour means once every 60/3 = 20 minutes .
So task A runs whenever “ n % 20 == 0 ”
Task B runs whenever “ n % 10 == 0 ”
Task C runs whenever “ n % 60 == 0 ”
Oh , you need task C1 which runs 1 x per hour , but not the same time as task C ? Sure , have it run when “ n mod 60 == 1 ” ( still once per hour , but not the same as C1 ) .
Mentally I see a cycle I want to “ hit ” at various intervals , so I insert a mod .
The neat thing is that the hits can overlap independently .
It ’s a bit like XOR in that regard ( each XOR can be layered — but that ’s another article ! ) .
Similarly , when programming you can print every 100th log item by doing : if ( n % 100 == 0 ) { print … } .
It ’s a very flexible , simple way to have items run on a schedule .
In fact , it ’s the way to answer the FizzBuzz sanity check .
If you do n’t have the modulo operation in your batbelt the question becomes much more tricky .
Finding Properties Of Numbers
Suppose I told you this :
a = ( 47 * 2 * 3 )
What can you deduce quickly ?
Well , “ a ” must be even , since it ’s equal to something which involves multiplication by 2 .
If I also told you :
a = ( 39 * 7 )
You ’d balk .
Not because you “ know ” the two products are different , but because one is clearly even , and the other is odd .
There ’s a problem : a ca n’t be the same number in both since the properties do n’t match up .
Things like “ even ” , “ threeven ” and “ mod n ” are properties that are more general than individual numbers , and which we can check for consistency .
So we can use modulo to figure out whether numbers are consistent , without knowing what they are !
If I tell you this :
3a + 5 b = 8
3a + b = 2
Can these equations be solved with the integers ?
Let ’s see :
3a + 5 b = 8 … let ’s “ mod 3 it ” : 0 + 2 b ≡ 2 mod 3 , or b ≡ 1 mod 3
3a + b = 2 … let ’s “ mod 3 it ” : 0 + b ≡ 2 mod 3 ) , or b ≡ 2 mod 3
A contradication , good fellows !
B ca n’t be both “ 1 mod 3 ” and “ 2 mod 3 ” — it ’s as absurd as being even and odd at the same time !
But there ’s one gotcha : numbers like “ 1.5 ” are neither even nor odd — they are n’t integers !
The modular properties apply to integers , so what we can say is that b cannot be an integer .
Because , in fact , we can solve that equation :
( 3a + 5 b ) – ( 3a +b ) = 8 – 2
4b = 6
b = 1.5
3a + 1.5 = 2 , so 3a = 0.5 , and a = 1/6
Do n’t get seduced by the power of modulo !
Know its limits : it applies to integers .
Cryptography
Playing with numbers has very important uses in cryptography .
It ’s too much to cover here , but modulo is used in Diffie - Hellman Key Exchange — used in setting up SSL connections to encrypt web traffic .
Plain English
Geeks love to use technical words in regular contexts .
You might hear “ X is the same as Y modulo Z ” which means roughly “ Ignoring Z , X and Y are the same . ”
For example :
b and B are identical , modulo capitalization
The iTouch and iPad are identical , modulo size ;)
Onward and Upward
It ’s strange thinking about the “ utility ” of the modulo operator — it ’s like someone asking why exponents are useful .
In everyday life , not very , but it ’s a tool to understand patterns in the world , and create your own .
In general , I see a few general use cases :
Range reducer : take an input , mod N , and you have a number from 0 to N - 1 .
Group assigner : take an input , mod N , and you have it tagged as a group from 0 to N - 1 .
This group can be agreed upon by any number of parties — for example , different servers that know N = 20 can agree what group ID=57 belongs to .
Property deducer : treat numbers according to properties ( even , threeven , and so on ) and work out principles derived at the property level
I ’m sure there ’s dozens more uses I ’ve missed — feel free to comment below .
Happy math !

Le mani della cricca su L'Aquila
appalti tre giorni dopo il sisma
La presidente della Provincia Pezzopane : " Rendano pubblico l'elenco delle imprese appaltate "
Guido Bertolaso , ieri in Calabria
di PAOLO BERIZZI - I verbali smentiscono Gianni Letta : chi rideva del terremoto , all ' Aquila ha fatto affari .
Altro che " non hanno mai messo piede a l'Aquila " e " non hanno avuto né avranno un euro di lavori " , come aveva assicurato nei giorni scorsi il sottosegretario alla Presidenza del Consiglio .
A smascherare gli imprenditori che come avvoltoi - a cadaveri ancora caldi - si sono avventati sulla ricostruzione post - terremoto , ci sono ora le intercettazioni .
Sono gli stessi costruttori al centro dell ' inchiesta fiorentina su appalti e favori per il G8 .
Quelli che già dal pomeriggio del 6 aprile - il giorno del sisma costato la vita a 300 persone - si attivavano per mettere le mani sull ' affare dove " adesso ci fanno carne di porco ... " .
Uno scenario che emerge dal rapporto dei carabinieri del Ros ( oltre 20 mila pagine ) allegato all ' ordinanza di arresto di Angelo Balducci , Diego Anemone , Mauro Della Giovampaola e Fabio De Santis .
Sugli schizzi di fango all ' Aquila sta indagando , da sette mesi , anche la Procura del capoluogo abruzzese : nei giorni scorsi il procuratore capo , Alfredo Rossini , ha chiesto ai magistrati di Firenze copia degli atti dell ' inchiesta che vede indagato , assieme ad altre 23 persone , Guido Bertolaso .
" Tanti sono venuti e si sono organizzati per fare speculazioni truffaldine " , spiega Rossini .
" La magistratura faccia chiarezza " , dice il sindaco dell ' Aquila Massimo Cialente .
Più dura la presidente della Provincia , Stefania Pezzopane : " Letta è stato smentito , ora sianorese pubbliche le liste delle imprese appaltate " .
Il pressing dei pm aquilani ( 123 imprese sono già sotto la lente della Prefettura e della Procura antimafia ) si concentra sulle possibili infiltrazioni di comitati d'affari negli appalti ( ricostruzione e G8 ) .
I riflettori sono puntati , in particolare , sul Consorzio Federico II , formato da tre imprese aquilane ( Barattelli , Vittorini Emidio Costruzioni e Marinelli ed Equizi ) e dalla Btp di Vincenzo De Nardo e Riccardo Fusi già coinvolta nell ' inchiesta di Firenze .
La strada per il Consorzio - stando ai verbali - si fa in discesa a partire dal 14 maggio , quando Gianni Letta incontra Riccardo Fusi , imprenditore in strettissimi rapporti con Denis Verdini ( il coordinatore del Pdl indagato per corruzione ) .
Gli appalti per il Consorzio arrivano : tra i 10 e i 12 milioni di euro .
Oltre alla messa in sicurezza della sede della Cassa di risparmio della Provincia dell ' Aquila e del Palazzo Branconi Farinosi , Fusi e soci hanno avuto l'appalto per la realizzazione della scuola media Carducci , pari a 7,3 milioni .
22 luglio 2009 : sms di Libero Fracassi , direttore tecnico del Federico II , a Fusi : " Abbiamo vinto il primo appalto : una scuola per 7,3 milioni .
È il primo , gli altri a breve .
Ferie all ' Aquila " .
Se la ridevano gli imprenditori .
I cognati Pierfrancesco Gagliardi e Francesco De Vito Piscicelli - quello che il 6 aprile 2009 dice " alle 3 di notte ridevo nel letto " - il 9 aprile 2009 sono " lanciatissimi " .
" Vuoi fare un bel appalto sul lago di Garda ? " .
" No - risponde Piscicelli - mo ' c'è il terremoto da seguire ... lì c'è da ricostruire per dieci anni " .
Non meno interessati alla torta sembrano Angelo Balducci , presidente del consiglio superiore dei lavori pubblici , e il costruttore Diego Anemone ( entrambi arrestati ) .
Il primo chiama Anemone e gli riferisce che Bertolaso gli ha detto di contattarlo subito : ne va della partecipazione ai lavori di ricostruzione .
Un ruolo importante , nell ' affare , è esercitato anche dal magistrato della Corte dei conti , Mario Sancetta .
Il 7 aprile il giudice attiva i suo contatti per far ottenere appalti al Consorzio Stabile Novus di Antonio Di Nardo , funzionario delle Infrastrutture e costruttore ritenuto vicino al clan dei Casalesi .
Parlando con l'imprenditore Rocco Lamino , chiede chi sia il provveditore per le opere pubbliche per l'Abruzzo .
È Giovanni Guglielmi , con cui Di Nardo ha ottimi rapporti .
Guglielmi promette un interessamento per gli appalti , in cambio chiede di essere aiutato a diventare presidente dell ' Anas .
Arizonans drive long distances on their highways , and they like to do it fast .
But since the Grand Canyon State began enforcing speed limits with roadside cameras , motorists are raging against the machines :
They have blocked out the lenses with Post - it notes or Silly String .
During the Christmas holidays , they covered the cameras with boxes , complete with wrapping paper .
One dissenting citizen went after a camera with a pick ax .
Arizona is the only state to implement “ photo enforcement , ” as it ’s known , on major highways and is one of 12 states and 52 communities , plus the District of Columbia , with speed cameras , according to the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
The cameras , paired with radar devices , photograph vehicles exceeding the speed limit by 11 mph or more .
A notice of violation -- carrying a fine of $ 181.50 -- is then sent to the address of the vehicle ’s registered owner .
In California , speed cameras are illegal , but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a program to add speed enforcement capabilities to 500 red - light cameras to generate $ 338 million for the 2010 - 11 budget .
The proposal is unlikely to be a part of the Legislature ’s upcoming budget recommendations .
State Assembly Budget Committee Chairwoman Noreen Evans ( D - Santa Rosa ) has described the proposal as “ silly . ”
“ It ’s using big - brother tactics to balance the state budget , ” she said .
“ It ’s outlandish . ”
That ’s certainly been the reaction in Arizona , where the cameras have incited a mini revolt .
Initially , the cameras were thought of as a revenue generator , expected to bring in more than $ 90 million in the first fiscal year of operation .
But from October 2008 , when the program began , to October 2009 , the cameras generated about $ 19 million for the state ’s cash - strapped general fund , according to a report on photo radar released by the Arizona Office of the Auditor General last month .
As of September , only 38 % of issued violations were paid , the report said .
This does n’t mean the program lacks defenders .
The number of fatal collisions investigated on state highways in 2009 was the lowest in 15 years , a figure that Lt. Jeff King of the Arizona Department of Public Safety attributes to tough drunk driving laws and photo enforcement .
“ We believe the cameras should stay up , ” said King , who is the district commander for the program .
The program was designed to encourage people to pay the fine and not fight their violations :
No points are added to an offender ’s license , and it does n’t affect insurance .
But , critics note , that has n’t stopped people from wanting their day in court .
About half of the total violations issued are still pending because people have ignored the tickets or have requested hearings to challenge them , according to the state Department of Public Safety .
The violations put an “ inordinate ” load on the courts , said Terry Stewart , a court administrator with Maricopa County .
People have flocked to request hearings at Phoenix courts , and at one point last year , one court branch had cases set up through 2011 .
“ You just have irate litigants and irate defendants coming in , just mad at the entire photo enforcement system in general , ” said Steven Sarkis , a Maricopa County justice of the peace .
The most high - profile protester has been Dave VonTesmar , who has achieved statewide fame through his efforts to fight the tickets with a monkey mask .
The 47 - year - old flight attendant has allegedly sped past the cameras at least 40 times .
His defense ?
There ’s no way to prove that he was the driver wearing the mask , he says .
Lots of people , he adds , drive his car .
VonTesmar , who signed up for the military on his 17th birthday , says he does n’t fancy himself a criminal .
Amid empty soda cans on the floor of his white station wagon are various rubber disguises , including the famous monkey mask , a Frankenstein , koala , panda bear and a ghost mask that glows in the dark .
So far , four of VonTesmar ’s cases have been dismissed , and he ’s been found responsible for seven .
The remaining 29 are pending , said VonTesmar ’s attorney , Michael Kielsky .
In December , the Maricopa County courts launched a pilot program specially designed to handle the photo enforcement hearing caseload .
On one particular day , about 30 people sat in various courtrooms to fight their tickets .
Anh Pearson of Cave Creek , Ariz. , came prepared with a manila folder .
“ How do you know that is my car ? ” she asked the judge .
“ Do you know if I ’m the registered driver ? ”
With each question , Judge Don Calender ’s irritation became more apparent in his monotone voice .
“ Were you driving , yes or no ? ” he replied .
“ Were you speeding , yes or no ?
It ’s pretty simple . ”
In the end , she paid the fine .
Pearson , 58 , said she basically lives on the freeways in her work .
Her job ?
A freelance court interpreter .
Among the dissenters fighting photo enforcement are members of a citizens group , the Arizona Citizens Against Photo Radar .
In Maricopa County -- where 92 % of Arizona ’s violations occur -- volunteers have been on the streets for about a year , gathering signatures for a 2010 ballot initiative to remove the cameras .
On a December afternoon , Shawn Dow , chairman of the group , and two volunteers gathered signatures at an Arizona State University basketball game .
As ASU fans in maroon and yellow shuffled into the game , a mother with children in a Toyota Prius gave an opposing view as she drove past .
“ Photo radar keeps people alive with kids , whoo - hoo ! ” she yelled .
Many people , however , were eager to sign the petition .
One couple even took a snapshot with a sign saying “ BAN Photo Radar ! ”
“ It ’s a fraud , ” said Jose Jimenez of West Phoenix , who posed with his girlfriend .
“ It ’s a big scam . ”
The Arizona Legislature is considering multiple bills to alter or end the photo enforcement system .
Gov. Jan Brewer is encouraging the Legislature to place a referendum on the November ballot -- so voters can decide whether to scrap the system .
Another dissenter is John Keegan , a judge for the Arrowhead Justice Court , who has called the cameras a constitutional violation .
He rejects every photo radar ticket that comes before him .
So far , Keegan says , he ’s dismissed more than 7,000 violations , potentially worth more than $ 1 million .

France quarrels with America not because the pair are so different but because they are so alike
NESTLING in a valley near Aix - en - Provence , Plan de Campagne is a familiar French landscape .
A strip of garish hoardings on stalks reaches into the distance .
Le Plan Bowling , a 30 - alley indoor centre , squats near the El Rancho Tex - Mex grill , a clay - coloured mock hacienda , complete with cactuses and sombreros .
Two McDonald 's fast - food joints rival Buffalo Grill , where poulet Kentucky and assiette Texane are served under a red roof topped with giant white buffalo horns .
All this is ringed by vast parking lots , crammed with gas - guzzling 4X4s .
Welcome to France , cradle of anti-Americanism .
Beyond the Romanesque churches and lavender fields of the tourist trail , France is changing .
Slowly , its way of life is beginning to resemble that of the country it loves to hate .
Over four - fifths of the French now live in towns or suburbs — more than in America .
Less than 4 % of the French workforce is in farming .
French intellectuals and editorialists may still philosophise in smoke - filled cafés , but their countrymen flock to Hollywood films and devour American brands .
American culinary sins — fast food , TV - dinners — are on the rise in the land of gastronomy , and with them child obesity .
Yet the more that ordinary French people embrace such American ways , the more the elite seems fixated with an anti-Americanism that runs far deeper than just differences over Iraq .
What is it about the French and America ?
France has no monopoly on anti-Americanism .
But no other country gets such scorn from Americans for harbouring the sentiment .
France 's defiance over Iraq explains much of this today .
But that disagreement swelled into an exchange of insults because it drew from a deeper well of American assumptions about the French — their unreliability , ingratitude , superciliousness — that are in turn inspired by the force of French anti-Americanism .
French anti-Americanism is unlike other European varieties , because it prevails not only on the political left but on the right too .
Anti-Americanism in Spain used to be a largely right - wing phenomenon , and the tradition is venerable among right - wing writers in Britain .
But only in France has it inspired the most potent strain of right - of - centre politics for nearly half a century .
President Jacques Chirac derives most of his support from this tradition , whose champion is still Charles de Gaulle , the president who converted France 's dollar reserves into gold and , in 1966 , defiantly pulled France out of NATO 's military command .
Some , such as Philippe Roger , the author of “ L'Ennemi Américain ” , detect an undercurrent of anti-Americanism going back to the denigration of pre-revolutionary America by French thinkers in the 18th century .
It reappeared , often as cultural snobbery , in the 19th century , and hardened into contempt in the 20th , most virulently among communists , as American industrial might grew .
A rash of publications during the 1920s and 1930s — “ L'Abomination Américaine ” ( 1930 ) , “ Le Cancer Américain ” ( 1931 ) — railed against the inhumanity of American life .
“ Out with the Yankees ! ” wrote one pamphleteer .
“ Out with the people and their products , their methods and their lessons , their dances and their jazz !
Let them take back their Fords and their chewing gum . ”
The sentiment has found an echo , especially in the columns of France 's national newspapers , ever since .
The durability of anti-Americanism prompted Jack Straw , Britain 's foreign minister , to call it an ancient French “ neurosis ” .
Scratch the surface of the denunciations from on high , however , and French anti-Americanism is not quite what it seems .
First , because it is an elite doctrine that is often not shared by ordinary people .
Second , because it is used by the political class more as a scapegoat for its own troubles than as a reasoned response to real threats .
And , third , because it implies that the French clash with America out of antipathy .
The real reason is rivalry , tinged with jealousy .
“ It is an article of faith among American intellectuals ” , wrote Thomas Frank , the author of “ What 's the matter with Kansas ? ” , “ that countries such as France resist Hollywood films because they are snobs , dedicated to bringing ‘ culture ' — in the form of arty , disjointed films — to the masses . ”
Certainly , French intellectuals cherish low - plot , high - art films , and the French Ministry of Culture leads a guerrilla war to defend such works from a vulgar American invasion .
But what do French people actually watch ?

From France with love
In the first 11 months of 2005 , the top film was “ Star Wars : Episode 3 ” .
The all - time top box - office film in France is another American blockbuster , “ Titanic ” .
On the small screen , French versions of American reality television and confessional talk - shows clog up the schedules , spawning the term la télé poubelle .
French teenagers download American rap to their iPods .
In 2004 , the person most searched for on Google France was Britney Spears .
The more American brands flaunt their origins , the better they seem to do .
In Carrefour at Montesson , a giant out - of - town hypermarket west of Paris , the bakery shelves are stacked with “ Harry 's American Sandwich ” bread , a sliced product that has taken the land of the baguette by storm .
In the nearby McDonald 's , Le road to America menu tempted customers not so long ago with Le New York burger and Le Texas .
Such is the success in France of McDonald 's , a chain that is struggling elsewhere , that its boss was promoted to reinvigorate the brand across Europe .
Existentialism on the rocks
The French seduction by Americana is not new .
The French fell for American jazz in the 1920s and 1930s , welcoming black American musicians who saw France as a haven from the racism at home .
Josephine Baker became a music - hall star in Paris .
Sidney Bechet lived his last years there .
Duke Ellington , Charlie Parker and Louis Armstrong were mobbed when they toured France .
American writers , too , from Richard Wright to Henry Miller , made a home in Paris , finding a reception and stimulation that eluded them at home .
Sartre and de Beauvoir adored America 's jazz , its novels , its films and its whisky .
Of course , a taste for American brands or popular culture does not necessarily mean a taste for America , its citizens or leaders .
Consumption patterns are no guide to affinity , argues Mr Roger : American brands are popular in the Arab world , after all .
Yet even the evidence for popular anti-Americanism is ambivalent .
For sure , 85 % of the French disapprove of George Bush 's international policies , according to the latest German Marshall Fund transatlantic survey , compared with 72 % of all Europeans and 62 % of the British .
Mr Bush 's French supporters are a silent minority : just 11 % would have voted for him , said one poll before the 2004 presidential election .
And today 's America — God- fearing , fixated by terrorism , militaristic — is not the Europhile America of old that a nostalgic France often yearns for .
Yet the French do not seem to generalise this dislike .
In one 2004 poll , 72 % of the French had a favourable view of Americans , more even than in Britain ( 62 % ) or Spain ( 47 % ) .
Some 68 % of those questioned in another poll the same year said that what unites France and America was more important than what separates them .
During the 60th anniversary of the Normandy landings in 2004 , politicians were frosty , but the people at large showed an outpouring of gratitude to American veterans .
Even in the 1950s , as anti-Americanism raged on the left , ordinary French people did not express hostility to America .
Between 1952 and 1957 , according to Michel Winock , a French historian , polls found the French on average unequivocally favourable to America .
Today America still draws the French .
Young French bankers , cooks and students head for New York or California .
Even French politicians cannot resist the allure .
On the left , Laurent Fabius snapped up a short summer job lecturing at the University of Chicago in 2003 and again in 2004 .
On the right , Nicolas Sarkozy , who found an hour to entertain Tom Cruise at his ministry in Paris , told a New York audience that “ The dream of French families is that their children go to American universities . ”
Even Mr Chirac has fond memories of a summer at Harvard .
He may rail about American cultural imperialism , but could not resist inviting Steven Spielberg to the Elysée Palace to award him the légion d'honneur .
So much for French disdain for the new world .
In truth , the allergy to America was always a rather intermittent complaint .
When we recall the fervent anti-Americanism of the left in the 1950s and of the right in the 1960s , we can't help but be struck by the transformation of attitudes and sensibilities that have opened the door to American mass and high culture .
The transformation of attitudes has even resulted in general support for American foreign policies .
Survey data show that while France manifested the strongest hostility towards the United States in the post - war period , it is now probably the least hostile of the European countries .
This was Ezra Suleiman , a political scientist at Princeton and astute observer of France , writing some 20 years ago .
It is easy to forget that Ronald Reagan 's America was widely admired by François Mitterrand 's France .
Even the French elite does not always feel compelled to stir up anti-Americanism .
Consider the revolutionary period , which Patrice Higonnet , a Harvard historian , calls the “ mythological age ” of mutual admiration .
French and Americans , intoxicated by modern ideas about liberty , swapped theory , gunpowder and manpower .
The Marquis de Lafayette , who was made an American officer and helped to defeat the British at the battle of Yorktown in 1781 , was a shared hero .
Tom Paine , an American by adoption , was granted French citizenship for his contribution to revolutionary thinking .
Benjamin Franklin was adored in the salons of Paris , and Thomas Jefferson was invited to sit in the National Assembly during the writing of the French constitution .
For sure , anti-American feelings later stirred in France .
French radicals were disappointed at the timidity of America 's revolution .
Yet French fascination with the young republic survived .
Disenchantment was followed by renewed admiration .
Lafayette spent nearly 13 months in the United States as a guest of various Americans in 1824 - 25 , before being sent home in a government frigate with a gift of $ 200,000 and the ownership of a small town .
In 1886 , President Grover Cleveland unveiled a gift from the French : a statue dedicated to “ Liberty Enlightening the World ” .
It 's a diversion
What prompted all this to change into 20th - and 21st - century anti-Americanism ?
Explanations include a clash of commercial interests , as American economic might grew and French clout declined ; changing views of common foreign threats ; and the two countries ' relative balance of power .
To these might be added a French sense of insecurity .
Anti-Americanism intensifies at times of French uncertainty .
It has often flared after French military humiliation — 1917 , 1940 , 1962 — or instability at home .
Striking positions of independence from America is a way for France to project power when it feels emasculated , something de Gaulle well understood after the American liberation of France .
Today 's concern about decline is another such moment .
Sure enough , a favourite posture among the French political class is proclaiming the need to build up Europe to counterbalance the United States .
Despite a recent thaw in Franco - American relations , President Chirac , in the best Gaullist tradition , continues to call for a “ multi- polar world ” .
On the left , the Socialist Party campaigned for the European constitution with the slogan “ Strong in the face of the United States ” .
Or consider the use of the term “ l' Américain ” by French politicians to discredit rivals .
Michel Rocard , a Socialist prime minister in the 1980s , was undermined by the label .
Today , Mr Sarkozy 's rivals on the right pin it on him .
The epithet is potent because many current French phobias — capitalism , globalisation , liberalism — are associated with America .
Indeed , Jean - François Revel , author of “ L'Obsession anti-Américaine ” , argues that French anti-Americanism , particularly in the media , often flourishes at the expense of self - examination .
The French delight in exposing American poverty , racism and ghetto life , he pointed out well before the country 's recent riots proved his point , when at home a tenth of the workforce is out of work and young French Muslims are isolated in suburban tower blocks .
America , he argues , “ serves to console us about our own failures by sustaining the myth that things are even worse there — and that what is going wrong for us comes from them . ”
Thomas Friedman , a columnist for the New York Times , kicked up a stir among the French during the stand - off over Iraq when he declared that “ France is becoming our enemy . ”
But is it really hostile to America ?
America is , after all , one of the few western countries with which France has never been to war .
Even de Gaulle supported America during the Cuban missile crisis , and reminded a joint session of Congress of the two countries ' history of shared values .
The country that supposedly scorns American capitalism has spawned global companies that feed the American army ( Sodexho ) , fit tyres on American cars ( Michelin ) and put the gloss on American lips ( L'Oréal ) .
In many ways , France and America clash so often not because they are so irreconcilably different , but because they are so alike .
The modern French and American polities may have evolved quite differently , notably where the role of the state is concerned , but both emerged as highly codified , anti-clerical , secular republics .
Both — unlike the dissembling English — can articulate unapologetically what their country stands for .
Born of revolutions , America and France each established republics inspired by Enlightenment thinking , and based on freedom and individual rights .
Within the same year , 1789 , both the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the American Bill of Rights were drafted .
Above all , each nation believed in the universalism of its model — the Americans stressing liberty , the French civilisation — and shared an ambition to spread it abroad .
The conviction among the French elite that France represents an alternative to the American way runs deep .
It forms part of the national mythology that has helped to shore up French pride .
And it explains why the French so readily pick on America at times of self - doubt .
Just listen to Dominique de Villepin , the prime minister , who came to embody anti-American defiance .
“ What an honour to be French , ” he wrote in a recent book , “ loyal to a ... responsibility to bestow a conscience , a soul upon our Earth .
Our democracy was built upon the affirmation of universal values , ” he adds , and France 's destiny is to enact “ our universal and humanist dream ” .
Such florid romanticism may provoke derision on the other side of the Atlantic , never mind how closely it parallels Mr Bush 's belief in his duty to spread freedom .
But the basic point is keenly felt among the French governing class .
It echoes de Gaulle 's “ certain idea ” of France , “ dedicated to an exalted and exceptional destiny ” , 50 years ago .
This competitive instinct explains why anti-Americanism was the natural flipside to de Gaulle 's effort in the 1960s to turn Europe into a French - led superpower .
As with de Gaulle , so with his inheritors .
Romantic rivalry inspires Mr Chirac 's determination to create a “ multi- polar ” world , and his resistance to Mr Bush 's doctrine of unilateral pre-emption .
It explains France 's desire to keep its own spheres of influence , whether in Africa or the Arab world .
And , incidentally , it explains France 's eagerness to see off others whom it considers to be encroaching on its domain , notably the British , whose first attempts to join the European common market were vetoed by de Gaulle .
Moreover , defying the might of America is a form of muscular self - affirmation , to be contrasted with the unmanly British tendency to jump when American fingers click .
To be pro-American for long would emasculate .
After all , what is France for if not to represent an elegant , pleasurable alternative to the American way , even if it does so as most of the country munches its burgers and goggles at its trashy television ?
