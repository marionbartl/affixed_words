A lot of people — mainly but by no means exclusively Republicans — were on the Sunday shows yesterday denouncing the administration ’s decision to jail and try KSM and four accused 9/11 plotters in New York City .
And most of the criticism comes under three distinct but related arguments : 1 ) civilian trials give the defendants too many rights and protections and thus create too big a risk they ’ll get acquitted and set free , 2 ) holding the prisoners and trial in New York City puts the city ’s civilian population at unnecessary risk of new terror attacks , and 3 ) holding public , civilian trials will give the defendants an opportunity to mock the victims , have a platform to issue propaganda or gain public sympathy .
The first two arguments strike me as understandable but basically wrong on the facts .
The third I find difficult in some ways even to understand and seems grounded in bad political values or even ideological cowardice .
Let ’s start with the idea that civilian trials have too many safeguards and create too big a risk these guys will go free .
This does not hold up to any scrutiny for two reasons .
First , remember all those high - profile terror prosecutions where the defendants went free ?
Right , me neither .
It just does not happen .
The fact is that federal judges are extremely deferential to the government in terror prosecutions .
And national security law already gives the government the ability to do lots of things the government would never be allowed to do in a conventional civilian trial .
( People who really think this is an issue seem to base their understanding of federal criminal procedure on watching too many Dirty Harry movies , which , as it happens , I ’m actually a big fan of .
But remember , they ’re movies . )
KSM is not going to be able to depose or cross-examine CIA Director Leon Panetta or President Bush or Vice President Cheney or anyone else .
The possibility that a judge would suppress evidence obtained through torture is a real one .
But Eric
Holder made clear he and his prosecutors believe they have more than enough untainted evidence to obtain convictions .
So that should not be an issue .
Finally , even in the extremely unlikely case that any of the five were acquitted of these charges , the government has a hundred other things it can charge them with .
Indeed , the government could as easily turn them over to military commissions or indefinite detention post - acquittal as it can do those things with them now .
That may not make civil libertarians happy .
But it is the nail in the coffin of any suggestions that these guys are going to be walking out of the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan saying they ’re headed to Disneyland .
It ’s simply not going to happen .
( The best argument against what I ’ve argued here is probably the case of El Sayyid Nosair , the murderer of Jewish extremist leader Meir Kahane , who received a partial acquittal when he was tried in 1991 .
Here I would say that the case came prior to modern counter - terrorism law in the United States , which I ’d date to the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
And the Nosair example actually proves my larger point since a subsequent terrorism conspiracy trial got Nosair a life without parole plus fifteen year sentence , which he is now serving at the SuperMax facility in Florence , Colorado . )
We can imagine a different set of facts , where all the most damning evidence was obtained through torture , and acquittal seemed at all a reasonable possibility .
In that case there might be a real question as to whether it was worth taking the risk when military commissions which have been used in the past are available .
But this ‘ risk ’ simply does n’t appear to exist so you do not even need to get to the constitutional or deeper rule - of - law questions .
Next we have the question of danger to the people of New York City .
As I said in my first post on this question , just on the facts I do n’t think al Qaeda terrorists are holding off on attacking New York now because they lack or incentive or feel we have n’t pushed things far enough yet to merit another hit .
The symbolic value of hitting New York might increase a bit .
But it ’s already so high for these people that the increase seems notional at best .
And more to the point , I choose to trust the people already charged with keeping the city safe .
On a more general level , however , since when is it something we advertise or say proudly that we ’re going to change our behavior because we fear terrorists will attack us if we do n’t ?
To be unPC about it , is n’t there some residual national machismo that keeps us from cowering even before trivially increased dangers ?
As much as I think the added dangers are basically nil , I ’m surprised that people can stand up as say we should change what we do in response to some minuscule added danger and not be embarrassed .
And finally we come to the fear of what KSM and the others will say .
I do n’t see what factual dispute there is here .
And at some level I do n’t even understand the argument .
Logically I understand it ; I understand what they ’re saying .
But it ’s so contrary to my values and assumptions that at some level I do n’t get it .
I cannot imagine anything KSM or his confederates would say that would diminish America or damage us in any way .
Are we really so worried that what we represent is so questionable or our identity so brittle ?
( Some will say , yes : torture .
The fact that some of these men were tortured is a huge stain on the country .
But it happened and it ’s known about .
To the extent that it is a stain it is the kind of stain that is diminished not made worse by an open public accounting . )
Does anyone think that Nuremberg trials or the trial of Adolph Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 or the war crimes trials of Slobodan Milosevic and others at the Hague advanced these mens ’ causes ?
Or that , in retrospect , it would have been wiser to hold these trials in secret ?
At the end of the day , what are we afraid these men are going to say ?
What we seem to be forgetting here is that trials are not simply for judging guilt and meting out punishment .
We hold trials in public not only because we want a check on the government ’s behavior but because a key part of the exercise is a public accounting and condemnation of wrongs .
Especially in great trials for the worst crimes they are public displays pitting one set of values against another .
And I ’m troubled by anyone who thinks that this is a confrontation in which we would come out the worse .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Two U.S. money managers arrested in February on charges of running a $ 554 million fraud at their firm for more than a decade , have been indicted by a grand jury , according to court documents released on Friday .
Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh were charged with conspiracy , securities fraud , commodities fraud , two counts of wire fraud , and money laundering in the indictment in U.S. District Court in Manhattan .
U.S. prosecutors are demanding that the men forfeit at least $ 131 million of investor money they received in the purported conspiracy at WG Trading and WG Investors between 1996 and February this year , according to the court papers .
“ These payments were directed to Greenwood and Walsh , to members of their families , to various entities that they or their family members controlled , and / or to persons and entities for goods including antiques and collectibles and services , ” the indictment said .
The money managers of the Greenwich , Connecticut company oversaw assets of institutional investors including Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania .
Lawyers for Greenwood and Walsh could not immediately be reached for comment .
The accused have been out on bail since their arrest in February while the investigation proceeds .
The indictment said that Greenwood and Walsh issued promissory notes of a combined $ 554 million to WG investors to conceal their misappropriation of funds “ and the fact that neither WG Trading nor WG Investors was profitable . ”
On Tuesday , the firm ’s former chief compliance officer pleaded guilty to criminal charges of illegally transferring more than $ 100 million to chief financial officer Greenwood and chief executive officer Walsh .
Under a plea agreement Deborah Duffy , 54 , who worked for 18 years for the Greenwich , Connecticut , company , will be required to cooperate with prosecutors .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also brought civil charges against the money managers in February .
Both are former part owners of the New York Islanders National Hockey League Team .
A Portland attorney who has filed multi-million dollar lawsuits over the years on behalf of hundreds of adults who claimed they were sexually abused as children said Sunday night he plans to file similar lawsuits Monday morning in three states .
The suits allege abuse by the Mormon Church and the Boy Scouts in San Francisco , Portland and Seattle , said Kelly Clark , who has represented victims of Jesuit priest abuse .
Clark alleges three boys were allegedly abused in San Francisco , one in Portland and another in Seattle , all while participating in the Boy Scouts .
He said the Boy Scout program has been a part of the Mormon church 's official men's program for decades .
" There is a close connection , " Clark said .
" The Mormon church sponsors 50 percent of the Boy Scout troops in the Western United States . "
Oregon church leaders were unavailable for comment .
The operator at the national headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints in Salt Lake City , Utah , said no one would be available to discuss the suits until Monday .
Clark said he planned to file the first suit in San Francisco and then travel north Monday to Portland and then Seattle .
Clark said the alleged abuse took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
He claimed the alleged abuse occurred over a period of years .
The Baltimore Orioles have had such a horrid run since 1997 that it ’s not surprising that the occasional out - of - town sportswriter will churn out a story that suggests , all evidence to the contrary , that the O ’s do indeed have a bright future .
It ’s a swell fairy tale , one that I ’ve fallen prey to previously , as recently as last summer , but the stark reality is that Baltimore ’s baseball fans have as much reason for optimism as their counterparts in Pittsburgh and Kansas City .
Maybe less , considering the team is still owned by Peter Angelos .
( If only Cal Ripken Jr. could head a consortium to buy the Birds , the clucking on message boards says , then the O ’s would be in business !
Truth be told , I could n’t agree more . )
The Yankees just completed a three - game shellacking of the O’s at Camden Yards — scores were 5 - 1 , 9 - 6 and 10 - 2 — and while the Team That Jeter Built ( the Yanks veteran , at 35 , is having a terrific season , and , by my reckoning , is a lock for the American League MVP , more for “ lifetime achievement ” than actual performance , as the Twins ’ Joe Mauer deserves the award ) unfortunately appears to be riding a wave that will lead to a November parade on Broadway after winning the World Series , Baltimore ’s woes are far deeper than just dropping their last three games .
On Tuesday , New York Times beat reporter Tyler Kepner , published a story headlined “ Yet Another Year Pains the Orioles , but This Time There is Hope , ” that I ’m pretty sure was sincere .
But Kepner , a fine baseball writer , just does n’t follow the team enough to see that the cornerstone of O ’s optimism — the young pitchers Brad Bergesen , Chris Tillman and Brian Matusz , along with the superb right fielder Nick Markakis — is n’t nearly enough to get the team to .500 next year or even in 2011 .
Bergesen , for example , was impressive this season ( until he went down with an injury ) and for my money , the best of the lot .
Nonetheless , even when he took the mound , maybe leaving after giving up three runs in six innings , the O ’s bullpen is so atrocious that you can never put a “ W ” on the scorecard until the final inning is completed .
Baltimore Sun sportswriter and blogger Peter Schmuck is more realistic , joking that even he , once the Ravens ’ season gets going , will be an infrequent visitor to Camden Yards .
Schmuck also made the blunt observation that O ’s manager Dave Trembley wo n’t be around to see his prized youngsters progress ( or , as in the past , probably not ) .
Reacting to the team ’s president of baseball operations Andy MacPhail ’s decision to shut down Tillman and Matusz for the rest of the season , Schmuck wrote on Sept.
2 : “ The only real question is what this means for Dave Trembley , whose future as manager was supposed to depend — in large part — on whether the young Orioles showed noticeable improvement over the final two months of the season .
If that is still the barometer for his job security , then Trembley is a dead manager walking , and MacPhail has paved his road out of town with a series of decisions that have made it next to impossible for the club to avoid another end - of - season collapse . ”
My only quibble with Schmuck ’s analysis is that the ( annual ) collapse began after the All - Star break .
( At least Schmuck , one of the few Sun sports survivors after a mass purge by parent company Tribune several months ago , has n’t lost his sense of humor , either about his newspaper or the baseball team he covers .
In his blog on Sept. 2 , he quipped , “ In case you missed it , or all the copies of today ’s print edition are sold out in your area , I ’ve got a column up today … ” )
Trembley , I ’m betting , gets canned a day or two after the season ends .
On the one hand , I feel bad for the guy , who toiled in the minor league sewers for some 20 years before getting tapped for the O ’s job in ‘ 07 ; on the other , he ’s a humorless fellow who is simply lost when it comes to making strategic pitching decisions .
Trembley told Kepner that there ’s a “ sense of pr ide ” emanating from his squad ’s clubhouse , which is pretty weird since the O’s are going to finish last ( again ) in their division and probably lose 95 games .
I go to a lot of games at Camden Yards ( even though I ’m a Red Sox fan , which has its own drawbacks this year , the O ’s park is still a great place to see baseball , and it ’s affordable and not far from my house ) , and it ’s difficult to see that “ pride ” on the field .
Last Sunday afternoon , for example , even in a 5 - 2 victory over the Indians , most of the team seemed lethargic and going through the motions .
When Adam Jones ( now injured and probably out for the season ) , by all rights a five - tool player , took a half - hearted route on a ball hit to dead - center , and muffed it , my wife — an O ’s fan who has a Jones t- shirt — stood up and screamed , “ You ’re a disgrace , Adam Jones ! ” it caused one of our sons and me to take notice of this uncharacteristic vehemence .
Veteran Melvin Mora ’s done with the team after this year , but he loafs as well , as does — and sorry for the heresy , O ’s diehards — Brian Roberts , who was foolishly signed to an extension through 2013 , even though he ’s 31 and has previously expressed ambivalence about playing for a perennial loser .
Finally , and although this is apropos of nothing more than the general lack of cultural interest among baseball players , when one of those dumb in - between quizzes was flashed on the Jumbotron that Sunday , I just shook my head in disbelief .
Nine Orioles players were asked what singer they preferred , Neil Young or Neil Diamond , who are roughly the same age and were performing before the athletes were born .
Six of the nine chose the unspeakable Diamond over Young , which would be the rough equivalent of six Orioles in ’69 picking Lawrence Welk over Bob Dylan .
Jim Johnson may not have a future as the Orioles ’ closer , but at least , unlike rookie sensation ( still a work in progress as a catcher ) Matt Wieters , he apparently prefers “ Keep on Rocking in the Free World ” to “ You Do n’t Bring Me Flowers . ”
As does Brad Bergesen , which leads me to believe , without any baseball horse sense whatsoever , that he ’ll be a star .
And then leave for a contending team as soon as he can .

Advertisement Mexico's Ciudad Juarez is one of the world 's most dangerous cities , plagued by battles between drug gangs .
A BBC team witnessed its violence at first hand on a police patrol , as Ian Sherwood reports .
The sun sets early now that winter is approaching .
It is nearly 1800 and Ciudad Juarez has already descended into darkness .
We drive up to Estacion Delicias police station , where all is quiet .
As we approach a busy roundabout , there is a white Suzuki jeep surrounded by armed police in the middle of the road
I explain that we are here to spend the evening on patrol with the municipal police .
We are escorted to a marked police vehicle , which pulls away at high speed .
The police lights flash .
There is no siren and it is not clear where we are going as the vehicle zips through the streets of Juarez .
A few minutes later we stop .
On average , seven people have been killed each day in Ciudad Juarez in 2009
In front of us a car is surrounded by people , including several police officers , some of whom have their faces concealed with black masks .
Suddenly it becomes clear why Ciudad Juarez has the label of being the world 's most dangerous city .
The body of a man is slumped in the front passenger seat of the car .
He has been shot several times in the chest .
Paramedics arrive and he is pronounced dead .
His wife is standing close by , holding her infant daughter .
She breaks down as she tells us that it is her husband inside the car .
The police seal off the area with tape .
The bullet casings are marked out close to the car .
As the investigation into this murder gets under way we are told that there has been another killing close by .
After being ushered into the police vehicle once more we pull away .
Last rites
As we approach a busy roundabout , there is a white Suzuki jeep surrounded by armed police in the middle of the road .
As we get closer , a body clearly is visible , loosely covered by a blue coat .
One of the headlines in the local newspaper here reads : " More people are murdered here than in Iraq "
Mexican city sees record murders
We get out of the police vehicle and approach the officers to be told that two people have been killed .
The second victim is inside the car .
There are several bullet holes in the driver 's side window at the front of the car , a further bullet hole has penetrated the back window of the car .
Many bullet casings are scattered on the road , glinting under the street lights .
In the distance we see a priest approaching the body in the road .
He kneels down and administers the last rites to the victim and then he walks away .
Some police officers take photographs of the scene , vehicles pass on the busy road next to us and some buses pass by carrying children .
They hang out of the windows of the bus trying to make sense of what they have seen .
Cries of grief
Rocks are placed next to the bullet casings in the road .
An elderly man is escorted to the body , he crouches down close , a police officer pulls back the blue coat and the man holds his face in his hands and weeps .
Friends and relatives of the dead fill the scene with cries of grief
He has just identified the body of his seven - year - old grandson , Jaciel Ramirez .
The man in car is his 28 - year - old son , Raul .
The elderly man then calmly crosses the street , where he is greeted by his wife .
She cries out loudly after her husbands tells her the news .
She is comforted by a friend , as she asks : " What has he done to deserve this " ?
More relatives and friends come to the scene , the air is filled with cries of grief .
One girl screams the boy 's name as she tries to get closer to his body .
She is held back by the police and is then consoled by a man who embraces her .
We do not yet have the answers as to why these people were murdered .
On this one evening on these streets 15 people were killed , their names are added to a growing list of nearly 2,000 who have been murdered in Juarez so far this year .
One of the headlines in the local newspaper here reads : " More people are murdered here than in Iraq " .
In Ciudad Juarez a taskforce of thousands of federal army soldiers , federal police and municipal police patrol the streets under direct orders from the president of Mexico to bring the violence under control .
The people of this city are asking why they are still not safe ?

( CNN ) --
A man arrested in connection with the 1990 abduction , rape and attempted murder of an 8 - year - old girl appeared before a judge Thursday on an attempted capital murder charge , according to CNN affiliate KTRK .
Dennis Earl Bradford , a 40 - year - old welder , was arrested after DNA tied him to the crime , police say .
Dennis Earl Bradford waived his right to a court - appointed attorney when he appeared Thursday , saying he would retain his own .
For security reasons , the hearing was held at the Galveston ( Texas ) County Jail and not in a courtroom , the station reported .
The judge ordered Bradford to undergo a physical and mental evaluation and set bail at $ 1 million .
His next court appearance was set for Wednesday , according to KTRK .
Upon conviction , an attempted capital murder charge could result in a sentence of life in prison .
Bradford , a 40 - year - old welder , was arrested early Tuesday in Little Rock , Arkansas , in connection with the 1990 incident involving Jennifer Schuett , who was abducted from her bedroom , raped and left for dead in Dickinson , Texas .
Schuett shared her story with CNN two weeks ago in hope of someday bringing her attacker to justice .
CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assault , but Schuett decided to go public with her story to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker .
" It 's not about me anymore , " she told CNN in September .
" It 's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night .
I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt .
You have to fight back . "
Bradford 's arrest came after DNA and other forensic tests led police to him , authorities said .
" This is a huge day for me , " Schuett told CNN on Tuesday .
" And I want to see this through the end .
The rest will come out during the trial . "
Schuett said she was alone in her bed August 10 , 1990 , when a man crept in through a window .
She remembers waking up in a stranger 's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot .
She said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family .
He drove her through the streets of Dickinson , pulling into a mechanic 's shop next to her elementary school .
" Watch the moon .
The moon will change colors , and that is when your mom will come to get you , " she recalled him saying .
" Oh , it looks like she is not coming . "
Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and sexually assaulted her .
She passed out .
When she regained consciousness , she was lying naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear and her voice box torn .
She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day after lying in the field for nearly 12 hours .
She was rushed to a hospital in critical condition .
" Three days after the attack , I started giving a description .
The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again , but I proved them all wrong , " Schuett said .
She believes that she got her voice back so she could tell her story .
Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case , along with Dickinson Police Detective Tim Cromie .
Both men were discussing the case when Rennison received a memo from the FBI 's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment ( CARD ) team , seeking child abduction cases that had gone cold and could be retested for DNA evidence .
Schuett 's was one of the cases selected .
" This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived , " Rennison said .
" The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive .
In cases of child abduction , it is rare that the child is recovered alive .
Frequently , you recover a body .
And most times , you never find them . "
The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago , which was retested .
It included the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing , as well as a man 's underwear and T - shirt , which were found in the field where Schuett was found .
The clothes were tested in 1990 , but the sample was n't large enough for conclusive results .
But now , modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell .
They were still awaiting the results when CNN featured Schuett 's story in late September .
CNN 's Mayra Cuevas - Nazario contributed to this report .

Mark it on your calendars folks … on September 10th Motorola is holding an Android related event in San Francisco that could be one of the most epic announcements of 2009 :
If you did n’t know , Motorola has FOUR Android Phones churning in the rumor mill :
At least one of these will see the light of day and given recent events , I would n’t be surprised if Motorola unveils both the Sholes and Morrison at this event .
Regardless of what they unveil its pretty unbelievable that the day of Motorola Android reckoning is in our official crosshairs !!!
A long time ago we knew that Motorola wanted to leverage Android to revive the company ’s handset division .
They have devoted a TON of resources to their Android efforts and now , in 2 weeks , we ’re going to see the fruits of their labor .
The whole world will be watching Motorola on September 10th and I think its safe to say that anyone with an interest in mobile should be pretty darn excited about the potential devices and announcements .
Does anyone else feel like a kid before Christmas at the moment ?
VG , one of Norway ’s largest newspapers published a test the other day – what they think of different abroad passport controls .
How was their first impression of a country .
I found it very amusing and could n’t resist trying to translate it and share it with you .
Sorry about my English and grammar and I think this was supposed to be read with a pinch of humor .
Heres what they wrote ( with points from 1 ( bad ) to 6 ( very good ) ) :
Donald Sangster International Airport , Montego Bay – Jamaica
Points : 6
Swift and friendly , neat information in the passport control area .
A real sunshine reggae !
“ We pass in 10 minutes despite that 3 fully loaded planes were let in at the same time ” .
Beautiful posters with information fills the area .
Large windows with fantastic view of warm Caribbean paradise .
“ Welcome to Jamaica – home of Usain Bolt and Shelly - Ann Fraser – it should be : “ Welcome to Jamaica – home to the most effective and pleasant border guards ” .
Forgotten is the crowded plane that took us here , forgotten is the sour wind and loud experience in pass control in USA .

Heathrow ( Terminal 3 ) , London – Great Britain
Points : 3
You have to walk far and further than far .
Else not that bad – if you have the correct color on your passport .
The difference on how you are being treated is huge – depending if you ’re from EU / EEA or if you ’re going through the more intesive control into the old empire .
The border guards has no appearent interest studying Norwegian id - papers , even a fully loaded SAS - plane is let through in a hurry in the carpet filled hallway and into baggage claim and train .
Those who , on the other hand , have to fill out arrivalcards and talk to an inspector should bring food and water .
Those lines get incredible long in the worn down terminal 3 , where they do n’t use all the desks .
The walk from the plane to the passport control also decrease it ’s score .
Its long , less tidy and the interior is everything else than beautiful .
PS !
British Airways is now using terminal 5 , a far more comfortable environment there than this .

Borispol International Airport , Kiev – Ukraina
Points : 3
“ The one who makes you smile ” is J - Lo singing on the large monitor , but its not affecting the border guards .
The scene is absurd ; a slightly undressed Jennifer Lopez wiggles on the large ceiling monitor , serious guards with large gold - covered shoulders and both legs safely planted on the floor .
“ The way you smile … it drives me wild … ” ..
No smiles are detected in the dust gray faces , the faces that welcome tourists to Kiev .
No spasiba , no welcome , nothing .
Non existent knowledge of English and armed members of the Ukrainian army also contribute to a sad Borispol - airport experience .
But if you ignore the sad faces the system is surprisingly alike the soviet bureaucracy .
The lines shortens swiftly , even in the middle of the night , only two arrivals the last 30 minutes probably should be credited for that .
Even if you do n’t need visa a “ prefilled ” immigration form is a must .
We experienced that the field ’s content was n’t very important as long as they were filled .
The worst ?
Its more scary to be offered a taxi outside Borispol than getting drug - offers in Oslo in the middle of the night .

Newark Liberty Airport , New York – USA
Points : 2
Is USA getting safer by having angry border guards ?
If you fly in towards New York on a clear weather day you can’t avoid noticing that theres still a few buildings missing on the city ’s skyline .
Its a fair reminder of why USA have so many strict security measures that , for us , seem a bit odd .
On the Newark - airport at least 10 “ trainhost - uniforms ” had a dedicated job guiding us to the desk with the shortest line .
They executed their job in such eager that most of the passengers were confused and walked into the wrong line .
When it was our turn the man in the desk went to eat lunch .
The angry “ trainhosts ” immediately stepped up and chased us to a different line , in the back of it .
At this desk a lady sat barfing “ next ! ” to each passenger .
No trace of “ please ” here , as we learned about in our English lessons .
The lady stamped here and there , captured portrait photo and fingerprints and asked the questions she is instructed to do ( without listening to the answers ) .
Puh !
We passed the test !

They are adding to this test as they go , if you like I ’ll update this post as well .
Link to the Norwegian article : VG .
Keeping track of time is one of the brain 's most important tasks .
As the brain processes the flood of sights and sounds it encounters , it must also remember when each event occurred .
But how does that happen ?
How does your brain recall that you brushed your teeth before you took a shower , and not the other way around ?
For decades , neuroscientists have theorized that the brain " time stamps " events as they happen , allowing us to keep track of where we are in time and when past events occurred .
However , they could n't find any evidence that such time stamps really existed — until now .
An MIT team led by Institute Professor Ann Graybiel has found groups of neurons in the primate brain that code time with extreme precision .
" All you do is time stamp everything , and then recalling events is easy : you go back and look through your time stamps until you see which ones are correlated with the event , " she says .
That kind of precise timing control is critical for everyday tasks such as driving a car or playing the piano , as well as keeping track of past events .
The discovery , reported in this week 's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , could lead to new treatments for diseases such as Parkinson 's disease , where the ability to control the timing of movements is impaired .
Construction of time
The research team trained two macaque monkeys to perform a simple eye - movement task .
After receiving the " go " signal , the monkeys were free to perform the task at their own speed .
The researchers found neurons that consistently fired at specific times — 100 milliseconds , 110 milliseconds , 150 milliseconds and so on — after the " go " signal .
" Soon enough we realized we had cells keeping time , which everyone has wanted to find , but nobody has found them before , " says Graybiel , who is also an investigator in MIT 's McGovern Institute for Brain Research .
The neurons are located in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum , both of which play important roles in learning , movement and thought control .
The new work is an elegant demonstration of how the brain represents time , says Peter Strick , professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh , who was not involved in the research .
" We have sensory receptors for light , sound , touch , hot and cold , and smell , but we do n't have sensory receptors for time .
This is a sense constructed by the brain , " he says .
Key to the team 's success was a new technique that allows researchers to record electrical signals from hundreds of neurons in the brain simultaneously , and a mathematical way to analyze the brain signals , spearheaded by team members Naotaka Fujii of the RIKEN Brain Institute in Japan and Dezhe Jin of Penn State .
Though this study focused on the prefrontal cortex and striatum , Graybiel says she expects other regions of the brain may also have neurons that keep time .
Graybiel suggests that the new research could help patients with Parkinson 's disease , who often behave as if their brains ' timekeeping functions are impaired : they have trouble performing tasks that require accurate rhythm , such as dancing , and time appears to pass more slowly for them .
Rhythmic stimuli such as tapping can help them to speak more clearly .
Targeting the timekeeping neurons with neural prosthetic devices or drugs — possibly including the natural brain chemicals dopamine and serotonin — may help treat those Parkinson 's symptoms , she says .
Future studies in this area could shed light on how the brain produces these time stamps and how this function can control behavior and learning .
The work also raises questions regarding how the brain interprets the passage of time differently under different circumstances .
" Sometimes time moves quickly , and in some situations time seems to slow down .
All of this ultimately has a neural representation , " says Strick .

In response to my last post , readers left several provocative comments on the profits earned by commercial health insurance companies — provocative in the sense that they provoke me to elaborate .
I propose to do so in this and next week ’s post .
Tom Bloom
In this week ’s post , I shall walk the reader through the most recent income statement of WellPoint Inc .
Before proceeding , readers may wish to click on this link shown above and print out the income statement .
That statement is fairly typical of a large insurer selling mainly group - insurance policies to relatively large employers .
WellPoint Inc. was formed from the merger of two companies that were once known as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana and Blue Cross of California , both originally not - for - profit plans .
It is now one of the nation ’s largest commercial health insurers .
Income statements are part of the annual reports called a 10 - K that every publicly traded company must submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The virtue of the 10 - K is that it is fully audited by the company ’s external auditors , formally approved by the board , certified to be accurate by the firm ’s chief executive and chief financial officer , and strictly supervised for accuracy and honest disclosure by the S.E.C. — at least in principle .
A firm ’s 10 - K is a fascinating read in its own right , as it reveals much of the bowels of a company , including the business risks it faces and executive compensation .
Revenues : According to WellPoint ’s income statement for 2008 , the company ’s total revenue that year was $ 61,579.2 million .
Of that , 93.2 percent came from premium revenues , and 6.3 percent came from fees for merely administering the claims of employers who self - insure ( that is , these firms set aside their own funds for their employees ’ health benefits and bear full risk for them ) .
Revenue From the “ Float ” : About 1 percent of WellPoint ’s total revenue came from a category simply called “ other revenue . ”
For the most part this probably comes from interest earned on the “ float . ”
An insurer ’s “ float ” is the money temporarily on hand when premium payments come in earlier than the outlays for insurance claims covered by these premiums .
In times when interest rates are high , an insurer ’s float can be a major source of revenue , which is why sometimes health insurers stand accused of deliberately dragging out claims processing , strictly to increase the size of the float at any point in time .
As the Federal Reserve has lowered short - term interest rates to close to zero , however , the interest earned on an insurer ’s float is now trivial — as it is in Well Point ’s case — meaning that more costs must be recovered through premiums .
The Health Benefit Ratio ( alias Medical Loss Ratio ) : WellPoint ’s payments for health benefits in 2008 equal the sum of what it calls “ health benefits ” ( $ 47,742.4 million ) and the “ cost of drugs ” ( $ 468.5 million ) .
Together these health benefits came to $ 48,210.9 million .
As a fraction of total premium revenue of $ 57,101.0 million in 2008 , total health benefits amounted to 84.4 percent of premium revenue .
Traditionally , actuaries had called this fraction the medical loss ratio ( M.L.R. ) , because it represents what insurers “ lose , ” so to speak , to doctors , hospitals and other providers of health care .
Because that terminology comes across as indelicate , however , the preferred term now is the mellower health benefit ratio ( H.B.R. ) .
Marketing and Administrative Expenses , or S.G.&A. : The firm ’s total marketing ( selling ) expenses for 2008 were $ 1,778.4 million .
General administrative expenses were $ 7,242.1 million .
The sum of these two items goes by the acronym “ S.G.&A . ” One should relate these S.G.&A. expenses not just to premium revenue , but also to total revenue .
In this case , S.G.&A. expenses amounted to 14.7 percent of total revenue in 2008 .
The Profit Margin : WellPoint ’s net income ( profits ) after all expenses and the provision for income taxes in 2008 was 4.07 percent of total revenue .
In accounting jargon , it is called the “ profit margin . ”
In 2007 , that margin had been 5.47 percent .
In 2006 it was 5.42 percent .
Were WellPoint ’s profits in 2008 high ?
It depends how we look at it .
Profits were not that big a deal as a fraction of premium revenue .
S.G.&A. expenses typically are a far bigger enchilada worthy of attention .
It is here that the health insurance industry is being challenged to search for economies .
As a percentage of total assets of $ 48,403.2 million deployed by the company ( measured at the reported book value on the firm ’s balance sheet ) , WellPoint ’s profits in 2008 amounted to 5.14 percent in 2008 and 6.42 percent in 2007 .
As a percentage of the equity shareholders had in WellPoint ( also measured at the book values reported by accountants ) , WellPoint ’s profits in were 11.62 percent in 2008 and 14.55 percent in 2007 .
Relative to other industries , these are not particularly high numbers , nor are they particularly low .
By examining the income statements of other insurers , readers can verify for themselves that the percentages calculated above do vary for a given company over time and also among different companies at any point in time .
The comparable income statement of Aetna , Inc. ( stock ticker symbol AET ) can be found here .
The link to the remarkably cryptic profit and loss statements of UnitedHealth Group ( stock ticker symbol UNH ) is here .
In next week ’s post , I intend to explore how the add-ons for marketing , administration and profits on top of expected outlays for health care to set the insurance premiums can be astonishingly high for individually sold policies .
Up to half the premium can go for these non-medical items .
It is the reason why that market urgently needs to reformed .

ILM staff spent months researching real flames to see how they moved Technology and movie - making have always gone hand in hand but the latest breakthroughs are changing the very nature of the process .
Those in the industry say that thanks to the role of graphics processing units ( GPUs ) , the director 's vision can be more fully realised .
It also means that special effects teams are involved in the making of the movie at a far earlier stage .
In the past , their creations would be done in post - production and not be seen for weeks or even months after a movie has wrapped .
All that is changing thanks to the GPU , according to leading industry players like Richard Kerris , chief technology officer of Lucasfilm , part of Industrial Light and Magic ( ILM ) .
The GPU is a specialised graphics processor that creates lighting effects and transforms objects every time a 3D scene is redrawn .
These tasks are mathematically intensive and in the past were done using the brains of a computer known as the central processing unit or CPU .
ILM was started by Star Wars director George Lucas , and is the biggest special effects studio in the business and behind blockbusters like E.T. , Star Trek , Terminator , Harry Potter , Transformers and M Night Shyamalan 's soon - to - be- released fantasy The Last Airbender .
" The advent of the GPU is really the next big frontier for us .
We have seen hundreds of times improvements over the last few months .
This is taking Moore 's Law out the window , " Mr Kerris told BBC News .
" Back in the day , the simplest of special effects rendering took a lot of computing power and a 500 - square - foot room back then that really would n't operate our phone systems today .
" But , the talent and the understanding of what could be done out of that was able to produce movies like Terminator .
It was cutting - edge stuff and getting a computer that was the size of a small automobile to render out simulations of a twister was pretty groundbreaking then , " said Mr Kerris .
Speed is key
At the heart of what the GPU does is speed , according to Dominick Spina , product manager for Nvidia , the company that invented the technology .
The Terminator T - 1000 liquid metal shape shifter still wows audiences " This is a big leap and the amount of data that can be crunched , analysed and documented can be done a lot faster on the GPU than the CPU .
On certain simulations , we are talking a 100 - 200 times improvement , " said Mr Spina .
With that kind of acceleration , Dr Jon Peddie , president of Jon Peddie Research says directors are no longer limited by the technology .
" A movie operates at 24 frames a second , and it takes for one of these extraordinary movies that we see anywhere from as few as 12 to as many as 24 hours for one frame .
" So now you have 24 days for a second 's worth of film .
By using the GPU for this rendering , you can literally reduce that to one 1,000th of what is was .
So if it was say 24 hours to do the job , now you can do it in 24 seconds .
" GPU computing is on the cusp of transforming a major part of the computing industry , " claimed analyst Rob Enderle , president of the Enderle Group .
" This is to supercomputers what PC's were to mainframes , and I doubt the world will ever be the same again . "
' Making the impossible possible '
From a creative standpoint , studios say the technology has been a real boon .
" With this system , the creative process has been transformed from tedious to fun , " said Rob Bredow , chief technology officer for Sony Pictures Imageworks , which used Nvidia 's GPU to make " Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs . "
Animators created 80 different kinds of food for the movie " When an artist can do 10 times as many iterations of an effect in the same amount of time , the quality of the end product will be that much better .
Renders that would have taken 45 minutes or more to run on a CPU , are now cut down to 45 seconds , " he said .
Mr Kerris from LucasFilm is in total agreement .
" In the past , a lot of times the director would say ' I want this kind of effect ' and the team would go away , do their work and a year later come back with it and if it was n't what you as a director wanted , then the whole process had to get re-instated .
" We are just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of experimentation but already we have seen the impact on some of the films we worked on this summer like Harry Potter .
" There was a final scene at the end of the film that had to do with fire and Dumbledore moving the fire around his head .
When the director saw that he could actually direct the fire , he expanded that entire scene so it became a much more prominent scene in the film , " explained Mr Kerris .
" GPUs are making the impossible possible in movies , bringing anything from swirling tornadoes to fiery infernos to the big screen , " said Nvidia 's Mr Spina .
" In the past movies dominated by crazy water , weather and fire effects were nearly impossible to make regardless of budget or timeframe ; with the advent of the GPU , artists are able to make these visions a reality . "
Story telling
So what does the future of this technology hold ?
" In the next 6 - 8 months you will see some major films with some incredibly big scenes that are primarily done through GPU's .
We are talking about taking it to a new level and doing it in a way where it wo n't take two years to do , " said Mr Kerris .
Digitally adding Iron Man 's armour later let the actor concentrate on acting " Beyond that , I think GPU 's will start to play a part in the home environment .
You could hypothesise that a GPU could offload some stuff from the TV processor to give real - time overlays and graphics and data say with a sports game or show .
" You are going to see amazing new amusement centres , virtual reality and augmented reality .
All these things will exploit the GPU on a more personal basis , " said Dr Peddie .
" We take our mobile phone and with augmented reality we experience the world in a different way .
The power of the GPU does that for us .
We are at a tipping point , " said Dr Peddie .
But at the end of the day , Mr Kerris stressed that when it comes to the movies , all the whizz - bang technology is worth nothing if the story is not up to scratch .
" George Lucas founded the different divisions of Lucasfilm not for technology 's sake .
In fact he is a very non -tech person .
For him technology is a means to an end and it is always the story that counts , " stressed Mr Kerris .

Under a bill being drafted by Democratic Reps. Peter DeFazio ( Ore. ) and Ed Perlmutter ( Colo . ) , the sale and purchase of financial instruments such as stocks , options , derivatives and futures would face a 0.25 percent tax .
The bill , a copy of which was obtained by The Hill , is titled the “ Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Act of 2009 . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Half of the $ 150 billion in tax revenue would go toward reducing the deficit , while the other half would be deposited in a “ Job Creation Reserve ” to support new jobs .
The job fund would be available to offset the additional costs of the 2009 highway bill and other legislation that creates jobs .
The Obama administration and congressional Democrats are looking for ways to create jobs after the nation ’s unemployment rate hit 10.2 percent in October and job losses are expected to rise .
House leaders have mentioned the possibility of a tax on stock transactions , but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) appeared to raise questions about the approach last week .
Pelosi said such a move would need to be done in conjunction with efforts in other countries .
“ Obviously , we have to work with leadership on this , ” said Leslie Oliver , spokeswoman for Perlmutter .
“ It has a long way to go , but the idea is to stir debate … We think this is one idea that makes a lot of sense .
” The stock tax measure specifies that tax revenue would need to support jobs that pay at least the median wage in the United States , promotes manufacturing jobs and prohibits any recipient of the $ 700 billion financial bailout from directly benefiting from the job reserve fund .
The bill aims to exempt retirement accounts from the impact of the tax .
A group of consumer watchdog organizations and labor unions sent DeFazio a letter this week supporting the tax bill .
“ Your bill would put Wall Street to work for the public good , by placing a modest securities transaction tax on trades of stocks , options and swaps .
A tax on these trades has little impact on the average investor or pension fund because they hold their investments for the long term , but it does disincentivize Wall Street gambling and high - volume short - term speculative trading , ” the organizations wrote .
The groups include : Americans for Financial Reform , Public Citizen , the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) and the AFL - CIO , among others .

Now enter the below video / teaser .
A teaser that looks like another Tim Burton - style film , but it is not at all .
In fact , I was n't able to actually prove this was a clip from EA for the new game .
It originally showed up on a youtube channel that is not EA 's official youtube channel .
But in any instance , it looks good and creepy as the game should be .
Although if it is the real deal , it is a bit short and ends with a 2011 time frame for the game .
Take a watch and see what you think for yourself .
Pupils were asked to occasionally bring their own toilet paper
A cash - strapped school in County Cork has asked pupils to bring in their own toilet paper .
Parents of pupils at St John 's Girls National School in Carrigaline received a letter with the request last week .
Principal Catherine O'Neill wrote : " Dear parent , from time to time we will request your daughter to bring in a toilet roll to her class teacher .
" These rolls will be specifically for your daughter 's class and will be dispensed by the class teacher . "
She added : " We would also request that your daughter has tissues in her sack at all times . "
The Republic of Ireland 's public finances have been battered in the economic downturn , and education has not escaped unscathed .
Ms O'Neill said the voluntary measure was taken because of cutbacks .
" We are endeavouring to trim down expenses and ensure we use our grants towards the educational needs of your child , " she said .
The notoriously poor quality of some school toilet paper has long been the butt of many jokes , but the move angered some parents who expressed surprise that the school had been caught short of funding .

Yahoo paid $ 3.57bn for GeoCities in 1999
A service that gave many people their first taste of building and owning a web page is set to close .
Yahoo - owned GeoCities once boasted millions of users and was the third most popular destination on the web .
The free site has since fallen out of fashion with users , who have switched to social networks .
Yahoo , which acquired the site for $ 3.57 bn ( £ 2.17bn ) in 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom , said sites would no longer be accessible from 26th October .
' Fascinating experiment '
However , many of the pages have been archived and will still be available to view via the nonprofit Internet Archive project .
The giant digital library , which has been archiving the public web since 1996 , has set up a special project to archive GeoCities before it is lost forever .
" We 've collected a lot of GeoCities sites over the years - but might not have every site and every page , " the Internet Archive said .
It is asking for GeoCities users to check whether their site has been archived before Yahoo pulls the plug .
" GeoCities has been an important outlet for personal expression on the web for almost 15 years , " it said .
A number of firms - including Yahoo - have also tried to woo GeoCities users to move their pages to paid - for hosting services .
GeoCities started life in 1995 as Beverly Hills Internet , a small web - hosting firm .
The company allowed users to host their web pages in themed cities .
For example , " WallStreet " hosted business related sites , whilst " SiliconValley " was used to host computer and technology sites .
Users , known as homesteaders , could build and host their own sites in these online spaces .
At its peak , the site had millions of users .
In April this year , Yahoo said that it was closing the site and would now focus on helping " customers build new relationships online " .
When Yahoo announced the end of the site earlier this year , Rupert Goodwins , editor of the ZDNet website , said it was the end of an era .
" I think GeoCities was the first proof that you could have something really popular and still not make any money on the internet .
" It was a fascinating experiment in the pre-industrial era of the internet . "

Psystar just got what 's coming to them in the California case .
Here 's the order [ PDF ] .
It 's a total massacre .
Psystar 's first - sale defense went down in flames .
Apple 's motion for summary judgment on copyright infringement and DMCA violation is granted .
Apple prevailed also on its motion to seal .
Psystar 's motion for summary judgment on trademark infringement and trade dress is denied .
So is its illusory motion for copyright misuse .
There are still issues remaining for trial , despite Psystar 's attempt to present everything now as being moot .
Here 's what 's left to be decided at trial : Apple 's allegations of breach of contract ; induced breach of contract , trademark infringement ; trademark dilution ; trade dress infringement ; and state unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code § 17200 ; and common law unfair competition .
See anything on that list that will be helpful to Psystar ?
So that means damages ahead for Psystar on the copyright issues just decided on summary judgment , at a minimum .
The court asked for briefs on that subject .
In short , Psystar is toast .
Psystar 's only hope now is Florida , and frankly I would n't bet the house on that one .
Judges notice if you were just found guilty of a similar cause of action in another state .
You 're surprised ?
I told you , I told you , I told you .
So , to those who feel crushed at the moment , there could be an appeal , I suppose .
And if you want freedom for your code , you certainly can find it on Planet Earth .
Look in the right direction .
You 'll be happy you did , because you can hack away to your heart 's content , and it 's perfectly legal .
The court 's message is clear : EULAs mean what they say ; if you do n't want to abide by its license , leave Apple 's stuff alone .
We have the order for you as text .
On the first sale defense , you 'll find it in the section on distribution right and Section 109 : Apple contends that Psystar has violated its distribution right by offering and selling Mac OS X on Psystar computers to the public .
Psystar admits that it has distributed Mac OS X ( Chung Exh. 17 at 4 ) .
But Psystar responds that its conduct is protected by the Section 109 first - sale doctrine .
Section 109 provides that " the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title , or any person authorized by such owner , is entitled , without the authority of the copyright owner , to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord . "
17 U.S.C. 109 .
This provision is a limitation on the distribution right .
It applies only to an owner of a copy .
The parties spill much ink on whether Psystar was the owner or a licensee of the copy ( i.e. , the tangible copy ) of Mac OS X that it purchased .
Even assuming arguendo that Psystar was the owner of a copy , the first - sale defense fails here .
Section 109 provides immunity only when copies are " lawfully made . "
The copies at issue here were not lawfully manufactured with the authorization of the copyright owner .
As stated , Psystar made an unauthorized copy of Mac OS X from a Mac mini that was placed onto an " imaging station " and then used a " master copy " to make many more unauthorized copies that were installed on individual Psystar computers .
The first - sale defense does not apply to those unauthorized copies .
See Microsoft Corp. v. Software Wholesale Club , Inc. , 129 F. Supp. 2d 995 , 1006 ( S.D. Tex. 2000 ) ( " the first - sale doctrine does not apply to an admittedly counterfeit unit " ) ; see also 2 - 8 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 8.12 ( " if the manufacture of a copy or phonorecord constitutes an infringement of the reproduction or adaptation right , its distribution will infringe the distribution right , even if this is done by the owner of such copy or phonorecord " ) .
Catch that ?
Even if Psystar were the lawful owner of the copy , it still can't do what it did .
The court quotes from Microsoft Corp. v. Software Wholesale Club , Inc. : " the first - sale doctrine does not apply to an admittedly counterfeit unit " .
So , no , you can't buy a copy and use it to go into a counterfeiting business , in effect .
Terekhov 's theory has bitten the dust and then had to eat some .
Just like Daniel Wallace 's anti-GPL theory did .
Whoever is relying on their legal theories might want to buy a vowel and try to figure this puzzle out .
I know .
They 'll say , but , but , but ... what if they had n't used the master and just used each copy , then would it work ?
Sons , why do you think Psystar used the master copy ?
Because it 's a business , and in a business , efficiency is money .
That 's why businesses set themselves up , to make money .
The whole world is not with you on a holy war to destroy EULAs and the GPL .
Even this rinkydink business wanted to make money .
Theoreticals belong on message boards , not in business and definitely not in courtrooms , and even on message boards , everyone told you for years that this would n't work out if someone tried it .
It 's been tried .
It did n't work out .
And to those who argue that all that matters is that open source is a better way to develop code , let this case be a warning message .
Apple makes fabulous code .
Of course , the BSD community did a lot of it for them , but Apple makes it all just work for end users , and they do that beautifully .
So no one can argue that for end users it is not fabulous code .
It is .
So here is my question : is that enough ?
Or is n't the message of this case that what you really want with your fabulous code is freedom for the code ?
If you answer yes , I want freedom to do what I want with code on my home computer , then why use proprietary code ?
Proprietary vendors are happy to sell you the best code in the world , if they have it .
But they wo n't sell you freedom to use it any way you want .
That 's not the business they are in .
So , if freedom matters to you , do n't sell out the goal of a completely free operating system , without any proprietary blobs at all .
There is a purpose to that goal , because proprietary blobs mean restrictions on use .
That is a given .
There are other negatives , but that one is the one this case highlights .
So work for drivers that are not proprietary .
Stay away from code that you believe has potential patent infringement claims .
Why ?
Because a short - term seeming advantage can block the end result you want .
It will provide a Brand X solution that takes you on a detour away from your goal .
So when folks tell you that all that matters is that the code be open source or that end users should have the right to put proprietary code together with free and open source code if they want to , or that partnering with Microsoft will work out well , or that what matters is that end users use more free software by using proprietary - free mixtures , ask yourself , is that really true ?
No matter who says it , is it true ?
Look at the Apple v. Psystar case .
Freedom matters .
Some things are just obvious .
Use what you want , but think it through more deeply than just thinking about what you want this minute or what 's more convenient .
Why do you think Stallman started trying to create Free Software ?
Because he knew how to fix a printer but the license would n't let him .
He already saw what you are seeing with this Psystar case .
Proprietary means restrictions on use .
It does .
Here 's the docket ; the order is the final one on the list :

( whalc1 , COURT STAFF ) ( Filed on 11/13/2009 ) ( Entered : 11/13/2009 ) Update :
When Psystar began talking to the media by means of its first law firm , Carr & Ferrell , this is what then lead counsel for Psystar , Colby Springer , said at a press conference announcing that Psystar would defend itself with antitrust counterclaims : Springer took time to address both claims directly .
He noted that Psystar does not make copies of the Mac OS to install on its machines .
In fact , every copy installed is an individually purchased copy of the operating system from Apple or one of its authorized resellers .
" There 's no pirating going on , " he responded .
On claims of code modification , Springer said that the company had not made any modifications to the operating system .
Any techniques applied to make Mac OS run on Psystar , he said , can be found in already available , open source software .
Was that true ?
Compare his words with what the judge wrote , that Psystar made modifications and that it certainly did not buy a copy of MacOSX for each machine .
In fact , it was using a master .
Next question : Would the law firm know it was not true , as discovery eventually demonstrated to the judge ?
I do n't know .
But Psystar knew .
They were the ones doing both things that Springer claimed they were not .

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA APPLE , INC . , a California corporation ,
Plaintiff ,
v .
PSYSTAR CORPORATION , a Florida corporation ,
Defendant .
No. C 08-03251 WHA ORDER RE CROSS MOTIONS
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
AND RELATED COUNTERCLAIMS .
INTRODUCTION
In this copyright - infringement action , plaintiff Apple , Inc. and defendant Psystar Corporation have filed cross motions for summary judgment .
For the following reasons , Apple 's motion is GRANTED and Psystar 's motion is DENIED .
STATEMENT Plaintiff Apple Inc. launched its Macintosh computer in 1984 and its Mac OS X operating system in 2001 .
Apple has manufactured an exclusive line of personal computers , including the Mac Pro , iMac , Mac mini , MacBook , MacBook Air , and MacBook Pro. Mac computers have been sold with Mac OS X preinstalled .
Mac OS
X has also been sold as a DVD so customers can upgrade their Mac computers to another version of the operating system .
1 Mac OS
X on both Mac computers and the DVD are covered by software license agreements that provided that the software is " licensed , not sold to [ the user ] by Apple Inc. ( " Apple " ) for use only under the terms of this License " ( Chung Exh. 26 at ¶ 1 ) .
Apple 's license agreements restricted the use of Mac OS X to Apple computers , and specifically prohibited customers from installing the operating system on non-Apple computers .
The license agreement stated ( id. at ¶ 2 ) : 2 . Permitted License Uses and Restrictions .
A. Single Use .
This license allows you to install , use and run ( 1 ) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple - labeled computer at a time .
You agree not to install , use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple - Labeled computer or enable another to do so .

In brief , customers were contractually precluded from utilizing Mac OS X on any computer hardware system that was not an Apple computer system .
Besides the license agreement , Apple has obtained three copyright registrations for Mac OS X .
It has used lock - and - key technological measures to prevent Mac OS X from operating on non-Apple computers .
This involved the use of a " kernel " extension , which is software that is executed and becomes part of the operating system on an Apple computer .
The kernel extension would communicate with other kernel extensions to locate the decryption keys in the hardware , which then would unlock the encrypted files .
Defendant Psystar Corporation has made a line of computers called Open Computers ( formally known as Open Mac and OpenPro ) .
Psystar has modified Mac OS X to run on its computers and has sold them to the public .
The following briefly describes the conduct at issue .
Psystar first bought a copy of Mac OS X and then installed it on an Apple Mac mini .
Next , Psystar copied Mac OS X from the Mac mini onto a non-Apple computer .
This non-Apple computer was used as an " imaging station . "
Once on the imaging station , Mac OS X was modified .
Psystar then replaced the Mac OS X " bootloader . "
The bootloader runs when a computer first comes on and locates and loads portions of the operating system into random access memory .
Without a bootloader , Mac OS X would not operate .
Psystar also disabled and / or removed Mac OS X kernel extension files and replaced them with other kernel extension files .
Psystar 's modifications enabled Mac OS X to run on non-Apple computers .
The modified copy became the " master copy " that was used for mass reproduction and installation onto other Psystar computers .
Apple also alleges that every time Psystar turned on Psystar computers running Mac OS X then another copy was made in random access memory .
Apple contends that Psystar 's reproduction , modification , and distribution of Mac OS X on non-Apple computers constituted copyright infringement under the Copyright Act and a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Psystar asserts a number of defenses .
Both parties now move for summary judgment .
3 ANALYSIS 1 . LEGAL STANDARD .
Summary judgment must be granted under FRCP 56 when " the pleadings , the discovery and disclosure materials on file , and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . "
A district court must determine , viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party , whether there is any genuine issue of material fact .
Giles v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. , 494 F.3d 865 , 872 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) .
A genuine issue of fact is one that could reasonably be resolved , based on the factual record , in favor of either party .
A dispute is " material " only if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law .
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 24849 ( 1986 ) .
2 . COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT .
Apple contends that Psystar is liable for copyright infringement .
" Plaintiffs must satisfy two requirements to present a prima facie case of direct [ copyright ] infringement : ( 1 ) they must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and ( 2 ) they must demonstrate that the alleged infringers violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under 17 U.S.C. § 106 . " A&M Records v. Napster , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004 , 1013 ( 9th Cir. 2001 ) .
Apple has two federally registered copyrights in Mac OS X .
The validity of these registered copyrights is not contested .
Thus , Apple has established ownership of Mac OS X.1 Apple asserts that Psystar has violated three of its exclusive rights in Mac OS X : ( 1 ) its reproduction right ; ( 2 ) its distribution right ; and ( 3 ) its right to create derivative works .
This order next addresses each of these .
A. Reproduction Right and Section 117 .
According to Apple , Psystar has violated its exclusive right to copy Mac OS X. Psystar admits that it has made copies of Mac OS X and installed those copies on non-Apple computers 4 ( Def. Opp. 10 ) .
In addition , when Psystar turns on its computers running Mac OS X , another copy of the software is made to the random access memory .
Psystar has thus infringed Apple 's reproduction right .
Section 117 ( a ) permits the owner of a copy of a computer program to copy or modify the program for limited purposes without incurring liability for copyright infringement .
See Krause v. Titleserv , Inc. , 402 F.3d 119 , 121 ( 2nd Cir. 2005 ) .
But the question is whether Psystar can rely on Section 117 to escape liability .
It cannot .
As Apple pointed out , Psystar waived any Section 117 essential step defense when it failed to plead it .
Psystar counters that it has not waived Section 117 because that provision is a limitation on a copyright owner 's exclusive rights rather than an affirmative defense .
An earlier Ninth Circuit decision stated " Section 117 defines a narrow category of copying that is lawful per se " and " Section 107 , by contrast , establishes a defense to an otherwise valid claim of copyright infringement . "
Sega Enters . v. Accolade , Inc. , 977 F.2d 1510 , 1521 ( 9th Cir. 1992 ) .
Since then , the Ninth Circuit has expressly referred to Section 117 as a defense .
See Wall Data Inc. v. L.A. County Sheriff's Dep't , 447 F.3d 769 , 776 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) ( referring to Section 117 as an affirmative defense ) ; Asset Mktg. Sys. v. Gagnon , 542 F.3d 748 , 754 ( 9th Cir. 2008 ) ( referring to Section 117 as a defense ) .
As such , this order treats Section 117 as an affirmative defense .
Alternatively , if Section 117 is considered an affirmative defense , then Psystar argues it has pled it in its answer and raised the substance of its Section 117 argument in its interrogatory responses .
Neither the answer nor interrogatory responses , however , refer to Section 117 .
And Psystar has not demonstrated any good cause for its failure to assert the defense after a year of litigation .
Also , there has been no showing that its failure to do so will not prejudice Apple .
As such , Psystar has waived the defense .
At all events , the assertion of Section 117 is so frivolous 5 in the true context of how Psystar has used Mac OS X that a belated attempt to amend the pleadings would not be excused .
2 Psystar briefly mentions a Section 107 fair use defense but does not even attempt to address the four factors used to determine fair use .
See 17 U.S.C. 107 .
Psystar nonetheless contends that its production process and hard drive imaging are fair use .
As stated , rather than loading Mac OS X separately onto individual computers , Psystar uses a mass production process .
Arguing this is for efficiency , Psystar contends that " [ s] uch incidental infringement is protected by the fair use doctrine to the extent that the infringement is not part of a greater scheme of infringement " ( Def. Reply 6 ) .
To support this argument , Psystar cites the following passage in Wall Data Inc. v. L.A. County Sheriff's Dep't , 447 F.3d 769 , 779 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) : To be clear , we do not hold that a fair use defense is not available simply because the infringer uses technology to make efficient use of its licenses .
The problematic aspect of the Sheriff 's Department 's use is that it took in excess of what it bargained for , not that it was technologically efficient .
Thus , for example , if the Sheriff 's Department had saved time and money by hard drive imaging RUMBA software onto the number of computers for which it had licenses , its " efficiency " would not create a problem .
Psystar 's reliance on this quote is misplaced .
In Wall Data , the Sheriff Department purchased 3,663 licenses to plaintiff 's software , but installed the software onto 6,007 computers .
To do this , the Department used hard drive imaging  a single master hard drive containing the software was used to copy the contents onto many other computers .
The Ninth Circuit held that this was not fair use and was in excess of the licensed use of the copyright software bargained for .
While the process used for " efficiency " was not the problem , the Sheriff Department 's unauthorized copying of the software beyond the number of licensed copies was problematic .
Similarly , Psystar 's use of Mac OS X has been in excess and has violated Apple 's copyrights .
6 B. Distribution Right and Section 109 .
Apple contends that Psystar has violated its distribution right by offering and selling Mac OS X on Psystar computers to the public .
Psystar admits that it has distributed Mac OS X ( Chung Exh. 17 at 4 ) .
But Psystar responds that its conduct is protected by the Section 109 first - sale doctrine .
Section 109 provides that " the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title , or any person authorized by such owner , is entitled , without the authority of the copyright owner , to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord . "
17 U.S.C. 109 .
This provision is a limitation on the distribution right .
It applies only to an owner of a copy .
The parties spill much ink on whether Psystar was the owner or a licensee of the copy ( i.e. , the tangible copy ) of Mac OS X that it purchased .
Even assuming arguendo that Psystar was the owner of a copy , the first - sale defense fails here .
Section 109 provides immunity only when copies are " lawfully made . "
The copies at issue here were not lawfully manufactured with the authorization of the copyright owner .
As stated , Psystar made an unauthorized copy of Mac OS X from a Mac mini that was placed onto an " imaging station " and then used a " master copy " to make many more unauthorized copies that were installed on individual Psystar computers .
The first - sale defense does not apply to those unauthorized copies .
See Microsoft Corp. v. Software Wholesale Club , Inc. , 129 F. Supp. 2d 995 , 1006 ( S.D. Tex. 2000 ) ( " the first - sale doctrine does not apply to an admittedly counterfeit unit " ) ; see also 2 - 8 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 8.12 ( " if the manufacture of a copy or phonorecord constitutes an infringement of the reproduction or adaptation right , its distribution will infringe the distribution right , even if this is done by the owner of such copy or phonorecord " ) .
Psystar asserts on its motion that it includes a Mac OS X DVD with every Psystar computer it sells .
There is no sworn evidentiary support for this assertion in Psystar 's motion .
This alone is dispositive .
It is true , as Psystar points out , that Apple 's opening brief on its own separate motion stated " Psystar includes both a Mac OS X DVD . . . and a hard drive copy of Mac OS X on the Psystar computer " ( Pl. Br. 7 ) .
At oral argument , Psystar asserted that Apple 7 cited to paragraph 20 in the declaration of John Kelly , Apple 's expert , to support this proposition .
Paragraph 20 merely stated that Kelly observed Psystar 's technician who did not use a Mac OS X installation DVD for the hard drive imaging or assembly of Psystar 's Open Computer ( Kelly Decl . ¶ 20 ) .
At oral argument , Apple 's counsel referred to paragraph 15 of the Kelly declaration and a table therein .
There , Kelly stated that he had examined nine Psystar computers that had Mac OS X installed on the hard drive ( id. at ¶ 15 ) .
He further stated that the Mac OS X software for five of those computers was not the same as the software found on the Mac OS X DVDs shipped with the computers .
Instead , those computers had a different version of Mac OS X actually installed on hard drive than was found on the accompanying Mac OS X DVD .
According to Table 2 in Kelly 's declaration , three of the other nine computers did not include a Mac OS X DVD at all ( ibid . ) .
The Apple footnote invoked by Psystar at the hearing did include citations to deposition testimony , but the cited testimony did not support the proposition either .
Finally , for its own motion , Psystar was obligated to provide sworn support .
It may not cure evidentiary gaps for its own motion by invoking briefs filed separately and simultaneously by its opponent .
It must lay out plainly and clearly the basis for its own summary judgment motion at step one .
Furthermore , it is not the court 's task " to scour the record in search of a genuine issue of triable fact . "
Keenan v. Allan , 91 F.3d 1275 , 1278 ( 9th Cir. 1996 ) .
Counsel have an obligation to lay out their support clearly .
In Carmen v. San Francisco School District , 237 F.3d 1026 , 1031 ( 9th Cir. 2001 ) , the court expressly held that " [t ] he district court need not examine the entire file for evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact , where the evidence is not set forth in the opposition papers with adequate references so that it could conveniently be found . "
Even if it were the case that a DVD was included with every computer , that did nothing to cure the infringement as to the unauthorized copies discussed above .
Besides Apple does not assert copyright infringement with respect to the sale of the DVD that Psystar allegedly purchased .
C. Right to Create Derivative Works .
Section 101 of the Copyright
Act defines a derivative work as : 8 [ A ] work based upon one or more preexisting works , such as a translation , musical arrangement , dramatization , fictionalization , motion picture version , sound recording , art reproduction , abridgment , condensation , or any other form in which a work may be recast , transformed , or adapted .
A work consisting of editorial revisions , annotations , elaborations , or other modifications which , as a whole , represent an original work of authorship , is a " derivative work . "
17 U.S.C. 101 . Psystar infringed Apple 's exclusive right to create derivative works of Mac OS X .
It did this by replacing original files in Mac OS X with unauthorized software files .
Specifically , it made three modifications : ( 1 ) replacing the Mac OS X bootloader with a different bootloader to enable an unauthorized copy of Mac OS X to run on Psystar 's computers ; ( 2 ) disabling and removing Apple kernel extension files ; and ( 3 ) adding non-Apple kernel extensions .
These modifications enabled Mac OS X to run on a non-Apple computer .
It is undisputed that Psystar made these modifications ( Def. Opp. 67 ) .
3
But Psystar contends that this did not amount to creating a derivative work , because Apple 's source code , object code , or kernel extensions were not modified .
This argument is unavailing .
Psystar admittedly replaced entire files within the software while copying other portions .
This resulted in a substantial variation from the underlying copyrighted work .
In fact , if the bootloader and kernel extensions added by Psystar were removed , then the operating system would not work on Psystar 's computers .
The inclusion of the copyrighted Mac OS X with the above - described additions and modifications makes Psystar 's product an infringing , derivative work .
Psystar cites no decisions to reasonably support its argument that its modifications do not amount to a derivative work ; whereas , Apple points to decisions showing that such deletions , modifications , and additions to software result in an infringing derivative work .
See , e.g. , Dun & Bradstreet Software Servs. v. Grace Consulting , Inc. , 307 F.3d 197 , 208 ( 3rd Cir. 2002 ) ( concluding that defendant 's modification of a copy of plaintiff 's software , including fixing bugs and adding features , created an infringing derivative work ) ; Midway Mfg. Co. v. 9 Arctic International , Inc. , 704 F.2d 1009 , 1014 ( 7th Cir. 1983 ) ( finding defendant 's addition of circuit boards created a speeded - up video game that was a substantially different product from the original game and thus a derivative work ) ; SAS Institute , Inc. v. S & H Computer Systems , Inc. , 605 F. Supp. 816 , 831 ( M.D. Tenn. 1985 ) ( finding defendant 's duplication and conversion of software that would run on an IBM computer to run on a VAX computer constituted a derivative work ) .
In sum , Psystar has violated Apple 's exclusive reproduction right , distribution right , and right to create derivative works .
Accordingly , Apple 's motion for summary judgment on copyright infringement must be granted .
2 . CONTRIBUTORY INFRINGEMENT .
Apple next asserts that Psystar is liable for contributory infringement .
Psystar offers no opposition on this issue .
" One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement . "
See MGM Studios Inc. v. Grokster , Ltd. , 545 U.S. 913 , 930 ( 2005 ) .
Psystar is a contributory infringer through its sale of unauthorized copies of Mac OS X to the public .
This is contributory infringement .
Accordingly , summary judgment must be granted for Apple on contributory infringement .
3 . COPYRIGHT MISUSE .
Copyright misuse is a defense to copyright infringement .
The copyright - misuse doctrine " forbids the use of the [ copyright ] to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the [ Copyright ]
Office and which is contrary to public policy to grant . "
Altera Corp. v. Clear Logic , Inc. , 424 F.3d 1079 , 1090 ( 9th Cir. 2005 ) .
" The misuse defense prevents copyright holders from leveraging their limited monopoly to allow them control of areas outside the monopoly . "
A&M Records v. Napster , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004 , 1026 ( 9th Cir. 2001 ) .
Psystar argues that Apple misused its copyrights by continuing to prosecute allegedly " invalid " copyright infringement and DMCA claims against Psystar .
This argument is unavailing .
This order finds that Apple 's claims are valid and has granted summary judgment in favor of Apple on those claims .
10 Psystar next argues that Apple 's attempt to use copyright to tie Mac OS X to Apple hardware constituted copyright misuse .
Put differently , Psystar argues that Apple cannot extend its exclusive rights to control the computers on which Apple 's customers run Mac OS X. Psystar 's antitrust allegations were dismissed in a prior order , and Psystar then chose not to pursue any antitrust counterclaims .
The prior order stated , " Apple asks its customers to purchase Mac OS knowing that it is to be used only with Apple computers .
It is certainly entitled to do so " ( Dkt. No. 33 at 14 ) .
That order previously rejected Psystar 's theory and this order does the same .
Psystar rightly points out that the Ninth Circuit has stated , " a defendant in a copyright infringement suit need not prove an antitrust violation to prevail on a copyright misuse defense . "
Practice Management Info Corp. v. American Medical Ass'n , 121 F.3d 516 , 521 ( 9th Cir. 1997 ) .
For this principle , the Ninth Circuit relied upon a Fourth Circuit decision , which explained , " [t ] he question is not whether the copyright is being used in a manner violative of antitrust law ( such as whether the licensing agreement is ' reasonable ' ) , but whether the copyright is being used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright . "
Lasercomb America , Inc. , v. Reynolds , 911 F.2d 970 , 978 ( 4th Cir. 1990 ) .
In the present case , Apple has not prohibited others from independently developing and using their own operating systems .
Thus , Apple did not violate the public policy underlying copyright law or engage in copyright misuse .
In this way , Practice Management Info Corp. is distinguishable .
There , the Ninth Circuit invalidated the AMA 's copyright on a coding system of medical procedures requiring a contracting party ( HCFA ) to use only the AMA 's coding system and none other , stating :
What offends the copyright misuse doctrine is not HCFA 's decision to use the AMA 's coding system exclusively , but the limitation imposed by the AMA licensing agreement on HCFA 's rights to decide whether or not to use other forms as well .
Conditioning the license on HCFA 's promise not to use competitors ' products constituted a misuse of the copyright by the AMA .
Id. at 521 .
But Apple has not prohibited purchasers of Mac OS X from using competitor 's products .
Rather , Apple has simply prohibited purchasers from using Mac OS X on 11 competitor 's products .
The Ninth Circuit has likewise distinguished Lasercomb America , 911 F.2d at 97879 , on this ground .
See Triad Systems Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co. , 64 F.3d 1330 , 1337 ( 9th Cir. 1995 ) , overruled on other grounds by Gonzales v. Texaco Inc. , No. 07-17123 , 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 18370 , at * 5 ( 9th Cir. Aug. 17 , 2009 ) ( " [ U ] nlike the case of Lasercomb America , Inc. v. Reynolds , 911 F.2d 970 , 97879 ( 4th Cir. 1990 ) , Triad did not attempt to prohibit Southeastern or any other ISO from developing its own service software to compete with Triad " ) .
Psystar cites
In re Napster , Inc. , Copyright Litigation , 191 F. Supp. 2d 1087 , 1105 ( N.D. Cal. 2004 ) ( Patel , J. ) , for the proposition that " unduly restrictive copyright licensing agreements " can constitute misuse .
But even Judge Patel acknowledged that " no court has thus far articulated the boundaries of ' unduly restrictive licensing ' or when licensing or other conduct would violate the amorphous concept of public policy . "
Ibid .
As explained above , Apple 's licensing agreement is not unduly restrictive .
Indeed , the egregious examples of copyright misuse in the decisions cited by Psystar provide further support for this order 's determination that Apple has not engaged in copyright misuse .
For example , in Lasercomb America , 911 F.2d at 978 , the Fourth Circuit found copyright misuse in the following circumstance :
The language employed in the Lasercomb agreement is extremely broad .
Each time Lasercomb sells its Interact program to a company and obtains that company 's agreement to the noncompete language , the company is required to forego utilization of the creative abilities of all its officers , directors and employees in the area of CAD / CAM die - making software .
Of yet greater concern , these creative abilities are withdrawn from the public .
The period for which this anticompetitive restraint exists is ninety - nine years , which could be longer than the life of the copyright itself .
Lasercomb America likewise stated that an anti-competitive restraint lasting even 20 years would constitute copyright misuse .
Id. at 979 .
Ultimately , the problem in Lasercomb America was that the all - encompassing anticompetitive restraint attempted to " control competition in an area outside the copyright . "
Ibid. ( emphasis added ) .
But Apple 's licensing agreement is not nearly as all - encompassing as those addressed in Lasercomb America 
Apple 's agreement does not seek to control all competition in an area outside the copyright .
Rather , Apple 's 12 agreement simply attempts to control the use of Apple 's own software  an area that is the focus of the copyright .
Therefore , Psystar 's motion for summary judgment on copyright misuse must be denied .
4 . DMCA .
Apple contends that Psystar has violated the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA .
Apple has used a decryption key as a technological protection measure to prevent access to Apple 's Mac OS X and to prevent Mac OS X from running on a non-Apple computer .
Section 1201 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) provides that no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title .
Psystar has used decryption software to obtain access to Mac OS X and to circumvent Apple 's technological measure when modifying Mac OS X in its production process .
This is a violation of the Section 1201 anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA .
17 U.S.C. 1201 ( a ) ( 1 ) .
Section 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) prohibits the manufacture , importation , offering to the public , providing , or otherwise trafficking in any technology , product , service , device , component , or part thereof , that meets one of three criteria , including the following : ( A ) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title ; ( B ) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title ; or ( C ) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person 's knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title .
17 U.S.C. 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) ; see also 17 U.S.C. 1201 ( b ) . Section 1201 ( b ) is very similar to Section 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) .
But ( a ) ( 2 ) focuses on effectively controlling access and ( b ) focuses on effectively protecting a right of a copyright owner .
Psystar 's circumvention technology was installed on Psystar computers and sold with Mac OS X. Psystar also marketed the computers as running Mac OS X .
This facilitation of circumvention was a violation under Section 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) . 13 Section 1201 ( b ) ( 1 ) was likewise violated .
When an end user turned on a Psystar computer and ran Mac OS X , there was also an act of circumvention , as Psystar concedes ( Def. Reply 2 ) .
As stated , running the modified Mac OS X results in an unauthorized copy to RAM .
Thus , Psystar 's circumvention technology has not only provided access but also resulted in copies in RAM .
Although Apple 's technological measure may have been primarily aimed at controlling access , it also effectively protected its right to copy , at least for the copy made in RAM .
Cf. 321 Studios v. MGM Studios , Inc. , 307 F. Supp. 2d 1085 , 1097 ( N.D. Cal. 2004 ) ( Illston , J. ) ( finding that Section 1201 ( b ) ( 1 ) applied when copying the encrypted DVDs was not particularly useful , as any copy made without circumventing could not be accessed or viewed ) .
Psystar asserts , nonetheless , that it has not violated the DMCA and provides two reasons : ( 1 ) Psystar did not facilitate infringement ; and ( 2 ) Apple 's technological protection measure was not effective .
Because unauthorized copying and access have been proven , Psystar 's first argument is rejected .
See Chamberlain Group , Inc. v. Skylink Techs. , Inc. , 381 F.3d 1178 , 1193 ( Fed. Cir. 2004 ) .
As to the second argument , Psystar contends that Apple 's anticircumvention technology was ineffective because the decryption key for circumvention is publicly available on the internet .
This argument fails .
" The fact that circumvention devices may be widely available does not mean that a technological measure is not , as the DMCA provides , effectively protecting the rights of copyright owners in the ordinary course of its operation . "
Sony Computer Entm't Am. , Inc. v. Divineo , Inc. , 457 F. Supp. 2d 957 , 965 ( N.D. Cal. 2006 ) .
Generally , measures based on encryption " effectively control " access to copyrighted works .
Here , when the decryption key was not employed , the encryption effectively worked to prevent access to Mac OS X .
And that is all that is required .
See Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes , 111 F. Supp. 2d 294 , 318 ( S.D.N.Y. 2000 ) ( noting that when a decryption program was not employed , the encryption worked to control access to the protected work ) .
Accordingly , Psystar has violated the DMCA by circumventing Apple 's 14 protection barrier and trafficking devices designed for circumvention .
Apple 's motion for summary judgment on its DMCA claim must be granted .
4 5 . TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT AND TRADE -DRESS INFRINGEMENT .
The summary of argument section of Psystar 's motion introduces an argument that its use of Apple 's trademarks and trade dress is a nominative fair use .
But the motion never fully addresses this issue .
For example , no evidentiary cites or legal cites are provided .
Psystar failed to even mention nominative fair use in its reply .
While nominative fair use may be asserted as a defense , the defendant has the burden of proof .
See Mattel Inc. v. Walking Mt. Prods. , 353 F.3d 792 , 810 ( 9th Cir. 2003 ) ( stating a defendant must prove three elements to show nominative fair use ) .
The burden was not met here .
Accordingly , Psystar 's motion for summary judgment on nominative fair use must be denied .
6 . RELIEF .
Psystar contends that Apple has waived damages on its non-copyright claims , such as its breach - of - contract claim .
Psystar further argues that if an injunction is granted , then it should be limited to Mac OS X Leopard ( and not include Mac OS X Snow Leopard , for example ) .
Apple neither filed a motion on its non-copyright claims nor for a permanent injunction .
Rather , Psystar has prematurely raised these points merely in anticipation of Apple doing so .
As such , this order will not address the relief , if any , that Apple may be entitled to at this juncture .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons , Apple 's motion is GRANTED and Psystar 's motion is DENIED .
Apple has also asserted the following claims , which remain for trial : ( 1 ) breach of contract ; ( 2 ) induced breach of contract , ( 3 ) trademark infringement ; ( 4 ) trademark dilution ; ( 5 ) trade dress infringement ; and ( 6 ) state unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code § 17200 ; and ( 7 ) common law unfair competition .
15 With respect to relief , formal briefing is appropriate , so : Apple 's opening November 23 , 2009 ; Psystar 's opposition November 30 , 2009 ; and Apple 's reply December 7 , 2009 .
A hearing will be held on December 14 , 2009 , at 8 a.m. IT IS SO ORDERED .
Dated : November 13 , 2009 . ( signature )
WILLIAM ALSUP
UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE 16 Psystar also asserts that Apple claims copyright infringement as to its decryption key .
In response , Apple clarifies that it " has never alleged that Psystar 's copyright infringement is limited to Psystar 's unauthorized use of the " decryption key ( Pl. Opp. 15 ) .
Rather Apple 's allegations are focused on copying of Mac OS X , not just a decryption key .
In any event , Psystar has provided little support for this argument and its position is rejected .
Trying to have it both ways , Psystar successfully opposed Apple 's earlier attempt to reopen discovery and extend deadlines to add an additional product 
Snow Leopard  to this action .
Psystar now seeks to add a very late affirmative defense .
This would not be fair .
Psystar also asserts Section 117 as a defense to avoid liability for infringement of Apple 's right to create derivative works .
But as stated above , Psystar has waived this defense .
Psystar does not rely on a reverse - engineering defense under the DMCA , and thus this order does not address Apple 's argument on this point .

So it will probably survive the note the Vatican issued last week , inviting disaffected Anglicans to head Romeward , and offering them an Anglo - Catholic mansion within the walls of the Roman Catholic faith .
But the invitation is a bombshell nonetheless .
Pope Benedict XVI ’s outreach to Anglicans may produce only a few conversions ; it may produce a few million .
Either way , it represents an unusual effort at targeted proselytism , remarkable both for its concessions to potential converts  married priests , a self - contained institutional structure , an Anglican rite  and for its indifference to the wishes of the Church of England ’s leadership .
This is not the way well - mannered modern churches are supposed to behave .
Spurred by the optimism of the early 1960s , the major denominations of Western Christendom have spent half a century being exquisitely polite to one another , setting aside a history of strife in the name of greater Christian unity .
This ecumenical era has borne real theological fruit , especially on issues that divided Catholics and Protestants during the Reformation .
But what began as a daring experiment has decayed into bureaucratized complacency  a dull round of interdenominational statements on global warming and Third World debt , only tenuously connected to the Gospel .
In a unique experiment in democratic transparency , Barack Obama – a BlackBerry owner , and the first American president to use email while in office – has agreed to copy G2 in on his otherwise highly confidential electronic communications .
Each week we present a selction from recent days :
To : David Axelrod < davidaxelrod@barackobama.com >
Subject : Tokyo visit
You wo n't believe this – sat down for state dinner with PM Hatoyama and literally the first thing he said was : " Got any good gossip on what 's going to be in Sarah Palin 's autobiography ? "
I thought this was just a US media obsession , but they can't get enough of her here .
We had to talk about it for the WHOLE meal because Reggie L had read in Lonely Planet that Japanese culture is all about " saving face " and we 'd mortify our hosts if I tried to bring up US - Japanese economic cooperation .
She 's like some unkillable zombie .
Singapore next .
If they ask about her there , I 'll be tempted to make her special envoy to SE Asia .
That 'll show them .
BHO PS .
Got an advance copy ?
I need cheering up .
To : All White House staff Subject : Departure of Gregory Craig , White House counsel
All – you 've probably heard that Greg Craig will be leaving his role as our top lawyer .
He 's had his ups and downs , obviously , what with his mishandling of the plan to close Guantánamo Bay within a year , numerous screw - ups in vetting our nominees , etc .
But he 's not being " fired " , as has been reported , and it 's time to give him a good send - off .
There 'll be drinks this Thursday outside the Oval Office , by the watercooler .
Unfortunately I 'll still be in Asia , and neither Rahm nor Axelrod can make it , and Joe 's attendance is unconfirmed .
And actually the drinks will come FROM the watercooler !
But have fun !!
Festivities kick off at 5.15 pm , followed by speeches at 5.18 , wrapping up at 5.19 .
All the best for the future Greg .
Barack
To : General Stanley McChrystal < smcchrystal@army.mil >
Subject : New Afghanistan policy – attached as PDF file
Stanley – reached our decision !
See attachment .
Better late than never !
Phew !
Barack
To : Senior WH military advisers , David Axelrod , Rahm Emanuel Subject : Afghanistan policy
Guys , we have GOT to figure this out .
NOW .
I just sent McChrystal another email where I said the policy was in the attachment , but " forgot " to attach it .
I can't keep doing this .
He 's going to figure it out .
Barack

CONAKRY ( Reuters ) - Security forces in Guinea killed more than 150 people in a crackdown on opponents of military junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara , a local rights group said on Tuesday .
The violence on Monday was the worst since Camara seized power in a 2008 coup and follows months of tension with opponents who demand he honor a longstanding pledge to ensure a transition to civilian rule .
WHAT LED UP TO THE CRACKDOWN ?
Opponents believe Camara is preparing to run as a candidate in a presidential election due to have taken place this year but now postponed to January .
While he himself has made no formal declaration , his supporters have in recent weeks said there should be no impediment to him standing .
Two days after Camara held a rally for his supporters in the city of Labe , a coalition of rival parties sought on Monday to hold their own event at a stadium in the capital Conakry .
It was banned but thousands of people took to the streets and broke into the stadium anyway -- prompting an immediate and massive crackdown by security forces .
DOES THIS AUGUR WIDER UNREST ?
The violence used by the military on Monday could suggest a deliberate attempt by authorities to dissuade critics from any new challenges to Camara ’s rule .
Aside from the use of live rounds , eyewitnesses reported gratuitous abuses by soldiers including sexual attacks on women , while media covering the events said they were assaulted by soldiers and their equipment destroyed .
Several prominent opposition leaders including Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea ( UFDG ) were arrested on Monday and it is not clear when they can expect to be released .
Guinea was quiet on Tuesday , but with the presidential election due on January 31 , the country is set for a volatile four months that could spill over into violence at any time .
WHAT IS THE REST OF THE WORLD DOING ?
The crackdown brought swift and unequivocal condemnations from United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and former colonial power France , which said it would consult with European Union and other partners on what steps to take .
The African Union recalled that it had given Camara a deadline of mid-October to confirm he would not be standing in the election or face sanctions .
The AU warned that its Commission was already preparing a report on the developments and possible sanctions , but did not elaborate on what moves were possible .
The statements amount to concerted external pressure on Camara to relinquish power as promised , but the junta leader has in recent months maintained an openly defiant stance to such calls .
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY ?
Camara ’s weak point may be his reliance on outside investors to ensure Guinea draws benefit from its huge bauxite reserves .
Mining firms such as UC RUSAL and Rio Tinto have not indicated they are ready to leave the country despite a series of disputes .
Officials say government revenues from mineral exports is already expected to fall dramatically next year , putting public finances under strain .
Analysts believe Guinea ’s move to rescind a bauxite refinery deal with RUSAL this month was an attempt by the leadership to apply leverage for better terms on the contract rather than aimed at kicking RUSAL out .
For now , investors are staying .
But if Camara lets things get out of hand -- either on the streets or in the economy -- they could change their mind .

2.6.1 - 2.6.4
Attention all users :
For pre 2.6 applications to work with web2 py > =2.6 , you must copy static / js/web2py.js , controllers / appadmin.py , and views / appadmin.html from the welcome app to your own apps ( all of them ) .
Attention production users :
The updated handlers and examples are in handlers / and examples / .
The updated ones will not override the existing ones .
To use the new ones it is not sufficient to upgrade web2 py , you also need to copy the desired handler / example in the root web2 py / folder .
Attention MySQL users :
The length of string fields changed from 255 to 512 bytes .
If you have migrations enabled this will trigger a large migration .
To prevent it , first set migrate_enabled =False , upgrade , check everything is ok , then add length=255 to your string Fields , then re-enable migrations with migrate_enabled =True if needed .
better directory structure : handlers / extras / examples /

Scheduler Improvements ( thanks to niphlod , ykessler , dhx , toomim )
web2 py.py -K myapp -X starts the myapp scheduler alongside the webserver
tasks are marked EXPIRED ( if stop_time passed )
functions with no result do n't end up in scheduler_run
more options : web2 py.py -E -b -L
scheduler can now handle 10 k tasks with 20 concurrent workers and with no issues
new params : tasks can be found in the environment ( no need to define the tasks parameter ) max_empty_runs kills the workers automatically if no new tasks are found in queue ( nice for " spikes " of processing power ) discard_results to completely discard the results ( if you do n't need the output of the task ) utc_time enables datetime calculations with UTC time
scheduler_task changes : task_name is no longer required ( filled automatically with function_name if found empty ) uuid makes easy to coordinate scheduler_task maintenance ( filled automatically if not provided ) stop_time has no default ( previously was today + 1 ) retry_failed to requeue automatically failed tasks sync_output refreshes automatically the output ( nice to report percentages )
workers can be : DISABLED ( put to sleep and do nothing if not sending the heartbeat every 30 seconds ) TERMINATE ( complete the current task and then die ) KILL ( kill ASAP )

db.define_table ( ' mytable ' , db. Field ( ' somefield ' ) , timestamp )
Example :
timestamp=SQLTable( None , 'timestamp ' , SQLField ( ' created_on ' , ' datetime ' , writable = False , default=request.now ) , SQLField ( ' modified_on ' , 'datetime ' , writable = False , default=request.now ,update=request.now ) )
and use it in all your tables
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,request.args [ - 1 ] )
and you get a create form if the URL ends in /0 , you get an update
form if the URL ends in /[ valid_record_id ]
make a display form in two possible ways :
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record,readonly =True )
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record_id,readonly=True )
make an update form in two possible ways :
form=SQLFORM( db.circle,record )
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record_id )
make a create form in two possible ways :
form=SQLFORM( db.circle )
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,0 )
make a form that automatically computes area
pi=3.1415
form=SQLFOM( db.circle )
if form.accepts(request.vars ,
onvalidation=lambda form : form.vars.area=pi*form.vars.radius2 ) : ...
make the radius appear in bold in display and table
db.circle.radius.represent=lambda value : B( value )
automatically timestamp when record is modified
db.circle.modified_on.update=request.now
automatically timestamp when record cretaed
db.circle.modified_on.default=request.now
do not show now in display forms
db.circle.modified_on.readable =False
do not show area in create / edit forms
db.circle.area.writable =False
add a comment in the forms
db.circle.area.comment= " ( this is a comment ) "
1.56
Now you can do :
db.define_table ( ' cirlce ' , db.
Field ( ' radius ' , ' double ' ) , db.
Field ( ' area ' , ' double ' ) , db.
Field ( ' modified_on ' , ' datetime ' ) )

Congressional Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday to make it easier for older workers to win age discrimination lawsuits ( a Supreme Court decision in June had made it harder by requiring that the worker show that age was the deciding factor in an employment decision ) .
Unemployment for older workers has climbed to record levels .
Has age discrimination on the job become a bigger problem ?
A Lose - Lose Situation
Teresa Ghilarducci , director of economic policy analysis at the New School for Social Research , is the author of “ When I ’m 64 : The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them . ”
The bad news is that age discrimination is skyrocketing .
According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission age discrimination claims were up 29 percent in 2008 .
This is almost double the increase in overall
discrimination complaints for race , sex , etc .
A hidden cause of the increase in age discrimination claims is the pension crisis .
Discrimination on the basis of age takes place when older workers are laid off , or bypassed for promotion or a pay increase .
Getting hired is a problem too .
Unemployed workers between the ages of
55 and 64 have the toughest time finding new jobs ; 30 percent of older men are out of work for almost 30 weeks compared to 25 - to 34 - year - olds who get work in 10 weeks .
One reason is that health insurance can cost an employer twice as much for a worker over age 40 .
This is yet another good reason for health care reform .
The good news is that the increasing numbers of older workers may break down barriers and prejudice .
But asking a pension economist if it ’s a good thing that older people are working more is like asking a vegetarian about the falling price of beef .
Eroding pensions — 401 ( k ) assets in mutual funds declined by 40 percent last year — and a lousy economy explains why many older people are clinging to their jobs or returning to the labor market after retiring .
A hidden cause of the increase in age discrimination claims is the pension crisis .
Read more …
Everyone who wants to work should be able to and no one deserves to be judged by their age or any other factor that does not relate to their productivity .
But forcing older people to work in order to cover their pension losses will have the unintended effect of also causing more age discrimination claims — a lose - lose situation .
Prejudice Is Flourishing
Peter Cappelli , the director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School , is the author , with Bill Novelli , of a forthcoming book on managing older workers .
We can see evidence of discrimination in many different contexts from experiments where employers are presented with identical job applicants whose only difference is age to employee complaints brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
It has gotten worse in recent years especially with the end of lifetime employment .
Seniority - based pay schedules that paid more to experienced workers led many employers to cut experienced workers — who happen to be older — as a way to save money fast .
In the past , the terms and conditions of employment for older workers were laid out in formal rules .
No longer .
The perception that older workers ca n’t or wo n’t change leads some employers to replace them with younger candidates as a means of changing the organization .
Most distressingly and despite all research evidence pointing in the opposite direction , there is a common belief that older workers do n’t perform as well as their younger counterparts .
That causes employers to pass over them in hiring and promotions and to target them for layoffs .
Prejudice against older workers may not be worse now , but the ability to exercise that prejudice in the form of age discrimination is more common .
In the past , the terms and conditions of employment especially as they relate to older workers were laid out in formal rules :
The most senior workers got the promotions , pay increased with years of service , and layoffs were targeted at the newest hired .
Those rules have gone away in most organizations , leaving managers with discretion over how pay , promotion , hiring , and job assignments are determined .
With that discretion , prejudice that may have always been there can be made manifest .
Legislation May Harm Workers
Joanna Lahey , an assistant professor of public policy at Texas A&M University , specializes in the economics of work and aging .
She is on leave this year at RAND .
Age discrimination remains a significant workplace issue .
From 1992 to 2008 , 15.79 percent of cases brought to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , or about 4,585 cases per year , were described as successful claims .
While this number is small given the number of workers covered by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act , many , if not most , instances of age discrimination are never litigated , and cases of hiring discrimination often go undetected .
If it is more difficult to fire an older worker than a younger worker , a firm will be less likely to want to hire older people .
Most of those who do sue are white , male middle - managers who are likely to have lost a sizeable salary and pension .
For the most part , other groups do not litigate because the costs of a lawsuit do not outweigh the potential benefits .
There is strong experimental evidence for age discrimination in hiring , at least for entry - level jobs .
In 2002 - 2003 , I performed a labor market experiment in Boston and St. Petersburg , Fla . in which I sent out thousands of resumes for fictitious entry - level female candidates and measured response rate based on date of high school graduation .
Among this group , younger applicants , whose date of high school graduation indicated that they were less than 50 years old , were 40 percent more likely to be called back for an interview than were older applicants .

It is difficult to tell whether employment problems are worse for older workers than for other workers when times are bad .
The number of discrimination lawsuits increases during times of high unemployment , but this finding by itself does not indicate an increased level of age discrimination .
In times of higher unemployment , the opportunity cost to a lawsuit is lower than it is when times are good .
From the employer ’s perspective , mass layoffs may seem like a good chance to remove a higher proportion of generally more expensive older workers without the worry of being sued .
On the other hand , employers may be less likely to remove protected older workers because they still fear lawsuits .
One thing we do know is that once an older worker loses a job , he or she is much less likely to find a new job than a younger worker is .
Unfortunately , the effect of legislation prohibiting age discrimination is not clear cut and may actually be part of the reason it is so difficult for older workers to find employment .
If it is more difficult to fire an older worker than a younger worker , a firm will be less likely to want to hire older workers .
Indeed , my research finds that in states where workers have longer time to bring a lawsuit claim , older men work fewer weeks per year , are less likely to be hired , and less likely to be fired than men in states where they do not have as much time .
Not many people would suggest that we go back to a world prior to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act , in which advertisements specify the specific ages of people they are willing to hire .
However , legislation prohibiting discrimination is no panacea .
The recent Supreme Court decision and the recent proposed congressional legislation could have both positive and negative effects on potential older workers .
More Expensive Workers
Alicia H. Munnell is the Peter F. Drucker professor of management sciences at Boston College ’s Carroll School of Management and director of the college ’s Center for Retirement Research .
Older workers today should be more attractive to employers than they were in the past .
They are better educated , with no significant educational deficit relative to younger workers .
Employment has shifted away from activities that require physical strength and stamina .
And employer retirement income programs are no longer an escalator of compensation costs as workers age .
Keeping healthy older individuals in the labor force is best , but this may be a tough goal to achieve .
Nevertheless , there is little indication thus far that the employment prospects of older workers have improved .
A 2006 survey conducted by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College revealed that employers have mixed views of older workers .
They think of them as knowledgeable about the company , at ease with customers , and reliable .
But employers also worry about physical stamina of older workers , their ability to learn new things , and their commitment to continued employment .
This mixed view is reinforced by the economics .
The productivity of older workers can be expected to at best stay level , but will likely turn down .
The compensation of older workers at their career job will at best stay level , but probably rise .
These patterns make the retention of older workers relatively unattractive .
The hiring of older workers occurs only when they are willing to accept significantly lower rates of compensation than they had earned previously .
Keeping healthy older individuals in the labor force is best for them and for the economy .
But given employer perceptions , this may be a tough goal to achieve .
Words That Harm
Robert M. McCann is an associate professor at the Marshall School of Business , University of Southern California
Ageist stereotypes are rife in society , and when placed in a workplace context , those generalizations often play out in unfair expectations about older workers by management and staff .
Unfortunately , those views can also lead to discriminatory practices toward older workers .
The repercussions of age - laden communication and practices can be devastating to older employees , who may suffer declines in self - esteem and mental health .
Such practices also hurt their employers , which may have to deal with declining productivity and age discrimination lawsuits .
Laid - off older workers , facing a grim job market , may have more incentive to take sue to recover lost wages or jobs than before .
Language can play a major role in many age discrimination cases .
Remarks like “ we need young blood around here , ” “ let ’s make room for some M.B.A.s , ” or “ let ’s bring in the young guns ” are commonly found in age discrimination cases , where they ’re seen as evidence of discriminatory motive .
Age discrimination probably has gotten worse in recent years .
A variety of factors may account for the recent increase in age - bias claims among workers age 40 and above .
Most notably , there is the possibility that laid - off older workers , facing a grim job market , may have more incentive to take legal action to recover their lost wages or jobs than before .
On the other hand , it may be that companies are targeting older workers for layoffs because of their comparatively higher salaries , benefits , and medical costs .
It ’s important to note that there are some positive trends happening in older worker employment , ( see the AARP Best Employers for Workers Over 50 ) .
But in general , today ’s older worker has many challenges to overcome .
Politics and Bias Cases
Mark A. Graber is a professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law and a professor of government at the University of Maryland , College Park .
The Congressional effort to strengthen protections against age discrimination is not surprising .
Two years ago , in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company , the five conservative justices on the Roberts Court read the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 very narrowly when denying the claim of a woman who alleged gender discrimination on the job .
This year , Congress passed legislation to overturn the Ledbetter decision .
Two employment discrimination cases may be the first shots in what could be a protracted war .
This June , five justices in Gross v. FBL Financial Services interpreted the provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act as permitting employers to fire employees as long as age was not the only reason for termination .
On Tuesday , Democrats began what is likely to be the successful effort to reverse that decision .
From one perspective , these decisions and subsequent congressional reversals may be ordinary events .
Both the Ledbetter and Gross decisions interpreted federal statutes , so there is no constitutional problem when Congress corrects judicial interpretations of federal law .
Quite frequently , judicial decisions interpreting statutes even invite Congress to hand down a different rule .

Perth 's beaches are key to city life , but sea levels are rising fast New figures have revealed that sea levels along the coast of Western Australia are rising at a rate double that of the world average .
Statistics from Australia 's National Tidal Centre show levels have increased by 8.6 mm a year off the coast of the state capital Perth .
That compares to a global average of just over 3 mm .
Scientists have said that man-made climate change has played a significant role in the rise .
Climatologists have said that a combination of natural variability and man-made pollution have caused sea levels to rise around the world .
Double trouble
For much of the past century there were average increases of 1.7 mm per year , while that rate doubled after 1993 .
Some regions , however , have suffered more than others .
New figures show that the sea level rose off Perth in Western Australia and in the Kimberley region to the north by more than 8 mm .
Dr John Church , from Australia 's government - funded science and research body , the CSIRO , says these are worrying signs .
" Man 's role is making a significant contribution to this global average rise , " he said .
" I think the fact that sea levels are rising is a major reason for concern and it's a combination of the global average rise together with the natural variability leading to larger regional rises over certain periods and extreme events as in storm surges which will have the most impact and , of course , sea level rise will not stop in 2100 , it will continue for many centuries , " he added .
About 80 % of Australians live in coastal areas .
There are fears that vulnerable low - lying communities may have to be abandoned in years to come because of flooding and erosion .
CSIRO scientists have said that warming temperatures , which cause water to expand , have been a major trigger for sea -level rises in the 20th Century .
They have also blamed the melting of the world 's icecaps and glaciers .

A Double Ringed Basin on Mercury
Credit : NASA / JHU APL / CIW
Explanation :
What caused the smooth floor inside the double ringed basin on Mercury ?
No one is sure .
The unusual feature spans 160 kilometers and was imaged during the robotic MESSENGER spacecraft 's swing past our Solar System 's innermost planet last week .
Double and multiple ringed basins , although rare , have also been imaged in years past on Mars , Venus , Earth , and Earth 's Moon .
Mercury itself has several doubles , including huge Caloris basin , Rembrandt basin , and enigmatic Raditladi basin .
Most large multiple ringed basins on planets and moons are caused initially by a forceful impact by a single asteroid or comet fragment .
One interesting feature of the above - imaged double ring is that the basin center appears much smoother than the region between the rings .
Possibly , the internal floor was smoothed by later volcanic activity .
Also possible , however , is that the floor was smoothed by melting and flowing of material upon impact .
MESSENGER has now completed its last flyby of Mercury but will return and attempt to enter orbit in 2011 March .
There have been reports that Mercedes - Benz would like to place Nick Heidfeld in one of its F1 teams .
This does not mean that he has been signed by the new Mercedes Grand Prix .
In all likelihood it means that the process of bringing down the financial demands of Jenson Button and Kimi Raikkonen is continuing .
If Mercedes was going to announce a Nico Rosberg / Nick Heidfeld pairing they would have done so this morning .
Thus the likelihood is that Button and Raikkonen will remain the favourites for the two remaining seats at McLaren and Brawn .
If they do not give way on the money ( or the terms and conditions ) then Heidfeld will probably be in with a good chance .
The eHealth Ontario spending scandal has claimed one of the most powerful people at Queen 's Park – Health Minister David Caplan , whose resignation forces Premier Dalton McGuinty to revamp his cabinet .
But McGuinty has one hand tied behind his back as he struggles to reshape his embattled Liberal government because Deputy Premier George Smitherman , who is planning to run for Toronto mayor next year , does not want to quit his energy and infrastructure post just yet .
" Things are chaotic , " an insider said as worried Liberal MPPs held a late - night conference call to demand answers about the confusion at the highest levels of the provincial government .
Caplan 's departure from cabinet , which takes effect Wednesday , comes as the auditor general releases a scathing 50 - page report concluding successive Progressive Conservative and Liberal administrations squandered more than $ 1 billion on electronic health records for patients with little to show for it .
The health minister 's move comes after McGuinty spent months rejecting opposition calls for Caplan 's resignation .
Critics cited Caplan 's handling of eHealth , as well as his performance previously as minister responsible for the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. , where problems included lottery kiosk clerks and other insiders winning a stunning $ 198 million in prizes .
" The auditor is going to say eHealth has fixed a lot of things and that 's good , but the blame for the disaster really lies with the ministry , " said a source privy to the report .
Other heads should roll , charged a former eHealth official .
" To have spent $ 1 billion and achieved very little – there is a severe problem with the bureaucratic leadership . "
Sources said Tuesday night the top contender for Caplan 's job was Attorney General Chris Bentley .
Such a move would set dominoes tumbling and could see new assignments for Children and Youth Services Minister Deb Matthews , Aboriginal Affairs Minister Brad Duguid and Environment Minister John Gerretsen , among others .
Caplan , who was not available for comment , is scion of one of the most prominent Liberal families in Ontario .
His mother , Elinor Caplan , was health minister under premier David Peterson .
She left cabinet under a cloud in 1986 but returned the following year and later served as a federal minister .
MPP for Don Valley East since 1997 , the affable Caplan , a married father of two young sons , has many friends and admirers in the party .
His departure had them in shock .
" None of this happened on his tenure – it's all under George , " said a senior Liberal , referring to Smitherman , health minister from 2003 until 2008 .
" But with the report coming out , David takes the fall and is a good soldier . "
Another long - time friend fought back tears as she described Caplan as " competent , capable and compassionate . "
A high - ranking official insisted Smitherman 's mayoral ambitions " are n't part of the equation " as McGuinty replaces Caplan , but conceded another shuffle looms to address that situation .
Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak , who called Caplan 's ousting " long overdue , " said Smitherman deserves to be punished for the eHealth scandal since he was in charge longer .
" Smitherman should be gone .
Quite frankly , he has one foot already in the mayor 's campaign office . "
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Caplan should have resigned last June when the eHealth scandal erupted with details of $ 16 million in untendered contracts and consultants earning $ 3,000 a day while expensing snacks and meals .
" It 's no surprise ... the minister decided to fall on his sword , " said Horwath .
" I do n't believe this is the end of the situation , though .
I believe there 's a lot more work this government needs to do to restore the confidence of the public . "
McGuinty has banned untendered contracts for high - priced consultants in the wake of the eHealth debacle .
Also under the microscope in Wednesday 's report are the actions of the senior bureaucrat at health , deputy minister Ron Sapsford , who the Star reported Tuesday collects almost $ 500,000 a year in salary and benefits funnelled through a Hamilton hospital .
Sapsford is in charge of day - to - day operations in the health ministry , and oversaw contracts for eHealth .

The Liberals conceded they need to improve disclosure of how senior bureaucrats are paid .
Lucrative salaries for Sapsford and other senior bureaucrats are being channelled through hospitals such as University Health Network and Hamilton Health Sciences to skirt government pay guidelines , a practice Horwath called being " paid through the back door . "
" It 's a good question whether that 's the best way to do it , " acknowledged Smitherman .

The crucial question on Afghanistan today is not whether this war is important .
It is .
It is not whether the consequences of failure are serious .
They are .
It is a much more brutal question : can we win ?
And the answer is no .
Unless we change both our current policies and our present attitudes , failure is inevitable .
The reasons are manifold .
The international community continues to lack a united strategy with clear priorities .
Nato is all over the place .
President Obama 's plan is taking too long to be applied .
British soldiers are fighting the war at full capacity , but their government is not .
Respect for the Karzai government , to which we are tied , is not rising , but falling .
We lack a political plan that works .
And it is far from clear that the military plan is working .
All of this has led to public support for the war eroding at a frightening rate .
There are no quick fixes .
But we need to start immediately , to forge a co-ordinated response to each of these problems and , above all , to show the strategic resolve to see it through .
The central failure is the absence of any clear international strategy .
The British think Afghanistan is Helmand ; the Canadians think it 's Kandahar ; the Dutch think it 's Uruzgan ; the Germans think it 's the north ; and the Americans , until recently at least , thought that the only solution was a kinetic one .
Gordon Brown and his European allies have called for an international conference to review progress .
This will be a waste of time if it does not produce the single united international strategy that has so far been so disastrously lacking .
Nato , too , has to wake up to the fact that it faces a catastrophic failure with very wide consequences for its own future , unless it can start working like an integrated military alliance , rather than a hotchpotch of the committed and the half - hearted .
We now have an Afghan military team of the highest quality in US Generals Petraeus and McChrystal , recently joined by Britain 's new head of the army , General David Richards , the first person to hold that post with actual – and much admired – command experience in Afghanistan .
There is a chance for a new start .
But the word from Washington is that Dick Holbrooke is floundering and the political plan is taking far too long to put together .
Some say the fault lies in Washington infighting , with Holbrooke imprisoned in the state department and ignored by the defence department and the CIA .
Others say the problem is Holbrooke 's personality .
Whatever the reason , there is a perception of lack of co-ordination and drift from Washington .
President Obama 's white paper on Afghanistan in March was excellent .
But why is it taking so long to be properly implemented ?
Much rests on General McChrystal 's imminent , long - anticipated military plan .
He should propose a change in strategy and a change of gear .
The British government needs to change gear too .
Brown 's recent speech should have been a clarion call to the nation .
Instead , it was a lecture on post- rationalisation .
We all know our prime minister will never be Henry V at Agincourt ; his chief means of persuasion is not charisma , but volcanic grumpiness .
Nevertheless , he must find better means to tell us what this war is for , if he is to reverse the alarming erosion in public support .
The British people are not squeamish .
They have shown time and again that they are prepared to put up with pain and sacrifice , provided that they are convinced of the cause and see a reasonable chance of success .
You cannot win a war on half - horsepower .
The prime minister needs to make it clear that this struggle is now the nation 's first priority and we will strain every sinew to win it .
In most of our recent wars , prime ministers have formed a special war cabinet .
Why not now ?
Why not a minister for Afghanistan ?
Why have we not assembled the very brightest in the FCO , DfID , MoD and Cabinet Office to form a co-ordinated team to see this thing through ?
This war will not be won by the bomb and the bayonet .
It will be won by development and local ownership .
So why is increasingly prosperous India at the top of Britain 's aid list , receiving more than twice as much money as the ever more dangerous ( and grindingly poor ) Afghanistan ?
We also need to think again about the Afghan government .
If , despite the cloud hanging over the election , President Karzai is returned to power , we have to ensure that Karzai II is very different from Karzai I .
His government must not be made up of the unfragrant coalition of war lords and crime bosses he put together to get himself elected .
It should be a genuine government of national unity , which will clean out corruption and pursue an aggressive policy of integration of those Taliban who are willing to pursue their aims through the constitution , not the gun .
This should include a recognition by the international community that a programme to strengthen local government , running with the grain of Afghanistan 's tribal structures , will be more effective than pouring more money into government in Kabul .
Tribal politics are the key to Afghanistan , not western models of centralised government .
We must also take a long , hard look at our military tactics on the ground .
The policy of " clear , hold and build " in rural areas might have worked three years ago , but since then , the situation has moved heavily against us .
Now , in the rural areas at least , we are no longer fighting an external insurgency , but , for most of the contested rural areas of Helmand and Kandahar , a war among the people .
The aim of Operation Panther 's Claw was to resurrect our lost opportunity .
The theory was that , if our troops moved in , there would be a spontaneous reaction from the locals , abandoning the Taliban and seeking our protection and development .
But in most cases it has n't happened , leaving our soldiers once again overextended and isolated in Beau Geste - style forts , from which they can only dominate an area large enough to increase their vulnerability to ambush and roadside bombs , but too small to begin the development process .
If this is so , it 's time to consider plan B .
One option would be to concentrate our forces in the cities in future , so as to deepen the effect of the development process where it matters most , and then build out from there as force levels and resources allow .
Beyond that we may even have to consider plan C , a modern version of the old policy of Lord Curzon , but run from Kabul instead of Calcutta , which would use air power and special forces to prevent the Taliban ever again marching on Kabul or becoming a haven for al - Qaida , while we concentrate on the rest of the country outside the Pashtun belt .
All this will be very uncomfortable , but not as uncomfortable as reinforcing failure with more lost lives .
It is not yet lost in Afghanistan .
Not quite .
We are in the territory of the last chance .
There will be no more .
DETROIT -
The first national treatment guidelines for brain metastases , which account for nearly 500,000 new cancers annually in the United States , were released today at the Congress of Neurological Surgeons in New Orleans .
The guidelines were developed by a 20 - member panel in various specialties over the last year after reviewing the literature and reaching a consensus for different treatments .
The panel was headed by neurosurgeon Steven Kalkanis , M.D. , co-director of the Hermelin Brain Tumor Center at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit .
" In the last 10 years , there has been an explosion of new treatments for brain metastases : surgical resection , stereotactic radiosurgery , whole brain radiation therapy , partial brain radiation , chemotherapy and various combinations of all the above , " says Dr. Kalkanis .
" Because of the growth of these new technologies , there has been wide variation among physicians in how to treat patients .
And there has n't been a central source on which treatment regimens give the best results , " adds Dr. Kalkanis .
" Our primary goal was to identify best treatment practices leading to the best outcomes for patients . "
According to Dr. Kalkanis , there were 1.4 million individuals with cancer in 2008 .
Of those , 30 to 40 percent will develop brain metastasis , tumors which travel to the brain from other areas of the body , usually the breast or lung .
On the other hand , there are about 17,000 new cases annually of primary malignant brain tumors , cancers that originate in the brain .
Significantly , in cases where there was not enough data to suggest a guideline or recommendation for a particular treatment , the report lists all relevant ongoing clinical trials as well as needed future studies to inform the medical community and to foster support for continuing this important research .
The new brain metastases guidelines include :
a range of therapeutic options for treating brain metastases ;
the existing evidence used to guide decision - making and its limitations ;
the range of diversity in practice patterns and the various demographic factors that influence clinical decisions ; and
the impact of expert reviews of published clinical evidence on practice regarding treatment options for brain metastases .
This strict evidenced - based protocol was endorsed by not only the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and American Association of Neurological Surgeons , but by the Joint Tumor Section and experts from a wide range of multidisciplinary fields including radiation oncology , medical oncology and neuro - oncology , as well as neurosurgery .

Blocking an enzyme combats some negative effects of sleep deprivation in mice .
Your memory can suffer without some serious shut - eye .
PurestockX
A sleepless night can leave your memory in tatters , but research in mice raises the possibility that a drug could counteract the problem .
Although anyone who has ever been deprived of sleep knows all too well how tiredness can affect the brain , the molecular mechanism behind it has eluded researchers .
" One of the main problems is that sleep deprivation does a lot of things to the brain , and it 's easy to get caught in a mish - mash of different effects , " says Christopher Vecsey of Brandeis University in Massachusetts .
Vecsey was part of a team , led by Ted Abel at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , that examined the effects of sleep deprivation on a region of the brain called the hippocampus .
This is well known to have an important role in learning and memory .
The researchers monitored the levels of several molecules in the hippocampi of mice that had been deprived of sleep for five hours .
Sleepy mice showed increased levels and activity of an enzyme called PDE4 , which acts on a particular suite of molecules that help to consolidate long - term memories .
To confirm that PDE4 was actively impairing memory , the team treated sleep - deprived mice with rolipram , a drug that stops PDE4 from working , and then assessed how well they remembered a fear stimulus .
" When we treated [ mice ] with the drug we found that the memory deficits that they normally would have had with sleep deprivation were prevented , " Vecsey says .
The results are published in Nature1 .
Rolipram and other drugs that inhibit PDE4 are already being researched for their role in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis .
" The problem is that they do have side effects , " Vecsey says .
The team 's results pointed towards only one particular form of the PDE4 enzyme being affected by sleep deprivation .
" If we can design drugs that target this form specifically , successful treatments for some of the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation could be possible , " Vecsey says .
Such drugs could then be used to boost memory in people with sleep disturbances .
But , he says , " it 's important to keep in mind also that the type of effects we were examining here are just one aspect of what sleep deprivation can cause in the brain . "

" People knew that sleep deprivation affects learning and memory , but left it there because they did n't really know how it works , " says Peter Giese , who studies the biology of memory at the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London .
" This paper is the next milestone because it provides a mechanism . "
" It 's interesting that not every pathway is affected by sleep deprivation , which was not really known , " he adds .
" It could have been that all pathways are affected , which would have been a much more complicated result . "
" Miley .
You are a light in a world of darkness .
You were born " Destiny Hope Cyrus " for a reason .
You can't leave everyone now .
We are countin on you .
I understand " it is true one bad apple spoils the bunch " .
But listen to the words of your songs " Stand ... for what you believe in " ... Remember ? " - Billy Ray Cyrus ( Miley 's father )
Welcome to Miley Save Fuzzy
GREAT NEWS !
I now have a dog !
* Fuzzy is dead .
Check the Updates page .
Full story is on a new page : Fuzzy 's Demise .
Make sure you read the disclaimer before you proceed !
The following text is no longer entirely relevant , as the deadline expired .
Page is kept for archiving purposes and to familiarize newcomers with the contents and purpose of this site .
Like many others , I became addicted to Miley Cyrus ' Tweeting .
Catching up with her daily chores and what she has in mind have become part of my daily routine .
You could imagine how painfully shocking it was to learn that Miley will be quitting Twitter for ever - especially for a silly reason I can't even remember , but it goes along the lines of her boyfriend not having a Twitter or something like that .
The other day I asked myself : ' What can I do to bring Miley back to Twitter ? '
Fan video ?
Petitions ?
Letters ?
That never works .
Heck ,
Miley even made her own video about never wanting to use Twitter again .
Then I looked at my cat Fuzzy and I realized , maybe Fuzzy can help .
Fuzzy can make the ultimate sacrifice for this cause .
It was very difficult for me , you see , as I sincerely love Fuzzy .
But my mind is made up .
I could always get another cat , but nothing can replace Miley 's tweets for me !
The idea is very simple .
I 've set a deadline of November 16 , 2009 November 22 , 2009 , when Fuzzy will part with his life and become a meal .
I intend to make a cat dish according to our ethnic cuisine .
Check out the Recipes section for more information .
Also , you can view some pictures of Fuzzy here .
I do not consider myself a cruel person and I do love my cat .
Fuzzy will receive quick and swift death and I 'll try to minimize his suffering .
As a disclaimer I must say that most recipes require to behead or suffocate the cat and then rapidly pluck and dress it .
Unfortunately I have no experience with that so I really hope I wo n't hurt Fuzzy too much ... but I 'm sure eventually everything will be okay !
As soon as the meal is prepared and eaten , I will update the Pictures section with photos of the resulting meal , as well as some notes and impressions from someone who had a first cat - based meal in life .
How can Fuzzy be saved ?
Simple .
Miley Cyrus needs to come back to Twitter .
At least occasionally .
I respect her position , and do not mean to pressure her to do anything against her will !
But still ...
She just can't give something so great to the world and then take it back completely , just like that !
Besides , it does n't have to affect her life in a bad way .
She can just tweet whenever she feels like it .
I do want her to be somewhat active , however .
The deal is basically this : if Miley reopens her account sometime between now and November 16 , 2009 at 10 PM EST November 22 , 2009 at 10 PM EST , Fuzzy 's life will be spared .
However , just reopening the account is not enough .
I want to make sure she 's active again ( even if she 's less active than before , that 's her choice ) .
Which is why , at first , every time Miley tweets , Fuzzy 's cooking deadline extends by one week .
After I see she 's pretty much active again and she 's making several tweets on a somewhat regular basis , the idea of cooking Fuzzy will be abandoned and Fuzzy will live on for the rest of his natural days .
Let me clarify :
This is NOT a prank or a hoax .
I am not joking , even if some will choose to interpret it that way .
Cooking a cat is not illegal in my country , in fact it 's part of our culture .
I 'm not asking for money or any other benefit .
Fuzzy is my cat and I will not entertain any offers of selling or giving him away .
If Miley does n't tweet again , this WILL happen , and I 'm as serious as a heart attack .
I hope Miley comes through .
I 'm sure she already considers coming back anyway .
How can you help ?
Fuzzy 's life is hanging by a thread and will end if I do not achieve my goal .
Ultimately , Miley is the only one who has the power to save Fuzzy .
However , you may be able to temporarily extend the deadline .
You can help by spreading the word around .
Talk about Fuzzy , tweet about Fuzzy ( use the # mileysavefuzzy hashtag ) , raise awareness .
The most important thing is making sure Miley knows about this .
UPDATE : She knows
To keep you motivated , for one time only , in order to help and raise awareness , if #mileysavefuzzy becomes a trending topic on Twitter , the deadline will extend by one week .
( Deadline extended to November 22 , this will no longer extend the deadline )
After that , it 's up to Miley .

Frank Schaeffer is an outspoken critic of the politicized Christian evangelical right .
He sees the “ End Times ” movement as anti-Semitic .
He fears that a right - wing terrorist might assassinate the President of the United States .
None of these talking points would be novel on the left , but Schaeffer is hardly a bleeding heart liberal .
His father , Dr. Francis Schaeffer , is considered to be the godfather of the modern religious right movement .
Schaeffer himself took up the family mission and became a prominent speaker and writer , promoting many of the sentiments that have given rise to the politically active , extremely well organized and zealous movement of today .
He left the religious right in the 1980s , and was a Republican until 2000 .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an interview with Raw Story , Schaeffer — who has a new book coming out this month called Patience with God : Faith for People Who Do n’t Like Religion ( or Atheism ) — discussed his concerns about the radicalization of the Christian right and the increasingly violent rhetoric he foresees turning into actual violence .
“ Since President Obama took office I ’ve felt like the lonely — maybe crazy — proverbial canary in the coal mine , ” Schaeffer said .
“ As a former right wing leader , who many years ago came to my senses and began to try to undo the harm the movement of religious extremism I helped build has done , I ’ve been telling the media that we ’re facing a dangerous time in our history .
A fringe element of the far right Republican Party seems it believes it has a license to incite threatening behavior in the name of God . ”
“ The bestselling status of the Left Behind novels proves that , not unlike Islamist terrorists who behead their enemies , many evangelical / fundamentalist readers relish the prospect of God doing lots of messy killing for them as they watch in comfort from on high , ” he added .
“ They want revenge on all people not like them — forever . ”
The former religious right leader also says he ’s worried President Obama could be assassinated — or that extremists might launch another “ Oklahoma ” type bombing .
“ Sadly that line from the ‘ Godfather ’ sticks in my brain about the fact that anyone can be killed , ” Schaeffer told Raw Story .
“ The scary thing is that there are a number of pastors on record as saying they are praying for the President ’s death .
Can you imagine what some gun-toting paranoid who hears that in a sermon is thinking and might do ?
And to them the fact that ‘ the world ’ likes this black man is reason enough to hate him .
You wait .
The reaction to Obama winning the Nobel Prize will be entirely negative from the far Religious Right .
‘ See the world , all those socialists like him that just proves he ’s a — fill in the blank — communist , secret Muslim , the Antichrist , whatever . ' ”

Schaeffer asserts that he ’s trying to “ right ” the Christian right while also trying to explain God and religion to non-believers .
But ultimately , he has a very critical view of the Christian right and what he believes is the reason for their deep - seated anger : resentment .
He has recently written a column in support of a campaign to prosecute threats of violence and hate speech that may incite violence :
“ The campaign includes letters from attorney Kevin Zeese and myself to Attorney General Eric Holder asking that he take the issue of domestic terror seriously by investigating and prosecuting threats and acts of violence , ” Schaeffer says .
“ I ’m working with others on a campaign to reach religious leaders who enable and encourage this violence , and asking for the launching of investigations into the use of the media and web organizations by the right wing to foment violence .
It is time to combat hate speech . ”

Coming Full Circle
Larisa Alexandrovna :
For those who are not familiar with you and your family , could you please provide a brief summary of your history ?
Frank Schaeffer :
One morning in the early 1980s , I looked out over several acres of pale blue polyester and some twelve thousand Southern Baptist ministers .
My evangelist father — Francis Schaeffer — was being treated for lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic , and in his place I ’d been asked to deliver several keynote addresses on the evangelical / fundamentalist circuit .
I was following in the proudly nepotistic American Protestant tradition , wherein the Holy Spirit always seems to lead the offspring and spouses of evangelical superstars to “ follow the call . ”

A few weeks before , after being introduced by Pat Robertson , I had delivered a rousing take - back - America speech to thousands of cheering religious broadcasters .
And not long after , I would appear at a huge pro-life rally in Denver .
Cal Thomas — once the vice president of Jerry Falwell ’s Moral Majority , who later became a Fox News Commentator — would introduce me as “ the best speaker in America . ”
The “ anointing ” he said , was “ clearly on this young man ! ”
They were saying that I was a better speaker than my famous father .
LA : You mention your father and I think it is important to point out just how well connected your father was and subsequently how important you and your family were to the movement .
FS : [ Yes ] .
At that moment the Schaeffers were evangelical royalty .
When I was growing up in L’Abri , my parents ’ evangelical / fundamentalist religious community in Switzerland , it was not unusual to find myself seated across the dining room table from Billy Graham ’s daughter or President Ford ’s son , even Timothy Leary .
The English actress Glynis Johns used to come for Sunday high tea .
I figured it was normal .
They were just a few of the thousands who made it through our doors .
Only later did I realize that L’Abri attracted a weirdly eclectic group of people who otherwise would not be caught dead in the same room .
My childhood was , to say the least , unusual .

When Gerald Ford died in January of 2007 , I recalled that the day he had assumed the presidency , his daughter - in - law Gayle w as babysitting my daughter Jessica as her job in the work - study program at L’Abri , where Mike Ford , the President ’s son was a student .
Mom and Dad met with presidents Ford , Reagan and Bush Sr. and stayed in the White House several times .
In the 1990s when my mother Edith — then in her eighties — heard that George W. Bush might run for the presidency , she exclaimed , “ What ?
But Barbara asked me to pray especially for young George .
She did n’t think he had what it took to do anything . ”
LA : But you have moved away from that history or perhaps a better way to put it is that the movement moved entirely away from you — from Conservatism to extremism ?
FS : Dad and I were mixing with a new set of people that had not known much , if anything , about my father .
If they had even heard of Dad before he came on the pro-life scene in the mid-seventies , they probably had n’t liked the sound of him .
These people included Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson , James Dobson , James Kennedy and all the rest of the televangelists , radio hosts , and other self - appointed “ Christian leaders ” who were bursting on the scene in the 1970s and early eighties .
ADVERTISEMENT
Compared to Dad these slick media figures were upstarts .
They were “ not our sort of people , ” Dad often said .
What people like Robertson and Falwell got from Dad was some respectability .
Dad had a unique reputation for an intellectual approach to faith .
And his well deserved reputation for frugal ethical living , for not financially profiting from his ministry , for compassion , openness and intellectual integrity , was the opposite of the reputations of the new breed of evangelical leadership , with their perks , planes , and corner offices in gleaming new buildings and superficial glib messages .
Empire builders like Robertson , Dobson and Falwell liked rubbing up against ( or quoting ) my father , for the same reason that popes liked to have photos taken with Mother Teresa .
What I slowly realized was that the religious right leaders we were helping to gain power were not “ conservatives ” at all in the old sense of the word .
They were anti-American religious revolutionaries .
LA : Then you defended Senators Jim Webb ( D - VA ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) for the way they were treated by this movement .
Can you point to a particular issue you took with both the attack on Webb and on McCain ?
What happened after ?
ADVERTISEMENT
FS : I had long since left the evangelical subculture when I wrote an op -ed for the Dallas Morning News , and it was picked up by several hundred blogs and posted on the front page of James Webb ’s campaign website .
I had defended Webb against a series of scabrous attacks wherein his novels were smeared and he was even labeled a “ pedophile ” because he had described a sexual tribal ritual .
I noted that Webb is a serious novelist whose work has been widely praised by many , including Tom Wolfe , who called Webb ’s books , “ The greatest of the Vietnam novels . ”
I also took the Republicans to task for doing to Webb what they did to another war hero , Senator John McCain , back in the 2000 Republican primaries .
I went so far as to say that , in disgust , my wife Genie and I were switching from registered Republicans to independents .
A few days after this op - ed was published I wrote another piece , this time for the Huffington Post , about the reaction to my departure from the Republican Party .
This was picked up by dozens of Democrat - friendly blogs .
As the congratulatory e-mails poured in I was reminded of the welcome given new believers when they converted from some particularly hideous life of sin .
Then the Drudge Report and dozens of other right wing and / or evangelical outlets alerted their faithful to my treason .
Furious e-mails flooded in .
They fell into two categories :
The evangelical “ Church Ladies ” said they had n’t read Webb ’s novels but were shocked by his immorality nonetheless and went to three and four page single - spaced quivering lengths to justify the Republicans ’ tactics ;
The second group were simply profanity - spewing thugs .
The Church Lady emails contrasted markedly with the insults .
It was as if I ’d stumbled into a Sunday school picnic at a Tourette ’s syndrome convention .
“ As a Christian the best question you could ask is what would Jesus do ?
He would n’t give Webb ’s books a pass just because he ’s a veteran .. . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Mr. Schaeffer :
Do n’t let the door hit your ass on the way out you FUCK ! ”
“ Mr. Webb has no excuse for using profanity … ”
“ Good fucking riddance — you fucking cry baby ! ”
“ I have never read any of Mr. Webb ’s novels .
However , the excerpts [ in the Drudge Report ] are very disturbing .
. . .
As for the Bible , yes it has all the things you mentioned : rape , murder , adultery , masturbation , etc .
However , the Lord did not give us graphic details . . .
And I hope as Christians we can remember that and be a voice crying out against ALL the ugly things … ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We do n’t need your lame ass motherfucking comments or your support … ”
When combined the hundreds of emails seemed to boil down to : “ Do what we say Jesus says — and if you do n’t we ’ll kick your head in ! ”
The reaction confirmed why any sane person would run , and keep on running from the right - wing / evangelical / Republican morass as far as their legs would carry them , something I ’d been doing for more than twenty years .
But I had brought this upon myself .
The truth is , that with my father I had once contributed mightily to the creation of the right wing , evangelical / Republican sub -culture that was attacking me .
Alarms Bells Sound
LA : Most recently you have expressed serious concern about right - wing extremism in the name of God and the radicalization of the Christian right since the election of President Obama .
What is it that has you so alarmed ?
FS : Since President Obama took office I ’ve felt like the lonely — maybe crazy — proverbial canary in the coal mine .
As a former right wing leader , who many years ago came to my senses and began to try to undo the harm the movement of religious extremism I helped build has done , I ’ve been telling the media that we ’re facing a dangerous time in our history .
A fringe element of the far right Republican Party seems it believes it has a license to incite threatening behavior in the name of God .
ADVERTISEMENT
They have singled out President Obama as their target .
Since the real President Obama is not who they describe — no , he ’s not the Antichrist , was born in America and does n’t want to kill your grandmother — they have resorted to lies and intimidation to try and stop his agenda of much needed change .
The problem is that I believe that Religious Right leaders and their Republican base are also potentially inciting violence .
Within their numbers are unhinged people who also happen to be well armed .
Rachel Maddow and the readers of Huffington Post and Alternet have heard my warnings and so have a lot of bloggers .
However , most of the media have ignored the looming threat of far right violence while conservatives deride those of us who link crazy talk to the potential of crazy actions .
( I explain and expose the link between evangelical / fundamentalist “ End Times ” theology , politics and violence in my new book Patience With God–Faith For People Who Do n’t Like Religion ( Or Atheism ) .
LA : Have we not seen angry rhetoric before or is this something new , something different ?
FS : David Gergen recently said that the racial attacks on Obama are reminiscent of the atmosphere leading to the killing of President Lincoln .
Thomas Friedman wrote in the New York Times that he saw this same disturbing play of religious hate shortly before Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in Israel .
And Roger Ebert warned of the rise of the fringe in the GOP and how they are undermining democracy .

Of course in [ President ]
Roosevelt ’s time the far - right was pro German and called him a Jew .
LA : This I did not know .
But to the current far - right , why do you think religion , Christianity in particular , has become so politicized ?
FS : Power is a strong drug .
But the most recent power grab goes back to Roe v. Wade .
It was too soon and too fast a change .
That started the whole culture war as we know it .
The bestselling status of the Left Behind novels proves that , not unlike Islamist terrorists who behead their enemies , many evangelical / fundamentalist readers relish the prospect of God doing lots of messy killing for them as they watch in comfort from on high .
They want revenge on all people not like them — forever .
Knowingly or unknowingly , Jenkins and LaHaye cashed in on years of evangelical / fundamentalists ’ imagined victimhood .
I say imagined , because the born - agains had one of their very own , George W. Bush , in the White House for eight long , ruinous years and also dominated American politics for the better part of thirty years before that .
Nevertheless , their sense of being a victimized minority is still very real — and very marketable .
Whether they were winning politically or not , they nurtured a mythology of persecution by the “ other . ”
Evangelical / fundamentalists believed that even though they were winning , somehow they had actually lost .
LA : Can you better explain this mentality ?
FS : I used to be part of the self - pitying , whining , evangelical / fundamentalist chorus .
I remember going on the Today Show with host Jane Pauley back in the late 1970s ( or early 1980s ) .
I debated with the head of the American Library Association about my claim that our evangelical / fundamentalist books were n’t getting a fair shake from the “ cultural elites . ”
We Schaeffers were selling millions of books , but the New York Times never reviewed them .
I made the point that we were being ignored by the “ media elite , ” which was somewhat ironic , given that I had been invited to appear on Today to make that claim .
I dropped out of the evangelical / fundamentalist subculture soon after that Today appearance .
Others carried on where I left off , pushing the victimhood mythology to the next generation of evangelical / fundamentalists , and they have cultivated a following among the terminally aggrieved based on ceaselessly warning them about “ the world . ”
The Radicalization of Religion
LA : Do you think there a direct correlation between the radicalization of Islam by extremists to the radicalization of Christianity by extremists ?
FS : No . we were ready to try and take over America long before the present wave of Islamic - inspired terror started .
But now it ’s another excuse for the far right to hate the “ other . ”
LA : What is it that is driving the Christian right to such extremes ?
Is it fear ?
If so , fear of what ?
Is it something else ?
FS : It is fear of facts .
Look , if you believe in the earth being 6000 years old , that gays chose to be gay and can “ change , ” that Jesus will come back soon , that war in the Middle East is good … what you fear is the real world , the reality - based Americans who know you are dumb , crazy or both .
It is resentment that drives the right .
LA : For those of us who are not familiar with the “ end - times ” movement , could you please summarize what it is ?
How does it relate to Israel ?
FS : The expanding Left Behind entertainment empire also feeds the dangerous delusions of Christian Zionists , who are convinced that the world is heading to a final Battle of Armageddon and who see this as a good thing !
LA : A good thing ?
And what does Zionism have to do with this movement ?
FS : Christian Zionists , led by many “ respectable ” mega - pastors — including Reverend John Hagee — believe that war in the Middle East is God ’s will .
In his book Jerusalem Countdown : A Warning to the World , Hagee maintains that Russia and the Arabs will invade Israel and then will be destroyed by God .
This will cause the Antichrist — the head of the European Union — to stir up a confrontation over Israel between China and the West .
LA : Wait a moment .
Aside from the obvious of the real geopolitical allegiances and resource interests — making this scenario less likely than all of us packing up and moving to Mars soon — they believe this is a good thing ?
FS : Yes .
It will “ prove ” that they will “ inherit the earth . ”
In other words they ’ve spent their lives feeling left behind by culture and scholarship .
If the “ End ” comes , they get the last laugh .
So they cling to this like an addict clinging to his last fix .
Perhaps , in the era of Obama , Hagee will do a fast rewrite and say that President Obama is the Antichrist , because the same folks who are into Christian Zionism are also into the far , far loony right of the Republican Party represented by oddities like Sarah Palin .
These are the same people who insist that President Obama is a “ secret Muslim , ” “ not an American , ” and / or “ a communist , ” “ more European than American , ” or whichever one of those contradictory things is worse — not like us anyway , that ’s for sure .
Christian Zionists support any violent action by the State of Israel against Arabs and Palestinians because the increasingly brutal State of Israel is , in the fevered evangelical / fundamentalist mind , the nation presently standing in for Jesus as avenger on evildoers everywhere , by which they mean Arabs and others not like us .
Christian Zionists are yet another reason why I and countless other Christians , including many of the more moderate evangelicals , mainline Protestants , Roman Catholics , and Orthodox are hesitant to be labeled “ Christian . ”
Who wants to be confused with some of the most dangerous and stupid people in the world : nuclear - armed , paranoid evangelical / fundamentalist Bible - thumpers rooting for Armageddon on and worrying in paranoid “ official ” documents about being forced to become like “ the Europeans ” ?
( Just a thought : does that make high - speed rail service a tool of the Devil ? )
LA : Being a Jew , this idea of Christian Zionism sounds very much like anti-Semitism .
Would you say that Christian Zionism — and the whole end - times philosophy — is anti-Semitic or am I misunderstanding it ?
FS : Yes .
The “ purpose ” of the Jews is to be there to be killed after the Second Coming .
Christian Zionists love Israel the way oncologists love cancer .
It ’s a good living .
Jews who play footsie with evangelicals in return for the “ support ” of the State of Israel are fools .
LA : What do you fear will happen ?
Who or what do you fear will be targeted ?
FS : I do n’t fear large scale violence .
I fear another Oklahoma type bombing , and most of all the assassination of President Obama .
Sadly that line from the “ Godfather ” sticks in my brain about the fact that anyone can be killed .
The scary thing is that there are a number of pastors on record as saying they are praying for the President ’s death .
Can you imagine what some gun-toting paranoid who hears that in a sermon is thinking and might do ?
And to them the fact that “ the world ” likes this black man is reason enough to hate him .
You wait .
The reaction to Obama winning the Nobel Prize will be entirely negative from the far Religious Right .
“ See the world , all those socialists like him that just proves he ’s a — fill in the blank — communist , secret Muslim , the Antichrist , whatever . ”
LA : How would you describe the audience to whom this violence is marketed ?
FS : This is rube white America .
This is the cracker fundamentalist South .
These are the Sarah Palin “ He ’s Not - A - Real - American ” Obama haters .
These are the people waiting for Jesus to come back and / or the UN to take over the world or the Army to take their guns .
LA : Who do you see as fueling this rhetoric ?
FS : Fox News , Rupert Murdoch , Glenn Beck … we all know this crew .
And of course there ’s Rush Limbaugh .
But worst of all are not the famous leaders but the every day religious leaders feeding hate .
Look how they came together in California to push prop 8 .
Behind them are those like James Dobson who has told his followers to beat their children into submission .
He is always looking for new enemies and is now aiming at gays .
But none of this would happen if there were not thousands of pastors and followers whose idea of faith is to divide themselves from the “ other . ”
LA : What do you think motivates these media personalities , politicians , and so forth ?
Are they true believers or opportunists ?
FS : I ’ll speak for the ones I know personally .
Dobson gave away 150,000 copies of one of my far right 80 ’s hate screeds .
He had me on his show .
His intentions started out as good .
Then he got used to power and became a genuine egomaniac .
Pat Robertson is a genuine lunatic .
I ’ve been on Fox talking about my military - friendly books before they put me on their shit list .
They are just plain stupid .
LA : Have you seen similar extremism from left - wing Christians ?
If so , how is it the same or different from what you observe from the right - wing ?
FS : I would n’t say I ’ve seen the same levels of hate and outright lies from the left .
If you read the comments on places like Huff Post they are shrill sometimes but no one is being condemned to hell , and people try and stick to facts .
The amazing thing about the religious right is the combination of lies , myth and hate into a rather unique blend .
LA : What do you think a workable solution might entail ?
Some would argue that no matter how hateful , ugly , even violent the speech , it is still protected speech .
How then do you think your concerns could be addressed in that context ?
FS : All I ’d say is this :
The hate speech of the right ought to draw the same level of public and governmental attention as , say , Muslim hate speech .
If we take bin Laden seriously when he talks about God hating America ’s sins , we should take the America extremists as seriously .
There should be no free ride for these idiots carrying weapons near presidential or other political gatherings .
People like Operation Rescue should be investigated to see how many of their members are planning to murder more abortion providers .
And if you want to know what the greatest threat to our president is , look no further than where evangelical “ Christianity ” intersects with Glenn Beck ’s fans .
The FBI should seize his fan letter email .
I ’ll bet they ’d find some very interesting folks out there , people in militias , far right hate groups , and all the rest .
LA : How do you think your father would react if he were still alive today ?
How about Jesus ?
FS : Dad would despise Glenn Beck .
My father was not a hater .
He opposed abortion on demand and Roe .
But he never bashed gays but welcomed them and everyone else in his ministry .
Even before he died in 1985 he told me that he thought Robertson was a nut , Falwell crass , and Dobson power - hungry .
Except for the abortion issue my father was center left , interested in art and culture .
As for Jesus , well , I wo n’t speak for him , but let me just say that if “ conservatives ” are now going to edit out the “ liberal ” parts of the Bible , they better cut the four Gospels in their entirety .
LA : Thank you for your time .

Some people will tell you that slow is good - and it may be , on some days - but I am here to tell you that fast is better .
Being shot out of a cannon will always be better than being squeezed out of a tube .

Science reporter , BBC News
Brain waves appear to have a direct effect on behaviour Researchers have used electrodes to make people move in slow motion .
The scientists " boosted " human subjects ' brain waves - applying a small alternating current via electrodes on the volunteers ' scalps .
These waves are patterns generated naturally by groups of neurons , or brain cells , firing in a rhythm .
In the journal Current Biology , the researchers described how their finding shows that brain waves directly affect human behaviour .
The results also reveal clues about movement disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , sufferers of which have difficulty making voluntary movements .
Lead author Professor Peter Brown , from University College London in the UK , said : " We induced the same patterns as you see in normal brains via electrodes . "
He and his team boosted one specific form of relatively low frequency brain wave called a beta oscillation .
" Different parts of the brain work together and generate certain frequencies , " he explained , " and the movement areas of the brain come together in beta activity .
" That activity is suppressed just prior to and during movement , so we think the body gets rid of it to prepare to make a new movement . "
Boosting beta brain waves slowed people 's movement by 10 %
To investigate the effect of this beta activity , the research team gave healthy human subjects electrical stimulation through their scalps .
" The currents we use are very small ... but [ they ] shape the likelihood of neurons firing in the imposed rhythm , " he told BBC News .
During the test each volunteer was shown a dot on a computer screen .
They were able to control another marker on the same screen with a joystick .
" The dot jumped to a new location and when they were signalled to by an alarm they had to move [ their marker ] to that new location as quickly as they could , " Professor Brown explained .
" When we applied the beta stimulation that quick movement was slowed by 10 % .
" So we have a direct experiment showing a causal link between the oscillations and the behaviour , " he said .
Professor Brown explained that beta activity was important in Parkinson 's disease .
" So this information is very helpful , " he said .
" Since we 've shown that this slows people down , it tells us what Parkinson 's disease treatments should be trying to suppress . "
Professor John Stein , a neuroscientist from the University of Oxford pioneered the theory of what he refers to as a " beta straitjacket " - a pattern of brain activity that prevents Parkinson 's disease patients from making voluntary movements .
" The theory is that ... in Parkinson 's disease when people try to move they cannot suppress beta [ brain waves ] and therefore cannot move , " he told BBC News .
" This study is the first to show ... in normal subjects that beta activity actually slows movement .
This supports a causal role for [ the ] activity in causing a fixed posture and tending to prevent voluntary movements . "

More than half of sudden unexplained infant deaths occur while the infant is sharing a bed or a sofa with a parent ( co- sleeping ) and may be related to parents drinking alcohol or taking drugs , suggests a study published on the British Medical Journal website .
Although the rate of cot death in the UK has fallen dramatically since the early 1990s , specific advice to avoid dangerous co-sleeping arrangements is needed to help reduce these deaths even further , say the researchers .
The term sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) was introduced in 1969 as a recognised category of natural death that carried no implication of blame for bereaved parents .
Since then , a lot has been learnt about risk factors , and parents are now advised to reduce the risk of death by placing infants on their back to sleep , placing infants in the " feet to foot " position at the bottom of the cot , and keeping infants in a smoke - free environment .
But it is not clear which risk messages have been taken on board in different social or cultural groups , and little is known about the emergence of new or previously unrecognised risk factors .
So a team of researchers at the Universities of Bristol and Warwick studied all unexpected infant deaths from birth to two years in the southwest region of England from January 2003 to December 2006 .
advertisement
To investigate a possible link between SIDS and socioeconomic deprivation , they compared these deaths with a control group at ' high risk ' for SIDS ( young , socially deprived mothers who smoked ) as well as a randomly selected control group .
Parents were interviewed shortly after the death and information was collected on alcohol and drug use .
A detailed investigation of the scene and circumstances of death was also conducted by trained professionals .
Of the 80 SIDS deaths analysed , more than half ( 54 % ) occurred whilst co-sleeping compared to 20 % co-sleeping rate amongst both control groups .
Much of this risk may be explained by the combination of parental alcohol or drug use prior to co-sleeping ( 31 % compared with 3 % random controls ) , and the high proportion of co-sleeping deaths on a sofa ( 17 % compared with 1 % random controls ) , say the authors .
A fifth of SIDS infants were found with a pillow for the last sleep and a quarter were swaddled , suggesting potentially new risk factors emerging .
advertisement
The risk factors were similar whichever group the SIDS cases were compared with , suggesting that these risk factors for SIDS apply to all sections of the community and are not just a consequence of social deprivation .
Some of the risk reduction messages seem to be getting across and may have contributed to the continued fall in the SIDS rate , say the authors .
However , the majority of the co-sleeping SIDS deaths occurred in a hazardous sleeping environment .
The safest place for an infant to sleep is in a cot beside the parental bed in the first six months of life , they write .
Parents need to be advised to never put themselves in a situation where they might fall asleep with a young infant on a sofa .
They also need to be reminded that they should never co-sleep with an infant in any environment if they have been drinking or taking drugs .
We have learnt that SIDS is largely preventable , says Edwin Mitchell , Professor of Child Health Research at the University of Auckland , in an accompanying editorial .
It is important to monitor parents ' knowledge and infant care practices to inform health education and promotion .
Implementing what we already know has the potential to eliminate SIDS , the challenge now is how to change behaviour , he concludes .
Chilled Water Cools MIT Physics Department
September 3rd , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Here ’s a very good example of simple tech that works efficiently .
Because hot air rises , cool air falls down .
So if chilled water is carried through tubes at the ceiling , it sucks hot air from a room ; sending down the cooler air .
Simple tech is often low carbon technology too .
Chilled beams use water to remove heat from a room .
This is the opposite of radiant heating ; in which pipes carry hot water in pipes embedded in a mortar for a stone or tile floor .
The potential reduction in fossil fuel use of using chilled beams instead of a traditional air conditioning system can be as much as 50 % .
“ Chilled ” is a bit of a misnomer ; as the water does n’t even need to be chilled .
Even just running city water through this system will work as typical city water is about 55 degrees
Fahrenheit ; enough to cool a 90 degree room .
This works as a heat exchange .
If we used a system like this to cool every building we could achieve a cooling carbon reduction of 50 % over 2009 levels .
Fossil fuel use in heating and cooling buildings accounts for about 40 % of our national carbon emissions .
This year ’s climate bill contains incentives ( Cap and Trade ) for us to make reductions in fossil fuel use .
Cap and Trade just means using fees ( for choosing high carbon energy ) to fund incentives ( to help us buy low carbon energy ) .
The national building codes in the Climate Bill could do for the country what California building codes did for California : effortlessly cut our carbon footprint to half that of the nation : near European levels .
If you live near Boston , you can go check out how effective this innovative system is , and see if you can improve on the idea .
The first installation is at MIT ’s 49,000 square foot physics department ; in buildings 4 , 6 , and 8 , and next up is the new MIT Sloan School expansion and the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research .
“ Chilled beams cool the people and dehumidify the air in the room .
They take one - tenth the volume of fresh
air needed for traditional A/C , far less ductwork , smaller ducts , and smaller fans , ” says David Cooper ; manager of sustainability engineering and utility planning for the Department of Facilities .
This is a great passive cooling system for offices , laboratories , data centers and other spaces where equipment and sunlight generate a significant amount of heat .
“ There ’s a factor of eight improvement in cost of moving a Btu of air cooled by water versus air .
If you can get the cooling energy into the space through water , you ’re way ahead , ” says Cooper .
“ The eight times factor is a very attractive alternative from an energy point of view . ”
More ways to heat and cool our nation ’s buildings to reduce our national carbon footprint :
Recycling waste heat from air conditioners
Airport with 40 % lower fossil fuel
Very cheap DIY solar hot water
Very efficient solar hot water
Making energy from waste

You do n't often see Silent Hill at the center of a " games made me do it " controversy , but a thirty - five - year - old man claims that Konami 's psychological horror series inspired him to break into a hospital basement and shut off the electricity .
The man , identified only as Jan H. , claims to have been in a state of psychosis and believed he was playing the game .
Jan infiltrated the basement of Sophia Hospital in the Netherlands last April , where he shut off the power and forced a blackout for forty - five minutes .
People were trapped in elevators and doctors had to manually keep intensive care patients breathing .
Fortunately , nobody was hurt .
Amazingly , he was found not guilty in a trial last week as the court ruled Jan had " no idea of the true consequences of his deed . "
Jan claims that , during his warped state of mind , he believed that shutting off the hospital power would allow him to acquire a toothbrush as part of some convoluted Silent Hill puzzle .

' They accused me of being drunk '
By Jane Elliott
Health reporter
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement A stranger put her hands on James Downie 's car and begged him not to drive .
She wrongly thought his slurred speech and unsteady gait were the result of excess alcohol .
" She said ' you ca n't drive in that condition ' , " said James .
" I showed her my disabled badge and said ' what ?
My disabled condition ? ' and she felt very bad about it . "
James , 29 , has a progressive neurological condition called ataxia .
Seeming drunk Ataxia - which means ' lack of order ' - can affect walking , speech , and co-ordination .
Many wrongly think that the person with the condition is simply drunk .
In terms of stopping the progression there is nothing
Dr Julie Greenfield " I also had an argument with an airport guy who would not let me board a plane because he thought I was drunk , " said James , who says he is annoyed and distressed by the wrong assumptions .
" He said ' you have been drinking have n't you ! '
I was in my wheelchair , but he would n't listen .
Thankfully a colleague of his dealt with me .
" A lot of bars wo n't let me in either because they think I am drunk . "
Ignored symptoms James , from Surrey , first started noticing problems at the age of 15 when he started becoming more clumsy and found sport increasingly difficult .
He knew he had a problem , but ignored it until his symptoms progressed .
At the age of 21 James was diagnosed with Freidreich 's ataxia - the most common of the ataxias ( there are thought to be dozens ) .
" I locked myself away when I was first diagnosed , " he said .
" I tried to ignore it and pretend it was n't going to get any worse .
" If I did anything wrong I would go mad - if I dropped a plate I would punch the wall . "
There is currently no cure for the condition , which affects over 10,000 people in the UK .
Dr Greenfield is working to try to find a cure
But despite the prevalence a recent study by the charity Ataxia UK showed that just 7 % of the public know what it is .
The charity is attempting to raise the profile of the condition .
Consultant neurologist Dr Paola Giunti is a world authority on ataxias and established the first ataxia centre in the UK , based at University College London .
She said they are working to alleviate symptoms and find a cure .
" Currently there is no treatment for ataxias , and only a few clinicians have expertise in dealing with them , " she said .
" Treatment is directed at helping patients cope with their symptoms and improving the quality of their lives .
" We are also very active in research .
We have been recently identified a gene which is responsible for one type of ataxia called spinocerebellar ataxia 11 .
" We are also involved in a European trial for a drug for the most common genetic ataxia , Friedreich 's Ataxia . "
No cure Dr Julie Greenfield , from Ataxia UK , said it was important not to underestimate how a severe case of ataxia could affect the person with it .
A recent study of 215 people with ataxia by Ataxia UK found that just under half ( 46 % ) of those questioned they felt isolated by the disease .
More than one in three ( 34 % ) was currently living in a home that is no -longer suitable for them .
The research also found that over three in five ( 65 % ) people with the condition were concerned about the future and one in five ( 19 % ) were facing financial difficulties because of their condition .
ATAXIA
The first symptoms are usually clumsiness and unsteady gait .
This can progress to an inability to walk Ataxia can also affect vision , hearing and speech
The condition can be mild or severe Dr Greenfield said the unpredictability of the condition is particularly distressing .
" Some cases are really severe and some are n't , " she said .
" Because these conditions are progressive you know you are getting worse over time - and it is something you have no control over .
" There is quite a lot going on , but at the moment people will have physio and medication for the symptoms such as tremor and muscle spasm .
" In terms of stopping the progression there is nothing . "

The scientific community is buzzing over thousands of emails and documents -- posted on the Internet last week after being hacked from a prominent climate - change research center -- that some say raise ethical questions about a group of scientists who contend humans are responsible for global warming .
The correspondence between dozens of climate - change researchers , including many in the U.S. , illustrates bitter feelings among those who believe human activities cause global warming toward rivals who argue that the link between ...
I was a big believer in Ted Ginn Jr. in 2008 .
I thought he had the chance to really be a breakout wide receiver , but he fell well short with just 56 catches , 790 yards and 2 TD .
As we prepare for the start of the 2009 campaign , I find myself back in the same quandary .
Could this be the year that Ginn emerges as a must start fantasy option ?
He did take a step forward last season , improving from 34 catches and 420 yards in his rookie season , though it was n’t enough for him to crack our Top 25 ( click here to view ) .
Part of that can be credited to the presence of a steady quarterback in Chad Pennington , who was able to get him the ball consistently and allow him to make plays .
The touchdowns are a concern , with Anthony Fasano leading the way with seven .
A lot of that likely had to do with Pennington ’s adjusting to the offense .
Part could be due to the offense itself .
Remember , this is the team that brought the Wildcat offense to the NFL .
Ronnie Brown saw some time behind center , though he only threw three passes .
Still , with him rushing for 10 TD , as well as Ricky Williams getting four , there were n’t that many opportunities to score via the air .
Ginn helped to offset that by getting two touchdowns on the ground .
I know , four TDs are not going to blow your socks off .
Still , with continued growth and Pennington settling in , I could easily see him adding a few more TDs this season .
The Dolphins face the Falcons , who boasted the 21st best passing defense in the league last season .
While they added DT Peria Jerry through the draft , that does little to improve the passing defense .
Ginn enters the season as the team ’s # 1 receiver and I easily could see him posting a solid game .
Last season he had a pair of seven catch games , but only once surpassing 100 yards .
I would n’t expect him to get there , at least not in Week 1 .
As for what I would expect him to do :
Receiving – 5 receptions , 83 yards , 1 TD
Those are stats that I ’d take on my team and are certainly usable .
Maybe I ’m a little too optimistic , but I ’d recommend having him in my line - up for Week 1 .
What do you think ?
Is Ginn a player that you think is worth using in Week 1 ?
Why or why not ?

By
At the straw market in Nassau , in the Bahamas , — famous for stuff like the straw handbags below — I recently encountered a distinctive culture of bargaining that made me stop and ponder the subject ( on a beach , aided by rum ) .
The pondering resulted in a neat little flash of insight that allowed me to synthesize everything I know about the subject in a way that surprised me .
The short version : game - theoretic and information - theoretic approaches to the subject are something between irrelevant and secondary .
What drives bargaining behaviors and outcomes is story - telling skill .
Here ’s how you can learn the skills that really matter in being a successful bargainer .
The Simple , Elegant and Wrong Answer
Buyer A and seller B are haggling over product P. Neither knows what price the other is willing to settle for , but A wants P at the lowest price B might sell , and B wants to sell at the highest price A might be willing to pay .
You model the situation as a sequential move game , with each move being , at its simplest , a price .
You might represent the progress of the game thus , as pairs of B - A call - response moves :
( $ 200 , $ 100 ) , ( $ 180 , $ 120 ) , ( $ 160 , $ 140 ) , ( $ 150 , SOLD ! )
At each turn , each player uses the history of previous offers / counter - offers to estimate the true limit of the other party , and makes an offer that induces the other to move his price - point as much as possible while revealing as little as possible of his own limit .
Throw in some bounded rationality and a value on time , and you have the sort of framing economists like .
You could mathematically model this ( no doubt , somebody already has analyzed this to death and proved all sorts of convergence results ) .
One example of such an analysis is in the classic game - theoretic decision analysis book , Thinking Strategically ( an excellent read , by the way , for what it sets out to do ) .
But neat though this mathematical formulation is , it is fundamentally wrong - headed .
Bargaining is n’t primarily driven by parties attempting to ( bounded ) rationally guess each other ’s limit points by doing ( non-trivial ) real - time analysis of number sequences .
Yes , the alternating sequence of numbers does carry information , but in most real situations , information is primarily conveyed in other , non-quantitative ways , and the relevant information is n’t even about price .
Let ’s examine two examples before I present my alternate model of bargaining .
Real - World Examples
Example 1 : The Bahamian Turtle
In Nassau , I bought this coconut - shell toy turtle for my nephew , for $ 5 :
The seller , a pretty young woman , came up to us and engaged us with , not one , but three moves all at once , and persuaded me to close , before I had a chance to make a counter - offer :
Seller :
You like this turtle ?
Nice toy for child !
Eight dollars !
Seller ( conspiratorial whisper , eyes darting left and right ) :
Tell you what , I make you a deal , only six dollars .
Me ( doubtfully ) : Hmm … My Wife ( enthusiastically ) : oh , it ’s so cute ; we should get one for Arjun [ my nephew ] !
Seller : Alright , I give it to you for five dollars .
What color bead you want lady ?
[ the thing has a bead on the string that is not visible in this picture ] .
This one is , in a sense , a non-starter example , since I got played before we got to bargaining .
Let ’s take a longer example where I acquitted myself better .
Example 2 : The Jaipur Good - Cop / Bad-Cop
In Jaipur , India , on a vacation recently , my wife wanted to buy herself a traditional Rajasthani kurta , or shirt .
Translating from Hindi , the exchange went roughly as follows ( I may be misremembering the prices , but the gist is accurate ) :
Me : How much ?
Seller : 300 rupees Me : That ’s too much , how about 175 ?
Seller : Come on sir , at that price , I wo n’t even recover my costs !
Me : No , 175 is the reasonable price for this kind of item .
Seller : Arrey , come on sir !
Just look at this fine needlework ; you may have seen similar stuff for less in other shops , but if you look closely , the work is n’t as delicate !
Me :
Of course I can see the quality of the work , that ’s why we want to buy it , now come on , quote me the right price .
Seller : Okay sir , for you , I ’ll let it go for 250 ( starts folding up the kurta ) .
Me :
No no , this lady may not be Indian , but I am ; be reasonable [ my wife is Korean , and since I had n’t mentioned that she was my wife , the shopkeeper had almost certainly assumed I was her local guide — many other shopkeepers had in fact called out to me to bring her into their stores , offering me a commission ! ]
Seller :
But I did quote the price for you sir , for foreigners , we normally ask for at least 4-500 !
Me : Fine , tell you what , I ’ll give you 190 .
Seller : Come on sir , at that price , I do n’t even make a profit of 10 rupees !
Me : Fine , let ’s do this deal .
200 ; final offer .
Seller ( looking upset ) : But …
At this point , the seller ’s boss , probably the store owner , who ’d been poring over a ledger in the background , looked up , interrupted and said shortly , “ Ca n’t you see the lady wants it ?
Just give it to them for 200 , let ’s cut this short ! ”
I have several other examples I could offer ( in the US , bargaining tends to be restricted to larger purchases like cars ) , but these two examples suffice to illustrate the points I want to pick out .
The Phenomenology
There are several features of interest here .
Here is a round dozen :
Fake moves :
In the Bahamian example , consider the rapid series of three prices offered with a very quick change of subject to the color of the bead at the first sign that I wanted to buy .
This bargaining is clearly fake , the numbers being part of the initial courtship ritual rather than the actual price negotiations , which were short - circuited .
Bargaining as bait :
The sellers in the Nassau marketplace promote their wares with a curious mix of American retail rhetoric ( “ C’mon honey !
Everything 50 % off today ” ) and more traditional bargain - hunter bait ( “ You want a handbag sir , for the pretty lady ?
C’mon I make you a deal ! ” ) .
I suspect very little serious bargaining actually takes place , since the customers are largely American cruise ship tourists , who are not used to bargaining for the small amounts in play in these transactions .
Qualitative Re-valuation : Consider the variety of non-quantitative moves in the Jaipur example .
In the ‘ fine needlework ’ move , the seller attempted to change my valuation of the object , rather than move the price point .
I accepted the point , but indicated I ’d already factored that in .
Narrative : A narrative also developed , inviting me to cast myself as the knowledgeable insider who was being offered the smart Indian deal , as opposed to the high - mark - up offered to clueless foreigners .
This is a key point that I will return to .
Deal - breaker feints :
Twice , the seller attempted to convince me that I was offering him a price he could not accept .
These are rhetorical feints .
A similar move on the customer ’s part is to pretend to walk away ( that old saw about the key to negotiation being the willingness to walk away is n’t much use in practice , but pretending to walk away is very useful ) .
Closure Bluffs : another interesting feature of the Indian example is the closure bluff ; a non-serious price accompanied by closure moves ( such as starting to package the item ) , on the off - chance that the other party may panic and fold early .
Good Cop : Finally , note the second individual stepping in to make the deal towards the end ( this dynamic is particularly common in traditional retail stores in India , where the owner , or seth and accountant , or munim , will often be watching the salesmen at work , stepping in at the right moment .
The psychological key to this is an implicit sense of escalation and respect : “ forget that unimportant lackey , clearly you ’re a smart customer and I , the boss , will deal with you personally and cut you a special deal that my lackey is n’t authorized to offer . ” )
Ritual :
In most cultures of bargaining , there are also moves of ritual significance .
In India , the best - known one is the bohni , or first sale of the day .
Sellers will often plead with customers to close the deal , since it would constitute the bohni and also assert that the price being offered is a really good deal because of the seller ’s anxiety to finish his bohni .
This is not entirely a pragmatic sort of move — the bohni does matter to traditional merchants , who will often actually take a bit of a hit on the first transaction for luck , to get the cash flow started .
Curiously , I also encountered a much more open version of this in the Bahamas , where one shopkeeper said it plainly , “ C’mon honey , first customer gets best deal ! ”
I suspect anthropologists would find an equivalent in every culture besides modern fixed - price retail .
Knowledge Bluffs :
Though I did n’t use them , knowledge bluffs are common in bargaining ( “ I saw that same thing in Delhi for half the price ! ” ) .
These are bluffs because if the buyer really knows something about the cost structure of the seller , that information is usually quickly deployed and factored out , reducing the bargaining to a matter of “ what is the convenience - value to me of buying here rather than in that other place ? ”
Why do they still work ?
I ’ll tell you in a moment .
The Justice Bluff : Surprisingly , in the form of a bluff , a notion of fair price often enters even the purest free - market exchanges .
This is usually brought into play via displays of mock anger at being treated unfairly .
Surprisingly , even sellers will do this , attempting to convey a clear sense of disgust by putting away the items under discussion .
But there are boundaries : sellers will rarely plead to make a sale on the basis of personal need , since this subtly moves the situation from a peer - transaction to a ( morally unacceptable ) charity transaction .
My mom once bought some vaseline from a tearful door - to - door saleswoman who apparently genuinely broke down and said , “ buy some just out of sympathy please ! ”
My mom caved .
Boundary Blurring :
If a full transaction has three parts ( discovery / selection , negotiations , closing ) , elements of bargaining often creep out of their nominal home in the middle section .
For example , in traditional Indian full - service retail , the sales staff will often pull out a vast selection — more than necessary or asked for — visibly doing a lot of work , creating a clear sense of pressure .
On the other side , towards the end of a transaction , sometimes the customer will throw in surprise in - kind requests after the deal seems closed .
“ Alright , I am buying this car from you for more than I wanted , how about you throw in some floor mats ? ”
Non-influence of actual knowledge :
Though there is a lot of bluffing , there is not much actual information about price limits in play .
In every example I ’ve encountered , at least for small amounts , buyers and sellers do not attempt to guess limits directly ( beyond having a ballpark “ reasonable ” figure in mind that may be utterly irrational ) .
It is obvious that the buyer may not even have a “ walk away ” limit price in his / her head , but what is not so obvious is that even the seller may not have such a price in mind .
Cost structures can be murky even to sellers , and other hard - to - value elements may be in play , like prospects for future sales , desire to clear slow - moving inventory , and the like .
Actual price information usually enters the picture only when the amounts are significant , in which case the parties generally do their research beforehand , and attempt to factor that information out of the bargaining stage altogether .
Bargaining is primarily about ownership of the unknown factors in pricing , and is a high - cost process , and it is in the interest of both parties not to bother bargaining about mutually - acknowledged certainties .
The Right Model
So that ’s all very well .
There are lots of psychological subtleties involved .
But is this all really important ?
Is it possible to just cut the Gordian knot and become really good at some sort of game - theoretic model ?
Would all the bluffing and qualtiative nuances vanish under the right sort of time - series modeling ?
The answers are yes and no respectively .
Yes , you do need to work with the full thing ; game theory wo n’t cut the Gordian knot for you .
And no , you will not be able to subsume all the bluffing and complexity no matter how much you crunch the numbers .
So you do need to appreciate the qualitative sound - track of the bargaining , but no , do n’t be discouraged — I am not suggesting that the only meaningful model is a localized sui generis ethnography .
Universal models and approaches to bargaining are possible .
What actually happens in a bargaining transaction is the co-construction of a storyline that both sides end up committing to .
Every move has a qualitative and a quantitative part .
The prototypical transaction pair can be modeled roughly as :
(( p1 , v1 ) , ( p2 , v2 ) )
Where the p’s are qualitative statements and the v’s are price statements .
The key is that the qualitative parts constitute a language game ( in the sense of people like Stalnaker ) .
Each assertion is either accepted or challenged by subsequent assertions .
The set of mutually accepted assertions serves to build up a narrative of increasing inertia , since every new statement must be consistent with previous ones to maintain credibility , even if it is only the credibility of a ritual rather than literal storyline .
This is the real reason why there is apparent spinning - of - wheels where the price point may not move for several iterations .
For example in the Indian kurta case , I rejected the seller ’s assertion that 175 would represent a loss , but acknowledged ( but successfully factored out ) the “ this is fine needlework ” assertion .
Though the price point was n’t moving , the narrative was .
At a more abstract level , a full narrative with characters and plot may develop .
This is also the reason why knowledge bluffs work — even if the seller knows the buyer cannot have seen the same item for half the price in another store , he cannot call out the bluff in an obvious way since that would challenge the ( always positive ) role in which the buyer is cast .
The key conclusion from all this ?
The transaction moves to closure when the emerging logic of the narrative becomes overwhelming , not when price transparency has been achieved .
To bargain successfully , you must be able to control the pace and direction of the development of the narrative .
At a point of narrative critical mass , something snaps and either a new narrative must displace the old one ( rare ) , or there must be a movement towards closure .
Becoming a Right - Brained Bargainer
So here is my magic solution : become good at story - telling based conversations .
Walk in , not with a full - fledged plan / story , but a sense of what roles you can comfortably fill ( straight - dealer ?
cynic ?
know - it - all ?
Innocent student without much to spend ? )
As the conversation progresses , try to sense what roles the other party is trying on for size , and suggest ones favorable to you ( “ Look , I try to buy only from local merchants , and you guys do are doing a great job for the economy of our town , but … ” ) .
Say things that move towards a locked - in role on both sides that favors you .
In the example above , I got “ locked in ” into the role of “ knowledgeable local ” on disadvantageous terms .
Look out for the narrative logic as it develops .
For example , I successfully resisted an attempt to bring “ fine needlework ” assertion into play , which would have moved the story from “ guy looking for cheap deal ” to “ connoisseur transaction ” and a premium - value storyline .
There are critical / climactic points where you can move decisively for closure ; watch and grab .
In my case , I thought I had one when the seller offered the “ Not even 10 rupees ” move , but the owner cutting in for the kill and accepting was a clue that I could have pushed lower .
Be aware of the symbolic / narrative significance of your numerical moves .
If the seller moves from 200 to 180 , and you move from 100 to 120 , the very symmetry of your move shows that you have no information at all to use for leverage , and the transaction is likely to proceed dully to a bisection unless you do something creative .
If the seller offers 500 and you say 250 , that reveals that you may be using a “ start at half ” heuristic , which might create an opening for the seller to launch a storyline of “ really , 500 is a fair price , here ’s why . ”
Offering “ 275 ” instead creates the right sort of ambiguity .
If you do want to drive towards a symmetric - bisection storyline , make sure you pick an irrational starting point , but not one so irrational that it reveals you know nothing about the price ( irrationally low opening offers can work , but you need a 201 level bargaining course to learn why ) .
Now , this is n’t easy .
You have to become a storyteller .
But I never said I was going to offer an easy answer ; merely a better one than a misguided attempt to do real - time game - theoretic computations .
Thousands of university places could be left unfilled and institutions millions of pounds out of pocket , because high fee - paying international students are being blocked from starting degrees under a new visa system , vice - chancellors warned yesterday .
Universities fear wealthy foreigners , who can pay more than £ 20,000 a year for degree courses , according to data compiled for the Guardian , will be put off studying in Britain by massive delays in processing visa applications , prompting a funding crisis .
In Pakistan alone , a backlog of 14,000 applications has caused havoc for students who had been due to start courses this term .
Universities UK ( UUK ) , the vice - chancellors ' umbrella body , said it was likely that within weeks it would be too late for students to start their courses , and institutions would have to ask them to defer for a year .
Some universities have started filming lectures so students unable to get into the UK can catch up by watching them online if they finally get here .
Others have suggested providing reading materials so they can start at home .
But it is thought that many will close their doors to delayed entrants around the start of November .
Such a move would cause huge administrative headaches , not just for disappointed students but also for institutions who will then have unexpected spare places this year , but will have to take deferred students next year , putting pressure on 2010 admissions .
Income from foreign students is crucial to UK universities because they face a cap on the number of British and European students they can take .
Home and EU students pay tuition fees of up to £ 3,225 a year but the cost of educating them is much more and is supplemented in part by the government , which therefore limits places for them .
Professor Steve Smith , the president of UUK , which is in talks with the UK Borders Agency to try to speed up the visa process , said : " We are very concerned that significant numbers of students from Pakistan may not receive their visas in time to start their studies in the UK this year .
" Universities UK has consistently emphasised to UKBA that international students only have a limited timeframe within which to apply for a visa and any delays are very serious .
" We know many universities are trying to accommodate late arrivals but there will be cut - off points after which students will not be able to join their programmes .
This is obviously devastating for the students and problematic for institutions who have planned for certain student numbers .
" It is of huge academic , cultural and financial benefit to the UK for these highly - talented people to come to our country to be educated .
We are in danger of sending out a message that the UK does not welcome international students . "
Overseas students contribute £ 4bn a year in fees , according to the UK Council for International Student Affairs ( Ukcisa ) .
The Higher Education Statistics Agency says more than 8 % of the total income of UK universities comes from international students ' fees .
Data gathered for the Guardian by Mike Reddin , a former academic at the London School of Economics , shows that students from outside the European Union starting undergraduate degrees in the sciences at Imperial College London this autumn will pay up to £ 20,400 each year in fees .
International students on a undergraduate science course will pay an average of £ 10,781 each year , a 3.7 % increase on last year 's fees .
For arts courses , the figure is £ 9,911 - up 4.2 % .
Dominic Scott , Ukcisa 's chief executive , said the figures showed just how important international student fees were to the UK .
" Without it , universities would have more departments closing , worse infrastructure and less investment in libraries , " he said .
" At a time of huge financial pressure , it is the international student income which is enabling universities to invest , expand and survive . "
At the London School of Economics , where a large proportion of undergraduates come from outside the UK and EU , Simeon Underwood , head of admissions policy said significant numbers of students were arriving later than usual , and some had not come at all .
" The sector 's main worry is the damage this will do to the reputation of UK higher education overseas , especially in the Indian sub - continent , and the knock - on effect this will have on university funding , " he said .
The news from Mexico just continues to get worse with bad news from all three of their biggest oil fields , even as our perennial cornucopian talks of “ a Mexican surprise . ”
As Gregor noted recently ( h/t ft energysource ) at the beginning of the year Cantarell was producing 862,000 bd and at the end of July this was down to 588,000 bd .
The graph plotting decline continues to show a linear decent at the rate of 35,000 bd per month or roughly 100,000 bd every three months – giving it just 17 - months at that rate ( ending right at the end of next year ) until there is nothing left .
Somewhere in there the drop is likely to stabilize , but suddenly and soon the questions as to where the replacement hundreds of thousands of barrels are going to come from is going to stop being an almost academic exercise .
But they are n’t the only ones in trouble .
Consider U.S. net imports from Mexico over the same period .
That decline also looks pretty linear , with a projected intersection with zero in 2014 , depending on where you draw the line .
Net Imports From Mexico ( EIA )
Mexico itself is not likely to be able to come up with much of an answer .
The President just changed the head of Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) as the revenues that the state gets from sale of its oil ( making up nearly 40 % of the federal budget ) dropped 30 % in the first half of the year .
Current Mexican Government predictions that overall Mexican production will stabilize at 2.5 mbd over next year do n’t reflect the collapse of Cantarell , and also fail to recognize that the promised increases in production from other fields are not reaching the goals set .
It is only a few days since the production at Chicontepec was “ evaluated ” after falling some 12,000 bd short of target .
This field is still in development , with ultimate production targeted at 550,000 to 700,000 bd by 2017 , but as it is already 16 % behind the mark that does not augur well for that future .
As Euan Mearns pointed out the fields at Ku-Maloob - Zaap ( KMZ ) which lie adjacent to Cantarell are being produced in the same way as Cantarell , and thus production has recently risen dramatically .
Ku Maloob Zaap ( KMZ ) adjacent to Cantarell in the Gulf of Campeche is the largest source of new production growth .
It recently overtook Cantarell as Mexico ’s biggest producer , with record output of 814,000 b/d in April .
The KMZ complex produced 740,000 b/d of crude in 2008 , up from 550,700 b/d in 2007 .
Production has doubled in the last 3 years with a nitrogen reinjection program similar to one at Cantarell .
Pemex expects KMZ production to peak at 820,000 b/d before declining to 810,000 b/d next year .
Read that last sentence again !
Now the oil in KMZ is proving to be much heavier than that from Cantarell and so may not decline at quite the same rate , but given the very rapid increase in production , and that the peak is already here , this does not bode well for sustaining Mexican production using that region for any great period into the future .
Rather it might increase the already precipitate drop in total production levels going into 2011 .
Mexican exports of heavy crude ( that from Cantarell and KMZ ) had fallen , by July to 1.06 mbd from 1.22 mbd in January .
Pemex had domestic sales of 1.8 mbd in July which is up some 45,000 bd from January , largely due to increases in sales of motor gasoline .
The country imports some 550,000 bd of refined products .
If we go back to the Export Land Model , if internal demand continues to grow , and if Chicontepec proves to consistently fail to produce the needed production by as much as 20 % or more ( assuming that they are now working the best prospects first ) and if we start to see the decline in KMZ next year . . . . . .
And to quote an “ expert ” on the subject :
Michael C. Lynch , president , Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc. , differs from the generally pessimistic consensus on Mexico .
“ I think Mexico will probably surprise many , ” he said .
Lynch said , “ [ Pemex ’s ] first need has been capital ; the government has a long tendency to starve them of money , and only recently has this been reversed .
Mexican drilling activity is twice what it was a couple of years ago , and they have a lot of medium - sized fields that could make a serious contribution .
( The decline in rigs rates has helped them , but the peso decline offset that somewhat ) .
Deregulation and outside investment would certainly help , but capital is the main thing . ”
Perhaps somebody could explain to Michael that when one uses the word “ surprise ” it generally means you ’re going to hear good news – none of this is !

Because a quick response to emergency calls for patients in a life - threatening conditions is important to improve their survival rate [ 16 ] , several countries have introduced a priority dispatch system for ambulances [ 17 – 24 ] .
On October 1st , 2008 , Yokohama , Japan started a new emergency medical service system that was designed to dispatch ample emergency staff quickly to patients in a critical condition .
The present study aimed to assess the algorithm , which had originally been constructed based on data collected previously from 4,301 cases , prior to the start of the new system [ 14 ] .
In the new Yokohama system , when the life threat risk as estimated by the logistic model is higher than 10 % , the emergency call is categorized as A+. Category A+ targets patients that face a strong possibility of dying .
The Emergency Medical Division of the Yokohama Safety Management Bureau reported that under the new emergency system , the mean arrival time of the first responder to the scene for patients categorized as A + at the moment of the emergency call was approximately one minute shorter than that for other patients .
Whether the new system improved survival rate from CPA should be evaluated in further studies .
Logistic models were applied to construct an algorithm to assess the life threat risk from the information received in calls to emergency services .
The algorithm for assessing the life threat risk was constructed according to the type of caller .
This is based on a concept that the weight of data obtained from the calls is likely to differ depending on the type of caller .
For instance , a call reporting that a patient cannot walk could have different implications when made by nursing home staff compared to other types of callers .
The life threat risk was estimated synthetically , from observable signs provided by callers to the ambulance system .
The model allowed explanatory variables to be recorded as unknown or unconfirmed .
This is based on a concept that information that is unknown or unconfirmed is potentially related to the severity of patient 's condition and can be used as a factor in the risk assessment .
In the triage program , the patients ' life threat risk was expressed as a percentage .
For example , when a call was made by a family member who was in panic , if the patient 's age was 70 years , consciousness not clear and breathing status abnormal , if the patient was lying down and unable to walk , the patients face cyanotic , and sweating unable to be confirmed , then the life threat risk was estimated to be 19.2 % by the model .
In the Yokohama New Emergency System , patients were categorized as potentially life threatened when the estimated life threat risk was higher than 10 % .
The cut - off value was determined prior to the start of the system according to the city 's capability of dispatching ample staff , i.e. , from a viewpoint on the amount of acceptable false positives , such as overtriage .
In the present algorithm for assessing patients ' life threat risk , the term overtriage represents the amount of patients without CPA who were categorized as A+ ( the overtriage rate was 57.4 % ) , while undertriage represents the amount of patients with CPA who were not categorized as A+ ( the undertriage rate was 0.8 % ) .
A high rate of overtriage will result in an inappropriate high priority dispatch from the limited number of ambulances , while a high rate of undertriage will result in an unnecessary loss of lives .
The cut - off value was set as the same value regardless of the type of caller .
With the cut - off value , the algorithm for calls made from nursing home staff achieved high level sensitivity ( 91.4 % ) , meanwhile the sensitivity of the algorithm for calls made from third party was relatively low ( 63.5 % ) .
Sensitivity and specificity have a trade - off relationship .
An appropriate cut - off value of the algorithms must be reconsidered .
We included the obviously dead patients in our review because these patients were not identifiable at the time of emergency call .
Ambulance crews were dispatched to rescue every patient , among whom persons identified as obviously dead at the scene were included .
If obvious death is identified at the scene , patients are not transported to hospitals .
When non-transported cases are excluded from the evaluation study , sensitivity , specificity , predictive values , and likelihood ratios are changed .
In this case , the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of categorizing patients as A + that resulted in death or CPA was 78.7 % ( 95 %CI : 76.7 % - 80.6 % ) , 95.6 % ( 95%CI : 95.4 % - 95.8 % ) , 35.1 % ( 95%CI : 33.6 % - 36.7 % ) , 99.3 % ( 95%CI : 99.3 % - 99.4 % ) , 17.8 ( 95 %CI : 16.7 - 19.0 ) , and 0.22 ( 95 %CI : 0.20 - 0.24 ) , respectively .
Several studies on the validity of triage systems have been reported in the UK [ 20 , 21 ] , Canada [ 23 ] , Finland [ 24 ] , USA [ 25 ] and Australia [ 26 ] .
Heward et al. reported that 50 % of cardiac arrests were identified by the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System [ 20 ] .
Flynn et al. reported that sensitivity and specificity of the Medical Priority Dispatch System for detecting cardiac arrest were 76.7 % and 99.2 % [ 26 ] .
Direct comparison on the accuracy of triage systems is difficult because relevant terms for estimating the accuracy have not been presented in their entirety in the literature .
The likelihood ratio incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm and provides a direct estimation of the accuracy of the triage [ 27 , 28 ] .
There are several challenges for developing a more improved triage algorithm .
The algorithm to assess a patient 's life threat risk can be improved with the data obtained under the new emergency medical services system , in which information obtained during emergency calls is recorded as digital data .
Although the coefficients of explanatory variables shown in Table 1 were estimated from limited sample data , data of more than 120,000 triaged cases per year should contribute to the development of an accurate triage algorithm .
The variables used as explanatory variables in the logistic model were derived from data sought from callers by call workers , for instance , ' how is his consciousness ? '
Under an emergency situation , the number of such questions is inevitably limited .
Patient 's age , consciousness level , breathing status , walking ability , position , and complexion were selected as data that a call worker should seek in the interview protocol .
There may be factors for assessing the life threat risk other than the variables used in the current algorithm .
If other indicative factors are found in the future , they should be part of the interview protocol and should be included as explanatory variables in the model .
The coefficients of the logistic model were estimated by logistic regression analyses whose dependent variable is 1 if the patient 's condition resulted in death or was recognized as life - threatening by physicians at the ED .
Otherwise the dependent variable was 0 .
Although the current algorithm was constructed with the dependent variable of such outcome , i.e. , 1 or 0 mentioned above , there may be other outcomes or indices that serve as the optimum yardstick for determining advanced life support intervention .
Obtaining accurate information from the initial call to the emergency services is crucial for developing a well - organized algorithm .
The information on the patient 's condition is quite accurately recorded under the new system because the information was entered into a computer - based triage form during the phone call .
In the meantime , the information obtained from callers is prone to being inaccurate if the callers do not observe patients sufficiently to give the accurate information required .
Such cases should be excluded from the targets of call triage .
A logistic model does not yet exist that can assess the patient 's risk of death when calls are made to emergency services by the patients themselves .
Such a model is unlikely to be developed no matter how much data will be collected , because only a small percentage of such cases resulted in a critical condition .
Methods other than a quantitative approach may be preferable to predict the chance of a critical condition occurring when an emergency call is made by the patient .
It ’s hard to tell if AVG Anti-VIrus Free 9.0 offers decent PC security .
That ’s because the application is so annoying , it imposes such an overhead that it had to be deleted before testing finished .
At times free is too high a price .
AVG Anti-Virus Free 9.0 is still only two weeks old .
It arrived about the same time as Windows 7 and is compatible with Microsoft ’s new operation system .
The program is available at AVG ’s free web site – but I do n’t recommend it .
It is only a small download at 869 Kb .
It takes seconds with broadband .
The first file is a downloader which fetches and installs the rest of the software .
The process is easy enough .
Yet the second screen you see is only the start of what becomes an annoying and shrill sales pitch designed to control your choices and trick you in to paying money .
It appears AVG has learnt from the scam artists the software promises to protect you from .
Flakiness abounds
Your first choice is to select either free basic protection or a 30 - day trial of the company ’s comprehensive protection .
The implication is responsible people will choose the second option .
Which means in 30 days AVG will ask you for money .
Do n’t worry – you ’ll get plenty more opportunities to pay AVG if you choose not to do so at this point .
I thought I was downloading the free software – that ’s what I clicked on at the AVG web site – so that ’s what I proceeded with .
During the download AVG asks you to remove existing anti-virus software .
This makes sense , anti-virus applications can conflict with each other and anyway , as each program imposes an overhead , the performance drop can multiply .
Annoyingly AVG does n’t remove the other software .
It halts and opens the Windows uninstaller so you can manually remove it .
Even more annoyingly , the AVG installer closes itself at this point .
You need to hunt around in your download folder to find it and start all over again – by now many megabytes have been wiped off your download cap .
Click , click , bloody click
There ’s a lot of clicking throughout this process – some of it unnecessary .
Then it asks if you wish to install the AVG Security Toolbar .
The software has also helpfully pre-selected the option to change your default search engine to Yahoo .
This is spam – of a sort .
In both cases I choose No .
It is tricky – if you click off the first box , the Yahoo box stays ticked but grayed out .
This can only be designed to trick you into selecting the search engine choice .
At this point the installer had to close Firefox .
Not wanting to be sent all the way back to the start like that horrible long snake at the end of a game of Snakes and Ladders , I clicked to close Firefox held my breath .
Phew .
The install resumes .
We are now 40 minutes into the process .
Even at minimum wage rate this free anti-virus program has cost me the price of lunch and a clutch of grey hairs .
Finally
Suddenly the process is over .
A box appears telling me the install has finished .
But wait , what is this ?
More stuff to click .
Do I agree to give anonymous information ?
Oh alright then .
And now would I like to receive spam ?
( Sorry news and alerts ) .
Please enter your email address .
Are you kidding ?
No .
While AVG starts its first scan .
I reload Firefox .
In the meantime I notice the program has installed an icon on my Windows desktop .
Did I ask for this ?
No I damn well did not .
AVG asks tons of questions during the install – but does n’t allow me to choose whether the icon despoils my desktop .
At this point I ’m starting to get angry .
Not responding
Meanwhile Firefox is failing to load .
What ’s going on here ?
There was a string of open tabs – none of them are visible .
Windows tells me Firefox is “ not responding ” .
Eventually – more than an hour after the first download , Firefox opens .
And what ’s this ?
AVG has installed AVG Safe Search .
Is this the toolbar I choose not to install ?
The name is different , so let ’s assume it is n’t the same thing .
I was n’t warned or asked about it , but hey , let ’s go with the flow for a moment .
So , Firefox opens at the home page – my tags are all lost .
AVG is now scanning my computer looking for viruses .
I open up the scanner ’s display and see what looks like a banner ad for the paid for software at the bottom of the screen .
Fair enough , the software was free and these people have to eat .
I can accept advertising as the price to pay for free anti-virus .
It has to go
Before long my computer started crashing , randomly .
And things went s l o w l i ke w a d i n g t h r o u g h m o l a s s e s .
There could be only one explanation for this .
I removed AVG , reinstalled Microsoft Security Essentials and performance returned to normal .
Of course , you mileage may vary .
AVG Anti-Virus may rock your boat .
But for me it has proved so disastrous I could n’t even test its efficiency as an anti-virus tool .
I give it zero stars out of five .

Major Nidal Hasan , accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood Army base , has been described by former colleagues as “ psychotic . ”
As more details emerge about Hasan ’s troubled state , gun safety advocates are launching fresh attacks on a Senate bill they say would make it easier for mentally unstable veterans to buy firearms .
Sen. Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) says his “ Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act ” will protect veterans ’ gun rights .
But the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calls it a “ dangerous ” proposal that could allow “ over 100,000 mentally incapacitated or incompetent persons ” to buy guns — people who would previously have been barred from doing so by the Veterans Administration ( VA ) .
With debate over Fort Hood still raging on cable news , one might think that Burr might try to quietly shelve the measure , whose co-sponsors include Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) .
Instead , Burr fired back at the Brady Campaign in an interview with Fox News , accusing its president , Paul Helmke , of using the tragedy to “ exploit the senseless murder of American soldiers in the quest to secure personal triumph . ”
Responding to Burr Thursday in an open letter , Helmke wrote , “ it is hardly ‘ exploitative ’ to have an honest debate ” about the proposal , which would cancel out key provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and override standards used by the VA for nearly four decades .
Burr contends that , “ under current law , veterans who have come to VA for help but who are determined to be unable to manage their own financial affairs are labeled as mentally defective and , on that basis alone , are denied their 2nd amendment rights . ”
Yet even the National Rifle Association disputes Burr ’s description of the process by which veterans are ruled ineligible to own firearms .
As the NRA notes in the current issue of its magazine First Freedom [ PDF ] , “ VA records are only reported to NICS [ National Instant Criminal Background Check System ] if a patient has been ‘ adjudicated as a mental defective , ’ a lengthy process that includes opportunities for hearings , appeals , etc . ”
( The NRA ’s Institute for Legislative Action , which has not issued an official position on the measure , did not respond to Mother Jones ’ requests for comment . )
According to a 2008 New York Times report , at least 121 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans “ committed a killing in this country , or were charged with one , after their return from war . ”
In addition , as Helmke also points out in his letter , “ veterans are far more likely to die of suicide than non-veterans in the general population , with firearms the most common method of suicide among veterans . ”
Nevertheless , several veterans ’ organizations favor the measure , citing concerns that the VA might begin providing the Justice Department with the names of veterans seeking help for Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder .
Patrick Campbell , the chief legislative counsel for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , has said that his organization backs the bill “ in the hopes it will quell any fears veterans might have about seeking treatment for mental health injuries . ”
In the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings , the Brady Campaign joined the NRA to support strengthening mental health background checks .
This time around , it has offered to work with Burr ’s office to find a more precise way to address his concerns about veterans ’ gun rights .
But it staunchly opposes the current proposal .
As Helmke noted after the Fort Hood shootings , “ this latest tragedy , at a heavily fortified army base , ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places .
Enough is enough . ”
A 90 - year - old man who allegedly shot his terminally ill wife to death and then turned the gun on himself will likely be booked for voluntary manslaughter , authorities said this morning .
A caretaker for Phyllis Fish , 88 , called police about 1:30 p.m. Sunday after hearing gunshots inside the couple ’s Laguna Woods retirement community home , said Orange County sheriff ’s spokesman Jim Amormino .
Fish suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died at the scene .
James
Fish was taken to a hospital , also with a gunshot wound to the head .
He is in critical condition but is speaking , Amormino said .
“ She was under hospice care , ” the spokesman said .
“ That is the motive . ”

VIDEO - The IDF on Tuesday released footage showing weapons smuggling at the home of Hezbollah operative Abdel Nasser Issa in the southern Lebanon village of Tayr Filsi , on the outskirts of Tyre .
Issa and his son were reportedly killed Monday evening during an explosion that took place inside their home , which the IDF claims was used to store weapons .
The footage was taken by an IDF drone .
Hezbollah and the Lebanese army denied anyone was killed in the blast , and said it was caused by an exploding shell .
The IDF filed a complaint with the United Nations Interim Force in southern Lebanon , demanding an investigation into the explosion .
Army sources said the incident proved that Hezbollah continues to bring weapons and ammunition into southern Lebanon and is hiding them in houses , in violation of Security Council Resolution 1701 .
UNIFIL said it was aware of an explosion and was in contact with the Lebanese army .
" We are looking into the circumstances of the incident , " UNIFIL spokeswoman Yasmina Bouziane said .

OK , that last one is not exactly a famous quote .
But it ’s a favorite of mine .
I ’m a big fan of both the United States Marines and of Space : Above and Beyond , in which future Leathernecks fight to protect Earth from aliens .
If we ever do face a war with aliens , I expect US Marines will be there risking their lives for us on the front lines , as always .
Semper Fi !

A new " term of sale " opens the doors to more nations that want to approach the United States about foreign military sales , and that makes the U.S. more competitive in seeking partnerships , the director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said .
Its said that seven to eight hours per day is the average amount of sleep a person needs .
Though this may vary from person to person as some people are naturally short or long sleepers .
There are some great people like Leonardo da Vinci , Nikola Tesla , Edison , Sir Newton and others who slept quite less than rest of us .
They slept only 2 - 3 hours a day .
But for us beauty sleep is something that we wo n't miss for the world .
In past we have seen ' Art Of Sleeping ' , and now we have some amazing photos of sleeping animals at their best !

C’est un classement international qui l’affirme : le Cnrs est la première institution scientifique du monde !
Cette position pour le moins excellente - puisque l'excellence est désormais le maître mot de la politique de recherche officielle - provient du rapport 2009 du SCImago .
SCImago est un groupe de recherche espagnol et portugais , qui se propose de réaliser des cartographies des activités de recherches .
Son rapport annuel 2009 classe les meilleures universités et institutions de recherche mondiales et analyse leur performance pendant la période 2003 - 2007 , suivant 5 indicateurs de production , collaboration et impact scientifique , qui se reposent sur les citations scientifiques .
Le rapport a été élaboré à partir de données de la base Scopus ( plus de 16 millions de publications et 150 millions de citations ) et comprend des institutions de recherche de 84 pays sur les cinq continents , groupées dans cinq secteurs de recherche : gouvernement , éducation supérieure , santé , industriel et autre .
La position du Cnrs au sommet de ce classement provient en premier lieu de son statut d’organisme national qui regroupe sous sa signature dans les revues scientifiques , outre ses 11 000 chercheurs , les plus de 15000 universitaires et les milliers de thésards qui travaillent dans ses laboratoires , la plupart en situation de co-tutelle avec au moins une université .
C’est d’ailleurs pour cette raison - la concentration sous une signature unique - que l’on trouve ensuite sur la liste l’Académie des sciences chinoise , puis celle de Russie , avant de trouver l’Université de Harvard , Tokyo Daigaku , la Max Planck Gesellschaft , l’Université de Toronto , les Institut Nationaux de la Santé ( USA ) , etc ...
Il est assez piquant de souligner cette pôle - position alors que , depuis plusieurs années , les scientifiques doivent batailler pied à pied avec le gouvernement pour sauvegarder l’unité du Cnrs .
Ainsi , son actuel contrat quadriennal résulte d’un affrontement assez dur .
Les responsables politiques et en particulier Nicolas Sarkozy ( qui voulait réduire le Cnrs à une simple agence de moyens ) et Valérie Pécresse , n’ont cessé de réclamer de la « visibilité » et de la « simplification » au système de recherche français , en se plaignant de sa « fragmentation » .
Or , c’est contre eux et leur volonté de découper le Cnrs et d’en affaiblir la direction générale ou la relative autonomie vis à vis du pouvoir politique , que les scientifiques se sont mobilisés ces dernières années .
Finalement , les succès non négligeables de cette mobilisation , si l’on suit l’éclairage donné par ce classement , montre qu’ils ont réellement défendu l’intérêt général et non des revendications particulières .
Du coup , le récent discours « pro - Cnrs » de madame Valérie Pécresse apparaît plus comme un mea culpa que l’expression d’une pensée ayant guidé les décisions politiques .
Mais on ne va pas s’en plaindre ...

Anyways , back to the Cheshire cat .
It was created by Alex CF , an artist who specializes in Cryptozoological scientific art .
He describes the piece as :
A large wooden / glass display cabinet , contained within , the taxidermied corpse of an extra dimensional entity known as “ The Cheshire cat ” .
We can only hypothesize to the nature of this creature – whether it indeed was sentient , able to talk – or the physical manifestation of unconscious thought .
either way , dissections were carried out to discern its internal organs , which were entirely absent .
Alex has also developed a full narrative to accompany this horrifying piece of art .
In the early 1850 ’s , a theoretical physicist by the name of Henry O’malley was emitted to the Borough of Charlston County hospital , with severe wounds to his face and hands .
He was in a state of severe shock and began to rant and rave as the nurses tried to calm him .
He was sedated and his injuries treated , yet he had not made a full recovery from his bout of hysteria .
He was sectioned and sent to the Beverley asylum , in somerset .
There he was treated by the venerable psychiatrist Dr.Howard Keith .
For three months he would not say a word , he would eat very little , and horde almost everything placed before him .
His medication was cut to see if this was altering his behaviour , but nothing seemed to stem the awkward stare into the corner of his room , the muteness or his inability to comprehend his situation .
Until one morning , a steward knocked on the door of Dr. Keith and presented an altogether different Henry O’malley .
“ I wish to discuss my predicament , my research , and the reason for my lapse in judgement ” exclaimed Henry , with this he began a tale that would have filed itself neatly between the cases of all the other inmates , if it had n’t been for his final words .
“ And i have proof . ”

It happens all the time .
A group of friends or siblings are sitting around , puffing out their chests and exchanging trash talk over who would win some ridiculous competition .
Most of the time , everyone involved has a laugh before moving to another topic .
Other times , it leads to YouTube infamy , as a grainy camera phone captures a couple of guys trying to settle the bet and embarrassing themselves .
Once , it spawned a world championship competition in which thousands of participants utilize technology which runs the gamut from medieval to space - aged in order to determine who can propel a pumpkin the farthest .

Here 's a look at the Punkin Chunking winners trophy .
Let 's start from the beginning .
The history of World Championship Punkin Chunkin is full of colorful characters , but none are more legendary than Bill Thompson , Don Pepper , Trey Melson and John Ellsworth , the gentlemen credited with starting it all .
The four friends were sitting around Ellsworth 's blacksmith shop one late October afternoon , talking trash about an anvil - throwing contest the four had just had .
They decided a new game was needed and somehow decided to see who could build a machine that could launch a pumpkin the greatest distance .
These men of action agreed to meet on the first Saturday after Halloween , when pumpkins would be plentiful and cheap , to carry out the contest .
So on Nov. 1 , 1986 , they gathered in a field in Sussex County , Del. , armed with two spring - powered catapults , a large slingshot and , needless to say , alcohol .
Thompson and Melson won with a throw of 178 feet .
Everyone who attended was hooked .
Word spread .
Before you knew it , the pumpkin - launching arms race was on .
Twenty - three years later , " The Chunk , " as it 's affectionately known , is no longer just about blasting pumpkins into the atmosphere .
It 's the biggest party in Delaware , a three - day event attended by upwards of 70,000 people .
It 's a scene that would rival any college football tailgate in the country , and Page 2 dispatched me to cover this year 's event .
As I walked through the spectators area , the smell of charring meat and the the sound of excited chatter hung in the air .
Drinking games such as cornhole and beer pong were going full force .
A few guys were playing a game they called " redneck horseshoes , " using detached toilet seats and a plunger .
It 's much more difficult than it sounds .
You'd be surprised how much the wind can alter the trajectory of a toilet seat .
Eventually , I made my way to the competition , where devices are divided into classes , kind of like boxing .
But instead of being separated by weight , they are arranged by design , such as air cannons ( the most powerful ) , catapults ( the originals ) , centrifugals ( the coolest to watch ) and trebuchets ( the most impressive ) .
There are also subdivisions for youth teams .
In all , 109 devices were entered into the 2009 competition .
On each of the three days , each machine got one throw -- so a year of work and anticipation boils down to about 10 total minutes .
The farthest throw wins , and the pumpkin can not explode when it 's released ( such a result is known as a " pie in the sky " ) .

" Feel the Steel " is thought to be the only NFL - themed pumpkin cannon in the world .
As one scans the vast line of machines , it 's immediately clear which one is about to throw .
A centrifugal machine known as Inertia II , which looks like a giant erector set , begins slowly shaking .
A wire attached to the top begins swinging around in a circle , gradually at first but methodically picking up steam .
Spectators are rotating their necks in unison , following the path of the wire .
Suddenly , a white speck enters the sky , sailing off in a majestic arc down the field as a collective gasp is released .
After a split second , a raucous round of applause breaks out .
This is Punkin Chunkin .
I later found out Inertia II had released its pumpkin ( an African variety which is denser than the typical orange ones ) at a point 84 feet above the ground .
It tossed the pumpkin 1,783 feet , roughly the margin of error of a JaMarcus Russell throw .
After a few more centrifugal machines took their turns , it was time for the heavy artillery -- air cannons .
While centrifugal machines create buzz through visual splendor and showmanship , air cannons are all about raw power .
Their design evokes military weaponry , like tanks , but with much longer barrels .
They look like something The Joker would roll out to terrorize Gotham .
When an eight - to 10 - pound pumpkin exits the 100 - foot - long barrel of an air cannon , it 's traveling at 500 miles per hour , or 733 feet per second , and the force on the pumpkin is 3.8 G's , according to Bob Kotowski , author of " Pie in the Sky , the Authorized History of Punkin Chunkin ' . "
It 's enough power for a pumpkin to rip clean through a truck parked several hundred yards away .
That 's not hyperbole ( more on that later ) .
There is an elite club of cannons which have shot a pumpkin more than 4,000 feet .
But their owners are n't satisfied yet .
They all have one goal : to launch a pumpkin a full mile .
It 's a mythical barrier among the serious chunkers , one discussed with the same reverence once held for the four - minute mile .
" Big 10 Inch Team " had the best mark of this year 's competition with a throw of 4,162 feet .
To use a boxing analogy , centrifugals are the technically sound lightweights who impress with their skill and precision .
Cannons are the heavyweights .
There 's no dancing -- just a quick knockout punch .
After the pumpkins are loaded in , a horn blast fills the air , followed by a sharp hiss of gas and the distinctive thump of a gourd being shot down the field like a bat out of hell .
The crowd oohs and aahs and tries to follow the flight of the projectile , but if you do n't spot it coming out of the barrel , forget it .
You can't pick up something moving that fast if you do n't see it immediately .
But you usually can see the explosion when it hits the ground .
It 's a satisfyingly violent exclamation point on an otherwise graceful flight .
Punkin Chunkin also sponsors a cooking contest , featuring pumpkin delicacies such as chocolate chip pumpkin bread , pumpkin tiramisu , pumpkin ale and pumpkin braised rabbit .
The Punkin Chunkin festival is a weird combination of self - identified engineering geeks , families and partiers .
It 's Spring Break meets elementary school science fair .
There is also a Ferris wheel , carnival games , bumper cars , bands and the Miss Punkin Chunkin pageant .
This year 's event also played host to a wedding .
After the ceremony , the emcee called for single ladies to come catch the bouquet , which was fired out of a mini air cannon .
Back to the competition .
A machine called " Yankee Siege " headlines the trebuchets , and for good reason .
It is a near - replica of those used in wars throughout Europe in the Middle Ages , though it looked like something out of " Lord of the Rings . "
It was situated on wheels twice as tall as a man and featured a long arm capable of hurling boulders hundreds of yards into oncoming armies .
Alternatively , it can throw a baby grand piano 200 feet in the air and 100 feet away .

This cannon runs on Betty Boop power .
Yankee Siege works using brute force .
It applies 12,000 pounds of counterweight to power projectiles , and despite the fact that it only harnesses about 7 percent of the total energy generated , it still throws pumpkins farther than any trebuchet ever , according to owner Steve Seigars .
Take that , Feudal England !
Yankee Siege broke the 2,000 - foot barrier this year , a new trebuchet record .
After every machine had its turn , all machines were allowed to fire as much as they wanted in a gigantic free - for - all .
Against a setting sun , the chaos began and I was able to fire a few of these machines myself .
" Feel the Steel , " a Pittsburgh Steelers - themed air cannon owned by Bob Phassieu , is my first opportunity .
I pull the rope which serves as the triggering mechanism , and with the familiar hiss and thump , the pumpkin goes shooting skyward , straight and true toward the horizon .
Even though I had nothing to do with it , the sensation of controlling that kind of raw power was intoxicating .
Next , I move down the line to the bigger guns .
These monstrous contraptions are trying to pelt an old moving van which has been parked in the middle of the field .
" Mack Daddy , " an air cannon built by Allen Duckett , is positioned right in line with the truck .
My first shot from this hulking machine sails way off to the right .
My last shot one - hopped a foot short , and pumpkin bits splatter harmlessly against the tires .
Of course , the next shooter hit it dead center on the very next shot , ripping a glorious hole right through the truck .
Teams continued taking turns blowing the truck to bits before heading off into the night .
The party was just getting started , as fires roared , music blasted and beer flowed .
It 's not unusual for Punkin Chunkin participants to help each other with parts and manpower when competitors have trouble with their machines .
These people have a true passion and bond based on the simple desire to measure what they can achieve , even if it 's something as seemingly silly as launching pumpkins .
While it may not technically be a sport , Punkin Chunkin is actually something better : a community .

( CNN ) --
From the time she was an 11 - year - old , blue - eyed , freckle - faced blonde until she was a 29 - year - old woman with two children , Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her .
Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor 's backyard .
She was more than 160 miles from home , and her family had no idea where she was .
Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe , California , in 1991 , and took her straight to the soundproof shed , police said .
Dugard 's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch , California , was so overgrown no one even knew it existed .
The details about Dugard 's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California 's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping .
Anyone who came across the couple 's backyard , littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher , would assume that it ended at a 6 - foot fence .
Watch aerial images of the backyard compound »
" You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances , " said Fred Kollar , undersheriff of El Dorado County .
" There was nothing that would cause you to question it .
You can't see it from either adjoining property .
It was presumably well arranged . "
But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes , high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction .
Kollar said the property had " a hidden backyard within a backyard . "
It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet , two tents and several outbuildings , " where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives . "
It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard 's kidnapping , Kollar said .
The " secondary " backyard was inside the first and was " screened from view . "
One of the sheds was soundproof , he said .
In it were sheds and tarps , a makeshift bathroom and shower , along with electricity supplied by extension cords .
Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping .
Dugard lived for several years there by herself .
The sheds were locked from the outside .
She grew up and had her captor 's children there , and raised them there .
" None of them have ever been to school , they 've never been to a doctor , " Kollar said .
" They were kept in complete isolation in this compound , if you will , at the rear of the house , " he said .
" They were born there . "
The children , both girls , are now 15 and 11 .
" They are all in good health , " Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing .
" But living in a backyard for the last 18 years does take its toll . "

Today New York Times carries an article on the failure of America ’s public schools to teach math to kids .
In schools that are among the most expensive in the world ( for taxpayers ) , only 34 percent of 8th graders are “ proficient ” in math , and 39 percent of 4th graders .
One major theme of the article is to beat the dead horse of the Bush Administration , by pointing out that No Child Left Behind does not seem to be working .
The taxpayers are doing their part , paying up to $ 200,000 per year for each teacher ( including pension obligations incurred ) .
The students are doing their part , presumably , by showing up to school every day for 6 hours .
If things are n’t working , it can only be due to incompetence on the part of the government at this fairly straightforward task .
Let ’s contrast teaching K - 8 math with managing health care .
Instead of compliant 4th graders who show up to school every day , you have clever providers who will figure out where the gaps are in thousands of pages of federal rules and regulations and use those gaps to extract tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in extra profit .
Instead of a fixed subject that has not changed substantially since the death of Brahmagupta in 668 A.D. , health care presents a moving target of new procedures , drugs , tests , and fees .
In the school system , the interests of the students and taxpayers are aligned .
Both groups are better off if math is learned .
In the health care system , there is a substantial moral hazard .
If improved diabetes and heart disease therapies become available , people may indulge more in super sized meals .
You would think that the evidence of failure of trillions of dollars of tax money spent on math education in the period covered by the article ( 1996 - present ) would be a sobering reminder of the limits of government power , but none of the 50 + people commenting in the New York Times made that connection .
More :
On my non -profit ideas page , I propose teaching math in the context of doing an engineering project , such as designing and building a bicycle .
Around 72 pc believe the UK tax regime has already become less competitive compared to other major economies in recent years .

Today the Census Bureau released its latest income numbers , and they were n’t pretty : median income dropped by nearly $ 2,000 between 2007 and 2008 .
Nor was the long term picture much better : median income in the past decade has dropped from $ 52,587 in 1999 to $ 50,303 in 2008 .
But there ’s more to your earnings than just cash income .
As we ’ve all been reminded over and over lately , healthcare costs are skyrocketing , which means that healthcare premiums paid by your employer have risen dramatically during the past decade .
That ’s all part of your compensation too .
So if you add in employers ’ contributions to healthcare premiums , how do things look then ?
Answer : a little better , but still nothing to write home about .
Roughly speaking , if you add together both cash income and healthcare premiums and adjust everything for inflation , median income over the past decade has increased from about $ 56,400 to $ 57,000 .
In other words , a whopping 1 % .
It really has been a lost decade1 .
1 Though not for everyone .
During the same period , the average income of the richest tenth of a percent increased by about $ 2 million , or about 35 % .
No wonder there was n’t much left for the rest of us .
NOTE FOR NERDS :
There ’s no bulletproof source for the value of healthcare premiums over time , and in any case the value differs depending on whether you ’re married , single , have kids , etc .
So here ’s what I did to get a rough cut on the data .
Basic cash income table is here .
Healthcare premium estimates for the past decade are here .
I subtracted the employee contribution and then took the average of family and single coverage .
This may understate the cost a bit , but not by much .
Then I applied the GDP deflator to put all the healthcare costs in 2008 dollars .
This is strictly a cheap and cheerful bloggy estimate , but it ’s probably not too far off the mark .
It 's been labelled the worst disguise ever - two men arrested over a burglary attempt in the US were found with fake beards and masks scrawled on their faces with a permanent marker .
Police stopped the car of Matthew McNelly , 23 , and Joey Miller , 20 after it matched the description of a vehicle used by two men who allegedly tried to break into an Iowa apartment last Friday night .
Tried to hide their faces ... Matthew McNelly , 23 , and Joey Miller , 20 .
When officers looked inside the 1994 Buick Roadmaster , they were surprised to find the men with masks , beards and moustaches painted on their face in some sort of rudimentary disguise .
" It 's a little weird , " police chief Jeff Cayler told Radio Iowa .
This year marked the 40th anniversary of two momentous events related to space exploration .
One , the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20 , 1969 , was a hallmark technological achievement .
The other , the complete first run of Stanley Kubrick ’s remarkable movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey , vividly depicted author Arthur C. Clarke ’s vision of humans traveling the solar system with abandon .
Much of the related flurry of reporting noted the stark differences between reality — people have not been back to the lunar surface since the December 1972 visit — and Clarke ’s idea .
Articles also asked whether the nation is sufficiently committed to devoting the $ 200 billion or so to returning to the moon 10 years from now and perhaps , after that , spending even more money to send humans to Mars .
As a 15 - year - old , I found the 1969 moon landing enthralling .
I also charted the entire Apollo missions , built scale models and dreamed of being the first Canadian astronaut .
Humankind ’s travels promised to propel science forward .
But since then , my perception of the proper role for human space exploration has changed .
I would still jump at the chance to go into space .
But I now recognize , as I testified to Congress almost a decade ago ( coincidentally along with Buzz Aldrin , from Apollo 11 ) , that doing so would be for the adventure , not for advancing science .
The most scientifically exciting knowledge we can gain about the universe and the solar system will involve unmanned space vehicles , robotic devices and a lot less money than lofting Americans beyond Earth ’s orbit .
Human spaceflight has proved inordinately costly and far more dangerous than the Apollo program ’s successes led us to believe .
Moreover , the associated difficulties are far more mundane than TV and movie science fiction suggest .
We are not held back for lack of a warp drive , although fuel costs are a reason why unmanned flights are so much cheaper ; missions that carry humans must drag along the paraphernalia required to keep them alive .
The chief obstacle to visiting Mars is cosmic radiation .
During the 18 months or so that a round - trip journey would take , astronauts would very likely receive a lethal dose of radiation .
Our ultimate destiny may be in the stars , but the limitations imposed by physics and our biology suggest that this future probably is to be reserved for our mechanical progeny — robots — or perhaps for computers that can get organic life rebooted on some distant locale .
In the near term we still crave adventure , and the desire to travel to , and perhaps to colonize , the moon and maybe Mars seems irresistible , if financially daunting .
I am not against sending humans into space for that reason ( and would also encourage consideration of one - way missions , which seem to be ultimately more fiscally practical ) .
But we should separate funding for science from the diversion of a costly manned space program .
We also should not waste huge amounts on boondoggles such as the $ 100 - billion International Space Station , which purported to offer useful science beyond mere experience with how humans can live 200 miles above Earth ’s surface for extended periods .
The Apollo program taught us that we may conquer even enormous technological problems if the nation is willing to focus for however long it takes to solve them and to devote tremendous resources .
We now face many such challenges , from climate change to energy independence , which we need to tackle even as we juggle our hunger for space travel .
I do not believe that this is a zero - sum game .
Maybe there is money to do it all : to send humans into space , to do the best fundamental science we can do and also to address pressing problems here on Earth .
But we can only do that if we are honest about the costs , and possible benefits , of science for humanity .
And we must not pretend that a base on the moon or Mars is a panacea for any of our significant problems back home .

Witches , or mediums , had high status in Taiwan in the past
It is not the Harry Potter kind of witchcraft , but it 's equally spellbinding , say elders in Taiwan 's Paiwan tribe .
The indigenous tribe has recently started a class to train young people in the traditional skills of witchcraft .
The centuries - old traditions have diminished due to modernisation , the influence of other religions and assimilation into mainstream society .
The Paiwan is one of 14 aboriginal tribes that have lived on the island for thousands of years , long before the majority Chinese arrived .
Taiwan 's aborigines are considered Austronesians , with similar language and customs to people living in the Pacific Islands .
Witchcraft is an important ancient ritual for the Paiwan .
Witches - or mediums as they are sometimes called here - treated diseases , prayed for the community , blessed people and protected them from evil .
" In the past , mediums had a high status in the tribe , " said Weng Yu-hua , who spearheaded the opening of the class and whose mother is a tribal witch .
" They played an important role , especially during major occasions such as before a hunting excursion , before the year 's crops were planted , or when the tribe mourned the death of one of its members , " she said .
' True calling '
Half a century ago , the Paiwan tribe had more than 100 practitioners of witchcraft , but the tradition has nearly died out with the spread of Christianity .
Now the tribe has fewer than 20 witches .
This year , Ms Weng managed to obtain funding from the government 's Council of Indigenous Peoples to run the class .
The class was opened in a Paiwan village in Pingtung County , where most Paiwan live .
It has more than 10 students - housewives in their 30s to 50s .
Tribal elders pass on witchcraft skills to the students Lessons involve teaching students how to seek guidance from the gods and communicate with the souls of deceased ancestors .
" I took the class because my paternal and maternal grandmothers were both spirit mediums , " said Djupelang Qrudu , a 51 - year - old student in the class who preferred to use her Paiwan name .
" They wanted to pass their skills to me , but because of Western influence and the fact that I wanted to go to school , I had no chance to learn from them before they died . "
Paiwan children of Djupelang 's generation went to Christian schools opened by missionaries because there were no schools in their villages .
" I went to Friday evening Bible study or Sunday school , but I did not bother to learn my own tribe 's religion , " she said .
Later , Djupelang had marital problems , divorced , fell ill and had to quit her job .
She returned to her home village and sought advice from a witch .
" The witch told me I was chosen by my grandmothers to inherit their craft .
They chose me among all the girls in my family .
That 's when I realised I could not forsake my true calling , " said Djupelang .
But no classes were available until now .
Many gods
The teachers are elders in their 70s and 80s who want to pass on their skills .
Chanting and leaves are used to help the witches connect with the other world .
There are specific chants for each occasion .
For instance , there is a chant to bless hunters , a chant to pray for a good harvest and a chant to invite the various gods and the souls of tribal ancestors to the village .
Younger Taiwanese tend to think of witchcraft as superstition The Paiwan 's religion involves many gods : the god of Dawu Mountain , their homeland in southern Taiwan ; the god of agriculture ; the mountain protector god ; the life god , and more .
The Paiwan also worshipped their ancestors .
" These mediums use chanting to call back the gods and ancestors to give the village strength , " said Ms Weng .
The class , however , does not promise to instill psychic power in the students , but simply help discover it if it already exists in them .
Students in the class must have either had witches or shamans in their bloodline or be descended from village chiefs .
More classes are being planned , due to the first one 's popularity .
Comfort
But a major challenge for those who want to preserve the art of witchcraft is the lack of a Paiwan written language .
All the witches ' chants were memorised and passed on orally .
With the opening of the class , aboriginal people such as Ms Weng have begun recording the chants and transliterating them .
" We 've only been able to note down about half the chants , " she said .
" The elders have difficulties chanting for a long time . "
It will be an even greater challenge to pass the traditions down to the next generation , said student Djupelang .
" Young people might think this is superstition , " she said , but added that during the recent deadly Typhoon Morakot , many Paiwan found comfort in the witches ' prayer ceremonies .
" It 's good we 're rediscovering that our own religion can also offer us comfort in hard times , " she said .

Yankees fans flooded the streets last night celebrating the teamâ€™s 27th World Series victory .
And surprisingly , they caused little trouble , unlike Phillies fans , who last year flipped cars , smashed windows , and set fires amidst other mayhem that forced the city to generously lube up this time around .
In contrast , New York revelers kept it pretty tame , popping bottles of champagne , decorating trees with toilet paper , lighting a warming trash can fire and burning some Phillies gear , embellished with the message , â€ œFUCK CHEESE STEAKS.â€
Police , who ’s overwhelming presence undoubtedly put a damper on riotous spirits , reported no disturbances last night .
Army chief Wolfgang Schneiderhan is to stand down from his post Germany 's top soldier has resigned over allegations of a cover - up related to a deadly Nato air strike in Afghanistan .
Wolfgang Schneiderhan 's move followed reports that key information about the 4 September action was withheld , the defence minister said .
The strike , which was ordered by a German commander , targeted two fuel tankers hijacked by Taliban militants .
But dozens of civilians were also killed in the attack , which happened in the northern province of Kunduz .
Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg told parliament that Gen Schneiderhan had failed to provide proper information about the incident and had " released himself from his duties at his own request " .
Another senior Defence Ministry official , Peter Wichert , has also resigned .
The announcement came as Germany 's parliament debated whether to extend its military mission in Afghanistan , amid growing domestic opposition to involvement in the conflict .
Secret video Taliban fighters had seized the tankers while they were being driven from Tajikistan to supply Nato forces in Kabul .
Reports said that villagers were taking fuel from the tankers when the strike happened .
ANALYSIS Steve Rosenberg , BBC reporter in Berlin
For several days after the 4 September attack , the defence minister at the time , Franz Josef Jung , maintained that no civilians had been killed .
Today 's edition of the mass circulation Bild newspaper claims the German defence ministry did know about civilian casualties .
Now , on the day the German parliament is debating whether to extend the troop mission in Afghanistan , we see the first political casualties .
The German chief of staff and a deputy defence minister have resigned .
But there is little doubt that German troops will remain in Afghanistan .
Chancellor Merkel 's Christian Democrats and their coalition partner the Free Democrats have already called for an extension of the Germany military mission - and their parties enjoy a clear majority in parliament .
Political casualties of Afghan raid
It is not clear exactly how many civilians died .
The independent Afghanistan Rights Monitor group put the number of civilians deaths at 70 .
The Afghan government later said that at least 100 people died , of whom 30 were civilians .
The resignations were announced hours after a German newspaper , Bild , published a report alleging key information over the incident had been withheld .
Citing a confidential army video and a military report , it said they showed that the German commander who ordered the strike , Col Georg Klein , had not been able to rule out the presence of civilians at the scene before he took action .
The newspaper said the report proved the defence ministry had been told there were clear indications of civilian casualties by the evening of 4 September .
But it said former defence minister Franz Josef Jung continued to state for several days that there was no evidence civilians had been killed .
It is not yet clear whether Mr Jung , who is now labour minister following September 's elections , was aware of the report and the video .
Germany has more than 4,000 troops in Afghanistan , the third largest contingent after the US and Britain .

Sacrifice of 200,000 Animals Proceeds Despite Pleas , Prayers
Every five years , animals and birds are slaughtered in the name of the Hindu deity Gadhimai .
The event on the premises of Gadhimai Temple in the village of Bariyapur is believed to be the largest ritual sacrifice anywhere in the world and draws thousands of visitors from India and Nepal .
French actress and animal advocate Brigitte Bardot is one of those who sent a letter to Nepal 's President Dr. Ram Baran Yadav , who is a Hindu , pleading with him to stop the Gadhimai sacrifice .
" I have dedicated my life to protect animals and the best gift I could receive for this lifelong struggle would be the announcement of the stopping of ritual sacrifice of animals , " Bardot wrote .
" I personally find it hard to imagine that your heart can withstand such cruelty , knowing that you , being the head of the country , are ultimately responsible . "
The advocacy organization Animal Nepal is organizing protest events in Kathmandu ahead of the event and filing a case at the Supreme Court , as well as performing a symbolic ritual blessing in the hope that compassion will reign .
In addition , the Animal Welfare Network Nepal , which shares the Animal Nepal headquarters office , has joined with Anti Animal Sacrifice Alliance in an 11th hour plea to head priest Mangal Chaudhary and organizing committee chairman Shiva Chandra Kushwaha to stop the killing .

" We beg to you on our knees to consider our plea .
You , as the main two responsible persons for the world 's largest animal sacrifice , have the ability to show wisdom , compassion and courage by doing everything in your power to abolish the killing of innocent creatures in the name of the God .
If you do so , the world will always remember you as the key decision - makers in stopping the killings , " the groups wrote .
The plea was reinforced during a symbolic peace ritual today at the Gahawa Mai temple in Birgunj .
Animal Welfare Network Nepal has also petitioned Nepal 's ministers of tourism , agriculture , peace and law and justice to put an end to the sacrifice .
Humane Society International says , " This horrendous cruelty somehow existed without much publicity until this year .
Animal advocates and religious leaders both within Nepal and around the world have displayed outrage and disgust and are working together to pressure on the Nepalese government to put a stop to the mass animal sacrifice . "
HSI and its supporters are beseeching Nepalese leaders with a letter writing campaign , saying , " Even tradition is no excuse for cruelty in a civilized society . "
In a November 3 article in the " Kathmandu Post , " Maneka Gandhi appealed to the people of Nepal to abandon the killing of animals at the Gadhimai Festival .
A minister in four governments , the Indian politician , animal rights activist , and environmentalist said that this is not a way to honor the goddess , who will be instead be dishonored by the deaths and suffering of the animals .
" Priests frighten villagers into believing that terrible things will happen if the goddess is not placated with animal sacrifices , " she wrote .
She detailed the ways in which the festival is a profitable enterprise for priests , moneylenders and animal sellers .
" The festival is a business , and profit is the motive for killing so many animals .
Villagers go into debt to buy the animals to be sacrificed .
Debt leads to bankruptcies , and when the small farmers ’ lands are confiscated to become the property of large landowners , then the former farmers become day laborers , " wrote Gandhi .
" The festival exploits both humans and animals . "
The local business community is expected to raise about two million euros from sales of animal hides and carcasses as well as payment for logistics and recreational facilities .
The Tibetan Buddhist master Lama Zopa Rinpoche is requesting that all Buddhist centers and students read the Golden Light Sutra and pray that the killing may be halted before it begins .
" I have asked Kopan Gompa [ near Kathmandu ] to send some monks to read it at the stupa and make strong prayers for the sacrifice not to happen , to dedicate like that and of course dedicate for world peace , " said Lama Zopa in a widely circulated email .
The Buddha Boy , known for his Buddha - like ascetic life in the jungle , today moved to the Gadhimai Temple in an attempt to stop the sacrifice in the district where he was born and raised .
Officially called by his Tibetan name Palden Dorje Tamang Rinpoche , or by his Nepali name Ram Bahadur Bomjan , he intends to preach non-violence and offer a blessing at the venue to stop the slaughter .

Pramada Shah , director and vice president of Animal Nepal , explains what will happen during the Gadhimai event .
" The fair reaches its climax on an ' auspicious ' day , when thousands of buffaloes are sacrificed .
The blood letting that takes place turns the entire area into a marshy land of blood , " she says .
" It is expected that this year some 60,000 young he - buffaloes will be killed , as well as an additional 140,000 chicken , goats , pigs , birds and other poultry . "
" The sacrifice starts with the offering of five different animals : pig , buffalo , goat , wild rats and birds which include chicken and pigeon .
The different animals represent the mental obscurations sacrificed by the community including anger , stupidity and desire , " Shah explains .
" After the sacrifice of the first animal , a goat , thousands of pigeons are sacrificed by severing their heads .
Next three wild rats are brought and sacrificed before a comb - like pole . "
" After this , " says Shah , " more than 250 people carrying naked swords and axes wrapped in red clothes , all with a license to kill , approach the temple .
They frantically rush towards the field where more than 7,000 young buffaloes are kept .
Before the beasts are slaughtered , seven buffaloes tied to a pole undergo the sacrificial ritual . "
The animal advocates are also appealing to the Gadhimai visitors urging them to keep the animals at home or donate the animals to them .
Animal Welfare Network Nepal and the Department of Livestock Services have made arrangements to shelter any donated animals .
Organizers of the sacrifice claim a slaughterhouse has been built at a cost of over five million rupees to kill the animals and about 250 butchers have been hired .
Nepal 's government , wary of new disruptions threatened by the former Maoist guerrillas , has declined to ban the slaughter despite warnings by animal experts that the killings could trigger swine flu , bird flu and cattle diseases and have severe impacts upon the environment .
Animal advocates request that flowers , fruits and vegetables , incense sticks , sweets and coconuts instead of animals and their blood be offered to appease the goddess .
Vice President George H. W. Bush confided in Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he believed Ronald Reagan was an “ extreme conservative ” supported by “ blockheads and dummies , ” the former Soviet leader claims .
“ In 1987 , after my first visit to the United States , Vice President Bush accompanied me to the airport , and told me : ‘ Reagan is a conservative .
An extreme conservative .
All the blockheads and dummies are for him , and when he says that something is necessary , they trust him .
But if some Democrat had proposed what Reagan did , with you , they might not have trusted him , ' ” Gorbachev said in an interview with The Nation .
ADVERTISEMENT
Gorbachev added that he had been informed that , following their first summit in 1985 , Reagan reportedly described his Soviet counterpart as a “ die - hard Bolshevik ” — this despite the fact that Gorbachev would soon come to be known as a reformer who opened up the Soviet Union politically and ushered in an era of co-operation between east and west .
It ’s no surprise that there were tensions between Reagan and the elder Bush .
In 1980 , the two politicians ran aggressive campaign against each other to secure the Republican nomination for president .
During that campaign , Bush famously described Reagan ’s economic policies as “ voodoo economics . ”
Many historians believe Reagan picked Bush as his running mate after the primaries because of Bush ’s popularity with some segments of the Republican electorate .
In his interview , Gorbachev had praise for Reagan , commending the president for coming to agreements with the Soviet Union on nuclear arms reductions despite large policy differences between the two countries , and some personal animosity between the two leaders .
By telling you this , I simply want to give Reagan the credit he deserves .
I found dealing with him very difficult .
The first time we met , in 1985 , after we had talked , my people asked me what I thought of him .
“ A real dinosaur , ” I replied .
And about me Reagan said , “ Gorbachev is a diehard Bolshevik ! ”
And yet these two people came to historic agreements , because some things must be above ideological convictions .
No matter how hard it was for us and no matter how much Reagan and I argued in Geneva in 1985 , nevertheless in our appeal to the peoples of the world we wrote : “ Nuclear war is inadmissible , and in it there can be no victors . ”
And in 1986 , in Reykjavik , we even agreed that nuclear weapons should be abolished .
This conception speaks to the maturity of the leaders on both sides , not only Reagan but people in the West generally , who reached the correct conclusion that we had to put an end to the Cold War .
As the Cold War fizzled in the late 1980s , observers gave Gorbachev credit for reducing tensions between the east and west , but as time went on , many historians began to give credit to Reagan ’s foreign policy for forcing the Soviet Union to back down from the nuclear brink .
Many historians argue Reagan ’s Strategic Defense Initiative , or “ Star Wars , ” forced the Soviet Union into bankruptcy by keeping them chasing an arms race they could no longer afford .
ADVERTISEMENT
But , in his interview , Gorbachev argued that principle , rather than balance sheets , motivated his transformation of the Soviet economy and society .
Sometimes people ask me why I began perestroika .
Were the causes basically domestic or foreign ?
The domestic reasons were undoubtedly the main ones , but the danger of nuclear war was so serious that it was a no less significant factor .
Something had to be done before we destroyed each other .
Therefore the big changes that occurred with me and Reagan had tremendous importance .
But also that George H.W. Bush , who succeeded Reagan , decided to continue the process .
And in December 1989 , at our meeting in Malta , Bush and I declared that we were no longer enemies or adversaries .
Gorbachev also noted that , three years ago , he received a five - minute standing ovation from a US Midwest audience when he called for an “ American perestroika ” to reform the US ’s economic and social policies .
He has since reiterated that call .

Google has been actively collecting feedback on Google Wave with an ongoing survey , which was distributed via email , the help center , and Twitter .
Today they 've published the initial findings for public dissection .
So far results indicate that users love the concept of Wave , appreciate the collobartion features , and like the extensions , gadgets , and robots .
On the flip side , however , the most perplexing part of the Wave experience is that users ' friends and contacts do n't have access to Wave .
Respondents also complained of speed issues and indicated a desire for integration with more tools like email .
Based on our experience with Google Wave , the results that Google has published are spot on and point to some of the reasons why the system is both a game changer and , on the other hand , still not ready for mainstream attention .
Google does say that they will be acting on your feedback and opinions :
" With these responses and other data , we 're organizing our team around the core issues that are important to making waving better .
We 're working hard to scale our systems so you can invite your friends and colleagues to wave with you .
We 're also thinking about how to integrate with existing communication and collaboration tools .
And since we all know that fast is better than slow , a large portion of the team is working to make Google Wave faster . "

The last moments of Flight 93 were viewed from another aircraft ...
" Executive 956 : OK , I think we got him in sight . "
[ Memory Hole ] ... so it stands to reason that other planes reported seeing Flight 93 during its flight , therefore the military could have easily located the plane .
That being said , why did n't the FAA and military locate of all of the hijacked aircraft through planes which were known to be in their vicinities ?
Maybe they did , but we might never know ...
At least six air traffic controllers who dealt with two of the hijacked airliners on Sept. 11 , 2001 , made a tape recording that day describing the events , but the tape was destroyed by a supervisor without anyone making a transcript or even listening to it , the Transportation Department said today .
The taping began before noon on Sept. 11 at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center , in Ronkonkoma , on Long Island , but it was later destroyed by an F.A.A. quality - assurance manager , who crushed the cassette in his hand , cut the tape into little pieces and dropped them in different trash cans around the building , according to a report made public today by the inspector general of the Transportation Department .
[ New York Times 5/6/04 ]
" Be careful what we say on the loop , because these are being recorded and these tapes will be handed over . "

Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo says Fernando Alonso will sooner or later drive for the historic Italian squad , but the boss suggested it will not happen next year .
Renault driver Alonso has been linked with a move to Ferrari for a long time , and speculation became even stronger after Spanish banking giant Santander , backer of Alonso , confirmed a five - year deal with the Maranello outfit yesterday .
Di Montezemolo suggested Ferrari already has too many drivers for next season to think of Alonso , but the Italian insisted he will hire the two - time champion some day .
" Sooner or later I 'll make it happen .
We 'll see when , " di Montezemolo told Spanish reporters at Monza .
" For next year we have Raikkonen , Massa , Fisichella , Badoer , Gene , and I hope Michael Schumacher , so we have a bench as long as Real Madrid's .
" We have two great champions with the 2007 champion and the man who was 2008 champion for 15 seconds when he crossed the line .
So I think we have two extraordinary drivers . "
He added : " Having said that , I 've always liked Alonso , because he is a great driver that I spotted back when he was in Minardi .
He won titles , and I 've always thought that sooner or later , all great drivers come to Ferrari .
" Before the race at Imola , Ayton Senna came to me and told me : ' I want to end my career with Ferrari ' ; Prost , Lauda , Mansell , Michael , so we 'll see .
We look ahead , and life is long for everyone . "
The Ferrari boss reiterated his support for the introduction of third cars in Formula 1 in order to allow the sport to have a more competitive field .
" I 'm very much in favour for all teams to be able to field three cars , in order to be able to field young drivers , new people , a better show , " he said .
" I think it 's better to have three cars from well - known teams , than two cars from uncompetitive and unknown teams with uncompetitive drivers .
I think F1 is excellence , so welcome to new drivers on competitive cars .
" I think appointing a third car to a young driver or to something new would be useful for the sport .
Just look what Michael 's return at Valencia would have meant .
We must look ahead and try to do it . "
In guidance published last month to public authorities about interpreting equalities legislation and local service provision , much of the guidance used the example of domestic violence .
This is clearly based on a decision made by Dorset Council on closing a female refuge so they can pay for a service for men and women .
A decision that should not have happened because it is n't right to take services away from female victims but more funding for male victims should be found .
The guidance reiterates throughout that there is no problem in funding services based on gender groups if there is need .
It states that far more women suffer from domestic abuse than men , defining the term ' far more ' is difficult but the last split based on Home Office figures was 60%/65 % female 40%/35 % male .
Not usure that constitutes far more .
However , the issue raised is that the document throughout talks about the need for services for female victims and that local authorities and public bodies should ensure they have such services but purposely does not utter the words " you must also ensure you provide domestic violence services for male victims . "
There is a reference ( page 3 ) that the legislation allows services for female victims " separate from services for male victims " .
But what services are there for male victims within local council 's - precious little , if any .
And when it says that there is a need for more services for female victims , why does n't it simply also state " But you must ensure male victims within your community are catered for . "
Why are the needs of male victims not mentioned by the Equalities Commission ?

There ’s been a lot of noise lately about health care in this country , and frankly I ’m getting a little sick from it .
I thought about consulting my physician , but debate drain is not covered under my HMO .
And yes , that is the quality of joke I think this whole debate deserves .
I am routinely mystified by the manipulation of language we see in public debate .
No one considers themselves to be anti-choice or anti-life , but that ’s exactly the dichotomy that the abortion debate sets up .
In the health care debate we ’re told you ’re either pro-freedom or pro-socialism by one side , while the other crows that you are either pro-health or pro-death .
I wonder if one can be a socialist and pro-death ?
Personally , I ’d like to spread death around a bit when it comes my time .
Maybe I ’d get by with a simple maiming , instead .
One argument brought up again and again during this debate has been the so - called death panels .
These supposed death panels would decide when the life of a person was no longer worth living ( or cost prohibitive ) and deny them government health care .
I think the general idea is to scare the proletariat , but personally I find death panels to be a fantastic idea .
Bring them on !
I think death panels should operate like jury duty .
In fact , when you are called you should get a choice between jury duty or death panel .
I ’d choose death panel .
Grim ?
Perhaps , but I think a death panel is a wonderful example of democracy in action .
This guy has cancer ?
This woman has AIDS ?
This kid has a broken arm ?
I for one am tired of Congress imposing their morality upon me .
I want eleven other random strangers in a room with me making up their own personal brand of morality .
Willy over there hates people named Amber because some girl named Amber laughed at him for eating paste in the second grade .
That ’s a valid argument to lie on the table when deciding whether this 77 - year - old widow from Nebraska deserves to live or die .
Maybe granny should have thought wiser of continuing to use a paste - squealing name like Amber .
I suppose there ’s some rational argument against a death panel system , but I ’ll hear none of it .
I ’ll be too busy listening to Queen ’s “ Another One Bites the Dust ” trying to psych myself up for that afternoon ’s death panel .
Some little girl fell in a well , and though they saved her , she looks pretty bruised and scraped up to me .
And her name ’s Amber .
Honduras , September 30 , 2009 .
By Ricardo Arturo Salgado
Tegucigalpa , September 27 , 2009 –- Socialist Voice –- The Honduras crisis has sparked great interest among thinkers of both right and left up and down the continent .
Many people are reflecting on events , using all the analytical tools their knowledge permits .
There is wide scope for speculation , mainly because – for most people – the actions of different forces have been so unexpected in character .
President Manuel Zelaya carried out his return to Honduras in a way that astonished everyone , both the coup makers and most of his followers ( myself included ) .
Of course , the countries that are said to have participated in the operation do all they can to deny prior knowledge of his trip .
Meanwhile , the coup regime ’s “ unanticipated ” logistical capacity , the mobilisation of all its forces and the implementation of tactics did not fail to surprise observers .
Argentina 's President Cristina Fernandez Kirchner was moved to say that events have outdone the actions of the chieftains of the Southern Cone during the dictatorships of the seventies and eighties .
Legitimate and strong governments of the continent , such as Brazil or Mexico ( and even Spain ) , surprised observers by responding to the coup makers with diplomacy - lite , only to be defied in the style of the Third Reich .
At one point , the ``de facto '' regime called on all countries to withdraw their ambassadors from Honduran territory , and to name new ambassadors subject to approval from Tegucigalpa .
To top that , it gave the Brazilian government ten days to define Zelaya ’s status in the embassy , and if not , then …
Could an attack on the embassy of the South American giant really be expedient for Micheletti or someone else here ?
Would n’t such an action be the signal for military intervention sponsored by the whole international community , as if it were an act of charity ?
Is n’t this what many see as a solution for the Honduran problem ?
Threat of a provocative attack
Let ’s explore and speculate a little about what happens in this possible scenario .
The fascist regime , contrary to what was expected after the UN resolutions , maintains and increases its savage repression against the occupants of the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa ( this , in fact , is precisely what has happened ) .
The fascist regime launches a media campaign to justify its hostility to many governments in the region ( they have already done this ; last night its list included Mexico , Spain , Argentina , Venezuela and Brazil – but curiously the United States is left off the list .
The international community remains stupefied but fails to confront the situation correctly , above all necessary measures to sink the regime economically .
This has been going on from day one of the coup ; especially since [ Costa Rica 's president ]
Arias entered on the stage to boycott the resolutions of the entire international community .
The coup makers decide to enter the Brazilian embassy by force .
They take it over and create enormous confusion inside during which some resistance leaders are killed , even President Zelaya .
( This has been minutely prepared during the past few days , while the regime ignored international calls to defend the president ’s safety and the inviolability of the diplomatic legation . )
Simultaneously , they assassinate a large number of established and emerging leaders of the Honduran revolutionary process .
They count on a lapse of at least a week ’s time before the international community reacts .
This plan does n’t appear fictional ; on the night of September 23 the police and army actually tried to hunt down teachers and resistance leaders in the city of Danlí in El Paraíso province .
They have opened thousands of police files on an enormous number of resistance supporters across the country .
The material authors of the coup slip out of the country to a secure place .
The most likely is Panama , a fiscal paradise and centre of drug trafficking with an ultra - right government and an opposition that is incapable , at least for now , of mounting any significant actions and pressure against the upsetting guests .
( Yes , here everything is my speculation . )
International forces intervene in the country .
After a few skirmishes with some rank - and - file soldiers , the invaders call on both sides to have a dialogue .
In the name of peace and democracy , pro-coup candidates [ for the scheduled November 29 election ] , pro-coup private enterprises , pro-coup media , the self - anointed civil society , and the pro-coup church go into the dialog , licking their lips .
Likewise , the new authority reorganises the state in the name of God and reconciliation of the Honduran people , upholding the century - old bipartisan status quo .
As this unfolds , the new forces of order pursue the task of repressing the people until they are pacified .
Possible intervention to aid the right
The idea that foreign military intervention would benefit the right more than anyone else is not , it seems , off the wall .
Such action would allow them to destroy , or so they hope , any advance by progressive movements and people mobilised in the resistance .
As the de facto government was escalating its repression on September 23 , President Zelaya stressed that no foreign intervention will be welcome and that a solution must be found in the framework of dialogue .
The coup regime reacted to this with even more violence .
It is clear that President Zelaya understands that to cry out for military intervention would be to jump off the cliff , exactly as the coup makers hope we will do .
How can we avoid going down that road ?
The National Resistance Front Against the Coup ( FNRG ) , coordinated by workers ' , farmers ' and teachers ' leaders , alongside the president of the republic , has called for a general mobilisation for the “ final offensive ” .
The FNRG is trying to pressure the regime with a demonstration of its organisational capacity to lead the mass movement .
This is , from all angles , the best strategy to take within the country .
The alternative of sanctions
The countries of Latin America , especially Brazil , Mexico , Venezuela and Argentina ( and also Spain ) , should look into specific ways , including physical measures , to defend their diplomatic installations in Honduras , in order to prevent the coup regime from carrying out its plan .
These countries , with the exception of Venezuela , have good possibilities for pressuring the Yankee government to deploy military forces to defend their embassies .
Those gringo soldiers are already here in the Soto Cano base .
A serious , firm and ongoing campaign should be launched to pressure the Panama government to control the inflow of Honduran capital .
In the last three months large amounts of Honduran money have been transferred from banks in the United States to Panamanian banks .
We must pressure Panama not to support the aims of the Honduran coup .
The US administration must be pressured to freeze without delay access of the coup regime to Honduran monetary reserves held in US banks ( this measure has been applied to many other countries ) .
All monetary transactions to Honduras , including family remittances , should be blocked .
We must also demand that the Honduran armed forces reveal where it got the whole arsenal of arms it now possess .
The coup was engineered by Honduran big business .
All preferential commercial treaties should be abrogated in order to cut off their access to foreign currency .
The gringos [ US government ] are not strangers to these ideas .
They have practiced a criminal blockade against the Cuban people for 50 years , supposedly to defend liberty .
This time the US should act , for valid moral reasons .
Such pressure on businesspeople will result in them trying to bring about a rapid resolution of the crisis to protect their own interests .
We know that all this is hardly realistic .
In the end the empire is the empire .
It will not give in to all of these demands .
But getting even a few concessions from them would be a victory for Latin America .
Effective solidarity needed
Another important issue is the immediate organisation of an effective solidarity movement with the people of Honduras and their resistance in all fields – food , technology , computers , self - defence tactics and strategies , and whatever is necessary to maintain and increase this liberation process .
We are not inappropriate to remind Latin American presidents that we are struggling against an illegal and illegitimate government .
This affords juridical and moral support for undertaking a thousand - and - one forms of solidarity to undermine and weaken the fascist regime .
My speculations about the possible course of events shows the need to rapidly analyse this situation in order to take the most reliable path forward .
To repeat , we have to ask the right questions to get the best answers .
Victory is near , we ca n’t give ourselves the luxury of making errors .
No to foreign intervention in complicity with the coup !
Yes to peoples ’ solidarity !
Hasta la victoria siempre – Ever onwards to victory !

‘ The entire experience of being amid this predatory event was humbling and moving , ’ said the photographer to felix finance
‘ There was an energy and an excitement level underwater that is simply indescribable .
Before you even get into the water you can feel it .
‘ We look for Cape Gannets dive bombing a concentrated area from the sky .
Once in the water , you can feel the reverberation of the birds hitting the water , like small explosions constantly around you .
‘ There is a constant chirping of dolphins from every direction .
It was surrea Health Secret
The 35 - year - old , who has been involved in underwater photography since 2001 , says it was his first experience of the feeding frenzy .
‘ It was something I have wanted to do for several years , ’ he says .
‘ It is the largest predatory event on earth , yet scientists know very little about it and it ’s simply unpredictable .
Adobe is Bad for Open Government Share

So next week , Adobe ’s having aconference here to tell Federal employees why they ought to be using “ Adobe PDF , and Adobe® Flash ® technology ” to make government more open .
They ’ve spent what seems to be millions of dollars wrapping buses in DC with Adobe marketing materials all designed to tell us how necessary Adobe products are to Obama ’s Open Government Initiative .
They ’ve even got a beautiful website set up to tout the government ’s use of Flash and PDF , and are holding a conference here next week to talk about how Government should use ubiquitous and secure technologies to make government more open and interactive .
Here at the Sunlight Foundation , we spend a lot of time with Adobe ’s products – mainly trying to reverse the damage that these technologies create when government discloses information .
The PDF file format , for instance , is n’t particularly easily parsed .
As ubiquitous as a PDF file is , often times they ’re non-parsable by software , unfindable by search engines , and unreliable if text is extracted .
Take , for instance , H.R. 3200 – otherwise known as “ America ’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 ” , a 1017 page healthcare bill from congress .
Because it is primarily published in PDF , we ’ve got to build a special parser for it– that bill– in order to represent it programatically .
Or Carl Malamud ’s IRS filings for 527 ( stealth PAC ) organizations : gigabytes of PDF files , all released by government .
Government releasing data in PDF tends to be catastrophic for Open Government advocates , journalists and our readers because of the amount of overhead it takes to get data out of it .
When a government agency publishes its data and documents as PDFs , it makes us Open Government advocates and developers cringe , tear our hair out , and swear a little ( just a little ) .
Most earmark requests by members of congress are published as PDF files of scanned letters , leading the Sunlight Foundation and others to write custom parsers for each letter .
Yet , for some reason , Adobe feels they ’re essential to the new administration ’s mission of transparent and open government .
I on the other hand feel like picketing the event they ’re having next week to sell their wares ( hey hey !
ho ho !
your - binary - low - parsable - formats - for - government - data has got to go ! ) because in fact , they ’re quite the opposite .
Here at Sunlight we want the government to STOP publishing bills , and data in PDFs and Flash and start publish them in open , machine readable formats like XML and XSLT .
What ’s most frustrating is , Government seems to transform documents that are in XML into PDF to release them to the public , thinking that that ’s a good thing for citizens .
Government : We can turn XML into PDFs .
We ca n’t turn PDFs into XML .
Flash is n’t off the hook either .
Government has spent lots of time and money developing flash tools to allow citizens to view charts and graphs online , and while we ’re happy the government is interested in allowing citizens to do this , Government ’s primary method of disclosure should not be these visualizations , but rather publishing the APIs and datasets that allow citizens to make their own .
Only after those things are completed to the fullest extent possible should government be working on its own visualizations .
While Adobe may say in their open government whitepaper :
“ Since the advent of the web , an entire infrastructure has evolved to enable public access to information .
Such technologies include HTML , Adobe PDF , and Adobe® Flash® technology . ”
This is nonsense .
The fact is , sticking to open , standards based technologies like HTML , XML , JSON and others are far more important and useful in getting your information out to the public than the proprietary formats of Adobe .
Here ’s a hint– if the data format has an ® by its name , it probably is n’t great for transparency or open data .
So do n’t get me wrong – I appreciate just like the next guy that I can download a nice PDF file of an IRS form , print it out , and send it in .
I think that members of congress publishing their “ Dear Colleague ” letters with accuracy is great and important , and I think the pie charts on the IT dashboard are really neat .
But when it comes down to it , these technologies are n’t helping to fully open our government .
They have their place , but in terms of transparency and openness , I ’m afraid they do more harm than good .
Relying on them only yields frustration from the people who use the data government publishes the most , and they should be considered a bell or a whistle on top of the foundation that an agency should do to be fully transparent : putting data online , obeying the 8 principles of Open Data to the fullest extent .
Update ( 3:10 pm ) :
At the strong urging of our Policy Director , I ’ll add this caveat : any time Government decides to release data to the public , we ’re glad that government has taken a step forward .
But the PDF file format , especially when it comes to data , and large documents like bills , is something that government should strongly consider open , machine readable , parsable alternatives to .
There are plenty , and we ’re happy to help find them for you .
Update ( 3:20 pm ) : PJ Doland has the right answer .
PDF by itself is insufficient .
So is Flash .
But what makes PDF in particular bad is that more often than not , you can turn XML into a human readable PDF .
But you ca n’t turn PDF into a machine readable XML / JSON / whatever file .
President Barack Obama ’s Justice Department has changed little from the Bush Justice Department because the same people are still running the show , says former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Siegelman is fighting a 2006 corruption conviction he and many observers say was politically motivated and may have even been orchestrated from within the Bush White House .
Last week , Raw Story reported that President Obama ’s solicitor general , Elena Kagan , is standing by Siegelman ’s Bush - era conviction , saying prosecutors had proven “ corrupt intent . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There ’s really been no substantial change in the heart of the Department of Justice from the Bush - Rove Department of Justice , ” Siegelman , a Democrat , told TalkingPointsMemo ’s Justin Elliott .
“ The people who have been writing the briefs for the government are the same people who were involved in the prosecution . ”
Siegelman was freed on bail in March , 2008 , pending an appeal of his 2006 conviction .
Federal prosecutors alleged that Siegelman had broken the law in what they described as a pay - to - play scheme that saw Siegelman appoint former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy to a hospital regulatory board after Scrushy had organized $ 500,000 in donations to Siegelman ’s campaign to launch a statewide lottery .
Siegelman ’s lawyers argued the relationship between Siegelman and Scrushy was nothing out of the ordinary , and this fall 91 former attorneys general agreed , and urged the Supreme Court to hear Siegelman ’s case because it “ concerns the criminalization of conduct protected by the First Amendment — the giving and receiving of campaign contributions . ”
A Raw Story investigative series published in 2007 documents allegations that Siegelman ’s prosecution was orchestrated from the Bush White House , with White House adviser Karl Rove playing a pivotal role .
“ The seeming disconnect between Obama ’s team and numerous Democrats — including House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. , who ’s investigated Siegelman ’s case — may be because President George W. Bush ’s US Attorney in Alabama is still in office , ” Raw Story reported last week .
“ Democrats still have n’t settled on a replacement , some eleven months after Obama ’s inauguration . ”

In his interview with TPM , Siegelman echoed that notion :
So , Ales Hemsky is dead and he took the Oilers season with him .
According to Jim Matheson , Hemsky is receiving an MRI on his shoulder and will miss tonight 's game against the Sharks .
For those who have been living under a rock ( or in Winnipeg ) , Hemsky was run into the end boards by Michal Handzus in what was a brutal hit by Handzus 's standards .
A smooth - skating , two - way Slovakian who 's been in the league since 1998 , Handzus is n't known for his dirty play but his hit on Hemsky was pathetic , catching Hemsky around the shoulders with a crosscheck and riding him into the boards .
It was taking " finishing his check " to its logical conclusion : he finished the hell out of Hemsky , smashing his face into the boards and knocking the Oiler star out of the game .
Total punishment for Handzus 's dirty play : two minutes in the box .
Total time missed by Hemsky : well , we 're still working on that .
Now , we all know about Colin Campbell 's Wheel o' Justice .
If you injure a star player for an American team and you 're not Chris Pronger , enjoy your time off .
Plaster somebody up in Canada so ESPN does n't notice , and unless he winds up in intensive care you 'll probably get away with it .
Do I sound a little paranoid ?
Well , it 's the simplest explanation for the fact that this keeps happening .
Other teams have been taking liberties with the Oilers so often I 'm surprised they do n't carry tasers in their hockey pants .
Yet not one of these incidents have been met with so much as a fine , never mind a suspension .
Most were only two minute penalties if they were penalized at all .
Make all the Wheel o' Justice jokes you want , but sometimes the game is just rigged .
The season began on a sour note when Jarome Iginla and Sheldon Souray got into it on October 8 , with Souray and Iginla both chasing the puck into the same corner .
Iginla 's stick got between Souray 's legs as he drove into the corner , causing him to lose his footing and smack into the boards face first .
Souray missed sixteen games .
Iginla got a two minute penalty and was left to go on his merry way molesting defensemen on the end boards until the end of time or his contract is up for renewal and he starts trying again ; whatever happens first .
Now , there has been some good old - fashioned Copper and Blue dissent over this .
I , honestly , give Iginla most of a pass for the play .
It was careless but he got an appropriate penalty for that carelessness : two minutes in the sin bin .
Anything further would be punishing based on the injury rather than the infraction .
Derek , on the other hand , was of the opinion that Iginla played like a dirty bastard and deserved more than he got .
Certainly the impact on the Oilers was significant , as it began the injury death spiral that 's seen us slump to five games below .500 as opposed to our rightful three .
The NHL disciplinary office , if they even deigned to review the play , agreed with me .
As well they should have for I am a genius .
This incident would hardly be noteworthy on its own , but it was not on its own .
It was only the first in a long , long chain of brutality .
On Remembrance Day , Clarke MacArthur tried to put Liam Reddox into the hospital .
With Reddox turning in his own zone as the puck passed , MacArthur hit Reddox in the shoulder region with a hit from behind while Reddox was crouching about five feet into the boards .
Riding Reddox 's face into the boards , the young Fernando Pisani 's face hit about halfway down the boards and he did n't get up .
Frankly , it was a miracle and a testament to Reddox apparently being made out of titanium that he did n't miss the next game .
MacArthur looked sad after embossing a Blue Cross Blue Shield ad onto another human being 's face .
Apparently " looking sad " was sufficient excuse : he may not have absorbed the five - year - old 's lesson to put on the breaks when he sees the other guy 's numbers and he may have finished the hell out of that dirty hit , but he looked kinda glum so that makes it okay .
He got five and a game , but he deserved a lot more than that .
Quoting renowned fan of rough play Pierre McGuire , " sometimes good people can do bad things . "
Of course there was no suspension .
Of course .
Just last week , there was another example when Ryan Wilson of the Colorado Avalanche popped Ethan Moreau with an Undertaker - style flying shoulder that even Jim Ross would have found excessive .
Zack Stortini immediately threw down with Wilson , proving that whatever comments I might make about Moreau his teammates are willing to stick up for him .
Wilson got a five minute penalty , but that was for fighting Stortini ( who took an additional minor and a ten minute misconduct for standing up in somebody face - to - face instead of being a gutless puke ) .
To quote Mick McGeough quoted by David Staples , " It was unfortunate .
He had his head down .
And he got hit really hard . "
To quote the NHL rulebook , " 43.1 Charging - A minor or major penalty shall be imposed on a player or goalkeeper who skates or jumps into , or charges an opponent in any manner . "
Hope this helps , Mick .
Then there was Wednesday .
Ales Hemsky 's shoulder is sitting in a shoebox on Ken Lowe 's desk and Michal Handzus is skating free as a bird , which is only justice if the injured player is an Edmonton Oiler .
Call me paranoid , but when was the last time a player was suspended , say , two games or more for injuring an Oiler ?
Canucks , Senators , and Flames fans could probably sympathise : it seems to be going around Canada the last few seasons .
( Adds ICE comment )
NEW YORK , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - The ICE Futures Exchange on Friday canceled trades on the U.S. dollar index futures , the second time it did so this month , but provided few details .
The exchange canceled trades in the December contract above 76.50 , a spokesperson said .
It was the second time this month that the ICE canceled trades on the December futures dollar index .
Traders on Friday said the December futures contract DZX9 on the index had spiked to 82 , raising questions given that the dollar 's rise versus the euro EUR= was below 1 percent .
The euro is the biggest component of the index , with a weight of 57.6 percent .
“ That fact that this has occurred on two specific occasions within a two - week time frame leads market participants to believe that there is some suspicious ( cancellation ) of legitimate trades by the ICE Exchange , ” said Mike Hill , a partner at private investment house USF Corp in Atlanta , Georgia .
Lee Underwood , communications director at ICE in Atlanta , said in a statement : “ All trade cancellations are made pursuant to the exchange rulebook . ”
According to estimates from market participants , about 4,000 contracts were canceled on Friday .
The ICE declined to give the exact number .
Sources said the trades affected were those that came in between 7:04 a.m. to 7:07 a.m. ET .
The ICE had also canceled trades on the December futures dollar index on Nov. 3 , between 4:59 a.m. to 5:07 a.m. ET , a market source said , adding that around 8,000 contracts were canceled .
The ICE on Nov. 3 also had declined to give specific information about the volume or reason why the trades were canceled .
Late afternoon in New York , the ICE Futures December dollar index contract was up 0.5 percent at 75.710 .
Meanwhile , the Reuters - calculated dollar index , which measures the dollar 's value against a basket of six other major currencies , was up 0.5 percent at 75.637 .

Alberto Aquilani could make his Liverpool first - team debut in the Carling Cup fourth - round tie at Arsenal after being included in the squad to travel to north London .
The £ 20 m Italian midfielder has been fully involved in Liverpool 's training this week and looks set to feature at the Emirates Stadium tomorrow .
Aquilani played for 15 minutes of a reserve match last week , having been recovering from a knee operation since his arrival at the club in the summer .
The Liverpool manager , Rafael Benítez , stated his intention to utilise the former Roma man against Arsenal , although he will not start , and believes Aquilani will add a new dimension to the Merseysiders ' midfield .
" He will be with us , " said Benítez .
" He is improving his fitness , so he's in the squad .
He can not start at this moment but he will be there and maybe we can give him some minutes .
If it 's possible , we will try to use him . "
" We can see in every training session that he has quality , game intelligence and good movements .
He is a different kind of player for us .
We talk about using Steven Gerrard deeper sometimes , but maybe in Aquilani we have a player who can play there and pass the ball really well in the final third . "
After spending his first two months in England on the sidelines , Aquilani is relishing the prospect of playing a part in Liverpool 's season , having witnessed the atmosphere from the stands at Anfield during Sunday 's 2 - 0 win over Manchester United .
" It was incredible to be at the stadium on Sunday , " said Aquilani .
" It was one of the best games I have seen so far .
I do n't normally like to watch a match inside a stadium when I am not playing , but I really enjoyed Sunday .
" When I was in Rome , although the stadium was bigger , it did not have the same atmosphere as here .
Because the fans are closer to the pitch at Anfield , you can feel the atmosphere better .
It was very important to win against United and hopefully it can give us more confidence . "
While the 25 - year - old acknowledges he is still short of match fitness , he is already relishing the prospect of a first - team bow , with Benítez likely to make a decision on the level of his involvement tomorrow .
" It was good to play for the reserves because I have n't played for a long time , " he said .
" But to play for the first team is something different again and I am looking forward to that .
I really want to play , but I need to be patient , I know the time will come for me .
I will be very happy when I make my debut .
This is my job , it 's what I am here to do , and I am looking forward to it . "
With his first - team debut finally on the horizon , Aquilani was keen to thank his fellow players and the staff at the club 's Melwood training ground for helping him settle into life on Merseyside .
" I want to thank all the players and the people at the club because they have been very helpful to me since I arrived here , " he added .
" Obviously as Andrea Dossena is here and speaks Italian , he has helped me , but I want to take the opportunity to thank every player .
It has been difficult , but now I want to build up my confidence and I hope to bring out the best of my game here . "
The GOP 's brand - spanking - new website calls Jackie Robinson a " GOP Hero . "
That 's true !
Also true : baseball 's first black player said the 1964 Republican convention gave him an " understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler 's Germany . "
You really must check out the brand - new GOP.com , which was unveiled today .
It does n't work , of course .
( It 's actually called " GOP beta , " which is a rich metaphorical truth . )
But if you keep clicking " reload , " and if you 're lucky , you 'll actually bring up the page and be shocked to find a tiny , adorable little Michael Steele walking across your screen and addressing you directly , in the fashion of a Princess Leia hologram , to beg for " Republican coders " to help make the site actually work , which it does n't .
" GOP beta " will provide fodder for many days to come , but Greg Sargent at the Washington Post Company 's Plumline blog has found a delightful nugget :
The site 's " Heroes " page features a lot of black faces , probably in order to counter the ( accurate ) impression that the GOP is actively courting the energy and activism of people who really do n't like black presidents ( we 'd provide a link , but right now it says " PHP has encountered an Access Violation at 7C82A01A " ) .
There 's Frederick Douglass , for instance , who famously supported the GOP 's affirmation of states ' rights and opposition to the involvement of the federal government in local affairs .
And there 's also Jackie Robinson , baseball hero and famous Republican .
Yes , Jackie Robinson campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960 , and for Nelson Rockefeller in 1964 .
But Sargent points out that he was a registered independent , and dug up these telling quotes from his autobiography , recounting his experience at the 1964 Republican National Convention :
That convention was one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life .
The hatred I saw was unique to me because it was hatred directed against a white man .
It embodied a revulsion for all he stood for , including his enlightened attitude towards black people .
A new breed of Republicans had taken over the GOP .
As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco , I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler 's Germany .
This Robinson fellow seems like he'd be right at home at a tea party , where he would no doubt be welcomed with open arms as long as he can prove that he was born in America .
While the GOP is busy rewriting the past , it has n't had much time to look to the future : Politico 's Ben Smith went to see who was featured on its " future leaders " page , and found another rich metaphorical truth : a blank page .
As more and more developers start to enter the mobile application space — be it for the iPhone , Android , the BlackBerry , the Palm Pre , or any of the others — standing out in a crowded field of applications becomes more and more important .
For many developers , the end - goal is just to get their apps downloaded or purchased .
However , as the space becomes larger , staying visible and keeping your application in - use will also become critical to ensure future sales or developments .
Mobile analytics firm Flurry ( which we 've covered in the past ) released a study last week analyzing mobile application retention trends and what impact pricing and application type has on usage and app loyalty .
Flurry studied user retention across 19 different application categories over a 90 - day period on a number of different application platforms .
They monitored how frequently a consumer returned to an app after downloading it within 30 , 60 and 90 days , as well as how often any user accessed any application it had downloaded in the past over a 7 - day period .
In its sample , Flurry found that the most - frequently used applications over the longest period of time were news , reference , productivity and navigation apps .
This makes sense , if you consider that accessing the news , looking up information and getting directions from a map are the types of activities that many people like to do while on - the - go .
These applications are not only useful , but they can be ideal for the mobile platform .
On the opposite end of the spectrum ( or graph , as it were ) , the applications that had the least usage over time were what Flurry calls " Entertainment " apps .
" Entertainment " does n't mean games , it means one - off , single - purpose novelty applications .
Things like Fart applications or IQ tests or flashlights or other toys .
As can be expected , these applications are often used just a few times and then abandoned .
Why Is Retention Data Important ?
You might find app retention data interesting , but if you are a developer or an app producer , why is this information important ?
Because knowing usage patterns for an app can help determine pricing , the viability of add - ons , and in the future as app stores evolve , upgrades .
With the iPhone 3.0 SDK , Apple introduced the ability to do in - app purchases , so that developer 's can offer additional content .
Knowing how your applications are used ( or not used ) can help determine if add - ons will add value or long - term usage , or if that development time would be better focused elsewhere .
For developers trying to decide between an ad- supported or direct - pricing model , knowing how often and over what period of time a user uses your apps can show what might be more economically viable .
Ultimately , this sort of data can inform developers about how consumers use their products , which in turn can help better products get developed .
What is Your App Loyalty
Are you a use once and then delete kind of app tester or do you have favorites you use over an extended period of time ?
Let us know in the comments !
( UPDATE : A news video update on the Hajj has been added below . )
Statement by the President on Hajj and Eid-ul - Adha , as provided by the White House
Michelle and I would like to send our best wishes to all those performing Hajj this year , and to Muslims in America and around the world who are celebrating Eid-ul - Adha .
The rituals of Hajj and Eid-ul - Adha both serve as reminders of the shared Abrahamic roots of three of the world ’s major religions .
During Hajj , the world ’s largest and most diverse gathering , three million Muslims from all walks of life – including thousands of American Muslims – will stand in prayer on Mount Arafat .
The following day , Muslims around the world will celebrate Eid-ul - Adha and distribute food to the less fortunate to commemorate Abraham ’s willingness to sacrifice his son out of obedience to God .
This year , I am pleased that the Department of Health and Human Services has partnered with the Saudi Health Ministry to prevent and limit the spread of H1N1 during Hajj .
Cooperating on combating H1N1 is one of the ways we are implementing my administration 's commitment to partnership in areas of mutual interest .
On behalf of the American people , we would like to extend our greetings during this Hajj season – Eid Mubarak .

The Iraqi government Thursday signed a deal with a consortium led by U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. to develop a major oil field in southern Iraq , marking the first entry by an American - dominated group into Iraq ’s oil industry since it was nationalized in 1972 .
The deal coincides with a flurry of activity this week that suggests major oil companies are finally poised to return to Iraq , more than six years after the U.S. - led military invasion raised firms ’ hopes of gaining access to some of the world ’s largest and most underdeveloped oil reserves .
This week , a group led by Italy ’s Eni that includes the U.S. company Occidental Petroleum Corp. initialed a preliminary agreement , and China National Petroleum Corp. and Britain ’s BP finalized an accord to develop oil fields in the south .
The deals are service contracts .
That means the consortia will invest money to improve the yields of the fields and receive in return a fixed fee .
The agreements came after the oil companies dramatically lowered their fees to match those offered by the Iraqi government at a public auction in June .

The Exxon Mobil - led consortium , which includes Royal Dutch Shell , will receive $ 1.90 per barrel of extra oil produced , down from the $ 4 it asked for in June .
The consortium , 80 % controlled by Exxon Mobil , will invest $ 25 billion to improve the yield of the West Qurna 1 field from 290,000 barrels a day to 2.3 million barrels a day , Oil Minister Hussein Shahristani said at the signing ceremony .
Major oil companies have been eyeing Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , but the Iraqi government has acted slowly to encourage them .
That changed this year as falling oil prices and lagging exports put a squeeze on the national budget .
But the June auction fizzled after it emerged that Iraq was n’t willing to pay the fees demanded by the oil firms .
Getting the companies to accept lower fees is a major victory for the government , said Peter Kemp of New York - based Energy Intelligence .

“ If the oil companies can deliver here , the Iraqis have struck a brilliant bargain :
They will reap more than 95 % of the reward , ” he said .
“ Oil companies are not happy , but they feel they have to get in , whatever the costs and risks , because the potential of Iraq ’s reserves is unmatched anywhere else . ”
There are some doubts about the legality of these contracts , because the Iraqi parliament has still not passed new oil legislation .
That ’s a risk the companies appear willing to take to gain access to Iraqi oil , Kemp said .

Alex Barton 's parents always knew he could excel in school .
All it took was a little time - and not being cruelly voted out of class .
Barton , now 7 , recently made the honor roll at Jupiter Academy in Palm Beach County , just a year and a half removed from making national attention after being outcast from his kindergarten class in a public school like a contestant on Survivor .
" His mom was not surprised , but very thankful that the teachers were able to give
Alex the type of education he needed , " said Paul Sopp , the family 's attorney .
" This just goes to show Alex could be educated if a proper educational plan was put in place . "
Barton received straight A's on his report card , his mom Melissa Barton said .
" The difference is just unbelievable .
It 's day and night from where he was before , " she said .
" There are a lot of children out there that can excel but it really depends on the teachers they have and how dedicated they are .
He feels like a part of a family in his classroom . "
Wendy Portillo , the alleged mastermind of the class vote , called for the vote because Barton was disruptive in class , but it turned out the boy had a form of autism .
Before the vote , Portillo told the students one by one to tell Barton what they did n't like about him .
The kids eventually voted to expel him , 14 - 2 .
Barton 's parents pulled him out of the school after the incident and has filed a lawsuit against the Palm Beach School Board because of the incident .
The turmoil has n't slowed Barton down , as evidenced by his academic achievement .
And he is being taught by a first - year teacher to boot , Sopp said .
The second grader was home schooled last year and attends Jupiter Academy on a MacKay scholarship , which provides money for students with special needs to attend a private school , according to the Palm Beach Post .

What do these phrases mean to you ?
“ Circuit board ” , “ gearbox ” , “ dynamo and battery ” ?
If your answer is “ digital camera ” then you are either cheating or you already know about the BigShot , a kit camera designed to let kids learn about digicams by building one .
The BigShot , still in testing , is a super - simple digicam from the Computer Vision Lab at Columbia University .
It comes in parts , ready to be assembled ( by kids , but I ca n’t wait to get my hands on one ) , and teaches you along the way how these things work .
It ’s not quite the transparent view you get from making an old analog camera , where you can see how everything works , but it ’s as close as you can get from a machine that uses circuit boards .
The feature set itself is interesting enough .
The BigShot is powered by a single AA battery , or by spinning a crank ( 4 - 6 rotations will provide enough power for one shot ) .
The flash is made up of LEDs , and there is no removable memory card — instead you just hook up the camera to a computer via USB .
The lens arrangement is the best part , though .
An array of options is laid out on a dial , which is rotated into position , much like the elements on a microscope .
Matched pairs sit opposite each other on the circle , so you look through one ( there is nor screen on the back ) and take a picture through it ’s partner .
Lens choices are “ normal ” ( a 43 º field of view ) , “ panoramic ” , which appears to act likE an anamorphic lens , squishing the scene horizontally to be stretched back out in the accompanying BigShot software , and “ Stereo Prism ” , which splits an image into stereo pairs , again for processing later .
One oddity , caused by the lack of a screen , is that you can only delete the last photo you took : this is done by turning the control dial to the trashcan icon and pressing the shutter .
We actually like this setup : along with the limited ( and unspecified ) amount of on - board memory and the lack of an image review function is that you will shoot like you did with film — every frame is precious and everything comes as a surprise when you finally get to see the photos .
As a non mass market educational aid , it ’s sure to be too expensive .
But perhaps , if sold as a toy , or advertised as a low - tech camera , kind of a digital Lomo , it could take off .
I ’m all over this , and if it comes in at under $ 100 I ’ll be grabbing one for myself and my nephew , who does n’t have enough geek influences in his life .

I just do n't understand , why does ms .
scoville cry so much ?
It happens so often !
An industry organisation that includes Virgin and Yahoo has called on the government to " urgently " reassess its dismissive view about the potential threat and impact of oil shortages .
The call from the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security comes after revelations in the Guardian that there is dissent inside the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) about how soon the world may run out of supplies .
It also comes alongside a petition to Number 10 which calls on Gordon Brown to take up the issue more seriously amid a growing number of reports that indicate the situation is more urgent than many believed .
The Wicks Review into energy issues , published in August on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change , gave scant regard to peak oil issues .
Will Whitehorn , the taskforce chairman , who is also president of Virgin Galactic , Sir Richard Branson 's space travel business , said : " Given the revelations from within the IEA , we hope the government will be urgently reviewing the complacent approach to peak - oil risk evident in the Wicks Review . "
Other members of the taskforce include Scottish and Southern Energy , Stagecoach , the transport group , and Arup , the civil engineering consultancy .
Work already undertaken by the taskforce has suggests that more needs to be done to prepare for the potential economic dislocation from a sudden huge rise in crude prices .
The IEA has dismissed as " groundless " the claims of whistleblowers that political pressure from the US is affecting the way in which future oil reserves and production figures are presented and analysed .
The Paris - based organisation has argued that more than 200 oil experts have reviewed their numbers , leaving no scope for partisan views .
The debate was enlivened last Friday when Swedish academics unveiled their latest assessments of the numbers and came to even more gloomy assumptions .
The study from Uppsala University entitled The Peak of the Oil Age estimated that by 2030 the world would be able to rely on only 75 m barrels of oil a day , compared with the 105 m forecast by the IEA .
Until relatively recently the agency was assuming the output figure would be as high as 120 m and it still believes a peak of production could be reached in 2020 , while Uppsala believes it might have already been reached .
Meanwhile a petition on the No 10 website has been launched , calling for Gordon Brown to take action in response to a recent report by the UK Energy Research Council , which talks of a " significant risk " of oil peaking before 2020 .
The petition also refers to the 2005 Hirsch Report in the US , which has highlighted the decades - long timespan needed to transform oil - based infrastructure .
And while BP and others have said that there is plenty of oil for the next four decades , John Hess , the founder and chairman of the Hess Corporation , the US oil company , told a conference in London last month that a " devastating oil crisis " loomed on the horizon if global action was not taken quickly .
Hess added : " If consuming nations led by the US commit to conserving energy through new automotive and building efficiency standards , we could save over five million barrels per day of incremental supply over the next ten years . "
BEIJING --
A senior Chinese climate - talks negotiator said efforts to broker a global climate - change deal may fail unless developed countries change their demands before a planned December summit in Copenhagen .
The comments by Lu Xuedu , deputy director of China 's National Climate Center , added to fears that a growing divide between richer and poorer nations -- laid bare in preliminary talks in Bangkok several weeks ago -- is hurting prospects for an agreement .

“ I ’ve been waiting my whole life , for this one night . ”
An asteroid , with the energy of three Hiroshima bombs , has exploded in the atmosphere above Indonesia - reigniting fears about Earth 's defences against space impacts .
Witnesses in Indonesia heard the explosion and spotted a huge fireball in the sky .
The blast was also heard by monitoring stations 10,000 miles away , according to a report by scientists at the University of Western Ontario .
The explosion , on October 8 , caused no damage on the ground because it occurred at high altitude , 15 to 20 km above Earth 's surface .
Nasa estimates the explosion was the equivalent to 50,000 tons of TNT , making it one of the largest asteroid explosions ever observed .
Scientists are worried that it was not spotted by telescopes ahead of the impact , and that had it been larger and at a lower altitude it could have caused a disaster .
A Nasa statement said : " We estimate size to be about 5 - 10 meters in diameter .
As a rule , the most common types of stony asteroids would not be expected to cause ground damage unless their diameters were about 25 meters in diameter or larger . "
Tim Spahr , director of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge , Massachusetts , says that objects as small as 20 or 30 metres across may be capable of doing damage on Earth .
He warned that it was inevitable that these will go unnoticed :
" If you want to find the smallest objects you have to build more , larger telescopes .
A survey that finds all of the 20 - metre objects will cost probably multiple billions of dollars . "

One of the Maclaren pushchairs being recalled by the firm
Pushchair - maker Maclaren USA has announced a recall of 1 m pushchairs in the US after a dozen children had their fingertips amputated in the hinge .
The amputations happened when children placed their finger in the hinge while the pushchair , or stroller , was being unfolded .
The recall involves all Maclaren single and double umbrella pushchairs .
The firm has urged consumers to stop using the pushchairs immediately and to contact it for a repair kit .
Patty Davis of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) said the organisation had received a total of 15 reports of injuries to children 's fingers .

The models involved include Volo , Triumph , Quest Sport , Quest Mod , Techno XT , Techno XLR , Twin Triumph , Twin Techno and Easy Traveller .
The company stressed that models sold in the UK were not affected .
" The most important thing for parents and care - givers to remember is to get the repair kit immediately .
Do not use the stroller unless you get the repair kit in place first , " Ms Davis said .
She said the free repair kit provided hinge covers for each side of the pushchair , which would restrict access to the hinges .
The pushchair will remain fully functional with the hinge covers attached .
On its website , Maclaren stressed that safety remained its top priority and urged consumers to contact the firm immediately to obtain the repair kit .
OTL : Full Circle
OULDER , Colo . -- Every Sunday , after church , the 7 - year - old boy would escape to Grandpa 's basement .
He 'd never seen such a room -- trophies and game balls and jerseys and photos and videotapes , all at his disposal .
He 'd heard about a place called heaven , a magical place they raved about in Bible school , and he decided this had to be it .
It had to be .
Because his father was here .
One of those trophies his daddy won .
One of those game balls his daddy earned .
One of those jerseys his daddy wore .
One of those photos his daddy 's face .
Stacks of those videos his daddy coming to life .
The 7 - year - old would revel down there for hours , watching game film that made his eyes bulge , gripping a football that felt like love , deciding right then and there how he was going to spend the rest of his life :
Re-creating that basement .
The kind of recruit who can turn an entire program around
A dozen years earlier , in a coaching dungeon at the University of Colorado , Bill McCartney studied the same sort of game film -- not knowing it would change his family 's life forever .
It was 1985 , and McCartney was coming off a 1 - 10 season , ready to throw his playbook in the gutter .
He had decided to imitate Nebraska and switch full time to an option offense , but he'd need a rugged quarterback to orchestrate it , a quarterback who could run , pass and take a forearm shiver to the jaw .
University of Colorado Sports Information Sal Aunese was a perfect fit with the Colorado offense .
One look at Sal Aunese , a robust Samoan out of San Diego , and the coach 's eyes lit up .
McCartney had a preacher 's way about him , and after watching Aunese bull his way to about 10 high school touchdowns , he called in his top recruiter for a chat , a recruiter by the name of Les Miles .
McCartney had coached Miles in the mid-1970s at Michigan , so they 'd known each other for a decade and could say anything .
And that 's why McCartney had no problem putting his arm around the young assistant and telling him :
You 're going to California .
Now .
Miles left , and did n't return for a month .
He was n't married and did n't have a dog to walk ; his only obligation was to come home with the quarterback .
Nebraska was on Aunese 's heels , too , so it was all - out war .
But there was something kind and genuine about Miles , something parental that struck Sal , his parents , and his six brothers and sisters .
" That Les Miles was truthful , straight up , " remembers Sal 's older brother Joe , who had played at Kansas State .
" I remember him saying , ' Hey , Sal , we 're going to run the ball . '
He 'd say , ' Sal , I 'm an ex-offensive lineman , I 'm the offensive line coach .
I assure you the holes will be there . ' "
When McCartney would call for updates , Miles would n't rave about Aunese 's skills so much as about Aunese 's aura .
The entire Vista High School team flocked to the kid ; he was a rock star .
Sal played with a smirk , which every superb quarterback needs , but he somehow stayed humble , somehow was n't a prima donna .
Miles told McCartney : " He 's agreed to come visit campus .
We 're lucky .
We got a shot . "
McCartney , his dapper quarterback coach , Gary Barnett , and the Rocky Mountains took over from there .
As Sal stepped off the plane , he took one look at the landscape , breathed the crisp air and fell hard for Colorado .
McCartney then used his charm .
He told Sal the wishbone offense would make him a star , and Barnett drew up some plays on the spot that seconded the notion : bootlegs , quarterback draws , flea - flickers .
Most of the offensive coaches had people skills ( and head - coaching jobs in their futures ) -- Miles , Barnett , offensive coordinator Gerry DiNardo .
So , Sal did n't see the point of Nebraska anymore , and committed to the Buffaloes , causing an emotional earthquake in McCartney 's office .
" It was a bonanza getting Aunese was a recruiting bonanza , " McCartney says .
" You think we were n't slapping high fives ? "
Then they saw his final high school transcript .
Sal 's parents still spoke Samoan in their household , and Sal had always played catch - up in school .
Because of low SAT scores , he became a Prop 48 casualty , meaning he could n't play his freshman year at CU .
When he arrived in Boulder in the fall of ' 86 , Barnett was assigned to watch over him , to make sure he kept his grades up , essentially to hold his hand .
There were no guarantees the kid would survive the curriculum or ever play in a game , and , worse , he was n't allowed to practice or sit in on meetings .
He was frustrated , often left bored in his room , his football career going nowhere fast .
On the plus side , he got a chance to meet the girl down the hall .
University of Colorado Sports Information Sal Aunese with his friend and Colorado teammate Oakland Salavea .
Surprising success and a shocking secret
Her name was Kristy McCartney -- yes , daughter of that McCartney -- and , whereas most football players were intimidated by her or afraid she'd rat on them to her dad if they were rude -- Sal found her intriguing .
She was funny , warm and extroverted , everything he was , and he would proudly introduce her around as " my coach 's daughter . "
They were purely friends , but because they lived on the same floor and ate in the same dining hall , they kept bumping into each other , kept rubbing elbows .
She would n't dare tell her father this , but she kind of had a crush .
University of Colorado Sports Information Aunese 's teammates adored him for his toughness .
Before long , his teammates were just as enamored .
He joined them for the 1987 season , and if the CU players were wondering what all the fuss was about , they had to wait only until Week 3 to find out .
McCartney finally played him that day against Washington State , and all Sal did was take one of his first option - keepers 60 yards downfield .
He had n't played a real game in two years and was absolutely out of breath , but DiNardo 's next play call was still another quarterback option .
" I remember saying , ' Gerry , you 're going to kill this kid , ' " Barnett says .
" But Sal went ahead and ran it , when he could 've handed off .
That 's just the way he was . "
By game 's end , he had rushed for 185 yards in a 26 - 17 victory , and the Sal Aunese Admiration Society was officially in session .
The team was on its way to a seven - win season , and Sal was at the epicenter of it all , the instant ringleader .
In November , for instance , the weather had turned wicked cold one day , about 20 degrees , when all the Buffaloes players showed up for practice wearing sweatshirts , windbreakers , gloves , thermal underwear and knit caps .
All except Sal .
" He was out there in just a short - sleeved practice shirt , his regular practice pants -- and just practicing , " Barnett says .
" And guys are , ' Gawd , is he tough . '
He did n't do it to be cool , and he did n't do it to show off .
He did n't go up to the rest of the guys and go , ' Hey , you guys are wusses . '
That 's just who Sal was .
He had it , whatever ' it ' is .
He had this charm about him .
He was n't slick , he was n't cool .
And as a result , guys looked up to him . "
He was n't an aesthetically pleasing player -- 5 - foot - 10 , squat , incapable of running by defenders ; instead , he 'd dodge them or run through them .
By season 's end , he was named the Big Eight 's Newcomer of the Year , and the stark truth is that he celebrated a little too heartily in the offseason .
During a loud night out on campus with some teammates , Sal and his buddies were told by another CU student -- through a dorm window -- to shut up .
Sal 's hasty reaction was to go shake down the kid in the dorm , push him around , and the end result , according to the police report , was a ransacked room courtesy of " a drunken football player . "
Sal felt he'd been sticking up for his friends , which was definitely his M.O.
He was the Samoan quarterback who brought the white and black players together , and McCartney and Barnett appreciated Sal 's basic intentions .
But they also knew he was n't a saint , and the head coach had warned him before about " fighting at the drop of a hat . ''
They read him the riot act , and when he pleaded guilty to third - degree assault , second - degree criminal trespass and misdemeanor menacing and received a two - week jail term , McCartney had no choice but to suspend him for spring football .
" You 'd get him mad and he'd trade punches with you , " the coach says .
" Aunese was very , very competitive -- maybe like a fullback would be , wants to hit you in the mouth .
But he was my quarterback , so we had to corral him .
We had to slow him down .
We had to get him to understand that if you 're going to be the quarterback of a major college team , your deportment on and off the field has to be above par . "
The two weeks behind bars steadied him , and one of his confidants , upon his release , was none other than Kristy McCartney .
They had remained friends and , by now , had an undeniable chemistry .
And as the 1988 season was beginning , they also had a secret affair .
Kristy was careful to keep this from her father , a deeply religious man who did not believe in premarital sex , and he was too focused on the coming season to monitor her day - to - day business .
What he did notice was that Sal seemed more mature after his arrest .
The quarterback had always been able to think the game , but now his knowledge of the offense was beyond reproach .
This particularly amazed McCartney 's newest quarterback recruit , Darian Hagan , a brazen kid from the Watts area of Los Angeles who thought he'd waltz in and take Sal 's job .
Hagan actually told people he'd end up the starter , that Sal was n't a threat -- until Coach Barnett posted some formations on the bulletin board and asked someone to explain them .
Sal swiftly rattled off everyone 's assignment , and Hagan remembers realizing , " I do n't have a chance . "
Mark Harrison / The Seattle Times Darian Hagan , No. 3 , recalls believing he would join the Buffs and take over as the starting quarterback .
Aunese proved him wrong .
On the field , no one had command of a team like Sal .
His cadences -- his down , set , huts ! -- were fluid and loud , compared with Hagan 's tentative barking .
Sal was also secure enough to take the kid under his wing , and Hagan then began to hope Sal never faltered or got injured in a game because he did n't want to have to follow that act .
When the ' 88 season began , Sal raised the bar even more .
The team 's second game was at nationally ranked Iowa , on a 90 - degree day laced with Midwest humidity .
The temperature on the field reached triple figures , but Sal -- hot or cold -- always ignored the elements .
His 17 - yard touchdown run put the Buffaloes ahead 14 - 0 , although , in typical fashion , CU gave the lead back in the fourth quarter .
Under McCartney , the Buffs had had trouble closing out formidable teams on the road .
Barnett felt their only signature win , against Nebraska in ' 86 , had been " lucky , " and now this Iowa game was looking like another meltdown .
With 5:36 left , the Buffs took over on their own 15 - yard line , trailing 21 - 17 .
Eighty - five yards seemed like a million .
They were n't built to throw the ball , were n't built to play from behind .
But , according to wide receiver Jeff Campbell , Sal 's first words in the huddle were " All right , let 's do this .
We 've done this a million times in practice .
Let 's do this . "
Campbell and Sal were roommates , and they were so comfortable with each other that on passing downs they would just nod to each other , and " Soupy " -- Sal 's old reliable -- would know just what to do .
On a critical third - and - 9 play , the quarterback found Campbell for a 23 - yard gain , the key play of the drive .
Now Iowa had to start thinking pass , so the legs of Sal and tailback Eric Bieniemy became factors again .
With 1:55 left , Sal plunged in for a 1 - yard touchdown , and CU held on for a 24 - 21 victory .
McCartney was overcome , calling the win the turning point of his program .
The Buffaloes had pushed a Big Ten bully around on the road , and much of the credit went to his dumpy , indefatigable quarterback .
It had all been worth it to Coach Mac -- the switch to the wishbone , the year spent recruiting Sal , the precious time away from his wife , Lyndi , his three sons and Kristy .
His previous claim to fame had been that he was the first high school coach hired by Michigan 's Bo Schembechler .
But now he had a blossoming football power of his own .
Sal followed up the Iowa game with a career - high 190 passing yards against Oregon State , 107 of which went to Soupy .
Then , the next week against Colorado State , Sal led another cardiac game - winning drive , converting a crucial fourth - and - 2 with a brutish run , then throwing the winning touchdown pass with 13 seconds left .
The drama of that game completely sapped McCartney , who came home just wanting to put his feet up .
His team was 4 - 0 now , nationally ranked , and he and Lyndi sat together on the living room couch , watching a scoreboard show , cherishing the moment .
Before long , Kristy walked in , and plopped herself between them .
She looked flushed .
She put her right arm around her dad and her left arm around her mom , then she just spilled it :
" Mom , Dad I 'm pregnant . "
' Coach , I 'm not going to marry her '
The coach began to pace , the same way he'd pace the sideline .
Kristy had been terrified to tell him , and those initial moments were horribly tense for her .
Lyndi -- always maternal -- had instantly grabbed and hugged her , and now Kristy was hoping her father would sit still and say something supportive .
He soon hugged Kristy , and , with no anger in his voice , the coach said , " We 're with you . "
But then he was off pacing again , the way any dad would , asking the question any dad would ask : " Who 's the father ? "
Kristy then dropped her bomb :
" Dad , the father of the baby is the quarterback of your team , Sal Aunese . "
The coach was blindsided , absolutely blindsided .
" I was flabbergasted , " he says .
" I did not see that coming . "
Three hours before , Aunese had just won the coach a game , and now he was giving Bill McCartney a grandchild , as well .
The coach could already envision the headlines in the morning paper the awkward team meetings the whispers nationally the murmurs in church .
But minutes later , he snapped out of it and saw only his trembling daughter .
" Well , it does n't matter who the father is , " he said .
" We 're with you .
God bless you . "
Bernstein Associates / Getty Images McCartney says he was " flabbergasted " to learn that his daughter was pregnant and that Aunese was the father .
Right away , Kristy was glad she 'd never gone through with the abortion .
When she 'd first heard she was pregnant , by none other than Sal , she panicked and booked an appointment to end the pregnancy .
" I thought , what else can I do but have an abortion ? " she says .
But she could n't go through with it and hoped her parents would embrace her .
She needed them because , truth was , she was a self - admittedly immature 20 - year - old who did n't even enjoy baby - sitting .
She says she was n't ready to be a parent , and , God knows , Sal was n't , either .
Campbell came home from class one day and found Sal sitting by himself in a trance , visibly distraught .
" What 's up , man ? " Campbell asked .
" I think Kristy 's pregnant , " Sal answered .
Campbell knew to keep it a secret because Sal was n't even ready to tell his own family .
In fact , it was Lyndi who broke the news to Sal 's oldest sibling , his sister , Ruta .
Ruta , in some ways , ran the Aunese household , and she quickly confronted Sal .
He told her that , out of respect for her and her strong religious beliefs , he did n't know how to approach her .
But he was relieved that she finally knew , and that she seemed supportive .
His parents were another matter .
They came from a strict Samoan culture , in which you marry the person you impregnate .
They were rattled .
A lot of their family dreams had been pinned on Sal , and they were afraid he'd have to drop out of school to take care of this child .
Or maybe get kicked off the team .
" I found out from my sister , and I was kind of like , ' What ? ' " says Sal 's brother , Joe .
" And then the first thought in my mind was , ' McCartney 's daughter ?
The head coach 's daughter ? '
My thinking was , ' Wow , I know Coach McCartney ai n't a happy camper . '
I 'm thinking , ' What 's going to happen to Sal ?
Is this going to affect his scholarship ? ' "
Because Sal was living with four teammates , the locker room quickly got wind of the news .
Hagan did n't believe it , but soon they all heard about a major meeting between Coach and Sal .
" Everyone was like , ' Uh - oh , Coach Mac is going to rip this dude -- he got his daughter pregnant , and it's about to get ugly , ' " Hagan says .
Sal did n't know what to expect .
But when he first laid eyes on the coach , he sensed this would n't be fire and brimstone .
" Sal , " the coach said calmly , " Kristy tells me that you got her pregnant . "
" Yes , " Sal said , nodding .
" Look , this is not going to affect your position on the team , but I 'd like you to establish right now whether you 're going to be with her through this or whether you 're not . "
" Coach , I 'm not going to marry her . "
McCartney will never forget the ache he felt right then .
He had hoped Sal and Kristy would be a couple , had hoped their baby would have a two - parent household .
He believed in marriage , family and sexual purity , and it took everything in his power not to break down right then and there .
But he says he just sent Sal on his way , says he did n't blame him .
He realized " it took two , " that it was n't Sal 's fault alone .
In fact , the coach blamed himself for not including Kristy in his world enough , for letting football consume him while she was off making life - altering decisions .
" I could have done a lot better job of being a father to my daughter , " he says , and that 's what ultimately had him breaking down .
He used to bring his sons to the locker room or sideline , but Kristy was always the one left on the outskirts , vying for his attention .
He says he regretted not " dating ' ' his daughter , not taking her special places , and felt that if he had spent more time in her world , " She would 've been more secure with who she was and would not have given herself outside marriage . "
Who knew the answer ?
But , either way , the coach decided not to hold this against Sal .
If the kid did n't love Kristy , or was n't ready for marriage , so be it .
The coach was n't going to beg .
Of course , nothing was the same .
Coincidence or not , the Buffs got pummeled at home the next week by Oklahoma State .
And Kristy and Sal were already on the outs .
They had gone their separate ways -- Kristy leaving school to live with her parents and Sal immersing himself in everything football .
In the weeks that followed , Colorado ended up winning eight games for the first time in 12 years , earning a bid to the Freedom Bowl in Anaheim -- an absolute breakthrough season .
Although Sal battled a rib injury from midseason on , he was All - Big Eight and a messiah on campus .
News of the pregnancy had n't leaked out publicly yet , and the assumption was that Sal and the Buffaloes were on the verge of greatness .
All their key players would be back in ' 89 ; they would be in the national title conversation .
They could n't wait to play the Freedom Bowl and move on to the next , promising season .
Sal was particularly eager for the bowl game because Angels Stadium was only an hour from his home in Oceanside .
Ruta , Joe and the rest of the family -- cousins , uncles , aunts , you name it -- were driving up in a caravan , hoping to see Sal light up BYU at the Big A .
But something was amiss from the opening kickoff .
Sal was n't exploding through holes or setting his feet on play - action passes .
He was so ineffective that CU coaches called 19 straight runs at the end of the first half rather than risk a disastrous pass .
Ruta began telling Joe , " I wish they 'd just take him out . "
She remembered he'd been battling a flu bug , and Joe figured his poor play might be caused by rust from a 40 - day layoff between games .
Either way , they all agreed it was the worst game they 'd ever seen Sal play .
By the fourth quarter , McCartney had benched him for Hagan .
But when the freshman threw an interception in the closing minutes , leading to BYU 's go - ahead field goal , McCartney reinserted Sal .
It was a last chance for Sal to re-create his Iowa and Colorado State magic , and , as usual , he told the huddle , " Let 's do this . "
He nodded at Campbell to get open , but , this time , his arm had no zip .
When his final pass sailed incomplete , the Buffs had lost 20 - 17 , and Sal 's stat line was a pitiable 4 - for - 13 for 41 yards and an interception .
Afterward , Joe met him at the hotel and said , " Dude , good game , but you looked a little sluggish out there , buddy . "
Sal answered , " Yeah , I know , " coughing intermittently throughout their conversation .
Joe did n't think anything of it .
That night , the temperatures dipped into the high 40s in Oceanside -- arctic for Southern California -- but Sal got up in the middle of the night to open the windows of his family 's home .
Ruta was soon freezing and asked him , " Why are you opening windows ? "
" I can't breathe , " Sal told her .
He would never play football again .
Courtesy of the McCartney family When Sal 's teammates learned he'd gotten coach Bill McCartney 's daughter pregnant , they worried Sal 's position on the team would be in jeopardy .
Kristy was worried how her parents would react .
They responded with love .
Life ends and begins
At first , it was n't an illness as much as a curiosity .
Sal returned to campus in January 1989 for winter conditioning , but he began pulling himself out of drills , out of weightlifting sessions , out of roadwork .
" Sal was a guy who could run and push himself to the end , " Hagan says .
" But he was walking over to the trash can and kept throwing up throwing up blood . "
University of Colorado Sports Information Teammates David Gibbs , left , and Jeff Campbell , right , would go together to visit Aunese in the hospital .
Another morning , he woke up at his apartment with the entire right side of his face -- from earlobe to lower neck -- filled with fluid .
Campbell and his other roommates knew this was n't normal , and when Sal could n't keep his food down and began refusing even water , they nagged him to see a doctor .
But Sal was stubborn -- telling the guys , " I 'm all right " -- and it was n't until mid-February that he agreed to be examined .
The initial diagnosis was sarcoidosis , similar to pneumonia , but when a lump was found on his neck in March , he was sent to the university hospital for a biopsy .
The results were grave .
Tests showed he had inoperable stomach cancer , and only six months to live .
One of the oncologist 's first phone calls was to the home of Bill McCartney .
The coach nearly doubled over when he heard the news , heartbroken for Sal and distraught that he'd have to tell Kristy that her baby , due in about a month , would grow up fatherless .
Kristy sobbed uncontrollably in the privacy of her room .
Her world was completely upside - down , and all her pent - up emotions came flooding out .
Not only was she estranged from Sal , but now Sal was dying .
She was inconsolable .
The rest of the team heard the news over spring break , and many of the players came rushing back to Boulder to see their friend .
They expected to see their quarterback shriveled up , and , although he had lost a good amount of weight , Sal was still sprightly enough to tell them , " I 'll be all right , I 'll beat it . "
Ruta and Joe had moved to Boulder full time -- Ruta to care for him and Joe to drive him to his doctor appointments -- and he began to look and feel better .
He underwent two promising rounds of chemotherapy , and , when he began showing up at spring football practices , Barnett had this strange sense that Sal might actually play again .
The team cherished having him around , and at the spring game the entire squad mobbed him , lifted him up on their shoulders .
He watched from a special rocking chair , and , at the conclusion of the contest , he said firmly into a microphone : " See you next year . "
Kristy , in the final weeks of her pregnancy , watched it all from a distance , and , when she went into labor , her parents contacted Sal .
At the time , he had been dating someone else -- he was 20 and flawed , and the McCartneys knew it and forgave him for it .
But , awkward situation or not , Sal was not going to miss this .
He raced to the hospital , and could n't have been more proud when Timothy Chase McCartney was born on April 24 , 1989 .
He had a son .
And as Sal held him -- a grin on the quarterback 's face -- he nicknamed the kid T.C.
It stuck .
University of Colorado Sports Information Aunese 's teammates lifted him up at the 1989 Colorado spring game .
A long , painful goodbye
The McCartneys frequently reminded Sal he was part of the family , and as the spring wore on he would visit their home to dote on T.C. Sometimes , he 'd bring teammates with him -- Soupy or Oakland Salavea -- or sometimes he 'd just go by himself .
Kristy would watch how he handled T.C. , the way he'd gently cradle the baby , and it convinced her he'd be a caring , responsible father , if only he could live .
At the same time , these visits were bittersweet for Sal because he knew his health was deteriorating .
By June , the cancer was beginning to ravage his body , and he was constantly in and out of the hospital -- mostly in .
Hagan went to see him before summer practices began , along with Barnett and another quarterback , Charles Johnson , and he flat - out wept at the sight of him .
" He looked like a totally different person , " Hagan says .
" He had lost 50 pounds and had tubes in his nose , and he was frail .
And , you know , Sal was n't frail .
Sal was like a titan , man .
He was put together .
And seeing him sitting there fragile , I cried .
But I also told him we were going to do some good things for him , that I was going to be the guy at quarterback now , that I was going to grow up and was n't going to disappoint him . "
Once practices began in August , Sal would try to muster up enough strength to go -- and , whenever he 'd arrive , which was infrequently , the whispers would begin .
There 'd just been no way to keep Kristy 's pregnancy private , so the worst - kept secret at training camp was that Sal was T.C. 's father .
By late August , an alternative weekly newspaper in Denver -- Westword -- published the story of Kristy and Sal , quoting unnamed sources .
Some members of the CU athletic department went to every newsstand in town to confiscate copies of the paper , but the damage had been done .
People were calling the pious McCartney a hypocrite and attacking Kristy , as well .
The newspapers in Boulder and Denver avoided the story because the coach , Kristy and Sal would n't comment , but Kristy was nevertheless feeling victimized and too frightened to venture out in public .

As Aunese grew gravely ill , McCartney ( shown here in 1993 ) helped Aunese invite Jesus into his heart .
Back at the hospital , Sal could barely climb out of bed , and as he worsened , Ruta found herself leaning on the McCartneys .
She asked Kristy and T.C. to be regular visitors and , one day , she called Coach McCartney to say he'd been the answer to one of her prayers .
Ruta had desperately wanted someone to lead Sal to Christ , and , one morning , she 'd had a vision that the coach was that person .
She asked him to visit the hospital , and the coach whose football program had been saved by Sal tried saving Sal in return .
" Sal , have you ever invited Jesus into your heart ? " McCartney asked .
" No , " Sal said .
" We can do that right now .
Do you want to do it ? "
" Yes . "
He began to read the Bible around the clock , and would look forward to after - practice visits from his teammates .
He could n't play the sport , so the team brought the sport to him .
Campbell would sneak the playbook or the game plan to his hospital room , and , on the Friday night before the Sept. 2 season opener , Barnett invited him to the team hotel , for the quarterback meeting .
" His skin had turned dark , " Barnett says , " He looked very thin .
You just knew that it was over .
So we just kept him as involved as we could possibly keep him . "
The game Sal most wanted to see was Week 3 against Jeff George and Illinois , on Sept. 16 .
He 'd have loved to be under center that day , showcasing himself against the country 's elite passer .
But , if nothing else , he needed to be in the stadium , even if he'd have to leave early .
He arrived in a wheelchair , on oxygen , and was given a seat in a private box .
The players took the field waving to him .
Then , early in the matchup , Hagan threw a deep post to Campbell -- Sal 's receiver -- that gained 76 yards .
Campbell did n't score on the play , but he spiked the ball and pointed up to Sal 's box .
Sal pointed back .
" I was there , " Ruta says , " and Sal said , ' I see you , Soupy , I see you . ' "
Sal did n't have the endurance to stay through the fourth quarter , and while he was watching the end of the broadcast on TV , the announcers named Sal player of the game .
He slowly walked to the bathroom and locked the door .
Then Ruta heard Sal weep .
That next 72 hours , he grew weaker , and Kristy was part of a group that would stay with him all day , every day .
One evening , the entire group got up to leave , but someone told her that Sal wanted to speak with her .
It was just the two of them , and he said he was sorry for how he handled the pregnancy , for running , for everything .
He said that he was proud of T.C. and that he hoped they could take him to the park someday .
Kristy knew she still loved him .
A few days later , with Sal 's breathing even more labored , Kristy dropped T.C. off at the hospital .
It was just Ruta , Sal and the baby , and Sal asked his sister to bring the baby close to him .
He was too weak to hold T.C. , but he touched fingers with his son -- " Like E.T. , " Ruta says -- then squeezed his hand .
" My brother just looked into his eyes , " Ruta says .
" When I think about it , it was like he was just letting his son know how much he loved him and that no matter what happens to him , he wo n't be around , but may he always know that he loves him . "
That Saturday , Sept. 23 -- a bye week for CU -- Sal began calling in his brothers and sisters and cousins individually .
He told them not to worry , that he was cured and asked them to look after his parents .
Campbell stopped by briefly and saw Kristy nearby , holding the baby .
Sal was reading the Bible , and when he was n't , they were all singing Sunday school songs .
The lights were dimmed ...
Sal 's mother rubbed his feet .
And then , at about 9 p.m. , he sat up , took a deep breath , seemed to say something and died .
T.C. was 10 feet away .
" He died because he did n't have a game , " Barnett says .
" Not because it was a good time to die .
He died because it was our bye week , because he did n't have a game to keep him going .
We were convinced of that .
We just knew .
We said , ' We got a bye week coming up ; he wo n't make it .
He wo n't make it . ' "
Ruta went home to sleep in their Boulder apartment that night , but she awoke to a rustling noise .
She asked her friend Rowena , who was staying with her , to check on Sal , but Rowena said , " Ruta , Sal 's not here .
Sal 's gone . "
Ruta answered , " No , Sal 's here . "
In tears now , she demanded a pen and paper .
She claimed she could feel Sal 's presence , could hear Sal 's voice , and she began to write a letter .
" I 'm trying to write , but I 'm crying the whole time , " Ruta says .
" I 'm trying to listen to him .
I 'm crying , writing .
Yet , I understood what was happening , knowing that this is from him .
This letter is from him .
After it happened , I heard the door shut slowly .
Rowena witnessed the whole thing take place .
It was like he was coming just to say goodbye and let me know it was going to be OK . "
That next week , she read Sal 's letter at the memorial service , and grown men , grown football players , broke down :
My dearest teammates , coaches , friends and brothers , whom apart from my family I do hold so close .
I come to you all with love and encouragement to continue to do what you , we all , have been doing since our season first started , only to excel and better ourselves mentally , physically and spiritually .
Unity is our strength and love is our guide from here on in .
Do n't be saddened that you no longer see me in the flesh , because I assure you I will always be with you in spirit .
Hold me dear to your hearts as you know I do all of you .
Strive only for victory each time we play , and trust in the Lord for He truly is the way !
I love you all , go get 'em , and bring home the Orange Bowl .
The coach stood up to speak , as well , and he peered over at Kristy , who was snuggling T.C. behind the casket , seemingly terrified .
He praised her for her bravery , for not running away , for having the quarterback 's baby .
It was his first public admission that T.C. was Sal 's son , and the coach ended the speech by saying , " You 're going to raise that little guy , and all of us are going to have an opportunity to watch him grow . "
University of Colorado Sports Information Sal Aunese died of stomach cancer on Sept. 23 , 1989 .
At his funeral , his sister , Ruta , read a letter that she says came to her while she felt the presence of Sal .
It read , in part , " Strive only for victory each time we play , and trust in the Lord for He truly is the way ! "
Days later , the Buffaloes had to somehow play a football game , at the University of Washington , and , in warm - ups , they were melancholy and flat .
But when they returned to the locker room before kickoff , Ruta 's letter was hanging in every locker .
They retook the field tingling , and when the Husky Stadium P.A. announcer asked for a moment of silence for Sal , all 60 of the Buffaloes kneeled down and pointed to the sky .
" That was n't something we had planned , " Campbell says .
" There were a lot of guys in tears because we wished we never had to go through that , wished he had run through that tunnel .
That knee was taken with a very heavy heart .
That was a heavyhearted knee .
I know that a lot of us said , ' We 're going to do this thing for you , Sal .
We are going to get to the national championship game , and we are going to win it . ' "
Three months later , the Buffs were in fact the nation 's only undefeated team , at 11 - 0 , playing Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl .
They wore Sal's No. 8 on their wristbands , on their towels and on their cleats .
They pointed to the heavens .
But they still wound up losing , 21 - 6 .
Hagan and the others were disconsolate .
But then , 12 months later , after the 1990 season , they defeated the Irish in the next Orange Bowl , earning a share of the national title .
Coach McCartney was finally a champion , and he brought home a specially made No. 8 Aunese Orange Bowl jersey .
Just for T.C .
The Seattle Times Colorado players pay tribute to Aunese .
Campbell is at the far left , No. 84 .
A chip off the old block
Before long , T.C. was a young boy , hearing the whispers , hearing how he had his father 's face .
His last name was McCartney , but he was pure Aunese , straight down to his love for football .
At 6 , he was already begging to play Pop Warner , but Kristy kept telling him to wait , to wait for his bones to grow .
She was living alone with T.C. , working every day as an administrator in a Bible chapel school , leaving him in day care .
She was a single mom , determined to raise him on her own , but she also talked daily , openly , warmly about his father .
Young T.C. did n't need to ask questions about Sal ; Kristy and Lyndi and the coach volunteered all the information he 'd ever need .
They said that Sal was in heaven and that he'd been a tough hombre , the most adored man on the team .
They celebrated Sal 's birthday every May 8 with a cake and observed Sept. 23 , the date of Sal 's death .
So it was inevitable that T.C. , by the time he was 7 , would want to see Sal in person -- on tape .
And that 's when T.C. started spending his Sundays in Grandpa 's magical football basement , his heaven on earth .
He 'd stare at the trophies , the photos , the game balls .
He 'd riffle through scrapbooks .
He 'd watch the 1988 season over and over .
The Iowa drive .
The Colorado State finish .
All of it .
He 'd watch how Sal would handle the ball running the option , then T.C. would run an imaginary option in the basement , diving for a touchdown on the couch .
Kristy knew then that she'd have to acquiesce and let him play football .
He was 8 when he joined his first team , and , naturally , he wanted to wear the No. 8 and play quarterback .
His goal was to win a game ball himself someday -- start his own kind of basement -- and he began to turn his bedroom into a shrine .
He hung up his dad 's Orange Bowl jersey , the one Grandpa brought back from Miami , and had photos of Sal plastered all over his wall .
He had a CU comforter on his bed and even wore a shirt that said , ' Lil Aunese . "
He 'd gotten it from his Aunt Ruta , and that was the other development : Kristy was flying T.C. to San Diego once a year to stay for a week .
It was something that startled some cynical people in Boulder , who thought Kristy would keep T.C. in a bubble , isolated from Sal 's family .
But it was the opposite .
She knew how much T.C. meant to the Auneses and could see how much Sal meant to T.C.
She loved Sal .
She 'd said it over and over .
And she loved the Auneses , too , the way they treated her at Sal 's deathbed , how warm and accepting they were .
She had no qualms about putting T.C. on a plane to see them , and whenever he arrived , they 'd turn it into an event .
They 'd let him settle in for a day , then they'd throw him a Samoan - style barbecue , inviting upward of 40 family members .
T.C. would always feel them staring , and , inevitably , the cousins and aunts and uncles would ask him to throw a football , so they could see the Sal in him .
" Some of the people in our family say , ' Do n't mess with the Golden Child because if you do , his daddy 's going to get you , ' " Ruta says , laughing .
" But every time we see him , the family can't get over how much he looks like his dad .
We just look at each other and we 're like , ' Shhh , shhh . '
People get quiet because they do n't know what to say .
Looking at him is like looking at Sal . "
Before T.C.'s annual trip would end , the family would take him to Sal 's grave .
T.C. would always pose for pictures by the tombstone , always a smile on his face , because Ruta , Joe & Co. would tell stories about Sal as they stood there .
And when he'd fly back to Boulder , T.C. would report back to his grandpa , to give him details and to toss the football .
The coach and Lyndi were central figures in T.C. 's life , particularly after McCartney retired after the 1994 season .
Kristy would drop off T.C. at her parents ' , and it allowed her to have a little social life of her own .
She had struck up a relationship with Shannon Clavelle , one of her father 's players at CU , and , in ' 94 , she gave birth to another son , Derek .
By that time , the coach had founded Promise Keepers , a conservative Christian men 's organization that believed in " spiritual , moral , ethical and sexual purity " and held mammoth rallies in football stadiums .
Again , Kristy and the coach were roasted publicly -- which deeply hurt Kristy -- but her father was supportive of her , particularly once it was clear Clavelle would not play a major role in the child 's life .
The coach and Lyndi doted on Derek and so did T.C. Now T.C. would have someone else to throw to .
Still , the older T.C. got , the more he leaned on his grandpa .
McCartney was truly the family patriarch , and , in his early teens , T.C. told the coach he was adamant about walking in Sal 's footsteps , about playing quarterback , and McCartney began seriously teaching him nuances of the game .
He told him quarterbacking is not just about throwing but about blocking , leading , thinking the game .
He told him , " If you 're going to be an athlete , be one like your daddy .
Go all out .
Be wholehearted . "
Tom McCartney , T.C. 's uncle and Bill McCartney 's oldest son , happened to be the coach at Fairview High School in Boulder , and Kristy decided T.C. should enroll there for his freshman year .
McCartney and Lyndi then bought Kristy the house next door to them in nearby Westminster , meaning T.C. and Derek were living 20 steps from their grandparents , 20 steps from Grandpa 's basement .
" I would n't be who I am today if it was n't for him , " T.C. says of his grandpa .
" He 's taught me a lot of things because he had to fill in the gap .
I did n't have a father figure , so he was always there . "
T.C. playing varsity football was an eerie sight .
Kristy and her father would settle into their seats early , and out would walk T.C. , wearing No. 8 on his jersey , No. 8 on his wristbands and No. 8 on his towel .
" I think it made him feel closer to his dad , " Kristy says .
" That number symbolizes his dad to him and how much he loves him .
I just think he 's always felt like he 's No. 8 . "
He started at quarterback as a junior , in 2005 , and it was clear he was n't Sal 's body double .
He was 6 - foot - 3 -- 4 inches taller -- endowed with a better arm , but clearly not as agile or shifty .
He had much to learn about leading , too , and after one bad Friday night loss , he decided he would n't show up for a Saturday morning team meeting .
Tom , T.C.'s coach , gave him permission to skip it , but his grandfather told T.C. , not so fast .
He told him that Sal was always the last one doing interviews after a loss and always the first one out of the locker room after a win .
He said , as an athlete , Sal was accountable , and T.C. needed to be , as well .
From then on , T.C. was more rugged , more Sal .
Occasionally , the coaches would flank T.C. out as a receiver , and in a game against Lakewood High , the ball was snapped over the backup quarterback 's head .
The QB scooped the ball up 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage , when T.C. -- with a peel - back block -- decked the biggest lineman on the defense , knocking him out .
" Sal would 've loved that block , " Tom McCartney says .
Local recruiters began to take notice .
His dream was to play at CU , where Barnett was the head coach and was planning to bring T.C. in .
But Barnett was let go after the '05 season , and T.C. spent much of his senior year of 2006 in limbo .
CU 's new coach , Dan Hawkins , had brought in his own son , Cody , to play quarterback , so T.C. needed to look somewhere else .
" That really bothered me , " Barnett says .
" If I would 've stayed , then T.C. would 've come to Colorado .
That broke my heart as much as anything .
He needed to go play where his dad played .
And it could n't happen . "
It did n't help that Fairview had a rough 4 - 6 season in T.C. 's senior year , or that he threw for only six touchdowns .
His goal , from those days in the basement , had always been to play quarterback for a big - time program like Sal had , a place where he could conceivably win a national title and learn how to be a head coach like his grandpa .
His chances seemed bleak now , and his only options appeared to be smaller colleges , or a non-BCS school such as Idaho .
But then he got a phone call from Les Miles .
Les Miles ' fateful phone call
No one outside the family knew T.C. 's story better than Miles .
He had lived the story .
He 'd recruited Sal , had practically worn out the Auneses ' doorstep .
He knew Ruta and Joe .
He 'd known McCartney since 1975 .
He brought Sal to him .
When Sal died , Miles had gotten down on a knee himself .
It had been personal to him , too .
Steve Franz for ESPN.com T.C. McCartney is now a backup quarterback for Les Miles at LSU .
He was married now and , after a stop as the coach at Oklahoma State , had turned LSU into a burgeoning national power .
He had cachet now , but he also had a heart and a sense of history .
The year before , in 2005 , Miles had invited Bill McCartney to speak to his team in Baton Rouge , before a game against Auburn , and T.C. had made the trip with his grandpa .
For the first time , Miles was laying eyes on the kid , and he was floored by the resemblance to Sal .
" Like seeing his ghost , " Miles told friends .
Miles had first met
Sal at exactly the same time in his life -- as a high school junior -- and the meeting with McCartney and T.C. had Miles wistful , nostalgic .
T.C. enjoyed the moment himself , and he was particularly enthralled by the atmosphere at rustic Tiger Stadium .
He felt this was the kind of place for him , a big - time team coached by the same man who recruited his daddy .
But it was only a fleeting thought -- LSU had its pick of hundreds of quarterbacks .
Except , a year later , here was Miles on the phone , bringing the story full circle , asking T.C. whether he would consider coming to play for him .
Miles told him he could n't promise a scholarship , but he'd be willing to make T.C. a preferred walk - on , meaning he would be guaranteed to be one of the 105 players at preseason camp .
It was a generous offer , and , although T.C. hated to leave Kristy -- whom he called his " hero " -- the entire family agreed he should accept .
" I thought it was a really cool move by Les to do that , " Barnett says .
" Just the fact that there 's a million guys in the South that he could put on his team and take as a preferred walk - on .
Those are tough spots , a lot of competition for those 20 spots that go into camp . "
T.C. showed a forceful arm in practice , enough to merit a spot on the team .
Miles decided to redshirt him , but T.C. still got to go along on LSU 's 2007 BCS national championship ride .
He was issued a ring like everyone else , and when he and his grandpa played in a golf tournament with Campbell , they all took turns admiring T.C. 's bling .
" I did n't play , but I 'd always wanted to win the championship my dad didn't , " T.C. says .
" I looked at everything as unfinished business . "
And the next order of unfinished business was playing .
Miles had never promised such a thing , and , as the 2008 camp began , T.C. was ostensibly the fourth quarterback on the roster , a fringe prospect who probably belonged at a smaller program .
He had no sense that he could walk up to an equipment manager or a coach and ask for the No. 8 . First of all , the number already belonged to tailback Trindon Holliday , and , secondly , he was just grateful to have a number at all -- 17 -- not to mention a locker , a bed and a chance to compete .
But a season can sometimes go diagonally , and heading into the final game of the 2008 regular season at Arkansas , backup QBs Jarrett Lee and Andrew Hatch were both hobbled with injuries .
By attrition , T.C. had moved up to No. 2 , and he was being groomed by Miles and offensive coordinator Gary Crowton to play against the Razorbacks , if needed .
They were confident he could get by on his smarts , so he was one twisted ankle , one broken fingernail , one bloody nose from taking a college football snap , from carrying on his father 's legacy .
All week , he thought about Sal , studied the playbook , consulted his grandpa , envisioned getting under center on a national stage .
He just had a gut feeling -- or maybe a wish -- that Sal , from the heavens , would make it happen .
" I actually believed that I was going to play , " T.C. says .
" I was thinking about everything I 'd been through to get here , and why I came to LSU -- Coach Miles and the whole full - circle thing .
He had recruited my dad , this is where I was supposed to be , and this was my chance to earn my stripes . "
But he sat and sat and sat as starting quarterback Jordan Jefferson played all 60 minutes of the 31-30 loss to Arkansas .
That was that -- because the other quarterbacks returned healthy for LSU 's ensuing bowl game .
He was back to fourth on the depth chart , and after the 2008 season , Crowton asked him whether he would consider switching to tight end .
The appeal was that he could get on the field -- he was 6 - 3 , 220 and had soft hands -- and T.C. accepted the challenge .
He went to spring practice to learn the position , but he had a brutal time trying to block linebackers and defensive ends .
He 'd never been taught the correct techniques , nor had he ever lifted weights to gain bulk .
He was getting shoved around , and the coaches were n't giving him as many reps as he had hoped .
He missed playing quarterback and , in an odd way , suddenly felt disconnected from Sal .
" Even though I know I could probably be pretty good at tight end , I always wanted to play quarterback , always played quarterback .
All the quarterback movements are natural to me . "
Crowton 's no dummy , and he asked T.C. whether he wanted to return to quarterback this fall .
Of course he did .
The whole tight end experience had helped T.C. remember why he was in Baton Rouge , why he was still playing football -- to finish what Sal started , to get behind center at least one time in a college football game .
" There 's something in me that wo n't let me quit , " T.C. says .
" It 's just in me to do this . "
As the 2009 season started , the odds of his playing were n't strong , other than in a mop - up role .
Jefferson was still entrenched as the starter , backed up by Lee .
Miles also had recruited two freshman quarterbacks , Russell Shepard and Chris Garrett , and , although Garrett was being redshirted , there was a sense that Shepard and T.C. were quarterbacks 3 and 3a .
Not that T.C. was complaining .
He still had this superb opportunity to learn from one of the nation 's top coaches in Miles , and the staff trusted his preparation so much that he was asked to begin signaling in the plays this season .
But , at the same time , he was hoping for one moment , any moment , that could bring Sal back into people 's consciousness .
He could sense the old CU players rooting for him , hoping he could reinvent Sal .
He was now the same age as Sal was in 1988 , and every time he'd bump into a Hagan or a Charles Johnson , he'd feel a " you can do it " in their handshakes , in their slaps on the back .
" They 're watching me , " T.C. says .
" They 're watching Sal 's son . "
And then , this training camp , in a conversation with his grandpa , he found his moment .
The old coach had been looking at LSU 's schedule , and he noticed that the Tigers opened the season at , of all places , Washington .
The same place where the Colorado Buffaloes , exactly 20 years ago , had played their first game without Sal .
The same place where they got down on one knee and pointed to the heavens .
The same field that T.C. would now get to see for himself .
Steve Franz for ESPN.com
Twenty years later , T.C. walks out of the tunnel at Washington , where his father 's teammates had paid tribute to Sal after his death in 1989 .
" How ironic , " Bill McCartney says .
" What are the odds of LSU playing at Washington 20 years later ?
I 'll need to watch that .
I 'll need to soak that in .
I could get emotional over that .
T.C.'s heart will be pointed [ to the sky ] .
He will have to carry the weight of that in some way . "
On the weekend of Sept. 5 , T.C. arrived in Seattle with the team , stoic and pensive .
None of his teammates knew the significance of the situation , only Les Miles .
The team took the Husky Stadium field the day before the game , and T.C. stood alone on the 50 - yard line looking up .
Miles called him over , and they chatted on the sideline together alone for five minutes .
No one on the LSU roster would 've guessed what they were talking about , but the answer was : Sal .
On game night , four more people connected to Sal walked into the stadium to watch the game : Kristy , Jeff Campbell , Gary Barnett and Sal 's brother Joe .
Barnett was there to broadcast the game for a national radio network , and when he saw Campbell , he said , " What are you doing here , Soupy ? "
" To see T.C. step on this field , 20 years later , " Campbell said .
Campbell happens to live in nearby Portland , Ore. , and Joe lives in nearby Vancouver , British Columbia .
Odd how it all worked out .
But it seemed appropriate that T.C. had brought all four of them together again , because all of them -- including T.C. -- had been in Sal 's room on the day he died .
" All I can say is that it 'll be very , very awesome for me to watch his son run out there when I did n't get a chance to see his dad run out there , " Campbell was saying from the Husky Stadium bleachers .
" I know of 108 guys that played on the 1989 team that are pulling for T.C. McCartney . "
When T.C. finally did run out , he did not make a scene .
He did not point to the sky , and he did not kneel down on one knee until the postgame prayer at midfield .
He had n't gotten a chance to play ; the game , a 31 - 23 victory , had been too tight , too tense .
But , from the beginning , he felt a pang , a skip of a heartbeat , a presence .
Was it Sal ?
Twenty years later , was it him ?
Who knows ?
But , right before kickoff , T.C. McCartney will never forget what he saw staring him in the face : a rainbow .
Tom Friend , ESPN.com T.C. McCartney , No. 17 , now carries on the family football legacy -- and the faith -- at LSU .
Here , he kneels after this year 's Washington game in nearly the exact spot where his father 's teammates kneeled 20 years ago .
Join the conversation about " Full Circle . "
A silent battle has been raging right under our noses , a fierce underground struggle pitting the U.S. against one of its closest allies .
For all its newsworthiness , the media has barely noticed the story – except when it surfaces , briefly , like a giant fin jutting above the waves .
The aggressor in this war is the state of Israel , with the U.S. , its sponsor and protector , playing defense .
This is the dark side of the " special relationship " – a battle of spy vs. spy .
Convicted spy Jonathan Pollard – now serving a life sentence – stole secrets so vital that an attempt by the Israelis to get him pardoned was blocked by a massive protest from the intelligence and defense communities .
Bill Clinton wanted to trade Pollard for Israeli concessions in the ongoing " peace process , " and he was only prevented from doing so by a threat of mass resignations by the top leadership of the intelligence community .
The reason for their intransigence : among the material Pollard had been asked by his Israeli handlers to steal was the U.S. attack plan against the Soviet Union .
According to Seymour Hersh , then - CIA director Bill Casey claimed Tel Aviv handed over the information to Moscow in exchange for relaxation of travel restrictions on Soviet Jews , who were then allowed to emigrate to Israel .
The Pollard case is emblematic – but it was just the beginning of a years - long effort by U.S. counterintelligence to rid themselves of the Israeli incubus .
Law enforcement was – and presumably still is – convinced Pollard was very far from alone , and that a highly placed " mole " had provided him with key information .
In his quest to procure very specific information , Pollard knew precisely which documents to look for – knowledge he could n’t access without help from someone very high in government circles .
In addition , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) intercepted a phone conversation between an Israeli intelligence officer and his boss in Tel Aviv , during which they discussed how to get hold of a letter by then - secretary of state Warren Christopher to Yasser Arafat .
The Washington spy suggested they use " Mega , " but his boss demurred : " This is not something we use Mega for , " he averred .
The search for Mega and his underlings continues to this day , as U.S. counterintelligence attempts to rip up what appears to be a vast Israeli spy operation by its very deep roots .
That ’s why they went after Ben Ami Kadish , who handed over U.S. secrets to Tel Aviv and shared a handler with Pollard , and why they indicted Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , two top officials of AIPAC , the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group .
That ’s why they were listening on the other end as Jane Harman promised an Israeli agent to intervene in the Rosen - Weissman case .
And now a new front has been opened up in this subterranean war with the arrest of Stewart David Nozette , a top U.S. scientist who worked for the Pentagon , had access to the most closely guarded nuclear secrets , and was the lead scientist in the search for water on the moon .
Nozette ’s case is interesting because of his impressive resume : he held top positions with the Department of Energy , the Department of Defense , and NASA , and he served on the White House National Space Council under George H.W. Bush .
From 1989 until March 2006 , he held " Q " clearance , which means he had access to " critical nuclear weapon design information " and vital information concerning 20 " special access programs " – secrets only a very few top government officials had knowledge of .
In other words , this was n’t just some mid-level schmuck who wanted to sell out his country for cash : he was one of the big boys – the principal author of the Clementine biostatic radar experiment , which allowed U.S. scientists to discover water on the moon – a kind of J. Robert Oppenheimer figure , whose singular contributions to the U.S. space program and its military applications granted him security clearances available to a very select few .
The affidavit in support of the criminal complaint [ . pdf ] alleging espionage is terse , vague in parts , and brimming with implication .
Taking their cues from the Department of Justice press release , most news reports state , " The complaint does not allege that the government of Israel or anyone acting on its behalf committed any offense under U.S. laws , " leaving out the last three words in the DOJ ’s sentence : " in this case . "
In this particular case , it ’s true , prosecutors are going after Nozette for violations that occurred while they were reeling him in , with a federal agent pretending to be a Mossad officer offering him money ( not very much , by the way ) in exchange for secrets .
The real question , however , is what caused them to zero in on Nozette ?
A Washington Times piece cites Kenneth Piernick , a former senior FBI agent , who opined :
“ He must have made some kind of attempt , which triggered the FBI ’s interest in him .
They cut in between him and whoever he was trying to work with and posed as an intelligence officer , agent , or courier to handle the issue , and then when he delivered what he intended to deliver to that person , his contact was likely an undercover FBI agent or [ someone from ] another U.S. intelligence service . ”
Yet Nozette may have made more than a mere " attempt . "
The affidavit alleges that , from 1998 to 2008 , he served as a consultant to " an aerospace company wholly owned by the government of Israel , " during which time " approximately once a month representatives of the aerospace company proposed questions , or taskings , to Nozette . "
He answered these questions , and , in return , received regular payments totaling $ 250,000 .
This indicates the Feds had been on to Nozette for quite some time , and with good cause .
The affidavit also notes that , at the beginning of this year , he traveled to " a different foreign country " in possession of two computer " thumb " drives , which seemed to have mysteriously disappeared upon his return some three weeks later .
What was on the drives – and who were the recipients ?
In 2007 , federal authorities raided the offices of Nozette ’s nonprofit company , the Alliance for Competitive Technology ( ACT ) , purportedly because ACT , having procured several lucrative government contracts , had defrauded the federal government by overcharging .
The affidavit cites an anonymous colleague of Nozette who recalled the scientist said that if the U.S. government ever tried to put him in jail he would go to Israel or another foreign country and “ tell them everything ” he knows .
Perhaps the real reason for the raid , however , had to do with the FBI ’s growing suspicion – if not certainty – he was funneling U.S. secrets to Tel Aviv.
ACT is a curious creation , a " nonprofit " group that nevertheless generated over half a million dollars last year according to documents filed with the IRS , with over $ 150,000 in salary and benefits paid out to Nozette .
But it was n’t just about money .
ACT ’s mission statement reads like a spy ’s dream come true :
" The Alliance for Competitive Technology … has been created to serve the national and public interest by conducting scientific research and educational activities aimed at expanding the utilization of National and Government Laboratory resources .
The National Laboratories possess significant technology , technologists , and resources , of great potential value to growing U.S. industrial organizations , both small and large .
Recent changes in national policy ( the Stevenson - Wydler Act of 1986 and the NASA Technology Utilization Program ) have sanctioned the pursuit of technology transfer from these organizations .
However , the capabilities and resources present in National Laboratories are often difficult to access by small and medium sized organizations with limited resources .
ACT will research the best mechanisms to facilitate this transfer through focused research on technology transfer mechanisms , and educational and instructive programs on technology transfer from National Laboratories .
In addition , ACT will enable U.S. organizations to utilize the resources of National Laboratories through existing established mechanisms ( e.g. , the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Technology Affiliates Program ) .
Transfer of commercially valuable technology is significantly enhanced by such direct support of private sector efforts . "
In short : ACT is all about technology transfer – from the U.S. to Israel .
This , as is well - known , is one of the favored activities of the Israeli intelligence services , which regularly pilfer the latest American technology ( especially military applications ) to such an extent that a General Accounting Office investigation once characterized the effort as " the most aggressive espionage operations against the U.S. of any U.S. ally . "
ACT had contracts with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington , Va. , and NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . It is hardly a leap of faith to conclude that vital data flowing from these projects was fed directly into the waiting maw of the Mossad .
Nozette was a key figure in developing and promoting the " Star Wars " ballistic missile defense system .
His colleague in the " High Frontier " movement – and the official director of ACT – is one Klaus Heiss , like Nozette an enthusiast [ .pdf ] of space colonization ( who also has some strong views on other subjects ) .
Contacted by an FBI agent masquerading as an Israeli intelligence agent , Nozette did n’t blink when told his lunch companion was from the Mossad : " Good , " he said .
" Happy to be of assistance . "
This was well before the issue of money was raised .
Later in the conversation , Nozette boasted of his top - level security clearances and the range and depth of his knowledge of U.S. secrets , adding , " I do n’t get recruited by the Mossad every day .
By the way , I knew this day would come . "
Questioned further by the undercover agent , Nozette said , " I thought I was working for you already .
I mean , that ’s what I always thought [ the foreign company ] was – just a front . "
Which it no doubt was .
Nozette agreed to be a regular " asset , " yet he clearly felt his position was increasingly precarious .
He inquired about the right of return and raised the possibility that he might go to Israel .
He wanted a passport as part of his payment , in addition to the few thousand dollars the FBI was putting in a post office " dead drop " for him on receipt of stolen secrets .
Well , then , so what ?
Do n’t all nations , even allies , spy on each other ?
What ’s the significance of this particular case ?
On the surface , our relationship with Israel is encompassed by the terms of the " special relationship , " which has so far consisted of the U.S. giving unconditional support to Tel Aviv ’s every action , no matter how brutal [ . pdf ] or contrary to our interests – and tolerating , to a large degree , its extensive covert operations on U.S. soil ( or , at least , keeping quiet about them ) .
On a deeper level , however , the tensions in this one - way love affair have frayed the specialness of the relationship almost to the breaking point .
This is not just due to the election of Barack Obama , who is widely perceived in Israel as being biased against the Jewish state .
These tensions arose during Bush ’s second term , when U.S. policy began to perceptibly tilt away from Tel Aviv .
A particularly telling blow to U.S. - Israeli relations was the decision by the U.S. to clamp down on visa requirements for Israelis entering the U.S. : potential visitors from Israel are now required to undergo an interview , restrictions on their length of stay have been extended , and admission to the U.S. is no longer assured .
In the secret world of spooks spying on one another , the U.S. - Israeli relationship is increasingly adversarial , while in the diplomatic - political realm , it has nearly reached the point of open hostilities .
This is thanks to the objective conditions that determine relations among nations : in the post - Cold War world , Israel necessarily became much less of an asset to the U.S .
In the post - 9/11 world , as John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have so trenchantly pointed out , it is an outright liability .
Our self - sacrificial policy of unconditional support for Israel has earned us implacable enemies in the Arab world and granted our adversaries a priceless propaganda prize – and the growing awareness of this disability is something the Israelis no doubt find disturbing .
The distortion of our foreign policy by the power of the Israel lobby is also being widely noted , and this is their real Achilles heel .
In this case , too , the Lobby will no doubt rush to exert their influence to downgrade Nozette ’s crime and even depict him as an innocent victim of entrapment .
Defenders of the AIPAC duo conjured a vast " anti-Semitic " conspiracy within the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI to explain the alleged persecution of Rosen and Weissman , and the same tactics are bound to be trotted out in this instance .
That is nonsense .
The FBI did n’t just pick Nozette arbitrarily and conjure his crimes out of thin air .
Their target was already deeply involved with the Israelis , and this is what brought him to their attention in the first place .
The nature and extent of Israeli spying in the U.S. is not a subject you ’ll see the " mainstream " media very often touch with so much as a 10 - foot pole , but when it does the results can be ominously disturbing .
I , for one , have n’t forgotten Carl Cameron ’s four - part series on Israeli spying in the U.S. , broadcast by Fox News in December 2001 .
According to Cameron , his sources in law enforcement told him the Israelis had been following the 9/11 hijackers and had foreknowledge of their plans but somehow neglected to tell us .
And then there were those dancing Israelis , leaping for joy at the sight of the Twin Towers burning …
This is the dark side of the " special relationship , " so dark that hardly anyone wants to acknowledge it , let alone consider its implications .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
If you do nothing else today , go and check out my interview with Matt Cockerill of Young Americans for Liberty ( YAL ) .
It was truly an enjoyable half hour or so for me : we touched on everything from the history of the libertarian movement to the evolution of the peace movement to bright future promised by activist groups like YAL – which is , by the way , the fastest growing and most active segment of organized libertarianism .
On August 2nd of 1993 , Kurt Cobain wrote the following letter to a hero of his : Beat legend William Burroughs .
Cobain had been a fan of Burroughs for many years and in 1992 even collaborated with the author on The “ Priest ” They Called Him ; however , to Cobain ’s dismay , they still had n’t met .
And so , during preparation for the video to Nirvana ’s Heart - Shaped Box , he wrote to Burroughs and asked him to appear , even if it meant disguising his face to avoid unwanted attention .
His invitation was politely declined .
The pair did eventually meet , in October of that year .
Cobain passed away six months later .

August 2 , 1993 Mr. William Burroughs
WILLIAM BURROUGHS COMUNICATIONS
Dear William :
It ’s a bit odd writing someone whom I ’ve never met but with whom I ’ve already recorded a record .
I really enjoyed the opportunity to do the record — it ’s a great honor to be pictured alongside you on the back cover .
I am writing you now regarding the possibility of your appearing alongside my band ( Nirvana ) in the first video from our new album , “ In Utero . ”
While I know that Michael Meisel from Gold Mountain Entertainment ( my management company ) has been speaking to James Grauerholz , I wanted the opportunity to personally let you know why I wanted you to appear in the video .
Most importantly , I wanted you to know that this request is not based on a desire to exploit you in any way .
I realize that stories in the press regarding my drug use may make you think that this request comes from a desire to parallel our lives .
Let me assure you that this is not the case .
As a fan and student of your work , I would cherish the opportunity to work directly with you .
To the extent that you may want to avoid any direct use of your image ( thus avoiding the aforementioned link for the press to devour ) .
I would be happy to have my director look into make - up techniques that could conceal your identity .
While I would be proud to have William Burroughs appear as himself in my video , I am more concerned with getting the opportunity to work with you than I am with letting the public know ( should that be your wish ) .
Having said that , let me reiterate how much I would like to make this happen .
While I am comfortable letting Michael and James discuss this further , I am available to discuss this with you at your convenience .
Thank you very much for your consideration .
Best regards , ( Signed , ‘ Kurt ’ ) Kurt Cobain
A virtually unlimited supply of rare cells can now be produced in the laboratory to fight diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis in mice .
Crucially , these cells , which dampen down the body ’s immune response , have been engineered so that they target damaged tissue yet do n’t leave the rest of the body open to infection .
Vaccines have long harnessed the body ’s natural ability to fight disease .
Therapies that boost our natural immune response to cancer are also in the works ( see Autoimmune disease cells harnessed to fight cancer ) .
But in autoimmune disease – in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body ’s own tissue – the opposite is needed .
So immunologists have long eyed up the cells that dampen down the immune response , known as regulatory T - cells or T - regs , for their potential to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes and multiple sclerosis .
Advertisement
There have been two challenges : how to obtain large supplies of the rare T - regs , which make up less than 1 per cent of all immune cells , and how to neutralise dangerous immune cells without weakening the entire immune system , leaving people open to infection .
Now Hans Stauss and his colleagues at University College London have made a stab at solving both .
Straight to the joint
The team starts by extracting ordinary T - cells – immune cells that are common in the blood – from mice and using a virus to insert two genes into these cells .
One gene , FOXP3 , transforms the ordinary T - cells into T-regs .
The second gene codes for a receptor for a substance called ovalbumin .
Next the researchers injected ovalbumin into mice with rheumatoid arthritis , which is caused by normal T - cells attacking cartilage .
Each mouse had two arthritic joints , but the researchers injected the ovalbumin into one only .
Then they injected the lab - produced T - reg cells into the same mice .
The idea was that the ovalbumin would attract the cells , which would dampen down the arthritic inflammation that was attacking the joint ’s cartilage .
The rest of the immune system , however , would remain intact .
Sure enough , the injected cells homed in on the ovalbumin - injected arthritic joints and reduced inflammation , while the other joints remained inflamed .
More targets
Stauss says that a similar T - reg therapy could be developed to target autoimmune diseases that strike other parts of the body , by adding genes for receptors specific to molecules found there .
Alexandre Corthay of the University of Oslo in Norway warns of the unpredictable nature of T - regs , which regularly turn back into normal T - cells in the body .
Stauss admits that this is a risk but reckons that artificially produced T - reg cells are more stable than naturally occurring ones .
He also points out that because the T - regs are specific to a particular part of the body , even if they did revert , the damage they could do would be limited .

Afghanistan ’s police are poorly trained , plagued by drug addiction and infiltrated by the Taliban “ at every level ” , a former British soldier from Portadown has said .
The Afghan National Police ( ANP ) is actually a militia made up of local men whose allegiances are to their tribes rather than the national or local governments , according to Captain Doug Beattie .
Mr Beattie , who worked with the ANP during tours of Afghanistan in 2006 - 07 and 2008 , said Afghan police officers were often paid off by insurgents .
But he suggested that Tuesday 's horrific shooting , in which five British soldiers were killed by a rogue Afghan policeman , could have been sparked by a cultural misunderstanding .
“ The Grenadier Guards have only just arrived there .
They are getting to know the Afghan police , ” he said .
“ It could be somebody has said or done something and there 's a general grievance .
“ It could be that they have offended him without realising it , with them being new in country . ”
Mr Beattie has had his own run-ins with the Afghan police — he believes an ambush of his unit in Garmsir in Helmand Province in 2006 was set up between the Taliban and the ANP .
He also alleged that a former chief of police in Helmand was caught talking directly to the Taliban on his personal phone on several occasions .
“ It is absolutely right to say that the Afghan police are infiltrated by the Taliban at every level , from the very lowest to the very highest , ” he said .
“ Fears about the police are really well founded and they have been known about since 2006 .
“ There are a number of real problems .
They 're not really trained properly .
“ They 're really a militia , a tribal police whose allegiances are not necessarily to the government or even to the provincial governor .
It is normally to their village or tribe or the area they come from .
“ Because they 're militia they can be bought and paid off at will .
If they do n't get enough money they 're quite happy to be paid by the insurgency . ”

HAYSVILLE , Ind . �
Talk about one tough owl .
Police in southern Indiana said a great horned owl flew through the pre-dawn darkness into the front of a moving Ford F - 250 pickup truck � and survived even as the collision mangled the truck 's radiator .
The bird was left trapped inside the grill of the truck driven by James Ellis of Shoals .
A Dubois County sheriff 's deputy called a state Department of Natural Resources officer to the scene Thursday on U.S. 231 near Haysville to remove the owl
Conservation Officer Tony Mann said the bird was conscious and appeared to have a broken or dislocated wing and assorted scrapes .
He was able to free the owl and sent it to a wildlife rehabilitator in Vincennes for treatment .
A wrecker was called for the truck .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Recovery ?
New bull market ?
Yes , yes , get your money out of the mattress , out of CDs and money markets .
Buy stocks -- emerging markets .
Buy ETF hedge funds .
Buy junk bonds , bailed - out banks .
Buy .
Get back in the market .
Buy , buy , buy .
Warning :
The investor 's brain is infected with a deadly disease .
And like P.T. Barnum , Wall Street knows your brain 's a sucker just waiting for any excuse to get back to playing their game at their casino by their rules .
Yes , you have a disease .
Not swine - flu pandemic , but even more toxic -- to your financial health .
Your brain 's infected with the 800 - year - old " this time is different syndrome . "
But unlike the swine flu , there 's no cure , no shot to protect you from a pandemic .
You 're exposed .
And yes , Wall Street is taking advantage of you , adding new fees and higher commissions , siphoning off returns .
They 'll keep it up until the next crash , soon .
Then they 'll raid the Treasury again -- more bailouts , with your cash .
And Congress will give the crooks trillions again , thanks to their lobbyists .
There 's no cure .
You have it .
Congress has it .
And with a recovery and a new bull primed to roar , Wall Street 's dying to take advantage of your disease .

Read " This Time Is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly " by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff .
" The best empirical investigation of financial crises ever published , " says Harvard 's Niall Ferguson , author of " The Ascent of Money . "
But it 's more than just a history of 800 years of never - ending , self - destructive bull / bear , boom / bust cycles .
" This Time Is Different " is the single best book on behavioral economics out there today .
Why ?
Because it exposes a toxic dark side of behavioral economics , behavioral finance , neuroeconomics , investment psychology and the " new behavioral science of irrationality . "
" This Time Is Different " exposes a secret other behavioral economics best - sellers are in total denial about : Thaler and Sunstein 's " Nudge , " Ariely 's " Predictably Irrational , " Shiller and Akeroff 's " Animal Spirits " and Zweig 's " Your Money & Your Brain . "
Here 's why .
The false and misleading promise of behavioral economists
First off :
You have to understand why other behavioral economics books are misleading you back into an old Wall Street trap .
They all have an implied promise that 's not only misleading but also toxic in the investor 's brain .
Their promise : " If you follow our advice , your irrational brain will become ' less irrational , ' more rational , even make you rich . "
This promise is dangerous and will cost you dearly .
This promise harks back to Wall Street 's two - centuries - old theory of the " rational investor . "
Psychologist Daniel Kahneman's , the 2002 Nobel Prize winner in economics , killed that theory .
He proved the investor 's decision - making is irrational .
Unfortunately , the new behavioral economists are unwittingly reversing everything gained by Kahneman .
Look closely :
You 'll see how behavioral economists are reviving Wall Street 's toxic message in every one of their books , with implied promises to make American investors more rational again .
And as you 'll see later , that 's just another symptom of your brain 's " this time is different " disease :
" Your Money & Your Brain " boldly promises that " new science of neuroeconomics can help make you rich . "
Yes , rich .
That sounds great in bull markets .
Like when the book was published in 2007 and the Dow was pushing 14,000 .
But today , since Wall Street 's lost $ 10 trillion of our money , we just want to hang on , as we watch the too - greedy - to - fail fools running Wall Street banks race back into the same old high - risk gambling games , like high - frequency trading , that are destined to lose another $ 10 trillion , wipe out Main Street again , and trigger the " Great Depression 2 . "
Yes , rich .

" " Nudge 's " subtitle promises that if you trust their strategies you 'll be " Improving Decisions About Health , Wealth , and Happiness . "
Warning :
That 'll last just as long as Sunstein's on the White House payroll .
Then forget it .
Even his co-author
Thaler sees danger in mixing behavioral scientists with politicians : " Our goal is to give benevolent nudgers an instruction manual .
The evil nudgers have already mastered most of these tools " of behavioral economics .
Get it ?
The bad guys ( GOP ? ) not only use the same behavioral " weapons " as the good guys , they 've mastered them .
For example , the " evil nudgers " are already killing health - care reforms .
And someday they 'll win , control Washington again .
Then who 's " benevolent ? "
Who 's an " evil " nudger ?

Then who 's " benevolent ? "
Who 's an " evil " nudger ?
" Predictably Irrational " is a bit more realistic .
" Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day , but we make the same types of mistakes , " overpaying , underestimating and procrastinating .
Because " we fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions " that sabotage our decisions .
But unfortunately , like all other behavioral economic books , there 's some obligatory hype ;
A claim that the book will help you " break through systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions ... change the way you interact with the world . "
A " predictably irrational " false promise .
" Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day , but we make the same types of mistakes , " overpaying , underestimating and procrastinating .

But unfortunately , like all other behavioral economic books , there 's some obligatory hype ;
A claim that the book will help you " break through systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions ... change the way you interact with the world . "
A " predictably irrational " false promise .
" Animal Spirits " is more partisan politics than objective science , claims that behavioral economics can correct the past three decades of Reaganomics .
But then it makes a dangerous leap of faith using the same faulty logic : Leaping from " powerful psychological forces are imperiling the wealth of nations today " to " the necessity of an active government role " ( Dems ? ) to manage America 's out - of - control " animal spirits . "
The Keynes / Friedman debate aside , " Animal Spirits ' " formula of adding behavioral economics to Keynesian economics and concluding that the two will improve democracy sounds too much like political hype .
Worse , these behavioral economists are making wild assumptions that government leaders will become more rational and moral when they discover the wisdom in the behavioral economists ' books .
Unfortunately , that 's not only incredibly naïve , it 's " predictably irrational . "
Now here 's the second and more important reason " This Time Is Different " is the single best behavioral economics book on the market today .
Very simple :
It has no illusions that our " this time is different " disease can be cured .
It makes no misleading pie - in - the - sky promises .
And there 's not even a hint that the global disease will be cured .
Other behavioral economists ' books are misleading , promising a cure -- which only proves their brains are also infected with the disease .
There is no cure .
800 years of history : ' This Time It 's Never Different '
Economic growth - recession cycles and bull - bear market cycles will never end .
They 're as natural and as inevitable as spring following winter .
Nobody can stop America 's endless economic , market , financial and business cycles with all their manic insanity .
Moreover , Wall Street does not want behavioral economics to help Main Street investors .
Why ?
Because if those promises really worked , if investors wised up to the con game , Wall Street could n't get rich siphoning off a third of Main Street 's investment returns .
The disease is that deadly .
And it will continue infecting investor 's brains everywhere for the next 800 years .
Here 's how Reinhart and Rogoff explain the global impact of this deadly disease :
" This Time Is Different " is a " quantative history of financial crises in their various guises .
Our message is simple :
We have been here before .
No matter how different the latest financial frenzy or crisis always appears , there are usually remarkable similarities from past experience from other countries and from history . "
And " no country , irrespective of its global importance , appears to be immune to it .
The fading memories of borrowers and lenders , policy makers and academics , and the public at large do not seem to improve over time , so the policy lessons on how to ' avoid ' the next blow - up are at best limited . "
" The essence of the ' this time is different ' syndrome is simple .
It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times ; crises do not happen to us , here and now .
We are doing things better , we are smarter , we have learned from past mistakes .
The old rules of valuation no longer apply . "
" The current boom , unlike the many booms that preceded catastrophic collapses in the past ( even in our country ) , is built of sound fundamentals , structural reforms , technological innovation and good policy .
Or so the story goes . "
Similar self - delusional " stories " guarantee the cycle will perpetuate ad infinitum .
" The lesson of history , then , is that even as institutions and policy makers improve there will always be a temptation to stretch the limits .
Just as an individual can go bankrupt no matter how rich she starts out , a financial system can collapse under the pressure of greed , politics and profits no matter how well - regulated it seems to be .
...
Technology has changed ... but the ability of governments and investors to delude themselves , giving rise to periodic bouts of euphoria that usually ends in tears , seems to have remained a constant . "
" If there is one common theme to the vast range of crises ... it is that , excessive debt accumulation , whether it be by the government , banks , corporations , or consumers , often poses greater systemic risks than it seems during a boom .
...
Highly indebted governments , banks , or corporations can seem to be merrily rolling along for an extended period , when bang -- confidence collapses , lenders disappear and a crisis hits .
...
Highly leveraged economies ... seldom survive forever ... history does point to warnings signs that policy makers can look to access risk -- if only that do not become too drunk with their credit bubble - fueled success and say , as their predecessors have for centuries , ' this time is different ' . "
Unfortunately , even the best - and - brightest get " too drunk . "
Remember Greenspan , Paulson , Bernanke , now Summer and Geithner .
Bottom line : " This Time Is Different " should be in every investor 's library , it 's the best reminder of behavioral economics truths and the best chronicle of eight centuries of financial history .
Other behavioral finance books will mislead you with their self - help pop-psychology promises of a cure .
But bull - bear cycles are natural and inevitable , and you are vulnerable .
Unfortunately , the book also warns that over the long - haul " This Time Is Different ' disease is also sabotaging capitalism , damaging America 's role in the world , and killing your retirement .
High jumper Gretel Bergmann had jump expunged from record books and was barred from Berlin games
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Germany today honoured a high jumper expelled from the national team by the Nazis a month before the 1936 Berlin Olympics because she was Jewish .
Gretel Bergmann matched a German high jump record of 5ft 3in ( 1.60 metres ) in Stuttgart on 30 June 1936 .
Two weeks later , her feat was expunged from the record books and she was kicked out of the team .
Now the German authorities are making amends to the 95 - year - old , who emigrated to the US in 1937 and changed her name to Margaret Lambert .
The country 's track and field association has restored her achievement to the record books , calling the decision an " act of justice and a symbolic gesture " but admitting it could " in no way make up " for the past .
The association also requested that she be included in Germany sport 's hall of fame .
" That 's very nice and I appreciate it .
I could n't repeat the jump today , believe me , " Lambert , who lives in the New York City borough of Queens , told the Associated Press .
Lambert was part of the German Olympic team from 1934 to 1936 , but had gone to England to continue her education at the age of 19 .
She won the 1934 British high jump championships and had hoped to compete for Britain .
But the Nazis forced her to jump for Germany , threatening her family even though she knew she would not be allowed to compete in the 1936 Olympics .
It was , she said , a political ploy aimed at the Americans .
She found German Jews facing a desperate situation on her return to Germany .
" Jews were not allowed in restaurants , in movies , in whatever , " she told the US Holocaust Memorial museum .
Even though I was a member of the German Olympic women 's team , I was not allowed in a stadium .
I could n't practice . "
Lambert said the treatment of the Jews angered her and made her compete harder .
" The madder I got , the better I did , " she said .
When she moved to the US , Lambert , who has been married for 71 years , made a living as a cleaning woman and then worked as a physical therapist .
Today 's gesture by the German authorities follows a similar move in 1995 , when the Gretel Bergmann sports arena , in the Wilmersdorf area of Berlin , was dedicated .
Lambert did not attend that ceremony , having said she never intended to set foot in Germany again .
She was an honoured guest of the German Olympic committee at the opening ceremonies of the 1996 Atlanta games .
Introduction
Hardware interrupts has always been expensive .
Somehow these small pieces of software consume so much CPU power and hardware and software engineers has always been trying to change this state of affairs .
Some significant progress has been made .
Still hardware interrupts consume lots of CPU power .
You will rarely see effects of interrupt handling on desktop systems .
Take a look at your / proc / interrupts file .
This file enlists all of your hardware devices and how many interrupts received by each and one of them on each CPU .
If you are on a regular desktop system , you will see that number of interrupts that your computer handles is relatively small .
Even powerful servers handling millions of packets per second handle only tens of thousands of interrupts per second .
Yet these interrupts consume CPU power and handling them properly undoubtedly helps to improve system ’s performance .
But really , what can we do about interrupts ?
There are many things that can be done .
Many Linux distributions ship with kernel that include modifications that significantly improve the situation .
Technologies , such as NAPI , reduce number of interrupts and interrupt handling overhead so dramatically , that modern server probably wont be able to sustain a 1 G bps Ethernet link .
NAPI is part of kernel for quiet some time .
Other things include interrupt coalescence .
In this article I would like to address one of the most powerful techniques to optimize interrupt handling .
SMP affinity
The SMP affinity or processor affinity term has quiet broad meaning and requires an explanation .
The word affinity addresses proximity of a certain task to certain processor within multi-processor system .
I.e. when processor X runs process Y , they are affine to each other .
The processor has parts of process ’s memory in cache , thus constantly moving the process to different processor when scheduling it , would probably mean less effective scheduling .
As far as interrupts concerned , SMP affinity refers to a question what processor handles certain interrupt .
On the contrary to the processes , binding interrupts to certain CPU will most likely cause performance degradation and here ’s why .
Interrupt handlers are usually very small in size .
Interrupt ’s memory footprint is relatively small , thus keeping interrupt on certain CPU will not improve cache hits .
Instead , multiple interrupts will keep one of the cores overloaded while others remain relatively free .
Scheduler has no idea about this state of affairs .
It assumes that our interrupt handling core is as busy as any other core .
As a result , you may face bottle necks as one of the processes or threads will occasionally work on core that has only 90 % of its power available .
Things may be even worse because often core 0 by default handles all interrupts .
On busy systems all interrupts may consume as much as 30 % of core ’s 0 power .
Because we assume that all cores are equally powerful , we may find ourselves in a situation where our software system will effectively use only 70 % of total CPU power .
Who ’s responsible
APIC or Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller has been integral part of all modern x86 based systems for many years – both SP ( single - processor ) and MP .
This component is responsible for delivering interrupts .
It also decides what interrupt goes where , in terms of cores .
By default APIC delivers ALL interrupts to core 0 .
This is the reason why / proc / interrupts will look like this on vast majority of modern Linux systems :
CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 CPU3 0 : 123357 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge timer 8 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge rtc 11 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level acpi 169 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level uhci_hcd:usb1 177 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level qla2xxx 185 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level qla2xxx 193 : 12252 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level ioc0 209 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level uhci_hcd:usb2 217 : 468 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level eth0 225 : 285 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level eth1 NMI : 120 66 76 45 LOC : 123239 123220 123187 123065 ERR : 0 MIS : 0
See anything suspicious ?
Well , CPU0 handling all hardware interrupts .
All of them .
This is the situation that you see on a system with misconfigured interrupt SMP affinity .
Simple solution for the problem
Solution for this problem has been around pretty much since the introduction of the APIC .
It has several interrupt delivery and destination modes .
Physical and logical .
Fixed and low priority .
Etc .
The important fact is that it is capable of delivering interrupts to any of the cores and even do load balancing between them .
Its configuration is limited to first eight cores .
I.e. if you have more than eight cores , do n’t expect any core higher than 7 to receive interrupts .
By default it operates in physical / fixed .
This means that it will deliver certain interrupt to certain core .
You already know that by default it is core 0 .
The thing is that you can easily change core that receives certain interrupt .
For each and every IRQ number in the first column in / proc / interrupts file , there ’s a sub - directory in / proc / irq / .
That directory contains a file named smp_affinity .
Using this file you can change what core handles that interrupt .
Reading from this file produces a hexadecimal number which is a bitmask with a single bit for each core .
When certain bit is set , APIC will deliver the interrupt to corresponding core .
Let ’s see an example …
# # cat / proc / interrupts CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 CPU3 0 : 19599546 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge timer 8 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge rtc 11 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level acpi 169 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level uhci_hcd:usb1 177 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level qla2xxx 185 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level qla2xxx 193 : 95337 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level ioc0 209 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level uhci_hcd:usb2 217 : 100778 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level eth0 225 : 56651 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level eth1 NMI : 466 393 422 372 LOC : 19600453 19600434 19600401 19600279 ERR : 0 MIS : 0 # # # echo " 2 " > / proc/irq/217/smp_affinity # cat / proc/ interrupts CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 CPU3 0 : 19606722 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge timer 8 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge rtc 11 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level acpi 169 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level uhci_hcd:usb1 177 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level qla2xxx 185 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level qla2xxx 193 : 95349 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level ioc0 209 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level uhci_hcd:usb2 217 : 101027 49 0 0 IO - APIC - level eth0 225 : 56655 0 0 0 IO - APIC - level eth1 NMI : 466 393 422 372 LOC : 19607629 19607610 19607577 19607455 ERR : 0 MIS : 0 #
As we can see , once we enter the magical command , CPU1 begins receiving interrupts from eth0 , instead of CPU0 .
The echo command that changed the state of affairs is especially interesting .
It is “ 2 ” that we ’re echoing into the file .
Writing “ 4 ” to the file , would cause eth0 interrupt be handled by CPU2 , instead of CPU1 .
As I already mentioned , it is a bitmask where one bit correspond to single CPU .
How about writing “ 3 ” into the file .
In theory , this should cause APIC to divert interrupts to CPU0 and CPU1 .
Unfortunately , things are a little more complicated here .
It all depends on whether APIC works in physical “ destination mode ” and low priority “ delivery mode ” .
If it is so , than you most likely would not be seeing CPU0 handling all interrupts .
This is because when kernel configures APIC to work in physical / low priority modes , it automatically tells APIC to load balance interrupts between first eight cores .
So if on your system CPU0 handles all interrupts by default , this probably means that APIC configured ambiguously .
Ultimate solution
First of all , unfortunately there is no choice but to replace the kernel .
Software that configures APIC is part of the kernel and if we want to change things we have no choice but to fix things in kernel .
Things related to APIC are not configurable , so we have absolutely no choice .
The only question is , replace kernel with what ?
I tested this with OpenSuSE 10.2 that comes with kernel 2.6.18 .
Installing kernel 2.6.24.3 ( the latest at the moment ) with OpenSuSE ’s default kernel configuration ( / proc/ config.gz ) fixes the problem .
With this kernel , things look like this , right from the start :
# cat / proc/ interrupts CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 CPU3 0 : 728895 728796 728624 728895 IO - APIC-edge timer 8 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - edge rtc 11 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - fasteoi acpi 16 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - fasteoi uhci_hcd:usb1 19 : 0 0 0 0 IO - APIC - fasteoi uhci_hcd:usb2 24 : 14090 14090 14327 14056 IO - APIC -fasteoi ioc0 49 : 7 9 7 8 IO - APIC - fasteoi qla2xxx 50 : 8 12 11 10 IO - APIC - fasteoi qla2xxx 77 : 2849 2759 2841 2827 IO -APIC -fasteoi eth0 78 : 25072 25138 24996 24980 IO - APIC - fasteoi eth1 NMI : 0 0 0 0 LOC : 2915270 2915256 2915228 2915092 ERR : 0
Looks good is n’t it ?
All cores handle interrupts , thus working with maximum efficiency .
Now how about getting this result with just any kernel version ?
It appears to be doable .
There ’s a kernel configuration option that stands in our way and once removed you will get similar situation with probably any kernel newer than 2.6.10 .
The option is CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU .
It adds support for hotplugable CPUs .
It appears that having this option off , makes kernel configure APIC properly .
Actually it is quiet understandable .
You see , APIC has to be told what processors should receive interrupts .
You need additional piece of code that tells APIC how to handle processor removals – processor removal is one of the things that CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU allows you to do .
I assume that this functionality was missing from earlier kernel and got inside in 2.6.24.3 .
Conclusion
We saw that we can achieve really nice results by doing some modifications to kernel configuration .
On a very busy system , doing this small configuration change can boost server ’s productivity by large margin .
I hope you will find this information useful and use techniques I described in this article .
Japanese who believe that Tokyo should apologize for drafting thousands of Asian woman as sex slaves for the Imperial Army in World War II outnumber those who think otherwise for the first time , a straw poll suggests .
The Northeast Asian History foundation commissioned Gallup Korea to poll 527 Seoul citizens , and 500 citizens each in Beijing and Tokyo from Aug. 1 to 9 .
In the poll released Monday , 48.9 percent of respondents in Tokyo said Japan should apologize to the " comfort women , " while 30.3 percent said it does not need to .
Some 53.6 percent of Japanese women and 57.8 percent of Japanese respondents in their 30s and 40s said Japan should apologize .
Men made up 38.1 percent of those who thought Japan need not apologize , and older people 34.5 percent .
When the survey began in 2007 , only 38.4 percent of Japanese said Tokyo should say sorry , with 50.4 percent against .
The poll was held right before the general election , which marked a historic shift from the rightwing Liberal Democrats to the Democratic Party .
Meanwhile , some 60.3 percent of South Koreans said relations with China will improve , up from 52.3 percent in 2008 .
But among Chinese and Japanese the trend was the opposite , from 74.2 percent to 61 percent and from 31.6 percent to 23.3 percent respectively .
Some 44 percent of South Korean and Japanese respondents expected better ties between Seoul and Tokyo .
But only 30.1 percent of Chinese respondents saw Korea - Japan ties improve .
Asked about the most urgent historical disagree ments to be solved in the three countries , 23.6 percent of South Koreans cited Japan 's claim to the Dokdo islets , 12.3 percent of the Chinese picked territorial issues , and 11.2 percent of the Japanese cited the need to foster a proper historical understanding .
The poll had a large margin of error of 4.4 percent and a 95 - percent confidence level .
A Pacific tsunami warning issued following strong earthquakes off Vanuatu has been lifted , after only a tiny wave was generated .
The first quake with a magnitude of 7.8 was followed about an hour later by one of 7.1 , the US Geological Survey said .
The first epicentre was 295 km ( 180 miles ) north - northwest of Vanuatu 's largest island , Santo , at a depth of 35 km ( 21.7 miles ) .
People had already begun to move to higher ground .
In Vanuatu residents evacuated low - lying areas and fled to higher ground .
In New Caledonia , schools in coastal areas were evacuated .
More than 170 people died last week when a tsunami triggered by a quake hit Samoa , American Samoa and Tonga .
All three nations were initially included in a " tsunami watch " - a lower level of alert than a tsunami warning - but were later upgraded to the warning level , before the warnings were cancelled .
Earlier on Wednesday , a 6.7 - magnitude quake struck off the Philippines , but no tsunami warning was issued .
Snipers are an integral part of any modern combat operation since they are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the execution of the plans laid out by the strategists .
The Marine course scout / sniper school at Camp Pendleton , California is a school that trains student snipers to become adept at their task .
They are subjected to a mock combat exercise and are tested on their level of physical and mental toughness .
The students are subject to food deprivation , sleep deprivation , stress and pressure and checked whether they are able to maintain their cool and perform well .

A 54 - year - old Longmont woman who was accused of drugging and raping a male friend last year is expected to agree to a plea deal later this week .
Janice McCarl had been scheduled for trial beginning Monday , but that was canceled , and a judge scheduled a time for McCarl to return to court on Friday to accept a plea deal .
Details of the agreement are n’t known .
If convicted of felony sexual assault , McCarl could have been sentenced to up to 16 years in prison , if a judge found exceptional aggravating circumstances .
McCarl is accused of having inappropriate sexual contact with a 50 - year - old male friend Nov. 9 at his Longmont home , where he was hosting a backyard barbecue .
The man told police he passed out after drinking beverages that he suspects were drugged , and remembers partly waking up a half - hour later because of a painful sensation , according to a police report .
The man told officers he remembers the woman ’s hands were on him , and the next day he found McCarl sleeping next to him with her shirt covered in blood and lotion , according to police .
The man said he spoke with McCarl later , according to police , and she admitted to drugging him the night before — although she would n’t say why .
McCarl apologized , and he told her she was “ mean , nasty and disgusting , ” police wrote in the report .
Longmont police Cmdr. Tim Lewis has said the two had a consensual intimate relationship before the alleged assault .
When questioned about the incident , according to police , McCarl laughed and said , “ What did I do , kill somebody ? ”
Lewis has said his department rarely receives reports of women sexually assaulting men , and a victims ’ advocate said McCarl ’s case is only the second she can remember in the past decade .

Respect Travolta 's privacy
Scientology and religious freedom
Why celebrities are constantly targeted by tabloids
( Natural News ) John Travolta , who is testifying in a case involving a $ 25 million extortion attempt against him , revealed this week that his son who died this year from a seizure was autistic .
Sixteen - year - old Jett suffered from severe seizures every 5 to 10 days , Travolta testified , and then slept 12 hours to recover after each episode .
It 's not uncommon for autistic children to suffer from severe seizures .
This is an important clue about the causes of autism , as seizures reflect a serious neurological complication .
It brings to mind possible neurological toxins that children are being exposed to these days , includingandfound in vaccines .
A new U.S. government study just released this week says that .
This is an alarming increase in a disease that many ill - informed doctors and scientists still brush off as being genetic in origin .
But genes can't explain such a rapid increase in the number of children being diagnosed with the disease .
Clearly , some other factor is at work , and many parents suspect vaccines are one of the primary contributing factors .
Naturally , there is a lot of chatter on the ' net right now about John Travolta 's son and the vaccine issue .
Not every parent with an autistic child chooses to go public with that fact .
Travolta himself is being criticized by some in the autism community for not going public sooner with the autism diagnosis of his son , but in my view , this is unfair criticism .
People who have never been famous have no idea about the pressures that come with notoriety .
Aside from having your privacy routinely violated by tabloid photographers and gold - digging " friends , " as a famous person you 're also a ripe target for extortion attempts by criminally - minded people , which is precisely what John Travolta is having to deal with right now .
Travolta had no special moral obligation to declare the autistic diagnosis of his son , and those who berate him for choosing to protect the privacy of his family are acting out of extreme insensitivity ( if not outright cruelty ) .
Just because Travolta 's son suffered from a particular diagnosis does n't mean he 's obligated to be a spokesperson for that disease .
Besides , John Travolta probably realizes what many parents of autistic children are already figuring out :
Thatin an attempt to divert blame away from vaccines
Overall , the autism support community is very well informed about the links between vaccines and autism , but they are increasingly pressured by powerful pharmaceutical interests to dissociate the two and create doubt or confusion in the minds of those who might suspect any link between vaccines and autism .
As a member of Scientology , Travolta is well aware of the dangers of pharmaceutical intervention .
Scientology is ardently outspoken against psychiatric drugs and the dangers of drugging children with mind - altering chemicals .
It is not known to Natural News whether Travolta 's son actually received vaccine injections in years past , but it seems likely that he did , considering that he was 16 years old and many of the evidence linking vaccines to autism did not surface until only the past few years .
It could be that , like many parents , Travolta allowed his son to be vaccinated at a young age , and then swore off all vaccinations years later as he became aware of the true dangers of vaccines ( but this is just conjecture ) .
I have no doubt , however , that if Travolta had the opportunity to do it all over again , he would have kept his son as far away as possible from modern medicine 's chemical interventions .
This is increasingly true with a growing number of parents , by the way , not just John Travolta or followers of Scientology .
In anticipation of the comments that will likely be posted about this story and John Travolta in particular , I want to warn potential posters that expressions of religious intolerance will be deleted .
John Travolta is entitled to his particular religious philosophy just as you or I .
Believing in religious freedom requires that you accept the freedoms of others to embrace whatever religious practices they choose , including Buddhism , Judaism , Islam , Hinduism , Sikhism or even Atheism .
I personally am not a member of Scientology , but I have read parts of the texts of almost every major world religion ( translated into English , of course ) , including some of the works of L. Ron Hubbard , who was by any account a brilliant and highly prolific writer .
My own interests span many religions .
I was raised in the Christian tradition , I have Buddhist prayer flags mounted above the porch to my house , and I recently played a key role in the baptism of an Ecuadorian child at a local Catholic church ( that was a fascinating experience that I hope to share with you at some point ) .
I make a real effort to honor the religious beliefs of all those who follow a religious practice , even if their beliefs differ from my own .
And people need to realize thathas some bizarre practice of some sort , including Christianity .
What 's the deal with slicing off the skin from a baby 's penis , anyway ?
( Circumcision ... )
" Hey , here 's a beautiful new baby boy , formed in the image of God ... let 's cut the skin off his penis ! "
Bizarre ...
By the way , see this interesting web page from the National Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males , called : " Circumcision and the Christian Parent " http://www.noharmm.org/christianparent.htm
Aside from the topic of religion , John Travolta deserves some peace for the simple fact that he is a caring father who lost his son .
For that reason alone , we would all do well to respect his wish for some family privacy , respect his good intentions in protecting his son from dangerous medical interventions , and grant Travolta the courtesy to tell his own story in his own time , if he so chooses .
Perhaps he will wish to tell it through NaturalNews one day , as he probably knows we are the only well - established media outlet that wo n't try to distort his story for tabloid effect .
What these tabloids do to celebrities is criminal , in my opinion .
They exploit their personal tragedies and exaggerate the facts simply to sell more papers , regardless of whose reputation gets ravaged in the process .
Tabloid publishing is a dirty , sick business because their mostly - fictional reports force celebrities to relive their tragedies over and over again , always stacked with outright lies and disinformation .
Even defending yourself against a tabloid accusation is impossible , as acknowledging the story itself only brings more attention to precisely the false information you do n't want to highlight .
And as a celebrity , no matter what actions you take or decisions you make , they 're always second - guessed in a distorted and destructive way .
It 's impossible to be a celebrity and not be targeted by the tabloids , because controversy sells papers ... even if it 's all been invented .
This does n't even get into the issue ofof celebrities by their closest employees .
I 've often said this about Michael Jackson , too :
The guy was a victim of greed and deception , and he was constantly betrayed by those he thought he could trust ( the very people who worked closest to him ) .
John Travolta experienced much the same thing with the $ 25 million extortion threat he 's dealing with right now .
What every celebrity learns sooner or later is that .
Your best employee , best friend or even a close family member can turn on you in an instant when the right amount of money presents itself .
David Letterman learned this recently , too , with the $ 2 million extortion threat from an ABC Producer who was previously held in high regard by virtually everyone .
Although I 'm getting way off topic here , this is worth mentioning : .
It makes you bitter about human beings , because you come to learn that you can't trust people .
There 's no longer anything resembling true friendship with new people you meet , because you can never be sure whether someone enjoys your company for who you are , or they simply want to use you for your reputation , money or influence .
In any case , let us hope that some good will come out of this family tragedy .
Perhaps John Travolta 's notoriety will bring new attention to the autism / vaccine issue and encourage more parents to start asking the important questions about the safety of vaccines .
Autism rates in 2009 are 1000 % higher than in 1990 , as you 'll see in a related article about autism posted here on NaturalNews .
Clearly , something is causing this , and vaccines need to be looked at in much greater detail .
Because whether you 're a celebrity or just a hard - working mom or dad , your children have been put in danger by the pharmaceutical industry .
It 's up to YOU to protect them .
Germany observes no official holiday on November 9th , the day when , twenty years ago , crowds of stunned , delirious East Germans breached the Berlin Wall .
This is because November 9th is also the date on which Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated , in 1918 , two days before Germany ’s defeat in the First World War .
On November 9 , 1923 , Hitler attempted to overthrow the Weimar Republic , in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch .
In 1938 , November 9th was the Night of Broken Glass , when Nazi gangs attacked Jews and their property across Germany and Austria , foreshadowing the genocide to come .
The German calendar is appropriately inconvenient : nothing good is conserved without the active remembrance of something bad .
The British writer Timothy Garton Ash has called 1989 the best year in European history .
It delivered the Continent from its worst century — the new democratic European unity that began in 1989 was built on fifty million graves .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
The chain reaction of nonviolent civic movements in Poland , Hungary , East Germany , and Czechoslovakia seemed like a miracle at the time , and it still does .
Anyone who grew up knowing nothing but the Cold War could scarcely imagine that the world was n’t eternally locked in permafrost .
No Hegelian teleology predetermined that Communism would be left on the ash heap of history .
In 1989 , Francis Fukuyama published his essay “ The End of History ? , ” in which he predicted “ the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government . ”
This proved far too optimistic for the post - Cold War world , and even in Central Europe , where liberal democracy did emerge , the dramatic events that brought it about were messier and chancier than the dreams of neo-conservative philosophers .
The wall came down not because Ronald Reagan stood up and demanded it but because on the evening of November 9th , at a televised press conference in East Berlin , a Party hack named Günter Schabowski flubbed a question about the regime ’s new , liberalized travel regulations .
Asked when they took effect , Schabowski shrugged , scratched his head , checked some papers , and said , “ Immediately , ” sending thousands of East Berliners to the wall in a human tide that the German Democratic Republic could not control .
Soldiers and Stasi agents did n’t shoot into the crowd , but things could easily have gone otherwise .
The revolutions of 1989 were made possible by a multiplicity of conditions : the courage of East Bloc dissidents and the hundreds of thousands of fellow - citizens who finally joined them ; American support for the dissident movements and containment of the Soviet Union ; the disastrous economies of the Communist countries ; the loss of confidence among ruling - party élites ; the crucial forbearance of Mikhail Gorbachev .
For Europe ’s Communist regimes to disappear so suddenly and bloodlessly ( Romania was a different story ) , everything had to fall into place , above and below , within and without .
Such circumstances are improbably rare , and they ca n’t be mechanically replicated by the laws of history or by divine design or by universal human aspiration .
A false lesson drawn from 1989 involves a kind of shallow eschatology of totalitarianism : this is how it always happens — the people rise up , the regime withers and dies , peace and democracy reign .
The chaos that followed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was in part a consequence of this thinking .
In planning the postwar period in Iraq , George W. Bush and some of his advisers had 1989 in mind — “ like Eastern Europe with Arabs , ” as one official put it .
“ What the labor — relations board does n’t know wo n’t hurt it . ”

The last , briefest , and most thrilling of that year ’s peaceful uprisings , the Velvet Revolution , took place in Czechoslovakia .
Over the next two decades , it produced a series of successors and imitators in Serbia , Ukraine , and Georgia .
While they all improved the politics of their respective countries , none of them had a Václav Havel , and none of them created a stable liberal democracy .
Whenever things fail to turn out as they did in Central Europe , people tend to react as if history had unaccountably malfunctioned .
But if 1989 were the rule and not the exception , then Burmese , Chinese , and Zimbabwean dissidents — who have sacrificed far more than their European counterparts ( in China , 1989 meant Tiananmen Square ) — would be in power by now .
Perhaps the closest contemporary analogy to the fall of Communism is the democratic movement that is challenging the Islamic Republic of Iran .
It has deep social and intellectual roots , a growing mass following , and an enemy state with a hollowed - out ideology .
But , unlike the East German soldiers and the Stasi agents , the Revolutionary Guards and the Basij militia are ready to kill .
Behind President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , there is no restraining figure like Gorbachev .
Iranians will have to find their own way to the fulfillment of their democratic desires .
And yet the fact that the nearest counterparts to the thinkers and activists of 1989 are to be found in a non-Western , Muslim country exposes another false lesson of that year : that such things are for Westerners only , that “ they ” do n’t want what “ we ” want .
A recent Pew poll shows that Germans , Czechs , and Poles remain relatively enthusiastic about democracy and capitalism ; Hungarians , Bulgarians , and Lithuanians less so .
Former East Germans ’ hopes of achieving the living standards of their Western countrymen have not been fulfilled , and the inevitable disappointments have muted anniversary celebrations .
Last month in Dresden , a retired schoolteacher acknowledged the pining of some East Germans for their simpler , cozier former lives under state socialism .
There ’s even a neologism for it : Ostalgie .
But , the teacher said , “ What matters is that I can talk with an American journalist without going to jail , that I can travel without filling out forms , that I can read what I want to read , that I ’m not told what TV station I can watch and not watch , that at school I do n’t have to say something that I do n’t say in private at home .
This is what is decisive to me today . ”
Twenty years after the revolutions of 1989 , Europe ’s bitter half century of armed division is the object of profitable kitsch .
At Checkpoint Charlie , in central Berlin , where an East German guard opened the gate at 11:17 P.M. that November 9th , you can now pay a euro to pose with hucksters wearing Soviet , British , French , and American uniforms .
Neighborhoods that used to be separated by the wall have become hotbeds of the art scene , the gay scene , and the club scene .
Meanwhile , Germans widely regarded the recent election campaign , in which fundamental issues were avoided , as a snooze .
Berlin will never again be the hair - trigger focus of global ideological conflict , and Europe ’s place at the center of modern history is over .
This proves not the failure of 1989 but , rather , its astounding success .
No one is prepared to die for European unity , and no one will have to . ♦
From Roger Pielke Senior : Bias In News Reporting
There is a press release on a paper yesterday from NCAR titled Record High Temperatures Far Outpace Record Lows Across U.S .
I plan to post on the paper on which this news article is based next week ( it has major problems , as already identified at Watts Up With That ) .
However , today , I want to just compare the news exposure of three press releases , one of which supports a surface temperature changes from the human addition of CO2 and other greenhouse gases ( the NCAR press release ) , and two others which present other explanations for at least part of the surface temperature increases .
The NCAR press release as of 10 am EST November 13 2009 has 95 links ( under the lead author ) at google news .
The other two press releases are
“ Study gives clearer picture of how land - use changes affect U.S. climate ” from Purdue which has 3 links ( under any of the co-authors ) in google news where the press relase has the text
“ What we highlight here is that a significant trend , particularly the warming trend in terms of temperatures , can also be partially explained by land - use change , ” said Dev Niyogi , a Purdue earth and atmospheric sciences and agronomy professor , and the Indiana state climatologist . ”
New Idea offered to fight climate change from Georgia Tech which has 6 links ( under the author ’s name ) in google news where the press release has the text
“ Across the ( United States ) as a whole , approximately 50 percent of the warming that has occurred since 1950 is due to land use changes ( usually in the form of clearing forest for crops or cities ) rather than to the emission of greenhouse gases , ” Stone said .
“ Most large U.S. cities … are warming at more than twice the rate of the planet as a whole — a rate that is mostly attributable to land use change . ”
The news community clearly has a bias in its reporting .

What ’s with all the zombies lately ?
That could be a question about one of the hippest retro fads that pop culture has going these days .
Inspired by horror genres of past , zombies have lurched back to pre-eminence in books like “ World War Z , ” video games like “ Left 4 Dead ” and blockbuster films like “ Zombieland . ”
Even the highbrow producers at National Public Radio recently devoted a segment to a University of Ottawa study entitled “ Mathematical Modeling of An Outbreak of Zombie Infection . ”
Indeed , the undead have become so popular , they ’ve spurred “ zombie walks ” in cities and spawned Weird Al-ish parodies through Jane Austen knock - offs like “ Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ” and bands such as the Zombeatles ( with their hit “ Hard Day ’s Night of the Living Dead ” ) .
Frighteningly enough , though , that question about zombies could also be asked of America ’s political culture .
It was only a year ago that “ zombie ” first entered the colloquial economic lexicon during the collapse of the financial institutions that were cannibalizing the economy .
From a balance - sheet perspective , many of these firms were dead .
But they were quickly reanimated as zombie banks with trillions of taxpayer dollars .
Like a typical zombie outbreak , the initial plague spread .
On Wall Street , we have zombie executives — those who destroyed the economy but nonetheless kept their same jobs and now continue paying themselves huge bonuses .
At the White House , President Obama hired zombie advisers whose zombie economic ideologies and records manufacturing recession conditions should have killed their careers , but who now sit in high government office letting out moans in support of the zombie banks .
On Capitol Hill , the scene this Halloween season looks like Michael Jackson ’s “ Thriller ” video .
Decrepit zombie politicians with the funk of 40,000 years stalk Congress with the very zombie lobbyists that the election was said to disempower .
Lately , they are working in tandem to construct zombie health insurance companies — for - profit corporations eternalized by public subsidies , customer mandates and almost no regulation or competition .
At the same time , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that should have already concluded keep plodding on with an unchanging zombie strategy — all while media zombies push zombie myths about death panels and birth certificates , effectively feasting on the last functioning lobes of the American brain .
Call me a zombie pundit , but I agree with “ World War Z ” author Max Brooks ’ suggestion that the concurrent rise of zombie pop and political cultures is no coincidence .
“ Zombies are an apocalyptic threat , we are living in times of apocalyptic anxiety ( and ) we need a vessel in which to coalesce those anxieties , ” he says .
In fact , I ’ll go out on a severed limb and take it further :
If zombies specifically represent the apocalyptic downsides of immortalized mindlessness , then today ’s zombie zeitgeist is not merely a result of scary quandaries created by stupidity .
It is a reaction to both those problems and the sense that they can never be thwarted .
Here we are , a year after a financial implosion that should have driven a stake in the heart of free market fundamentalism .
Here we are , a year after an election that was supposed to pour holy water on Wall Street vampires , exorcise the economy ’s demons and challenge the ancient mummies of neoconservative foreign policy .
Yet here we are , with virtually nothing changed , watching the same zombie crises indomitably stumble forward .
And so what do we do ?
We flee to entertainment venues that let us enjoy the campy thrill of confronting the undead — even though we ’ve lost the ability to do that in real life .
“ The zombie is a way for us to explore massive disasters in a safe way , ” Brooks says .
“ You ca n’t shoot the financial meltdown in the head , but you can do that with a zombie . ”
Community contributions and copyright assignment
Did you know ...?

Over the course of the last month or so , your editor has been to six conferences on three continents .
When engaged in that kind of travel , it is , of course , obligatory to determine which country has the best beer ; normally , substantial amounts of research are required .
It 's also normal to hear what 's on one 's co-researchers ' minds while carrying out this task .
This time around , your editor heard grumbles from a surprising number of people , all about the same topic : copyright assignment policies .
In particular , developers are concerned and unhappy about the copyright assignment policy that Canonical has chosen for all of its projects .
This agreement [ PDF ] is a relatively simple read ; it fits on a single page .
It applies to a long list of projects , including Bazaar , Launchpad , Quickly , Upstart , and Notify - osd ; contributions to any of those projects must be made under the terms of this agreement .
So what do contributors agree to ?
The core term is this :
I hereby assign to Canonical with full title guarantee all copyright now or in the future subsisting in any part of the world in any Assigned Contributions .
So Canonical gets outright ownership of the code .
In return , Canonical gives the original author rights to do almost anything with that code .
Assigning copyright to Canonical could well be an obstacle for potential contributors , but there are a couple of other terms which make things worse .
One of them is this :
Canonical will ordinarily make the Assigned Contributions available to the public under a " Free Software Licence " , according to the definition of that term published by the Free Software Foundation from time to time .
Canonical may also , in its discretion , make the Assigned Contributions available to the public under other license terms .
There are many free software developers who might balk at giving their code away to somebody who " ordinarily " will make it available under a free license .
And the final sentence is even worse ; " other license terms " is , of course , euphemistic language for " proprietary terms . "
Finally , there is the patent pledge :
I will not assert or enforce any patent against ( a ) Canonical ( b ) anyone who received the Software and / or the Assigned Contributions from Canonical or ( c ) anyone who received the Software and / or the Assigned Contributions under a Free Software Licence , where that patent is infringed by any of them exercising copyright rights in the Software and / or the Assigned Contributions
This language is likely to be just fine for many developers who have no intention of asserting patents against anybody anyway .
But it 's worth noting that ( 1 ) the patent grant is broad , including anything which might be added to the program ( by others ) in the future , and ( 2 ) there is no " self defense " exception allowing patents to be used to fight off litigation initiated by others .
So , to a patent holder , this language is going to look like a unilateral disarmament pledge with unknown ( and unknowable ) scope .
For many companies - even those which are opposed to software patents in general - that requirement may well be enough , on its own , to break the deal .
Contributor agreements abound , of course , though their terms vary widely .
One might compare Canonical 's agreement with the Free Software Foundation 's language , which reads :
The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Work , or of any work " based on the Work " , that takes place under the control of the Foundation or its assignees , shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply , and possessing accurate notice of these terms , to redistribute copies of the work to anyone on the same terms .
These terms shall not restrict which members of the public copies may be distributed to .
These terms shall not require a member of the public to pay any royalty to the Foundation or to anyone else for any permitted use of the work they apply to , or to communicate with the Foundation or its agents in any way either when redistribution is performed or on any other occasion .
Not all developers are big fans of the FSF , but most of them trust it to live up to those particular terms .
The FSF agreement makes no mention of patents at all ( though GPLv3 is certainly not silent on the subject ) .
What about other projects ?
The Apache Software Foundation has an agreement by which the ASF is granted a license ( which it promises not to use " in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit status " ) but the author retains ownership of all code .
Sun 's contributor agreement [ PDF ] , which now covers MySQL too , gives
Sun the right to do anything with the code , but shares joint ownership with the author .
An extreme example is the SugarCRM agreement , which appears to transfer not just the author 's copyrights , but his or her patents ( the actual patents , not a license ) as well .
Agreements like Sun's and SugarCRM's are common when dealing with corporate - owned projects ; they clearly prioritize control and the ability to take things proprietary over the creation of an independent development community .
More community - oriented projects , instead , tend to take a different approach to contributor agreements .
Canonical is being criticized in a way that SugarCRM is not , despite the fact that Canonical 's agreement appears to be the friendlier of the two .
A plausible reason for that difference is that Canonical presents itself as a community - oriented organization , but it is pushing a more corporate - style contributor agreement .
Canonical 's policy is especially likely to worry other Linux distributors .
They are often happy to contribute to a project controlled by a different distributor , but they do not normally do so under terms which allow the recipient to take the code proprietary .
Licenses like the GPL ensure fair dealing between companies ; contributor agreements which allow " other license terms " remove any assurance of fair dealing .
It is not surprising that some people are uninterested in contributing code under such terms .
The real sticking point , at the moment , appears to be Upstart .
Other distributors either have adopted it or are considering doing so ; it does appear to be a substantial improvement over the old SYSV init scheme .
In the course of adopting Upstart , these distributors are certain to fix problems and make improvements to suit their needs .
But they are rather less certain to contribute those changes back under Canonical 's terms .
In his wanderings , your editor has heard developers talk about possibly forking Upstart .
Another developer claimed to be working on a completely new alternative system for system initialization which would take lessons from Upstart , but which would be an independent development .
Neither of these outcomes seems optimal .
Your editor sent in a query asking what prevents Canonical from adopting more contributor - friendly terms , but got no answer over the course of a couple of days .
Groups requiring copyright assignment often claim that it 's necessary for them to be able to take action against copyright infringers .
But the projects which have had the most success in that area - the Linux kernel and Busybox , for example - have no copyright assignment policy .
The other thing that copyright assignment allows , of course , is a relicensing of the code .
The FSF has made use of this privilege to move its projects to GPLv3 ; companies like MySQL have , instead , used it to ship code under proprietary terms .
One might assume that Canonical has no such intent , but the fact that Canonical has explicitly reserved the right to do so is unlikely to make people comfortable .
When developers contribute code to a project , they tend to get intangible rewards in return .
So asking them to hand over ownership of the code as well might seem to be pushing things a little too far .
Even so , many developers are willing to contribute under such terms .
But there are limits , and allowing a competitor to take code proprietary may well be beyond those limits - as are overly - broad patent grants for contributors who are concerned about such things .
Companies which demand such rights may find that their community projects are not as successful as they would like .
THE FORCE BEHIND THE HARASSMENT STRATEGY ….
It ’s good to match the group with the thuggish tactics .
Conservatives for Patients ’
Rights , the operation that ’s running a national campaign against a public health care option , is now publicly taking credit for helping gin up the sometimes - rowdy outbursts targeting House Dems at town hall meetings around the country , raising questions about their spontaneity .
CPR is the group headed by controversial former hospitals exec Rick Scott that ’s spending millions on ads attacking reform in all sorts of lurid ways , a campaign that ’s being handled by the same P.R. mavens behind the Swift Boat Vets .
In response to my questions , a spokesman for the group confirmed that it has undertaken a concerted effort to get people out to the town hall meetings to protest reform .
We learned yesterday that the group sent an email to a right - wing listserv called the Tea Party Patriots Health Care Reform Committee , hoping to coordinate efforts on more than 100 town - hall events throughout the rest of the summer .
Brian Beutler added today , “ The disclosure makes official what much of the reporting about the disruptions seemed to indicate : that industry funded groups –who stand to benefit if health reform legislation fails — are playing a significant role in organizing , and perhaps ginning up , the outbursts we ’re seeing at health care public forums around the country . ”
It ’s also worth remembering that Conservatives for Patients ’
Rights is run by Rick Scott , who is perhaps best known for having been ousted as the head of Columbia / HCA healthcare after a massive fraud investigation .
Columbia / HCA ultimately pleaded guilty to a variety of fraud - related charges , paid $ 1.7 billion in fines , and got rid of their scandal - plagued chief .
HCAN ’s Richard Kirsch said a couple of months ago , “ Those attacking reform are really looking to protect their own profits , and [ Rick Scott is ] a perfect messenger for that .
His history of making a fortune by destroying quality in the health - care system and ripping off the government is a great example of what ’s really going on… .
We cannot have a better first person to attack health care reform than someone who ran a company that ripped off the government of hundreds of millions of dollars . ”
Right - wing activists teaming up with a right - wing scam artist to ensure the public can’t have an honest discussion about health care .
It ’s sad , in a predictable kind of way .
The 100 Greatest Quotes from " The Wire "
By Dustin Rowles | Guides | April 22 , 2011 |
HBO ’s “ The Wire ” concluded its five - season run just last year , but it ’s already established itself as quite possibly the greatest TV series in history .
It never won an Emmy , and was in fact only nominated twice , both in the writing categories : once for the third season ’s penultimate episode , “ Middle Ground , ” and once for the series finale , “ - 30 - . ”
Of course , that stat only matters if you think the Emmys are worth a damn , and I think we all know that any organization that so consistently praises Fox ’s “ House ” has some serious priority issues .
But those two scant nominations do highlight something that the show ’s faithful followers know all too well :
The writing is outstanding .
The stories are sprawling , epic , Greek - tragic ruminations on the nature of American conquest and the sacrifices made by the people at the bottom of the ladder on behalf of the ineptitude of those at the top .
What ’s more , the dialogue is this thick gun-blast of hardened profanity , street slang , police argot , and the undeniably Shakespearean pleasures of hearing gifted orators hold forth on the tilted battle between good and evil .
Although creator David Simon handled a lot of the writing , over its 60 episodes the series also relied on stories and scripts from producer Ed Burns and a host of crime writers including George Pelecanos , Dennis Lehane , and Richard Price .
The show mined material from those who knew it , like when William Zorzi — a former colleague of Simon ’s at The Baltimore Sun — joined the writing staff to consult on a political story line and eventually became a large contributor to ( and cast member in ) the final season ’s story , set in part at a dying Sun .
It ’s with the show ’s rich history and stunning commitment to storytelling in mind that I ’m honored to reveal the latest creation from hh , our resident video editor who also cut together The Other 100 Best Movie Quotes of All Time .
This time out , he ’s come up with an outstanding compilation of 100 of the greatest quotes from “ The Wire , ” and it ’s a jaw - dropping reminder of how many amazing moments this show had .
There are so many moments , in fact , that there ’s a chance your personal favorite might not have made the cut .
( In which case : Show some flex . )
But it ’s a wonderful video nonetheless .
These are the lines that the devoted still recite to each other years after the episodes have aired , and that new converts ca n’t stop hearing in their heads every day .
Let it ring out .

David Cameron said that he does pray when he goes to church David Cameron has said he is a Christian who believes in God and goes to church , although " not as regularly as I should " .
The Conservative leader said Sunday School was one of his earliest memories , but said he did not " drop to my knees " and ask for help in a crisis .
However Mr Cameron added his Christian faith was a " part of who I am " .
His comments on the BBC's Songs of Praise diverge from other party leaders who have not discussed their beliefs .
Mr Cameron was brought up in an old rectory and told BBC One 's Songs of Praise , which was filmed in his Oxfordshire constituency of Witney , that his family were " relatively regular churchgoers " .
For me , and I suspect for lots of other people too , bad things actually sometimes make you think more about faith and the fact that you 're not facing these things on your own
David Cameron
He said : " I believe in God and I'm a Christian and I worship - not as regularly as I should - but I go to church .
" Do I drop to my knees and ask for guidance whenever an issue comes up ?
No , I do n't .
But it 's part of who I am .
" For me , and I suspect for lots of other people too , bad things actually sometimes make you think more about faith and the fact that you 're not facing these things on your own . "
While in office Tony Blair said he did not " do God " , however on leaving office he set up his " Faith Foundation " to promote inter - faith dialogue .
Mr Blair also converted to Catholicism after standing down as prime minister .
Egotism and altruism
And although Gordon Brown 's father was a minister , and he often speaks about the values he inherited from him , he rarely talks about his personal faith .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg sparked controversy when he became the only leader of a major party to openly declare he does not believe in God .
Mr Cameron said praying is " a quiet time when you can reflect a bit about your life and your family and your responsibilities and ask some questions " .
He added that he sees politicians as a blend of egotism and altruism .
" Politicians are always a bit of a mixture of ego and altro and you just hope that the altro wins out and that people do the right thing rather than the politically convenient thing . "

The Hermit Kingdom
Forget the hairdos and the funny suits .
Kim Jong
Il is no madman .
We do n’t have access to his shrink , of course , but there ’s absolutely no evidence to suggest that he ’s irrational .
In terms of judging his own people and the international community , he seems to have done a remarkable job with what he has been given .
One reason : cold - eyed awareness of the reality of his position .
He has told at least one reliable source that his own regime ’s propaganda is all lies , and he surely knows — given that he maintains constant access to the Internet and CNN — that his economy is a basket case and his country is an international pariah .
He also knows that it ’s almost impossible for him to reform without putting his own government ( and probably his life ) at risk .
While Chinese communist leader Deng Xiaoping was able to allow in investors from Taiwan and Hong Kong to jump - start his economy without having to worry that they would end up calling the shots , Kim faces an unhappy neighbor in South Korea whose economic strength means that any sort of perestroika - style economic modernization could quickly lead to loss of political control .
Indeed , Kim is thought to have circulated videotapes of the execution of Romania ’s communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to North Korean communist party members , just to make sure they get the point .
Given such constraints , Kim ’s hysterical rhetoric , missile launches , and stentorian nuclear threats look like a cynical but logical strategy for blackmailing the world into handing over adequate food and money for him to keep his regime in business .
Kim may be a dictator , but he ’s not deluded .
What ’s more , it ’s not just about Kim .
No one should be expecting the regime to change even if Kim himself departs ( a prospect much discussed since his recent bout of poor health ) .
Although Kim has reportedly tapped his third son as his official heir , the day - to - day affairs of the country have been run for years by the Kim - headed National Defense Commission , and Kim ’s powerful brother - in - law , who recently joined it , is already positioned to act as regent should Kim Senior pass away .
Even if 26 - year - old Kim Jong
Un actually becomes the putative new Great Dear Bright Amazing Leader , he ’s likely — given his youth and inexperience — to be a figurehead .
And even if this latest Kim is granted some measure of real power , you can forget all those hopeful news reports about the presumably liberalizing effect of his purported Swiss education .
For Kim 3.0 will face the brutal reality that his father does :
Any substantial opening will entail ceding control to the much more powerful South .
For the moment , though , the North is gradually moving toward some form of collective leadership .
Its aging members will be reluctant to vote for any sort of drastic reform , but they ’ll face the same sort of pressures that Kim does today .
Those pressures are only increasing as North Korea grows more open to the world than at any point in its 60 - year history .
Notwithstanding ritual media references to North Korea as " static " and " Orwellian , " today ’s North Korea is a place where people make a living off private markets and international trade .
In the mid-1990s the North ’s economic mismanagement compounded the damage from flooding , triggering an epochal famine that killed as many as 2 million people .
The corresponding collapse of state - managed networks for the production and distribution of food forced many North Koreans — including party members — to look to their own devices to keep themselves fed ( and the government increasingly looked away ) .
In 2002 Kim ’s government tacitly acknowledged this when it pushed through a series of tentative economic reforms that essentially allowed this minimal market sector to continue existing .
Under the " sunshine policy " instituted by the late South Korean President Kim Dae Jung at the beginning of this century , the North and South dramatically boosted economic cooperation , spurring trade and travel and even creating two enclaves inside the North where Southern managers and tourists mingled with Northerners .
The North did its best to restrict access , but knowledge and goods from both zones have spilled out — perhaps one reason why Pyongyang has seen fit to crack down on both of them in recent months .
One defector told Los Angeles Times correspondent Barbara Demick in 2005 : " It is not the same old North Korea anymore except in name . "
Lately , according to scholars such as Andrei Lankov at South Korea ’s Kookmin University , the government has been struggling to push back against the unwanted consequences of this reluctant liberalization .
Not long ago a Japanese newspaper reported a new wave of raids by so - called " 109 squads , " special police units that sweep through villages in search of illicit videos and music from the South .
As recently noted by members of parliament in Seoul , smuggled South Korean ramen noodles and whoopie pies are particularly prized by those in the North who can afford them .
Kim Jong
Il has reason to take such trifles seriously .
The number of North Koreans who have voted with their feet over the past decade , leaving the country for economic and political reasons , is now probably in the hundreds of thousands .
Of course , North Korea still maintains a vast police state that includes a network of concentration camps spanning the country .
And yet there are also intriguing signs that the government ’s power is no longer unlimited .
As part of the campaign to reassert its authority , the central government has repeatedly tried to crack down on the grass - roots private markets that serve as the main source of sustenance for ordinary folk , but so far it has notably failed to make the measures stick .
An attempt to close a key market in the city of Chongjin last year actually set off public protests .
And a new set of tough regulations this year has proven mysteriously hard to implement — perhaps because communist party officials now rely on the markets to stay alive themselves .
Yet the idea that the North has enclosed itself in an airtight seal remains a staple of international coverage .
That may have been accurate in the past .
But over the last 10 years the country ’s trade with China has mushroomed , and with the inflow of Chinese goods have also come video players , South Korean DVDs , and illicit Bibles .
Defectors report the popularity of everything from South Korean boy bands to the movie Titanic .
As a result , the regime ’s propaganda has largely lost its punch .
North Korea ’s growing dependence on cross - border trade also means that it ’s much more vulnerable to external pressure than is commonly recognized .
Many North Korea watchers think that sanctions imposed by the administration of George W. Bush in 2005 played a crucial role in bringing Pyongyang back to the six - party talks a few months later ; the sanctions proved effective because many Chinese banks shut down their business with the North for fear of losing access to the U.S. financial sector .
And this year trade between China and North Korea has slipped perceptibly — perhaps because a new round of U.N. sanctions , imposed after Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon last year , has also affected the North ’s financial dealings with Chinese partners .
That could be one reason why Pyongyang has suddenly started making overtures to the international community again after months of saber rattling .
So let ’s try to forget the lazy assumption that Kim is simply unhinged .
( For what it ’s worth , at least one of the U.S. officials to have dealt directly with him , former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , has repeatedly insisted that " Kim is not a nut . " )
There ’s no question that the regime remains extremely dangerous to its own citizens — and potentially to the outside world as well , through proliferation or desperate acts of aggression .
And many experts warn that it ’s highly unlikely that Pyongyang will ever give up its nukes .
The nuclear program is the only national success story that Kim Jong
Il can really call his own , making it a key source of legitimacy at a time when his standing is weaker than ever .
But that does n’t mean that outside powers should take off the pressure .
Containing North Korea ’s threats to international security will continue to be a full - time job .

.- With thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter ’s Square for the Sunday Angelus , Pope Benedict XVI focused his address on Sunday ’s Mass reading from the Gospel of St. Mark .
While creation is “ destined to end , ” he said , Jesus ’ words are " eternal . "
On the second - to - last Sunday of the liturgical year , Pope Benedict expressed his thanks to God for another year in “ the great family of the Church ” almost complete : “ It is an inestimable gift , which permits us to live in history the mystery of Christ , welcoming in the paths of our personal and communal existence the seed of the Word of God , an eternal seed that from the inside transforms this world and opens it to the Kingdom of Heaven . ”
St. Mark , he added , today presents us a part of the discourse of Jesus on the end times :
“ In this discourse , there is a sentence that is striking for its clear synthesis : ‘ Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away . ’ ”
The expression “ Heaven and earth , ” Benedict XVI explained , appears frequently in the Bible to indicate all the universe , the entire cosmos .
“ Jesus , ” he added , “ declares that all that is destined to pass away , not only earth , but Heaven , which is included here in the cosmic sense , not as synonymous of God . ”
“ Sacred Scripture is unambiguous .
All creation is destined to end , including elements divinized by ancient mythology .
There is no confusion between creation and the Creator , but a clear difference . ”
“ With such clear distinction , Jesus affirms his words ‘ will not pass away , ’ which stand by the part of God and accordingly , are eternal , ” the Pope expounded .
“ Pronounced with the concreteness of his early existence , these are prophetic words par excellence , as Jesus affirms ( in the Gospel of St. John ) when he turns to the heavenly Father : ‘ the words you gave to me I have given to them , and they accepted them and truly understood that I came from you , and they have believed that you sent me . ’”
In a well - known parable in the Gospel of St. Matthew , Jesus compares himself to a sower and explains that the seed is the Word .
“ The ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit ” are part of the Kingdom of God , the Holy Father said .
“ That is , they live under his rule , remaining in the world , but no longer part of the world .
They bear in themselves … a principle of transformation that already now manifests itself in a good life , animated by love , and in the end , will produce the resurrection of the body .
Behold the power of the Word of God . ”
The Pontiff concluded by explaining that the Blessed Virgin Mary is the living sign of this truth : “ Her heart was “ good earth ” that welcomed with complete openness the Word of God , such that all her existence , transformed according to the image of the Son , was introduced to eternity , soul and body , anticipating the eternal vocation of each human being . ”
“ Now , in prayer , let us make our own her response to the Angel ‘ may it be done to me according to your word , ’ so that following Christ along the way of the cross , we too can reach the glory of the resurrection . ”

" I was reading away and it was a serious story , and I suddenly thought ' Oh my gosh , that seagull 's back again ' , because we had a bit of a problem last night , " Hitchener told a radio station afterwards .
Yet another month where the decline in consumer credit comes in worse than expected : Total Credit decline from $ 2,475 billion to $ 2,463 , with the bulk of the $ 12 billion decline consisting of Revolving Credit reduction , or $ 10 billion , to $ 900 billion .
Total consumer credit is now back to July 2007 levels ... and the decline has yet to decelerate .
This is the seventh straight month of consumer credit declines .

Advertisement Chinese meteorologists say they brought about Beijing 's earliest snowfall in a decade , after seeding rain clouds with silver iodide to ease a drought .
The Weather Modification Office sprayed clouds with 186 doses of the chemical to bring rain for the wheat crop , the Beijing Evening News said .
But the arrival of a cold front caused heavy snow to fall , disrupting road , rail and air travel .
Cloud seeding is often used in China in an attempt to bring on rain .
The country 's north is prone to droughts , while the south is often flooded .
In Anhui province , which has been having a drought since September , there was 4 cm ( 1.5 in ) of rainfall at the weekend .
Much of the country 's farming still relies on rainfall as many of its communities have a poor irrigation system .
HOW CLOUD SEEDING WORKS 1 .
Silver iodide is fired into cloud using flares on planes or from the ground 2 .
Water droplets then attach to these particles 3 .
They fall as snow if surface temperatures are below or near freezing , or as raindrops at warmer temperatures 4 .
Heat released as the droplets freeze boosts updrafts , which pull more moist air into the cloud Despite the use of the cloud seeding technique , many scientists remain sceptical of its effectiveness
In February , snow fell after the authorities seeded clouds over Beijing in an attempt to alleviate the dry conditions .
However , many scientists - particularly in the UK - remain highly sceptical of the effectiveness of cloud seeding .
Even if it is theoretically possible , one of the problems for proponents has been to demonstrate that a rainfall or snowfall was caused by the seeding or simply occurred spontaneously .
In addition to cloud seeding , the government is building a huge network of tunnels and waterways that will funnel water from the south to the north , but the project is still five years from completion .

As support for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wanes on Capitol Hill amid frustration with the Obama administration ’s handling of the economy , JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is emerging as a potential replacement .
Sources tell The Post that a number of policy makers have begun mentioning Dimon as a successor to Geithner , whose standing in Washington has suffered because of the country ’s high unemployment rate , the weakness of the dollar , the slow pace of the recovery and the government ’s mounting deficit .
Last week , Geithner faced a withering attack from some Republican members of the Joint Economic Committee , getting into a testy exchange with one congressman who at one point asked Geithner if he would step down .
Dimon , meanwhile , has achieved rock star status during the financial crisis , having navigated JPMorgan through the recession and being a go - to guy when Uncle Sam last year needed Wall Street ’s help during the collapses of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual .
Furthermore , while many bank chiefs are facing heat over outsize bonuses , Dimon has repeatedly made clear he wo n’t write fat checks to attract or keep talent .
People familiar with Dimon ’s thinking said he “ would love to serve his country , ” and in recent weeks Dimon has had a noticeably higher profile in Washington , making frequent visits to government officials and earlier this month publishing an op-ed in the Washington Post that makes the case for letting large institutions that take big risks collapse rather than receive government aid .
“ It is critical to the standing of the United States in the global financial economy to have a Treasury secretary who has the full support of the president and Congress ; a person who has earned respect on their own as a result of hard - won battles in finance to represent this nation , ” said Dick Bove , a banking industry analyst at Rochdale Securities who this week will publish a report on Dimon .
“ That is not Timothy Geithner .
It is Jamie Dimon . ”
The timing might be right for Dimon to pursue the Treasury post .
He recently put into place a succession plan , and JPMorgan is currently considered one of the strongest banks in the country , even though it , too , faces a threat of sizable consumer - loan losses .
However , sources said Dimon also has tried to tamp down enthusiasm for his replacing Geithner , whom the JPMorgan boss continues to support and thinks is doing “ a good job , ” according to sources .
He does n’t want to be perceived as gunning for Geithner ’s job and is said to be keenly aware of the anti-Wall Street sentiment gripping the country .
He has told people he plans to stay at JPMorgan for another “ six or seven years , ” according to one source .
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment .
Dimon has long been a big Democratic supporter , and his ties with Obama go back to when he ran Chicago - based Bank One .
In addition , White House visitor logs show Dimon has been a repeated guest there .
He also was a point man during the previous administration , rescuing Bear and WaMu .
This is n’t the first time Dimon ’s name has been floated for Treasury secretary .
He was considered a candidate last year and is still viewed as an executive who could be instrumental as Washington looks to overhaul the financial regulatory infrastructure .

\ ^ ^J ^ I h TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER J. 338024 V. * PREFACE
This volume is simply what its title indicates , " A Book about the English Bible . "
It has grown out of a series of lectures delivered to students in the University of Pennsylvania , the purpose of which was to give a brief account of the English Bible , its immediate sources and their contents , their literary background and surroundings , the forms and characteristics of the constituent books and their relation to each other .
To the chapters , in which these subjects are suggested , rather than discussed , have been added several others containing a short history of the translation of the Bibie into English , from Saxon times to our own day .
Attention is called to the differences between the commonly used English versions as regards contents and translation , and to the reasons for the differences .
It is hoped that the reader may be sufficiently in - terested by what is said in the various chapters , to de- sire to pursue the study further by means of other books such as those named in the appended Bibliography .
To my colleagues Dr. C. G. Child and Dr. J. A. Montgomery , of the University of Pennsylvania , and to Dr. F. C. Porter and Dr. E. H. Sncath , of Yale University , all of whom read the manuscript , or special portions of it , and to my brother Dr. James H. Penni - man who read the proof , I desire to express my gratitude for suggestions and corrections .
To Dr. Montgomery I am indebted also for his kind permission to print his translation of several of the poems of Isaiah .

Over the entrance to the Library of the University of Pennsylvania are the lines : — " O blessed letters that combine in one All ages past , and make one live with all .
By you we do commune with who are gone ,
And the dead - living unto counsel call , " Impressive words !
reminding the student who may chance to read them that in literature the world has a heritage with which no other of its possessions can compare in value , for by words , more than by any other form of expression , the mind and heart are re- vealed and the intellectual and spiritual treasure of the race preserved .
Through books we may know the mind of the past and transmit the mind of the present .
The greatest book is the Bible , and the reason for the place assigned to it is that it contains interpretations of human life , actual and ideal , which reveal man tb himself , in his joys and sorrows , his triumphs and his defeats , his aspirations and his possibilities , his rela - tions to other men , and , comprehending and enveloping all , his relations to God , Men may differ about what 2 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE the Bible is , but the fact remains that for centuries millions of men , of ail grades of intelligence and learning , have believed that the Bible speaks to them as no other book has ever spoken , and that what it says comes with an authority derived from God himself .
The primary spiritual problem of man is his relations to God .
Men , everywhere , recognize the existence of an intelligent power outside and higher than themselves that con- trols and regulates the universe .
The individual who doubts or denies the existence of God is exceptional , and his opinions are at variance with human belief and experience .
The Bible , concerned as it is in its component parts with the revelation of God to man , and the relation of man to God , has held the attention of men because it is true to the truths of life and sat- isfying to the yearnings of the human spirit .
Men have found it so , and there is an abiding faith that men will continue to find it so .
Beliefs concerning the Jehovah of the Old Testament , and the worship of Jehovah , existed long before any accounts of such beliefs and worship were ever written .
The writings we have are not the earliest .
Included in the Old Testament are portions of writings that long antedate any of the existing books as we have them , and that may properly be regarded as important sources of the books .
The teachings of Jesus were re- lated orally for some years before any part of the New Testament was written .
Reverence for the Bible is increased by a knowledge of the history of its transmission down the centuries , through many languages , and many versions , preserv- ing always its distinctive qualities unimpaired by the frailties of human copyists , and unchanged through the lapse of time .
THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES
The title - pages of the modern English versions of the Bible , with the exception of the Douay Bible , state that they are translations from the original tongues .
A copy of the latter states that it is " translated . . . out of the Authentical Latin . . . conferred with the Hebrew , Greeke and other Editions in divers lan- guages . "
The Old Testament is in Hebrew , with the exception of a few passages , which are in Aramaic , Ezra 4:8-6:18 ; 7:12 - 26 , Daniel l-^b- y.iS , Jeremiah 10:11 .
The New Testament is in Greek .
These are the original lan- guages .
The conquests of Alexander spread the knowl- edge of Greek in the East , and in cities like Alexandria , great and populous , were many Jews who adopted the language as their own .
In the time of Jesus the con- quests of Rome had brought Latin also into the East where it became the language of the government .
At the Crucifixion , the inscription placed on the cross was " in Hebrew and in Latin and in Greek . "
John 19 : 20 .
These three languages contain the immediate sources of our Bible .
The original language of the Old Testa - ment was Hebrew , but our oldest manuscripts con- taining it are in Greek , into which the Jewish Scrip - tures were translated .
Some of the Greek versions antedate by centuries our oldest Hebrew copies , which are the Petrograd Codex of the Prophets 916 A. d. and a manuscript of the entire Scriptures , also at Petrograd , and dating perhaps as early as 1009 a. d.
The Jewish Scriptures have come down to us with what is known as an " accepted text " as a result of the care of the Sopherim , who were the custodians of the sacred text until the sixth century , when it was taken 4 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE over by the Massorites , the work of the two groups of scholars being thus differentiated by Dr. C. D. Gins - burg : " The Sopherim . . . were the authorized revisers and redactors of the text according to certain principles , the Massorites were precluded from developing the principles and altering the text in harmony with these canons .
Their province was to safeguard the text delivered to them , by ' building a hedge around it , ' to protect it against alterations , or the adoption of any readings which still survived in man- uscripts or were exhibited in the ancient versions . " ^
The Jewish Scriptures , which the early Christian Church accepted as inspired , consisted of three sep- arate collections as follows : I , " The Law " ; Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuterqpomy ; 2 , " The Prophets " ; Joshua , Judges , I Satnuef , II Samuel , I Kings , II Kings , Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel , ( The Twelve ) , Hosea , Joel , Amos , Obadiah , Jonah , Micah , Nahum , Habakkuk , Zephaniah , Haggai , Zechariah , Malachi ; 3 , " The Writings " ; Psalms , Proverbs , Job , Song of Songs , Ruth , Lamentations , Ecclesiastes , Esther , Daniel , Ezra , Nehemiah , I Chronicles , II Chronicles .
It will be seen that the order in which the books are placed in the English Bible is not that of the Hebrew Scriptures .
The latter vary slightly in the order of the books in " The Prophets " and " The Writ - ings , " but no book of one collection is ever placed in another .
The three collections are each definite in text and in contents .
" The Prophets " are subdivided into the " Former , " Joshua , Judges , I Samuel , II Samuel , I Kings , II Kings , and the " Latter , " Isaiah - Malachi .
The " Latter " are divided by length of books into " The ' C. D. Ginsburg , Iniroditction to the Hibrrw BibU , London , 1B97 , p. ^^l .
THE 90URCE3 OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE Major , " Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel , ' and " The Twelve " or " The Minor , " Hosea - Malachi .
Included in " The Writings " is a group known as the " Five Rolls " or " Megilloth , " the Song of Songs , Ruth , Lamentations , Ecclesiastes , and Esther , which were and are read in the synagogues at the celebration of the Passover , Pentecost , 9th of Ab ( destruction of Jerusalem ) , Tab - ernacles , Purim , respectively .
There are two distinct series of historical books in the Old Testament , one of which consists of Genesis — II Kings , * inclusive , that is , from Creation to the release of Jehoiachin from Babylon 562 B , c. ; the other is I Chronicles — Nehemlah , inclu- sive .
This begins with Adam , I Chronicles l:i , and closes with the second visit of Nehemiah to Jerusalem , 432 B. c. The Hebrew Scriptures ended with II Chron - icles and this will explain the reference in Matthew 23:35 , " al ! the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of Abel ( Genesis 4:8 ) .. . unto the blood of Zachariah , son of Barachiah , " ( II Chronicles 24:20 , al- though he is there called the son of Jehoiada^ ) .
The dividing , into two books each , of Samuel , Kings , 1 Daniel is in " The Writings " >n the Hebrew St^rlptures , not in " The Prophets . "
' Except Ruth , which , because of its openinH reference to the Judges , was pUced in the Septuagint , and consequently in the Latin and Enghsh versions , immediately after Judges .
' There are many such apparent discrepancies in the Bible .
In Eira 5:1 , Zechariah is called " the son of Iddo " ; in Zechariah 1:1 , " the son of Bere - chiah , " " the son of Iddo . "
Similarly Zerubbabel is in I Chronicles 3:19 the son of Pedaiah ; in Ezra j-.x , Nehemiah 12:1 , and Haggai i:t he Is the sonof Shealdel . "
Salah ( Shdah ) isin Genesis ll:lz , theson of Arpachshad , and in Lulte 3:55 - 36 , the son of Cainan , son of Arphaxad .
There are twenty seven differences between the two lists of names given in Ezra 2:z - 6o , and Nehemiah 7:7-62 .
These and other discrepancies are usually easily ex- plained .
In Matthew 27:5 , we are told that Judas " hanged himself , " ' ' in Acts I :lS , we read of him " and falling headlong , he burst asunder midst , and all his bowels gushed out . "
One statement does not exclude the isibility of the other .
He may have hanged himself on some high pti which he afterwards fell .
^^■ftwn I ( the wc 6 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE Ezra - Nehemiah and Chronicles , which Jerome called " double books , " and the counting of the " Minor Prophets " as twelve , where the Jews counted them as one book , causes our Old Testament to include as thirty - nine the books , which in the Hebrew Scriptures were counted as twenty - four .
Among Jewish scholars were differences of opinion as to the inclusion of Esther , Ecclesiastes , the Song of Songs , Ezra and Chronicles , but as a result of the Rabbinical Councils at Jamnia about 90 A , D. and 118 a. d. the third collection of the Hebrew , as we have it , was finally decided upon , There is reason for believing that the Scriptures of the Palestinian Jews were complete as early as the time of Judas Maccabffius , although among different sects such as the Pharisees , Sadducees , Essenes and Zealots , were differences of opinion concerning the books , which continued until the Councils of Jamnia .
The threefold coliection is thought to be referred to in the Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus , the son of Sirach : — " My grandfather Jesus , . . . having much given himself to the reading of the law , and the prophets , and other books of our fathers , etc , " In the time of Jesus the Son of Sirach , the Hebrew Scriptures were accessible in Greek .
About that time , in the persecution by Antiochus , " sacred books " of the Jews were burnt and possessors of a copy of the book of the Covenant were put to death .
When the Hebrew collections were made we do not know .
The book of the law was fundamental and there was doubtless some written form of the law very early .
In Joshua 8:32 - 35 , a book closely associated with Deuteronomy , we are told that Joshua read " all the words of the law . , . written in the book of the THE SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE / law " and also that he wrote upon " stones a copy of the law of Moses . "
According to an ancient tradition the inscriptions here mentioned were in all the languages of the world .
Jehoshaphat appointed men to teach the law to the people , II Chronicles 17:7 - 9 , and Ezra read to the people from the book of the law of Moses , Nehemiah 13:1 .
In the reign of Josiah a copy of the [ law was found by Hilkiah the priest , II Chronicles [ 34:14 .
This book , so often referred to , was not our ■.
Pentateuch , as we have it , but it seems certain that ■ our Pentateuch includes a large part , if not all of what in these passages called " the law of Moses . "
It is probable that the following statement has reference to the preservation of the collections which now constitute the Old Testament : — " And the same things were related both in the public archives and in the records that concern Nehemiah ; and how he , founding a library , gathered together the books about the kings and prophets , and the books of David , and letters of kings about sacred gifts .
And in like manner Judas also gathered together for us all those writings that had been scattered by reason of the war that befell , and they are still with us . "
II Maccabees 2:13 - 14 , There is an old story that the Hebrew Sacred Books were lost during the Babylonian captivity , 605 to 536 B. c , and that their preservation is due to Ezra .
In the Fourth Book of Esdras ( II Esdras of the Apocry - pha ) , which dates probably from about loo a. d. , is a passage , 14:23 - 48 , in which it is stated that Ezra , from memory , with the aid of five skillful scribes pro- duced in a forty - day period " ninety - four " ( Syr. Eth. Arab , Arm. versions , reading " two hundred and four , " , Latin copies varying ) books , of which twenty - four L of the ^ ^H^ words : 8 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE ( the Hebrew Scriptures ? ) were to be published openly and the remaining " seventy " kept for " such as be wise among the people . "
This story is connected with another tradition , equally without foundation in fact , that Ezra and a group of learned men known as the " Great Synagogue " or " Assembly , " connected with the second Temple , after the return from Babylon , collected and edited the Hebrew Sacred Scriptures , During the third century b. c. we find the Hebrew " Law " being translated into Greek , a language into which all the Scriptures were put , forming ultimately what became known as the Septuagint , or Greek Old Testament .
The Hebrew collections are referred to in the New Testament in a number of passages , such as Matthew 7:12 , " this is the law and the prophets " ; Luke 16:31 , " If they hear not Moses and the prophets . "
" Psalms " in the following passage may refer simply to the book of Psalms or to the third collection , called by the name of the book which 'is usually placed first in it ; at all events the three collections were evidently in mind when the words were spoken : — " All things must needs be fulfilled , which are in the law of Moses , and the prophets , and the psalms con- cerning me . "
Luke 24 m .
Upon the restoration of the Jewish State , as related in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah , it was necessary that the people should become familiar with the an- cient law of Moses .
There was , however , a difficulty , the Hebrew of the law was not the spoken language of the people .
This is probably the meaning of the words : J p THE SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE " And they read in the book , in the law of God , distinctly ( margin ' with an interpretation ' ) ; and they gave the sense , | so that they understood the reading . "
Nehemiah 8:8 .
" The Rabbis perceived in this activity of the first I generation of the Sopherim the origin of the Aramaic | translation known as the Targum , first made orally , and afterwards committed to writing , which was neces - sitated by the fact that Israel had forgotten the sacred language , and spoke the idiom current in a large part of western Asia .
All this , however , is veiled in obscurity as is the whole inner history of the Jews during the Persian rule , " ^ The Aramaic Targum is of importance because , as Dr. Margolis says : — " . . , it enables us to gain an insight into the Interpretation of the Scriptures at a time when tradition had not yet wholly died out . "
"
The Baby - lonian Targum of Onkelos contained the Pentateuch , as did also the Palestinian Targum of Jerusalem , Of the " Prophets " there is a Babylonian Targum and fragments of a Palestinian .
The Targum of the " Writ- ings " is Palestinian , There are other Targums which differ somewhat from each other in being freer , or more literal , in their translation of the Hebrew text .
THE SEPTUAGINT
It was but natural that books held in such reverence by the Jews should become known to others , and a Greek translation of the Scriptures was sure to be made .
Special reasons for it existed at Alexandria , that being a great center of Greek learning and the seat of a famous ' Preface to Tks Holy Scriplurts , x new translation , The Jewish Publica - tion Society of America , 1917 . • M. L. MarEolis , Thi Slory of Bible Translaliom , Philadelphia .

A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE library .
There had been Jews in Egypt for centuries before the time of Alexander , who , when he founded Alexandria { 332 B. c ) , recognized the loyalty and courage of a race , representatives of which had fought in his armies , by setting apart in the new city a special place for Jewish colonists , whom he admitted to full citizenship . '
They were allowed to transform an Egyptian temple at Lcontopolis into a replica of the Temple at Jerusalem , and to celebrate Jewish rites there until the coming of the Romans ended this .
An idea of the wide dispersion of the Jews and also of their loyalty to their religion and to Jerusalem its center , is given in the opening of the second chapter of Acts .
The Greek version of the Scriptures was in circulation in the time of Jesus .
A story of how this version came into existence is told in an ancient letter of Aristeas to Philocrates .
This letter was quoted by the Alexandrian writers Aristobulus and Philo , and by Josephus , the historian of the Jews ,
We know , therefore , that the letter was in existence as early as the first century of the Christian era , Aristeas says that the Greek transla - tion of the Pentateuch was made by order of Ptolemy Philadelphus ( 285-246 b. c. ) at the suggestion of Demetrius Phalereus , librarian of the royal library at Alexandria .
An embassy was sent to Eleazar the High Priest , at Jerusalem , with the request that he send to Alexandria , with a copy of the Hebrew Law , six elders , from each of the twelve tribes of Israel , to make a translation for the royal library .
Philo states that the anniversary of the completion of the translation was celebrated yearly .
This story , while for many reasons in Gfteh , Cambridge , igoo , I iny reasons j 1900 , Introduc - i » THE SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE of doubtful accuracy and authenticity , is quoted by early Christian writers as authority .
An interesting variant of the story makes the number of translators seventy , instead of seventy - two , and states that they worked independently , each in a separate cell , and that when they compared their work , on its completion , every copy agreed , verbatim et literatim , with the others .
The Talmud gives the story of the seventy - two trans - lators , but speaks also of another tradition which attributed the Greek version of the Law to five elders .
What we are sure of is that a translation of the Old Testament into Greek was made , beginning probably with the Pentateuch , about the time of Philadelphus , and completed in later years , by different hands .
This Greek version came to be known as the " Septua - gint " ( Latin , Septuaginta ) commonly written LXX , and is referred to in ancient Greek manuscripts as the version " according to the Seventy . "
Jerome , whose name is associated with the Latin version of the Bible , doubts the story of the cells and says : — ' " Nescio quls primus auctor LXX cellulas Alexandrise mendacio suo exstruxerit , etc , " In Book II of his Apology for Himself against the books of Rufinus , 402 a. d. , ^ Jerome mentions the important differences in text between different Greek versions of the Old Testament and differences between the Greek versions and the Hebrew text .
We are con- cerned with the Septuagint , in this volume , only so far as it contributes one of the early sources of our text of the Old Testament , for the most ancient texts of it ithat we possess are in Greek .
The Old Testament of 'le early Christian Church was in Greek , not in Hebrew , I , New York , 1893 , Vol. Ill , pp. 516-17 .
12 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE and quotations in the New Testament are from the Greek , version .
Of Greek manuscripts the most important are :—
The Codex Vaticanus , brought to Rome in 1448 and believed to have been copied in Egypt in the fourth century .
The Codex Sinaiticus , of the fourth century , found in 1844 - 1859 in the Convent of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai , and now In the Imperial Library in Petrograd .
The Codex Alexandrinus sent in i6z8 by the Patriarch of Constantinople to Charles I as a gift .
It was prob - ably made at Alexandria in the fifth century and since 1753 has been in the British Museum .
Each of these three contains almost the whole Bible and Apocrypha .
The Ephraem manuscript , now in the National Li- brary in Paris , belongs also probably to the fifth century .
It is a bundle of fragments representing about three - fifths of the original manuscript .
The Manuscript of Beza , so called because once owned by that scholar , was presented by him to the University of Cambridge in 1581 .
It is generally re- ferred to the sixth century .
It contains the Gospels and Acts and is remarkable as being the earliest to contain John 7:53 - 8:11 .
These manuscripts and the hundreds of others , of different dates , and of a more or less fragmentary char - acter , are the oldest versions we have of any parts of the Bible either Old Testament or New .
The discovery of additional manuscripts often throws light on the text , and It will be noticed that most important man- uscripts have come to our knowledge since the comple - tion of the King James Version In l6ll .
In addition to the Hebrew and Greek sources of the text of the THE SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE 13 u ^^ Th Bible , we have also manuscripts , of various ages , of a fifth century Armenian translation of the whole Bible , fragments of a Gothic version made by Wulfilas in the fourth century , of several different Egyptian ( Coptic ) versions of parts of the Bible , of an Ethiopic version and of a Syriac version .
All of these , as well as early quotations from the Bible , are important as indicating ■what the contents and text were regarded as being , for the manuscripts differ in text , and do not ail contain the same books .
There are important differences , the Syriac Peshitto version , for example , omitting the Apocrypha entirely .
The name Apocrypha meaning " hidden " or " secret , " had been applied to the books of certain sects .
It was used by Jerome of a number of books which had been included in the Greek version .
Of these , some were originally in Greek , while others were a Greek translation of Hebrew or Aramaic writings .
The original Hebrew of the Wisdom of Jesus Son of Sirach was found in a Cairo manuscript now in the Cam - bridge University Library .
None of the books of the Apocrypha was ever included by the Jews among their Scriptures .
THE LATIN VERSIONS
Just as the conquests of Alexander and the spread of Greek language and learning throughout the East re- sulted in a Greek version of the Old Testament , so the Roman conquests spread the Latin language , and of course a Latin version of both Old Testament and New was inevitable .
Christianity spread through the preaching of the Apostles , and this fact made even more important the Greek versions , and made necessary the Latin .
The oldest Latin version , which was known to j_J A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE Tertullian , Cyprian , Augustine , Jerome , and others of the Fathers , was probably made in the second century from the Septuagint , and there appear to have been different varieties of the text .
Augustine com- mends the Itala , and there were also an African and some European versions .
The oldest form of the Latin version is in the opinion of critics the African .
Por - tions of the Old Latin versions are still in existence in about forty manuscripts .
It was the lack of uniformity in the early Latin versions that led Damasus , Bishop , of Rome , to commission Jerome , a Dalmatian , to pre- pare a Latin translation of the Psalms and Gospels .
He finished this work and the New Testament on the basis of Greek texts .
A short time later Jerome revised his Psalter on the basisof Orlgcn 's work .
Origen ( 184 - 254 A. D. ) endeavored to produce an accurate Greek text of the Old Testament , and edited a Tetrapla , or four - text , and later a Hexapla , or six - text work , of which all that remains are fragments quoted in the Church Fathers , and a fragment of some of the Psalms , the latter found in the Ambrosian Library in 1896 .
In the same library were found also , in 1874 , a copy of a Syriac translation of the Septuagint text of the Hexapla made in 616 A. d. Origen arranged in col- umns , I , the Hebrew text , 2 , the Hebrew text in Greek characters , 3 , 4 , and 5 , versions of Aquila , Sym - machus , and Theodotion , 6 , a revised Septuagint text .
Origen worked on the New Testament as well , endeavoring to fix a canon .
He and Jerome were the two great textual critics of the early Church .
Jerome was not content to translate from Greek , but went to live at Bethlehem , where , for fifteen years ( 390-405 A. D. ) , he devoted himself to the study of Hebrew , and the translation of the Old Testament from THE SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE IS Hebrew into Latin .
At the request of several bishops , he translated also the books of Judith and Tobit , which a friend of his translated from Aramaic into Hebrew for him .
He then translated the Hebrew version , though he regarded as canonical only the ancient Hebrew books .
The oldest Latin versions were made from the Greek and included the Apocrypha , books rejected by the Jews , but received , with differences of opinion , by the Church .
Their inclusion was , against the opinion of Jerome , and owing to the influence of Augustine , decided upon by the Synods of Hippo 393 A , D. and Carthage 397 a. d ,
It is interesting to note that in Latin Bibles until 1566 the Old Latin translation of the Psalms revised by Jerome and known as the Roman Psalter was re- tained , the second revision of Jerome , known as the Galiican Psalter , replacing it in that year .
Jerome 's third and later translation directly from Hebrew never came into general use .
This retention of an older version of the Psalms is similar to the continued use of the Bishops ' version to - day in the Book of Common Prayer .
The Council of Trent , at its fourth session 1546 , decreed that the Vulgate , Jerome 's Latin version , was the Authentic Bible of the Roman Catholic Church .
This contains the books of the Apocrypha ( except the Prayer of Manasses and I and H Esdras ) , among the other books .
The books of the Apocrypha , included in the Vulgate , and therefore in the Rheims - Douay Ver - sion , are sometimes distinguished from the canonical Hebrew Scriptures by the title " deutero - canonical " ' '
The same term has been applied to cercainNew Testament boob which wne accepted as canonical only after long discussion , hence another title " Antileaomcna , " by which they were known .
The books are Hebrews , James , Jude , II Peter , 11 and III John and Revelation .
i - 1 ^ i6 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE meaning that they arc a supplement to the Hebrew canon .
Protestant opinion concerning the Apocrypha ranges from the rejection of it as uninspired and the consequent exclusion of it from the Bible , to the view expressed in Article of Religion VI of the Church of England , which is as follows :—
" And the other books ( as Hierome saith ) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners ; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine ; such are these following : The Third , [ First ] Book of Esdras , The Fourth [ Second ] Book of Esdras , The Book of Tobias , The Book of Judith , The rest of the Book of Esther , The Book of Wisdom , Jesus the Son of Sirack , Baruck the Prophet , The Song of the Three Children , The Story of Susanna , Of Bel and the Dragon , The Prayer of Manasses , The First Book of Maccabees , The , Second Book of Maccabees . "
In the Larger Catechism of the Russian Greek Church , 1839 , the Apocrypha is not included among canonical books , because " they do not exist in Hebrew . "
After the Reformation , Protestants did not regard these books as inspired , but did regard them as val - uable for their teachings , and they were therefore commonly printed in Protestant English versions , fol - lowing the example of Luther 's version 1534 in a collection by themselves , between the Old Testament and the New , but for many years they have usually not been printed in English Protestant versions .
The omission of the Apocrypha dates from 1826 and is the result of a controversy in the British and Foreign Bible Society , some members of which objected to circulating with the canonical books others which were not regarded as inspired . '
We find , therefore , a difference , as to > See The Book and Its Slory , on the occasion of the Jubilee of the BritiA and Foreign Bible Society , 1834 , p. 319 .
THE SOURCES OF THE ENGLISH BIBLl 17 lxx ) ks and 1 ' books , between the Vulgate , and translations of it , used by Roman Catholics , and the Bible as commoniy accepted by Protestants .
The oldest Christian list of the books of the Old Testament is that of Melito , Bishop of Sardis 170 a. d. , which omits the Apocrypha and also Esther .
There were , of course , many versions and variants of the Latin Bible , and it became necessary for the Roman Catholic Church to fix upon a text that should be standard .
A particular edition of the Vulgate was designated and , after that of Pope Sixtus V , 1590 , had been found unsatisfactory , one issued by Clement VIII was , by Papal Bull of 1592 , declared to be Authentic .
I No word of it is permitted to be altered .
The action ! of the Council of Trent in 1546 in regard to the Vulgate , was reaffirmed by the Ecumenical Council of the Vatican in 1870 .
In the spring of 1907 announcement was made that Pius X had determined upon a critical revision of the Latin Bible .
This work is being done by a Commission under the leadership of Father Gas - quet , who are at work studying and collating man- uscripts for the purpose of creating a text that shall be superior to that of the Clementine edition of 1592 . ^
With regard to the canon of The New Testament there is no difference between the versions .
Here there was no collection of ancient writings to be adopted , whole , or with exceptions or additions , by the early Christian Church .
By a gradual process of acceptance and approval the New Testament came into existence as the authoritative fundamental book of Christianity .
Of the twenty - seven books , which it contains , a few ' were accepted finally only after long discussion .
Books , , which for a time were read in churches , but which e the article " Vulgate , the Revision of , " in Thi Catholic Encyclopedia .
A- i l8 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE were never regarded as inspired , were the Clementine Epistles , the Epistle of Barnabas , and the Shepherd of Hermas .
There exist also other boobs such as the Apocalypse of Peter , Epistle to the Laodiceans , Acts of Paul , and many so - called Gospels .
Of the various early lists of writings permitted to be read in churches that of Athanasias d. 373 is the earliest to include the present twenty - seven books of the New Testament .
In his Easter Pastoral Letter in 365 A. D. , Athanaslus gave a complete list of the Old Testament books , placing the Apocrypha in a separate classification , and naming the books of the New Tes- tament as we have it .
Other early lists vary in regard to Hebrews , James , Jude , II Peter , II and III John , and Revelation , which have been mentioned ' as the " Antilegomena , " or books " spoken against . "
The Hebrew Scriptures , the Greek and Latin ver- sions of them , the New Testament in Greek , and in Latin , these underlie the English versions of the Bible , ■ which differ in contents , or in arrangement of contents , according to the texts from which they have been de- rived .
The order of the books of the Old Testament in English versions , except the Jewish , which retains the ancient Hebrew groupings , is due to the Greek and Latin translations , as are also the names of the books .
In the following lists the contents of the Revised Ver - sion which represents the Protestant view of the Old Testament canon , are placed parallel to the contents of the Rheims - Douay Version , which , following the Vulgate , represents the canon as accepted by the Roman Catholic Church , So long as the books were on separate rolls of parchment the order was unim - ' Above , p.

When the books were put into a volume the order became nec- essarily fixed .
It must always be remembered that the Bible as known and read in Western Europe until the time of the Reformation was the Vulgate , or Jerome 's Latin version .
It was from the Vulgate , Exodus 34:29 , for example , that Michelangelo derived his authority for placing horns on the head of his statue of Moses .
The Vulgate was back of the literature and art of Western Europe from the time that Christianity became the pre- vailing religion .

In the New Testament we have quotations from thirty books of the Hebrew canon , but no quotation , as such , from any of the books of the Apocrypha , al- though there are many passages , which will be dis - cussed in another connection , which indicate that the New Testament writers were familiar with some of the books of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha . ^

CHAPTER II THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT Back of the Old Testament was an extensive liter - ature , the product of high culture .
The Old Testament historical writings cover , in de- tail at some places , and in broad outline at others , the history of Jehovah 's dealings with the descendants of Abraham , at first as the patriarchs , then as the tribes , and later as the kingdoms of Israel and Judah .
Creation , the Fall , the Flood , the Dispersion , the build - ing of cities , the confusion of tongues — these occupy the first eleven chapters of Genesis .
The twelfth chapter records the call of Abraham , an event which occurred about twenty - two centuries before the Chris - tian era .
In addition to history , are the laws governing the religious ceremonies and social organization of the Jews , and there are also examples of various kinds of poetry , of wisdom literature , of stories of remarkable people and events , and the utterances of the prophets with their messages directly from Jehovah himself .
Probably the most interesting and important result of the work of the archseologists in their researches in the Orient has been in the reconstruction of much of the background of the Old Testament writings .
The gen - eral reader no longer regards the ancient Hebrew Scrip - tures as shrouded in mystery as to their sources , and as representing ages in which the life of man was lived in a manner unlike that of any other time .
The Tell el Amama tablets , discovered in 1 887 , some of which THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 23 contain correspondence between Egypt and Palestine of about the time of Moses , indirectly throw light on the story of Joseph , for example , by indicating that r close relations existed between the two countries , in - Ivolving , probably , frequent communication by means F of just such commercial caravans as that which passed ' along the ancient road and purchased Joseph as a slave from his conspiring brothers .
The Code of Hammurabi , discovered in 1901 on a stone column at Susa , throws a flood of light on the Law of Moses_ as given in the Pentateuch .
Hammurabi has been identified with Amraphel , King of Shinar , Genesis , : 14:1 , thus making him contemporary with Abraham .
As Professor Driver says : — " The civilization , including the history , the institutions , the art , and the society ' of ancient Babylonia and Assyria , is now known to us in many respects more completely than that of ancient Egypt .
Mr. Leonard King 's Letters and Inscriptions of Hammurabi , King of Babylon in the twenty - second century B. c , contains almost as vivid a picture of life and character as do the Life and Letters of some states - 1 or prelate deceased among ourselves a few years | » go . " '
The Code , elaborate in its details , which specify offenses and punishments , resembles in many ways the contents of Leviticus and shows that the Law of Moses was for the Jews a Code such as other peoples possessed in even earlier times .
Inscriptions have been found containing records of Kings mentioned in Genesis , ch. 14 , once pronounced , by some confident I critics , mere " etymological inventions of imaginary rcharacters , " and it has been proved by these independ - JJ 24 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH B13LE ent sources of informatioQ that the story of the Etam - itic invasion , told in Genesis , is not myth but veritable history . '
Concerning the relation of archeology to the Bible , in matters about which there has been discussion by the critics , we may repeat here what Professor Driver says : — " The fact is , while archeology has frequently corroborated Biblical statements , of the truth of which critics never doubted , such as Shishak 's invasion of Judah , the existence of such Kings as Omri , Ahab , Jehu and Sargon , and Sennacherib 's invasion of Judah , it has overthrown no conclusion , at variance with tradition , which has met with the general acceptance of critics . " ^
Archeological discoveries have brought to us a considerable amount of literature similar
In contents and form to parts of the Old Testament and revealing to us much concerning the life and thoughts of men in the ancient world .
In Professor Petrie 's Egyptian Tales are many old stories , one of which .
The Tale of the Two Brothers , is similar in several ways to the story of Joseph and Potiphar 's wife . '
Genesis , ch. 39 .
A tablet in ancient Sumerian , now in the Yale Univer - sity collection and translated by Dr. A. T. Clay , throws light on the parable of the Prodigal Son .
The tablet contains the oldest laws known , antedating by hundreds of years even the Code of Hammurabi , The laws of inheritance were of great importance , as we know from the Old Testament , Numbers 27:1 - 11 , 36:1- 10 , and are given at length in the Code of Hammurabi , This * G. A. Bannn , Jrchaohgy and ike Bible , Philadelphia , 1916 , is » re- liable source of information on ihls and similar lubjecls .

THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 2 $ older Sumerian Code shows , as Dr. Clay says , that the parable has a legal aspect not " surmised by the com- mentarians . "
The law concerning inheritance reads : — " If a son say unto his father and his mother , [ thou art ] not my father , not my mother ; from the house , field , planta - tion , servants , property , animals he shall go forth , and his portion to its full amount he [ the father ] shall give him .
His father and his mother shall say to him ' not our son . '
From the neighborhood of the house he shall go , " The Prodigal Son received his share , and then went to a far country , in accordance with the law , and not as the result of an importunate demand on an indulgent father .
" It heightens the contrast between the father , who , on the one hand , complied with what the law permitted the son to demand ; and , on the other hand , the forgiving father , who rejoiced over his return , not as a legal heir , but as a son . " ^
Another ancient in - scription on clay , in the Yale collection , which dates earlier than 2000 b , c , is a dialogue , the earliest example known , between a father and his son .
Tab - lets concerning dreams and their interpretations have also been found , which are of great interest in connec - tion with the many dreams of which the Bible con- tains accounts .
The Babylonian epic of Creation has been known since 1872 , when George Smith of the British Museum deciphered tablets telling of the Flood , and it is easily accessible in translated form . ^
Since then a num- ber of additional inscriptions containing Creation and Eden stories have rewarded the work of the archsolog^sts .
The excavations of the University of 26 BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE Pennsylvania on the site of Nippur brought to light many tablets , on some of which are accounts of Creation , Paradise and the Deluge , which have been published , the most recently deciphered inscription being presented by Dr. Barton , who says of it , and of the other tablets found at Nippur : — " This tablet , together with those discovered by Poebcl and Lang - don . . . proves that at Nippur there existed in the third millennium b , c. a cycle of creation myths . " '
These , and many more things which help us to under - stand the Bible , have become known from the dis - covery and reading of inscriptions , which have been preserved in clay and stone for thousands of years , and ; which antedate , not only any existing copies of the Biblical writings , but antedate also by many centuries the most ancient of those writings .
The Babylonian I narratives of Creation , and the Flood are older than '. the Hebrew , and show the existence of those stories in literary form in the East , probably before any such book as Genesis ever contained the record of them .
There is also a Babylonian story ^ similar to that of Job .
From many examples of ancient literature , preserved .
on the tablets dug in recent years from the ruins of j ancient cities , in the plains of Babylonia , and elsewhere , ' we know that , long before the time of Abraham , the world had reached a high state of development in all that concerned the organization and government of society , and that the human soul was finding expression in art and literature .
Not rude , barbarous , uncivilized '" Material concerning Creation and Paradise . "

Barton 's Arduzalo^y and ike BibU , pp. 392-297 , and is discussed at length by Professor Morns Jas - trow in the Journal of Biblical Literature , vol. ij , pp. 135-191 , " A Babylo - nian Parallel to the Story of Job . "
THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 27 ^ and undeveloped were the people from whom came the Old Testament writings , and this Is shown clearly , not only by the remains of Babylonia and Egypt , whether in inscriptions , in examples of sculpture and design , in magnificent structures like the Pyramids or Sphinx , or superb ruins like the temples , of Egypt and the palaces of the Pharaohs , but it Is shown also by what i^the Old Testament writings tell us concerning them - Ives .
The form in which we have these ancient Hebrevy books is almost certainly , in many cases , not that in which they first appeared in writing , for they have come to us through the work of many editors and copyists in the intervening centuries .
We may not be certain that they are contemporary accounts of the events of which they tell , but we do know that what we have has been preserved by the reverent efforts of men who regarded these writings as inspired by God , and there - fore holy and authoritative , and as containing the history of God 's dealings with his chosen people , and the utterances of great men , through whom the word of God was communicated .
That the past should never be forgotten and that the history of Israel and its prophets should be preserved ,
Is the meaning of the words : —
" We have heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
I
We will not hide them from their children , telling to the 1 generation to come the praises of Jehovah , and his strength , 1 and his wondrous works that he hath done . "
Psalm 78:3 , 4 . That special care was taken to preserve writings is shown in Exodus 17:14 , where Jehovah tells Moses to " write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in : ears of Joshua " ; and in : — [ 8 A BOOK ABOtJT THE ENGLISH BIBLE " Take thee again another roU , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which Jehoiakim , the king of Judah hath burned . "
Jeremiah 36:28 .
That writings were collected in later times and pro- tected against loss is indicated by the following state - ment , in which what was evidently a literary commis- j sion of King Hezekiah is mentioned in connection with 9l supplementary collection of proverbs : —
" These also are proverbs of Solomon , which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out . "
Proverbs 25:1 .
Added to this collection are Proverbs ch. 30 , The Words of Agur and ch. 31 , The Words of King Lemuel .
This note about Hezekiah , who was himself a poet ( see Isaiah 38:9 ) , is of great interest because of what it sug - gests concerning a library at Jerusalem and a trained group of copyists such as were the scribes in Nineveh .
Professor
Sayce thinks that there must have been a royal library at Jerusalem in the time of Hezekiah , and says : —
" The vassalage of Judah to the king of Assyria in the reign of Ahaz had necessarily led to the introduction of Assyrian culture into Jerusalem .
Ahaz himself had led the way .
In the court of the palace he had erected a sundial , a copy of the gnomons , which had been used for centuries in the civilized kingdoms of the Euphrates and the Tigris .
But the erection of the sundial was not the only sign of Assyrian influence .
The most striking feature of Assyrian and Baby - lonian culture was the libraries , where scribes were kept constantly employed , not only in writing and compiling new books , but in copying and reediting older ones .
The ' men of Hezekiah ' who ' copied out ' the proverbs of Solomon per- I UUUK.a , UUL III I. ^^^ Hezekiah ' wh( THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT formed duties exactly similar to the royal scribes in Nin- eveh . " ^
Hezeklah is credited with having done much to re- store and preserve the customs of the past .
We are told , II Kings , chs. 18 - 20 , and II Chronicles , chs. 29 - 32 , that he destroyed the brazen serpent , which Moses had made , and which the people worshipped , restored the laws of Moses , the services of the Temple , the observance of the Passover , and " commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David and Asaph the seer . "
He likewise believed in civic improvements and " made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city . "
II Kings 20:20 .
We see in these references evidence that litera- ture was preserved , i , by oral transmission , 2 , by care on the part of authors and scribes , and 3 , by special care
In collecting on the part of authorities and com- missions like those of Hezekiah .
We now come to what is one of the most interesting facts concerning ancient Hebrew literature and that is , that what we know as the Old Testament , which is com- posed of the three sacred collections of the Jews , the Law , the Prophets , and the Writings , is , with a few exceptions , all that has come down to us of what we know , indirectly , from the literary qualities of the ex- tant books , and from evident quotations , and directly , from the names of other books referred to in the Old Testament , must have been a highly developed and diversified literature .
The oldest Hebrew inscriptions found are those on the Moabite Stone , found in 1868 , and the Siloam inscription , found in 1880 , The former is now in the Louvre and dates from the time of Ahab , ' The Higher Criticism and the Verdict of the Monumeals , 4th edicion , London , 1894 , pp. 475 , 476 . 30 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGUSH BIBLE About 850 B. c.
It is Mesha 's account of a revolt men- tioned in II Kings 3 4 , 5 .
The inscription which is quite long contains much of the deepest interest to students of the language and the contents of the Old Testament .
The Siloam inscription , found in 1880 on the wall of a tunnel connecting the Pool of Siloam with the Virgin 's Well at Jerusalem , is now in the Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople .
It is believed to date from the time of Hezekiah , 700 e. c. who built a conduit .
The inscription records the completing of such a con- duit drilled through the rock . '
In Numbers 21:27 - 30 , we have a quotation from an old collection of proverbs that had been preserved orally or in writing .
Evident quotations , either from oral transmission or from earlier writings , are the Song of the Sword , Genesis 4:23 , 24 , and the Song of the Well , Numbers 21:17 - 18 , and such poetical passages as the words of Isaac to Jacob , Genesis , 27 : 27- 29 , 39 - 40 .
It is probable that such passages as the Blessing of Jacob , Genesis , ch. 49 and the Song by the Sea , Exodus , ch. 15 , the Song of Deborah , Judges , ch. 5 , and others , were preserved in books from which the writers of our present books took them .
That was the way in which the present book of Psalms was formed .
Poems were selected from earlier collections in which they had been preserved .
Two books , which were themselves collections of writings , are mentioned as sources , one is the Book of the Wars of Jehovah , quoted in Numbers 21:14 , the other is the Book of Jasher which is referred to twice , in Joshua 10:13 , ^^ ^he source of Joshua 's ad- dress to the sun and moon , and in II Samuel r:r8 , as be round in Archaoiagy and ike BibU , THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 31 ¥ : hc source of ihc Song of the Bow , or David 's Lament over Saul and Jonathan .
Except for these quotations , the two collections are lost .
Existing books to which the title Book of Jasher is given are , one of them , a collection of legends and stories based on the Old Testament , and dating from the 12th century , the other an l8th century forgery .
That there was a collection of psalms attributed to , saph is indicated by the existence In Psalms of such poems , evidently taken from an earlier collection .
In I Chronicles 16:7 , David gives thanks unto Jehovah , " by the hand of Asaph and his brethren , " biit the psalm then sung , made up of Psalms 105:1 - 15 , 96:1- 13 , 106:1 , and 106:47 - 48 , is not stated to have been by him , the passages referred to , in the Psalter , being all of them anonymous .
There were doubtless other collec- tions of poetry in which were preserved the poems , other than psalms , of which a considerable number are given in the Old Testament .
In I Kings 4:29 - 34 , is a remarkable passage concern - ing Solomon which contains references to what we must suppose to have been writings on a variety of subjects .
Except for such as may be contained in the Old Testa - ment , these works of Solomon have been lost .
The passage is : — " And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding ex- ceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea -shore .
And Solomon 's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
For he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahlte , and Heman , ^ and Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was In all the nations round about .
And he spake three thousand proverbs ; and his songs were a ' To Ethan is ascribed Psalra Sg and 10 Hem^n Psalm 88 .
32 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE I thousand and five ^
And he spake of trees , from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wail : he spate also of beasts , and of birds , and of creep - ing things , and of fishes .
And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the eartht who had heard of his wisdom . "
Besides these general statements concerning olher literature by which the Old Testament writings were surrounded there are in the historical books , especially the later ones , Chronicles , references by title to books and authors from which information has been drawn , or to which the reader is directed for a fuller account than that given .
Here are the titles of some books thus mentioned : — I Samuel 10:25 , ^ hook written by Samuel telling " the manner of the Kingdom , " perhaps the " book of Samuel the seer " { mentioned in I Chronicles 29:29 ) , I Kings 1 1 41 , " the book of the acts of Solomon . "

The term " Midrash " applied to the book of Iddo > ' 11 Chronicles 13:22 , and to the book of Kings , II Chronicles 24:27 , is perhaps better translated " story " as in the King James Version , than " commentary " as in the Revised Version .
Such books as Tobit and Judith are properly " Midrashim , " that is , stories with emphasis laid on the didactic or moral aspects of the various incidents .
It has been noted by critics that I the moral teaching is the motive of most of the stories [ told in Chronicles . ^
Oral transmission played an important part in keep - I 'jng alive in the minds of the people the history of their ■ past , and many of the stories contained in the Bible ' Examples may be found in II Chronicles 21:10 , 14:14 , 26:5 , etc. 34 BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE circulated among the peoples , not only of Israel and Judah , but also of the surrounding nations .
The Exodus must have been a constant source of interest and the fact that we have three accounts , in different styles , of the plagues of Egypt is not without literary significance .
In Exodus 7 - 15 , the account is epic , in Psalm 78 , lyric , and in the Wisdom of Solomon chs. ri , 17 , 18 , is an- other account which has been called the picturesque .
These are of different dates , but show what use was made of the material .
There were probably oral or written stories and songs about the patriarchs and Moses , and also about Samuel , Samson , David , Solo - mon , Saul , and other heroes .
Such a song is mentioned in I Samuel 18:7 .
Ballads and folk - songs existed , all of which , whether preserved orally , as was probably the Song of the Well , Numbers 21 : i7 , or in writing , as was probably the story of Balaam , which we have in Numbers chs. 22 - 24 , ' " a form part prose and part verse , were accessible to the Hebrew writers of the Old Testament .
From the evidence afforded by the text of the Old Testament there were probably collections of writings , , in different parts of Palestine , which contained local versions of histories or laws , and which may have been the varying sources of those portions , especially of the Pentateuch , which scholars generally regard as parallel , but distinct .
The Pentateuch is ascribed to - day to four main sources designated as J ( ahvistic} , because God is called Jahveh in these passages , E( Iohistic ) , because God is called Elohira , D( euteronomy ) , and P( riestly ) , the last so named because concerned especially with religious regulations .
To different sources are ascribed , for example , the two accounts of creation , Genesis i :i- 2:3 , and 2:4-25 , and the versions of the Commandments , I I THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 2S Exodus 20:1 - 17 , Exodus 34:1 - 27 , Leviticus 19:1 - 37 , Deuteronomy 5:1 - 21 .
Not only from books now lost did the Old Testament ■writers draw , but also from other books of the Old t Testament , unless indeed , as may be possible , the same I passage from a lost book was taken by more than one author or editor .
We cannot tell which really occurred , because usually no acknowledgment of indebtedness was made .
Isaiah contains a long passage which occurs in II Kings ( cf. Isaiah chs. 36 -39 , with II Kings 18:13 - I 20:21 ) , ch. 37 of Isaiah and ch. 19 of II Kings being I the same , I Chronicles 10:1 - 12 , is evidently from I Samuel 31:1 - 13 , II Chronicles ch. id , is evidently from I Kings 12:1— 19 .
In fact the whole of I and II Chronicles is based on the older books , I and II Samuel , and I and II Kings , as well as on other books , specifically men- tioned , and doubtless still others not mentioned .
The closing verses of II Chronicles appear as the opening verses of Ezra .
In Micah 4:1 - 3 , we have the same passage as Isaiah 2 : 2 - 4 , the most familiar portion of it being : — " They shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ; nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they leam war any more , " [ A less familiar passage evidently related to the other , I Occurs in Joel 3:9- 10 ; — " Prepare war ; stir up the mighty men ; let all the men of t war draw near , let them come up .
Beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruning hooks into spears . "
There are examples of the double use of the same [ earlier material in the collections of religious poetry 36 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE which we have in the Psalms , which consists , as the doxologies at the end of each book indicate , of five divisions , 1- 41 ; 42-72 ; 73-89 ; 90-106 ; J07-150 , each of which was probably an independent collection .
Psalm 14 of the first book appears again in the second book as Psalm 53 .
Psalm 70 is the same as Psalm 40 : 13 - 17 .
Psalm 108 is composed of Psalms 57:7 - 11 , and 60:5 - 12 .
The versions are slightly different in the two appearances of the same Psalm and the duplica- tions are always in different books .
Similarly the poem of David , which is Psalm 18 , is put into its historical setting In 11 Samuel 22 , in a different version .
Associated with the Old Testament , but not regarded by the Jews as part of their Scriptures , are the books of the Apocrypha , which found their way into the Bible , of the early Church , and which , with the exception of the Prayer of Manasses and I and II Esdras , are in the Bible of tiie Roman Catholic Church , because in the Vulgate .
Protestant versions place the Apocryphal books in a group between the Old and the New Tes- taments .
From the references to lost books , and from the use of materials in our Old Testament we see that there existed earlier , and also contemporaneously , a con- siderable literature , of which we have in the Bible only such examples as have been preserved for us by the reverent care of men who made it their business to see that the best thought of the best minds should be to the race a perpetual possession , and that the records of the Jews should be preserved .
To this lit- erature of the ancient world the archteologists have added considerable stores of the writings from the extensive literatures of Egypt and Babylonia con- temporary with , or earlier than the records of the Jews .
THE BACKGROUND OF THE OLD TESTAMENT yj
Of various dates , some doubtless fairly early , and others much later than any parts of the Old Testament , are a number of books containing material concerning much of the contents of the Old Testament , and purporting to give information about the prophets , patriarchs and others , supplementing what we learn from the Bible .
These books
In many cases show the thought of the time concerning matters to which the Bible refers as of general knowledge , but about which it has little to say , for example , Satan and the sons of God , and the councils in Heaven , spoken of in Job 1 and 2 ; I Kings 22:19 ; Zechariah 3:1 ; the func- tions of Satan as mentioned in I Chronicles 21:1 , which refers to the same event as II Samuel 24:1 ; the war in ' heaven and the fall of the bad angels , referred to as well - known stories in II Peter 2:4 , and Jude v. 6 ; the vision of judgment , Jude vs. 14 , 15 , quoted from the book of Enoch ; the quarrel between Michael and the devil , Jude v. 9 , a story which Origen said was from the Assumption of Moses ; the contest between Moses , and Jannes and Jambres , II Timothy 3 :8 , who are not named elsewhere in the Bible . '
There are many things spoken of in the Old Testament which were evidently a part of the literature or thought of the time , or of earlier times , Dr. R. H. Charles , ^ refers to the following beliefs which find expression in the Bible or In early Christian writings , as being either partially or wholly elucidated by the Secrets of Enoch , written about the beginning of the Christian era , and preserved to us , so far as is yet known , only in Slavonic : i. Death was caused by ' They were the sorcerers of Exodus 7:1 1 , Jewish tradition states .

CHAPTER III THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Back of the New Testament is the Old Testament , and not only this , but an extensive literature that came into existence after the latest events of which the Old Testament treats .
The Old Testament Scriptures are concerned , except for the opening chapters of Genesis , with the personages and events of about seventeen hundred years , from Abraham to Nehemiah ; the New Testament , except perhaps the book of Revelation , with the personages and events of probably less than one hundred years .
The Old Testament , while con- taining many biographies , falls much of it in the domain of national history , political as well as religious , though chiefly the latter .
The New Testament , some of which falls in the domain of history , belongs rather to biog - raphy , containing as it does , except Revelation , ac- counts of the birth , life , teachings , death and resurrec- tion of Jesus Christ , the efforts to promulgate and Inter - pret those teachings , and to organize a Church founded upon them .
The Revelation , a type of literature rep- resented in the Old Testament in Daniel , and in the Apocrypha in II Esdras , sets forth the events of the future as visions ; there are to be a new heaven and a new earth , in which God shall dwell with man , *' and death shall be no more ; neither shall there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more , " Revelation 21:4 .
To the period between the Old Testament and the New belong some of the books of the Apocrypha .
The THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 41 Dka of the Maccabees give us the history of the re- action against Greek power and influences .
The Per- sian gave way to the Greek who was succeeded by the Roman .
These changes from the conditions in the time of Ezra bring us to the Palestine of Jesus and his disciples .
The four centuries immediately preceding the Christian era saw not only changes in the political conditions , but also the development of certain ideas which are later more clearly set forth in the New Tes- tament .
It is in the Wisdom of Solomon that we find ex- pressed such thoughts as these_on personal immortality : —
" But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God , And no torment shall touch them .
In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died ;
And their departure was accounted to be their hurt , And their journeying away from us to be their ruin :
But they are in peace .
For even if in the sight of men they be punished , Their hope is full of immortality ;
And having borne a little chastening , they shall receive great good ; Because God made trial of them , and found them worthy of himself , As gold in the furnace he proved them , And as a whole burnt offering he accepted them .
And in the time of their visitation they shall shine forth .
And as sparks among stubble they shall run to and fro ,
They shall judge nations , and have dominion over peoples ;
And the Lord shall reign over them for evermore . "
The Wisdom of Solomon 3:1 - 8 .
In Daniel we read : — " They that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever . "
Daniel 12:3 . J \2 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE
Not as new ideas then came these words in the New I Testament : —
" Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . "
Matthew 1343 .
" When the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory , : also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
Matthew 19:28 .
" Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world ? " I Corinthians 6:2 .
The immortality of the soul is set forth in the Old \ Testament in a number of passages , ' such as the fol- \ lowing : — " For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol ; Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption .
Thou wilt show me the path of fife :
In thy presence is fulness of joy ;
In thy right - hand there are pleasures for evermore , " Psalm 16:10 , II .
" But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol ; For he will receive me . "
Psalm 49:15 .
" As for me , I shall behold thy face in righteousness ; I shall be satisfied when I awake , with beholding thy form . "
Psalm 17:15 .
" But as for me I know that my Redeemer ( Heb. gofl , vindicator ] liveth .
And at last he will stand up upon the earth :
And after my skin , even this body , is destroyed .
Then without my flesh shall I see God ; Whom I , even I , shall see , on my side , And mine eyes shall behold , and not as a stranger . "
Job 19:25 - 27 . '

The doctrine of the resurrection of the body is a clear and definite belief of the mother and her seven sons , who suffered death rather than eat swine 's flesh at the King 's command .
We read that the second son said to his murderer : — " Thou , miscreant , dost release us out of this present life , but the King of the world shall raise up us , who have died for his laws , unto an eternal renewal of life . "
11 Maccabees 7 ^ .
The fourth e 1 said : — " It is good to die at the hands of men and look for the hopes which are giWn by God , that we shall be raised up again by him ; for , as for thee , thou shalt have no resurrection unto life , " II Maccabees 7:14 .
This last is the idea in the Gospel of John : — " They that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of judg - ment . "
John 5:29 .
This idea
Is expressed also in the Old Testament : — - " And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt . "
Daniel 12:2 .
Compare the ideas of national , and also personal , I resurrection contained in the following passages : — ' " Thy dead shall live ; my dead bodies shall arise .
Awake I and sing , ye that dwell in the dust ; for thy dew is as the dew A distinction must be recognized between resurrection of the body and , nortality of the soul , wbieb are quite separate ideas .

Isaiah 16:19 .
" Come , and let us return unto Jehovah ; for he hath torn , and he will heal us ; he hath smitten , and he will bind us up .
After two days will he revive us : on the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live before him , " Hosea 6:1 , 2 .
The relation of the New Testament to the Apocrypha , which will be discussed a little further on , is mentioned here as connecting the Old with the New , as forming part of the background of the New , and as showing that the doctrines of personal immortality and the resurrection of the body , so all - important in the New Testament , were current in Palestine , in the lime of Jesus , and earlier , the Sadducees constituting a dis - tinct sect , among the peculiarities of which was the fact that they did not believe in the resurrection .
Matthew 22:23 - 32 .
There is in the New Testament no quotation from or reference to any of the books of the Apocrypha , by name , or as authority , although there are many pas- sages , such as those already quoted , from which we are almost sure that the Apocryphal books , or some of them , were known to the New Testament writers .
The Apocrypha may be regarded as a direct literary influence on the New Testament .
The ancient Scriptures composed of the Law , the Prophets , and the Writings , were to the early Christians , as to the Jews , inspired books .
Their view of them is expressed in a phrase , in Hebrews 5:12 , " the oracles of God , " which Is repeated in the declaration : — " What advantage then hath the Jew ? . . . much every way : first of all , that they were entrusted with the oracles of God , " Romans 3:1 - 2 , Jesus quoted " the Scriptures , " referred to " the Law , " " the Prophets " ^ ^H Scriptures J [ ow I em THE BACRGROUND OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 45 and " the Psalms , " and said to his disciples : ^ " Ye search the Scriptures , because ye think that in them ye have eternal life . "
John 5:39 .
Paul writes to Tim - othy : — " from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salva - tion through faith which is in Christ Jesus , " II Timothy 3 : is .
In time the Epistles of Paul came to be regarded as inspired , and are referred to as " scrip - tures " ; — " ... even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to htm , wrote unto you ; as also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; wherein are some things hard to be understood , which the ignorant and un- stedfast wrest , as tlify do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction . "
II Peter 3:15 - 16 .
Other writings were also regarded as Inspired , and lUectively they became known as the " New Cov- enant , " in distinction from the " Old Covenant , " II Corinthians 3:6 - 14 , or the Old Testament and the New Testament , Just as Antiochus Epiphanes ( d. 164 b. c. ) had en- deavored to eradicate the Jewish religion by destroying the Hebrew Scriptures , I Maccabees 1:44 - 57 , ^^'i putting to death those who were found possessing a copy , so Diocletian ( d. 313 A. d. ) endeavored to destroy Christianity .
Eusebius wrote of this effort : — " I saw with my own eyes the houses of prayer thrown down and razed to their foundations , and the inspired and sacred scriptures consigned to the fire in the open market " lace . "
Ecclesiastical History , Book 8 , ch , 2 , In spite of all these attempts to destroy them , the iriptures , Old and New , remain to - day in literature , 46 what they ha' BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE 1 for < , the world 's most ■ centunes , t cherished spiritual possession .
Let us see what the Uterary background and imme- diate surroundings of the New Testament were .
For convenience we will discuss them as follows : — I . The Old Testament , 2 . The Apocrypha and other non-canon - ical writings , 3 . Stories , preserved in other ancient lit- erature , 4 .
Greek literature , 5 . Authors like Josephus and Philo , 6 .
Lost writings of Paul and other early Christians , including " Sayings " of Jesus .
These groups are not always mutually exclusive , but they will serve our purpose . ^
I. The Old Testament .
There are in the New Tes- tament quotations from thirty of the Old Testament books .
Some of the quotations are literal , others are what may be termed composite , being made up of a combination of several passages .
Examples of the latter are Romans 9:32 — 33 , which combines Isaiah 8:14 , and 28:16 , as does also I Peter 2:6 - 8 .
It is Hkely that Mark i : 2 - 3 , is a combination of Malachi 3 :i and Isaiah 40:3 , perhaps from some manual .^
One of the most interesting instances of composite quoting from the Old Testament is found in Romans 3:10 - 12 .
Paul quotes Psalm 14:1—3 , He then quotes Psalms g:g , 140 : 3 , 10:7 , Isaiah 59:7 - 8 , Psalm 36:1 .
This composite passage found its way into the Septuagint version of Psalm 14 , and thence into the Vulgate .
It is included in ail translations of the Vulgate and through the Great Bible passed into the Psalter in the Book of Common Prayer , where it remains . '

Examples ; found in Jude as mentioned before : ^'
" But Michael the archangel , when conrending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a raihng judgment , but said , The Lord rebuke thee . "
Jude v. 9 . Origen said * that this incident is from the Assump - ion of Moses .
Enoch is quoted as an apparently well - known book .
The passage is : — '
And to these also Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied , saying .
Behold the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones , to execute judgment upon all , and to con- vict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought , and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "
Jude vs. 14 .- 15 - The verses in Enoch are : — " And behold !
He cometh with ten thousands of [ His ] holy ones To execute judgment upon all .
And to destroy all the ungodly :
And to convict all flesh

And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "

" ... when they see that son of man sitting on the throne of his glory . "

These and other passages indicate that some ideas which are commonly supposed to have been original with the New Testament writers were the thought of the time and had been expressed before .
The following passages probably indicate that there was a " ' small apocalypse , ' consisting of material set in the ordinary triple division common to apocalyptic literature ( cf. Apoc. 9:12 , 11:14 ) . " ' Mark 13 7 - 8 = Matthew 24,:6 - 8 = Luke 21:9 - 11 .
Mark i3:i4 -20 = Matthew 24:i5 - 22 = ( Luke 21:20 - 24 ) .
Mark 13 :24-27 = Matthew 24:29-31 = ( Luke 21 :25-27,28 ) .
There is perhaps evidence of the existence of a lost wisdom book in Luke 11:49 -51 : —
" Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send unto them prophets and apostles ; and some of them they shall kill and persecute , " etc .
From another lost book perhaps came John 7:38 : — ire hath sai
He that believeth on me , as the sc from within him shall flow rivers of living water . "
These and other passages from the New Testament are similar to the words of Ecclesiasticus : — " If a man love me he will keep my word : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him , " John 14:23 .

I Corinthians 2:9. was said by Origen ( in a comment on Matthew 27:9 ) to be from a lost book , the Secrets of Elijah the Prophet , Chrysostom and Theophylact state that the words are either from a lost book , or are a paraphrase of Isaiah 52:15 , . while Jerome thought them to be a paraphrase of Isaiah 64:4 .
" Awake thoL that sieepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall shine upon thee . "
Ephesians 5:14 . has been attributed to the lost Secrets of Elijah , to a paraphrase of Isaiah 60:1 , 19 , 20 , or to a Christian hymn .

Many of these have been pre- served in Syriac , Arabic , Armenian , and in Rabbinical literature .
The Ahikar stones contain parallels to the parable of the fig tree that bore no fruit , Luke 13:6 - 9 , the parable of the evil servant , Matthew 24:45 - 51 , and Luke 12 - 47 , and to the story of Judas . '

Paul quotes , Acts 17:28 , " certain even of your own poets , " as having said of God " For we are also his offspring , " a state - ment made by Aratus in the opening of his poem the Phsenomena , and by Oeanthes in his Hymn to Zeus .
He quotes , Titus l : I2 , the Cretan poet Epimenides , " a prophet of their own , " ( who , according to Jerome and Epiphanius , is quoted by Callimachus in his Hymn to Zeus ) , as saying : — " Cre e always liars , evil be : idle gim An iambic trimeter occurs in the Greek of I Corin - thians 15:33 : — ^$upovatv ^^ ) ( pi) irTa djuXuu Koxai , This is found in a fragment of Menander , and is translated : — " Evil companionships corrupt good morals .

5 . Influence of fosepkus and Pkilo .
Writers such as THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 53 Josephus , are from similarities of ideas and language , thought by some to have been well - known to the authors of II Peter , and the Gospels of Luke and John , '
The teachings of Christianity influenced , and were t influenced by , philosophic ideas of the early centuries .
I
In the writings of Philo , an Alexandrian Jew , we find many similarities of thought to the Gospel of John and to the Epistle to the Hebrews , both of which use concerning Jesus expressions used by Philo of the Logos of God .
The writings commonly known as Hermes Trismegistus , a collection of Christian Neoplatonic works of probably the latter part of the first century , contain ideas of God that are much the same as those of John , Hebrews and Revelation ; for example , in Hermes Trismegistus we read : — " But the Mind , The God , being masculine - feminine , orig - inating Life and Light , begat by Word another Mind Creator , Who being God of the Fire and Spirit , created Seven Admin - istrators , encompassing in circles the sensible world ; and their administration is called Fate . "
Poemandres i -.g.
In Revelation we read of " the seven Spirits of God , " and the seven stars , " i;20 , 3:1 , " seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God , " 4:5 , " The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth . "
5 :6 . 6 . Lost Writings .
A lost epistle of Paul is probably referred to in I Corinthians 5:9 , " I wrote unto you in my epistle " and there may easily have been other epistles lost , ^ Just as we have probably lost some of the '

It seems certain that II Corinthians , chs. 10 - 13 , 's ^ separate letter and belongs , not where it is now placed , but between I and II Corinthians , There were therefore probably four letters of Paul to the Corinthians , of which we possess three .
The necessity of authenticating his epistles , under some circumstances , is indicated by Paul in his expression II Thessalonians 3:17 , " ... with mine own hand , which is a token in every epistle . "
Paul asked Timothy to bring him " the books , especially the parchments , " II Timothy , 4:13 .
We do not know what books or rolls were meant .
Perhaps they were copies of the Scriptures .
That Paul was a scholar is well known , but the words of Festus , Acts , 26 124 , " thy much learning " may also be translated " those many writings , " perhaps referring to parch - ments , which Paul was accustomed to carry with him in his travels .
He had left such a lot of parchments at Troas and desired Timothy to bring them To him .
The discovery of " Sayings " of Jesus in 1897 and 1904 ' may be connected with a statement of Paul , Acts 20:35 , when he quotes a " saying " that is not included in any collection we have , but which was well - known to his hearers at Ephesus , " ... remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he himself said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive , ' " Paul was not quoting anything he had himself heard .
The Formaiion of the New Testament Consider now how the New Testament came into being .
Like the Old , it consists of a collection of books '
See belon , p. 67 .
i THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 55 Written , for the most part , independently of each other , but in process of time grouped together and regarded as authoritative and inspired .
Among the early Chris - r tian writers there were differences of opinion concern - I ing the authenticity or inspiration of some of the books 1 now included in the New Testament .
The earliest f list known of the books recognized by the Christian [ church is the Muratorian Fragment first published in 1740 by L. A. Muratori .
It was found in the Ambrosian I Library at Milan and is thought to date from about 1 170 A. D , The names of Matthew and Mark are I evidently torn off , the list beginning with " The Gospel I of St. Luke , the physician , companion of St. Paul , ] stands third . "
The Gospel of St. John comes fourth .
I Next comes Acts , then thirteen Epistles of Paul , The Fragment omits James , I and II Peter , Hebrews , and III John which were accepted later , and states " there is in circulation an Epistle to the Laodiceans and one to the Alexandrians forged in Paul 's name , and several others which cannot be received in the Catholic Church .
The Epistle of Jude however and two with the name of John are held in the Catholic Church .
We receive also that Revelation of John and the Revelation of Peter , which latter some of our body will not allow to be read in church , " Origen ( 210 A. D. ) omits James and Jude from his list , but includes them in other passages .
Eusebius ( 315 A. D. ) gives the list of books as now accepted , but mentions that some doubted concerning the Epistles of James , Jude , II Peter , II and III John and the Revelation .
Athanasius , a contemporary of Eu- sebius , gives the list as we have it .
Cyril { 340 a. d. ) , Gregory Nazianzen , ( 375 a. d. ) and Philastrius ( 380 .
D. ) omit the Revelation , as do also the Bishops in J 56 A BOOK ABOUT THE ENGLISH BIBLE the Council of Laodicea { 363 A. d. ) - Jerome { 382 .
A. D. ) gives our list , but is doubtful about the Epistle to the Hebrews .
Rufiuus ( 390 a. d. ) and Augustin ( 394 A. D. ) give our list , and the forty - four Bishops at the Council of Carthage ( the third , having been preceded by the Councils of Nicaaa and Laodicea ) pronounce canonical the books of the New Testament as we have them .
Various lists of New Testament books from early times differ somewhat in the order in which the books are arranged .
The Gospels usually are put first and the Apocalypse last , with the Acts , the Pauline Epistles , and the General , or Catholic Epistles , in that order , between .
It was logical to group the Gospels and the Acts first , as historical books , but Jerome placed the Pauline Epistles before Acts in his arrangement , while Chrysostom placed the Pauline Epistles before the Gospels in his list .
Early lists differ in the order in which they put the Gospels .
Commonly , but not always , Matthew comes first , because it was supposed that this was the earliest .
Chrysostom arranged the Gospels , John , Matthew , Luke , Mark , while some old Latin manuscripts give Matthew , John , Luke , Mark .
Almost every other arrangement is to be found , but the Council of Laodicea ( 363 a , d. ) adopted the order of the Gospels as we arc accustomed to find it .
The order of the Epistles is likewise variously given .
It is thought that the form in which we have the present books of the New Testament may have been affected by editing to make them conform better to the unity of the canon .
We are not concerned with these prob- lems in this volume .
They are mentioned , however , as of interest in any discussion of the New Testament as literature .
THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 57 ^
The Gospels are believed to have been written in the order l , Mark , 2 . Matthew , 3 .
Luke , 4 . John , the last named having been , as we know from a state - ment of Clement of Alexandria ^ ( d. about 220 a , d. ) , written after the other three .
From the nature of the contents , as well as from tradition , and from the state - ments of Papias , it has been concluded that Mark was the first written , almost , but not quite , the whole of
Florence Marryat On Stage
When I first joined Mr. d’Oyley Carte ’s Patience Company in the provinces , to play the part of Lady Jane , I understood I was to have four days rehearsal .
However , the lady whom I succeeded , hearing I had arrived , took herself off , and the manager requested I would appear the same night of my arrival .
This was rather an ordeal to an artist who had never sung on the operatic stage before , and who was not note perfect .
But as a matter of obligation and although I was very nervous about it , I consented to do my best .
At the end of the second act , during the balloting scene .
Lady Jane has to appear suddenly on the stage , with the word “ Away ! ” – I forget at this distance of time whether I made a mistake in pitching the note a third higher or lower .
I know it was not out of harmony , but it was sufficiently wrong to send the chorus astray , and bring my heart up into my mouth .
It never occurred after the first night , but I never stood at the wings again waiting for that particular entrance , “ girded my loins together ” , without a kind of dread lest I should repeat the error .
After a while I perceived a good deal of whispering about me in the company , and I asked poor Federici ( who played the colonel ) the reason of it , particularly as he had previously asked me to stand as far from him as I could upon the stage , because I magnetized him so strongly that he could n’t sing if I was near him .
“ Well !...
Do you know , ” he said to me in answer , “ that a very strange thing occurs occasionally with reference to you , Miss Marryat ?
While you are standing on the stage sometimes , you appear seated in the stalls .
Several people have seen it beside myself .
I assure you it is true . ”
“ It ’s always at the same time , ” he answered , “ just before you run on at the end of the second act .
Of course it ’s only an appearance , but it ’s very queer . "
I told him then of the strange feelings of distrust of myself I experienced each night at that very moment , when my spirit seems to have preceded myself upon the stage …
Being subject to “ optical illusions ” , I naturally had several with regard to my spirit child , “
Florence
” , and she always came to me clothed in a white dress .
One night , however , when I was living alone in the Regent ’s Park , I saw “ Florence ” ( as I imagined ) standing in the centre of the room , dressed in a green riding habit slashed with orange color , with a cavalier hat of grey felt on her head , ornamented with a long green feather and a gold buckle .
She stood with her back to me , but I could see her profile as she looked over her shoulder , with the skirt of her habit in her hand .
This being a most extraordinary attire in which to see “

China State Construction nets $ 100 m US subway deal By Liu Yiyu ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-11-24 08:11
The company has signed more than $ 2 billion worth of contracts in the US this year .
[ China Daily ]
China State Construction Engineering Corp , the largest contractor in China , has bagged a subway ventilation project worth about $ 100 million in New York 's Manhattan area , marking the construction giant 's third order in the United States ' infrastructure space this year .
The contract was given to China Construction American Co , a subsidiary , the Wall Street Journal quoted a source as saying .
" The new project , along with the $ 410 - million Hamilton Bridge project and a $ 1.7 - billion entertainment project it won earlier this year , signals China State Construction 's ambition to tap the American construction market , " said Li Zhirui , an industry analyst at First Capital Securities .
Li , however , said the order came as no surprise as the US government is spending massively on infrastructure projects .
The three orders only account for about 4 percent of the value of its total orders this year , Li added .
In the first three quarters of this year , the Chinese construction giant signed more than $ 2 billion worth of contracts in the US market .
China State Construction was also the contractor for a high school , a railway station and the Chinese embassy in the US .
Despite the progress made in the US market , the Middle East , Asia and Africa remain the State builder 's key markets .
The value of its contracts in Algeria this year increased 32 percent year - on - year , exceeding $ 800 million , and the value of its contracts in the Middle East surged 62 percent year on year , also exceeding $ 800 million .
The domestic market is still the largest contributor to China State Construction 's revenue , mainly due to strong property sales and infrastructure sector projects .
China State Construction said it reaped 41 billion yuan in revenue from the property sector in the first 10 months of this year , up 83.2 percent over the same period last year .
Orders from the infrastructure construction business were boosted by 90 percent largely due to the fiscal stimulus allocated to China 's infrastructure sector .
Citing the company 's recent performance , Shenyin & Wanguo Securities has given China State Construction a " buy " rating for the first time .
According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Commerce , China 's overseas project contracts have increased 22.7 percent to $ 100.15 billion in the first 10 months of this year .
Just great .

MANCHESTER , England -- Brock Lesnar will not be back in the UFC anytime soon , according to UFC President Dana White .
Speaking with the media after UFC 105 , White indicated the heavyweight champion is very ill and will be out of action for the foreseeable future .
He went on to state that an interim title match might need to be set up .
White did little to shed light on the specifics of Lesnar ’s condition , but he did state that he has been hospitalized .
“ He ’s in a hospital up in North Dakota somewhere right now , ” said White .
“ He went to Canada and some bad stuff happened to him , so we ’ve got to figure it out .
“ He does n’t want to talk about it publically , but he ’s in bad shape .
He ’s not well and he ’s not going to be getting well anytime soon .
” Lesnar pulled out of his Nov. 18 heavyweight title match with top contender Shane Carwin , and reports suggested he had swine flu .
But when rumors began to circle about the rescheduled Jan. 2 date being in jeopardy , it was announced that Lesnar had mononucleosis and could be out even longer than originally thought .
Now , after White ’s comments , it is apparent that Lesnar is in more dire shape .
He is not only suffering from mono but other ailments as well .
“ He has other problems too , ” continued White , fielding a question about his diagnosis of mononucleosis .
“ He is not good .
He is very , very sick and he ’s going to be out for a while .
” White went on to state that the UFC would be doing everything in their power to help Lesnar .
“ I am worried about it , ” said White of his biggest star ’s medical situation .
“ You know , I ca n’t really talk about it right now , but he ’s in rough shape .
He ’s in really bad shape … and we ’re going to have to do some stuff to take care of this guy .
He is not well and he ’s not getting any better .
“ We ’re going to have to send him to the Mayo Clinic or to Scripps , or one of those really good hospitals to figure out what ’s wrong with this guy . ”
November 28 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
I posted a few things a while back on analysing disgust philosophically .
Some emotions have got plenty of attention like this from philosophers , especially love .
But something that I ’ve never seen discussed in the literature is cuteness – what is the content and the meaning of our perceiving things as cute ?
A google search brings up nothing but people naming their cats Socrates and Nietzsche .
So I ’m going to have a go .
The obvious thing people say when analysing cuteness is that it ’s an evolutionary adaptation to facilitate care for infants .
This is quite true , but it does n’t answer the question .
What is a mouse or a bear or a human actually conscious of when they perceive their young in this way ?
They ca n’t really be conscious ‘ that the infant is theirs and is very young ’ , because they probably do n’t have enough sense of self - identity , or of time , to understand such concepts .
Besides , how young is young ?
It ’s a different space of time for different species .
So merely knowing why this reaction came about does n’t tell us what its content is .
What do people find cute ?
One answer is things with certain body shapes – soft edges , large foreheads , large eyes , etc .
Another thing we respond to is size , especially disproportion – something that ’s very small relative to you or relative to how big it should be , is cute .
Observe the deer and turtle to the left .
A related issue , I think , is how we respond to apparently disproportioned efforts – animals or people doing things that are hilariously beyond their abilities , or making judgements that seem to draw upon a level of authority and knowledge they clearly lack .
Observe Fluffy , the Destroyer of Worlds :
Or observe the cuteness of children or animals doing things the only adult humans are really capable of , such as this squirrel :
But this sort of ‘ aspirations far beyond abilities ’ is n’t always cute .
If it ’s in someone who has the power to harm us by their misguided efforts , it ’s not cute ; and sometimes it ’s just pathetic .
Patheticness and cuteness , in fact , seem very similar : both are encouraged by perceptions of vulnerability , uncertainty , and weakness ( observe the worry and fragility on the face of eated - cookie - cat , left , intensified by the act of openness and interdependence implied by the original making of the cookie .
What they seem to share , I venture to suggest , and what differentiates them from the person whose delusions of grandeur are dangerous , is something like the complete containment of one world within another .
By ‘ world ’
I mean in the sense that for any person , we can sort of talk about ‘ the world they inhabit ’ : the network of things that they interact with , depend upon , think about , aim for , and respond to .
A cute ( or pathetic ) being is one who ‘ inhabits ’ a miniature world , a world that is contained within the larger world that we grander and more knowledgeable beings ‘ inhabit ’ .
To put it another way , the significance that the cute being puts on any given object is greater than what we would , because that same object seems like a bigger part of a smaller world .
For instance , consider the ‘ anger ’ we perceive ( perhaps mistakenly ) on the face of Fluffy , above .
What ’s so funny and cute is the pettiness that we feel the anger must display : anger about some trifling thing , directed onto the tiny portion of reality that a small dog can be aware of .
Compare also the anxiety on the face of eated - cookie - cat : what is he / she anxious about ?
That we will be annoyed at the loss of a potential cookie – something that to ‘ us ’ ( the implied addressee ) is of hardly any importance , but which looms large before the cat .
Similarly , a person ’s quirks , habits , or interests , when they seem to motivate or matter to that person , but not to us , can seem ‘ cute ’ , because they show us a part of that person ’s world which they put more importance on than we do .
Size obviously connects to this , because spatial metaphors are so important to our thinking .
Large forehead , small mouth , etc. are then presumably contingent cues that evolution has built us to perceive as indicating that a being ’s world is within ours in this way .
What , then , differentiates the cute from the pathetic ?
It seems that in both cases there are two steps : first , the empathetic one through which we ‘ step into the shoes ’ of the cute being , so as to perceive what it perceives ( whether that ’s an identifiable object , or an implied one ) , and then secondly , we shift back ‘ up ’ and ‘ outwards ’ to our own world , so as to see the previously - perceived world of the cute being ( or part thereof ) as a component .
The difference between cuteness and patheticness seems to be that a in one case , this second step is pleasant , and in the other , it is unpleasant .
What accounts for this difference though ?
We can take as a clue , that perceiving someone or something as pathetic seems to be connected to perceiving them as a bit disgusting .
If , as I have argued in the past , the essence of disgust is a blurring of the boundary between mind ( life , spirit , etc. ) and matter , then this might suggest the following : that the ‘ pathetic ’ reaction is prompted by anxieties about where , between those two worlds , oneself is located .
When one sees oneself as within that smaller , contained world , precisely because it ’s so entirely conatined , it comes to seem less like a world at all , and more like an object within the larger world .
That is , it seems to objectify the self , to turn it from a proper mind ( which is : consciousness of the world ) and into a thing , a piece of matter almost .
That is , something pathetic worries us because we can’t quite persuade ourselves that we too are not similar pathetic .
This prompts a attempt to withdraw , to avoiding thinking about the pathetic person or thing , to avoid entering into their mental world for fear of being stuck there and contaminated .
Something cute , on the other hand , does n’t worry us , because we ’re confident that it is a silly adorable little child - like creature , while we are a proper , intelligent , worldly adult .
In entering into its world , and then shifting back out to ours , we find ourselves not contaminated or put in question , but affirmed and reassured .
This is why , for instance , we are likely to consider something cute when done by a child or animal , which if done by an adult human would be pathetic .
The adult human confuses and blurs our boundaries – adults should n’t be childish like that , because we are adults , and we need to keep up the boundaries that define that sense of confidence .
Anyway , that was my initial stab at a philosophical clarification of cuteness .
Since as I said I ’ve not found any prior writing on the subject , it ’s likely to be somewhat amateur , and no doubt have several points where improvement is needed .
But whatever .
The pictures are nice .

( CNN ) --
Three days after the world watched a giant balloon fly through the air as a tearful family expressed fears that their 6 - year - old boy could be inside , authorities announced what millions suspected :
The whole thing was staged .
The balloon is displayed at the sheriff 's department in Fort Collins , Colorado , on Sunday .
The " Aha ! " moment that led authorities to realize what had happened was an interview with the family Thursday night on CNN's " Larry King Live , " Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer County said Sunday .
In the interview with Wolf Blitzer , filling in for King , the Heenes asked their son why he had not come out from hiding when they called his name .
" You guys said we did this for the show , " the boy responded .
On Sunday , Alderden called the incident a " hoax , " adding that investigators believe the evidence indicates that " it was a publicity stunt " by the family in hopes of " better marketing themselves for a reality television show at some point in the future . "
The parents , Richard and Mayumi Heene , met in a Hollywood acting school and " put on a very good show for us , " Alderden said .
Authorities know there was " a conspiracy " between them , he added .
He said charges are expected to be filed in the case .
The couple 's attorney told CNN affiliate KMGH that he has n't seen any evidence beyond " speculation , " but the Heenes would turn themselves in if charges are filed .
" All I 'm saying if you 've got some reason to arrest him , let me know , he 'll turn himself in , " said Denver attorney David Lane referring to Richard Heene .
" If you got the goods , just tell me . "
The sheriff said investigators also want to interview 25 - year - old researcher Robert Thomas who worked with Richard Heene for about two months last spring .
Thomas was paid by Gawker.com -- a popular gossip site -- to write about his experience with Heene for a story published on Saturday .
Watch Alderden tell how police recognized " hoax " »
In an interview arranged with the help of Gawker , Thomas told CNN Sunday that as a student at Colorado State University with an interest in electromagnetic studies , he sought out Heene for a job as a possible research assistant .
He said he ended up as his " stenographer , " taking down Heene 's ideas and proposals for reality - show pitches .
Thomas said that at one point they were talking about the Roswell UFO incident of the late 1940s , when Heene said it would be easy to cook up " a media stunt that would be equally profound as Roswell , and we could do so with nothing more than a weather balloon and some controversy . "
Thomas said he wrote up the balloon idea , which he says did not involve any kids going missing , as a potential reality show episode .
" I did n't know that he was going to do something like this , " Thomas told CNN Sunday .
Thomas said he eventually quit working with Heene in May .
The sheriff 's announcement included an admission that authorities misled the media on Friday when they said they still believed it was not a hoax .
After Falcon 's remark on CNN Thursday night , " it became very clear to us at that point that they were lying , " Alderden said .
The " nonverbal responses " and " verbal cues " from the children at that moment made it clear , Alderden said .
But to get to the truth , " it was very important during this time that they maintained their trust with us . "
So investigators misled the media while they carried out their " game plan " of gathering the truth .
Watch body language expert analyze Heene interview »
That plan included pursuing separate interviews with the Heene parents and polygraph tests , partly by arguing that it could help end the media frenzy surrounding them , Alderden said .
He added that by law he could not say whether those tests were taken .
The Heenes have repeatedly denied any hoax .
In an interview Friday with CNN's " American Morning , " Richard Heene said Falcon 's remark was a reference to the media that had assembled in front of the family 's home .
Charges have not been filed , but authorities expect to recommend felony charges including conspiracy , contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant , Alderden said .
They also plan to recommend a charge of filing a false police report , which is a misdemeanor .

He also said it is unlikely that someone convicted of these charges would face jail time .
Explainer : How ' balloon boy ' drama began »
One of the key questions that remain unanswered , Alderden said , is : Where was Falcon as police searched for him ?
On Friday , Alderden said it had been determined that the boy was hiding in an attic in the garage , and had fallen asleep .
Now , authorities are unsure .
Alderden said the boy may not have even been in the home .
" The biggest error we made is when we searched the house very clearly we did n't search the house as thoroughly as we should , " he said .
Authorities had assumed a 6 - year - old boy could not have reached that attic , he said , so they took the Heenes at their word that he had hidden there the whole time .

Heene chases storms and brings the family along .
After the Hollywood gossip Web site TMZ.com reported that the Heenes had been " pitching a reality show about the wacky family , " one of the networks mentioned -- TLC , which produces the show " Jon and Kate plus 8 " -- told CNN that " they approached us months ago , and we passed . "
Heene has been described as a meteorologist , but his education ended at the high school level , Alderden said .
Alderden also said authorities are concerned about the safety of the three children , ages 6 , 8 , and 10 .
In fact , authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene " at length about domestic violence " and the children 's safety , Alderden said .
" But we did n't have enough that would allow us or Child Protection Services to physically take the kids from that environment . "

A 911 call was made from the home earlier this year that led authorities to a " suspicious circumstance " that Alderden said may have involved " domestic violence , perhaps against the wife . "
Lane , the Heenes ' attorney , told KMGH that he has " no reason to believe they 're anything but loving parents . "
In an interview Friday with CNN's " American Morning , " the Heene parents -- looking exhausted -- expressed relief that their son was alive .
" I 'm feeling very , very grateful that Falcon is among us , " Richard Heene said .

Heene said that the family was sitting in their living room , distraught and terrified for missing Falcon , when he walked into the room .
" [ It ] felt like from nowhere .
When I first saw him , I could n't even believe it .
I could n't comprehend right away , " she said , adding that the next moment she was " just jumping , calling his name . "
She began to " scream and cry , and I just enjoyed that moment . "

Hi , Shaggirl :
I 'm a cognitive neuroscientist at Boston University writing a book for Dutton ( an imprint of Penguin ) about how the Internet reveals new insights into some of the oldest circuits in our brain which control romantic attraction and sexual behavior .
I was very much hoping you might be willing to chat about Crack Van on LJ . . . .
For our research , we 're quite interested in learning about how people creatively use text and fiction to express and explore sexuality .
If you 're willing , we 'd like to ask questions about Crack Van and about adult fanfic in general .
If you 'd like , we'd be happy to include a positive mention of you and / or Crack Van in the book ( or respect your privacy , if you 'd prefer ) .
If you have any questions about our research or book , please do n't hesitate to ask !
I look forward to hearing from you ! :)

Fan fiction ( alternately referred to as fanfiction , fanfic , FF , or fic ) is a broadly - defined term for fan labor regarding stories about characters or settings written by fans of the original work , rather than by the original creator .
Works of fan fiction are rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work 's owner , creator , or publisher ; also , they are almost never professionally published .
Fan fiction , therefore , is defined by being both related to its subject 's canonical fictional universe and simultaneously existing outside the canon of that universe .
Who Wants to Be a Cognitive Neuroscientist Millionaire ?
A researcher uses his understanding of the human brain to advance on a popular quiz show .
That is ( or was ) the title of a book by Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam to be published by Dutton in 2010 .
How on earth do I know this ?
Back in July , The Neurocritic noticed a number of visitors to the post Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience ( about the infamous paper by Vul et al. ) who came from a link on the LiveJournal of shaggirl .
Specifically , the traffic was from her entry A response from our friendly scientists ...
I took note of it , thought I might write about it but other topics took precedence .
But this week , a larger surge of visitors arrived from various LiveJournal sites .
The reason ?
Let 's start at the beginning .
Shaggirl was " contacted by a couple of guys researching and writing about online fanfic .
" I do not want to begin a lengthy discourse on fan fiction , other than to quote Wikipedia So who is Ogi Ogas ?
While a grad student at Boston University , he entered a well - known game show , won $ 500,000 and wrote about it in SEED magazine :
[ However , it is easy to say that when the stakes are nil .
ANYWAY . ]
Before putting any questions , let me give a brief overview of our scientific perspective and how it will inform the book .
As cognitive neuroscientists , we are respectful of the fascinating diversity of the neural landscape .
And this diversity , we believe , is reflected in the terrain of erotic fantasy .
The internet and e-publishing now allow for a revolutionary and unprecedented disclosure of all our fantasies , not just those decided as marketable and mainstream for print .
Digital publishing seems to have lead to an explosion in the array of fantasies we can now experience and learn from ; the loop of imagination , desire , and actuality is now tighter .
We want to ' neuro - scientifically ' explore what this blossoming of fantasy means for us as individuals , and as a society .
How does this access to all manner of fantasies imaginable change our brains ?
Given this broad overview , we have some specific questions , and more general ones about adult fanfic , that we are hoping you can help us with .
I do apologize if some questions seem naive and / or I inadvertently mis-characterize something in my ignorance !
. . .
One quick note about the subtitle of the book : the current title is largely driven by the pre-publication marketing needs of the publication industry , and was determined by our editor .
The eventual subtitle will likely change ; it may still contain the term netporn , though this is increasingly unlikely NOTE :
Unlike the screenshot above , the current Unlike the screenshot above , the current book project list from Gail Ross shows the NETPORN subtitle has indeed been removed ] . ...
In terms of turning this into hard science , our primary goal is to make a strong case for the study of fantasy as being accessible in this era of copious datastreams from humans .
To give you one example of the kind of current study in neurosexual behavior that we feel is quite limited , there was an article in the Time magazine ( http://www.time.com/time/health/articl e/0,8599,1911103,00.html ) on how girls focus more on best friends while boys are more interested in group dynamics and ' packs ' .
The authors of the study tied this observation to the differential activation patterns in the brain based on how the subject group of boys and girls rated pictures of strangers .
The article state that the " nucleus accumbens ( which is associated with reward and motivation ) , hypothalamus ( associated with hormone secretion ) , hippocampus ( associated with social learning ) and insula ( associated with subjective feelings ) all become more active . "
The suspect and cavalier methodology of this study evoke some of the general problems that plague brain imaging experiments that purportedly examine social behavior [ 1 ] .
We hope to make the case that such methodological contortions are not required when a vast pool of people provide behavioral data on the internet through quantifiable activity .
Polling feedback from groups would be immensely useful .
We would definitely love your help in reaching other fans .. .
[ 1 ]
Here 's a paper criticizing such casual treatment of the brain - behavior linkage , which has received a lot of attention in the neuroscience community ( http://cns.bu.edu/~gsc/Articles/Vul_09 _Voodoo.pdf ) .
The content requires an understanding of imaging methodology , but the abstract is definitely accessible .
Here 's a posting from a popular neuroscience blog describing the article ( http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/0 1/voodoo-correlations-in-social.html )
[ They 're a very prolific bunch . ]
.
Even with all 4 choices available , it 's obvious the answer is D ( " Heroin : the sedative for coughs " ) .
Prescription cough syrup contains codeine , which is a cough suppressant .
In response to some questions about their book project , Gaddam replied
He then goes on to ask a number of questions about adult fanfic .
Dana ( shaggirl ) replied in a lengthy , thoughtful post in which she explains fandom ( " composed primarily of well educated women , most of whom self - identify as geeks " ) , objects to the word " netporn " in their book title , and answers all 7 questions .
Then A response from our friendly scientists ... where yours truly gets a mention :
Two things :
(1) They said the content of their book will be " Using new digital sources of data to illuminate brain regions and neural pathways involved in romantic and sexual behavior . "
However , they did not actually propose to measure brain function at all .
They might be skeptical of fMRI , but it 's a lot better than no real neural data at all .
( 2) A poll .
That generated Hundreds of posts .
Thousands of comments
So what kind of scientists are you anyway ?
We 're brain modelers .
We 're aligned with the relatively new field of cognitive neuroscience ... . . .
Our current research project will result in a model that makes novel behavioral and physiological predictions .
From a poorly written survey ?
And just when you think their project is a wee bit grandiose , the pomposity reaches stunning proportions :
The greater one 's mathematical ability , the greater the opportunity for designing a powerful and sophisticated model .
Superior models , such as those of Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter , may include unsolvable systems of differential equations .
Still , useful and productive models can be constructed using relatively straightforward mathematics .
Oh , and here 's a ridiculous question :
How is straight female interest in slash fiction like straight male interest in " shemale " * models ?
And why in the world does this matter ?
* ... We are aware that the term " shemale " may be used as a pejorative , but we are here referring to the narrowly defined term used in the adult industry for certain models .
One does not need to be an expert in any of these fields to see the problems inherent in the Ogas and Gaddam approach of inferring brain function from data on netporn usage ( broadly construed ) and unscientific polls .
But
The structure and activity of our subcortical circuits are shaped by neurohormones such as testosterone , estrogen , oxytocin , progesterone , and vasopressin ; these circuits function differently in men and women .
As cognitive neuroscientists , we draw upon a wide variety of empirical data sources to model these circuits , including brain imaging studies , primate research , cognitive science experiments , machine learning algorithms -- and behavioral data .
The Internet offers large , unprecedented sources of data on human activity : one of these data sets is fan fiction .
We 're deeply interested in broad - based behavioral data that involves romantic or erotic cognition and evinces a clear distinction between men and women .
Fan fiction matches this criteria perfectly .
Let us make clear , however : fan fiction is not the subject of our research .
Our subject is the human brain .
For us , fan fiction is a wonderfully rich source of data -- like single - neuron recordings in rhesus monkeys -- albeit a unique and invaluable one .
... because fan fiction is just as precise as single - unit recording at revealing putative sex differences in subcortical circuits .
In spite of a wink and a nod to " erotic cognition " Ogas & Gaddam reveal elsewhere in their manifesto that they 're not at all interested in cortical function .
Furthermore , were the ethics of conducting research on human subjects taken into consideration ?
Did the pair have proper approval from Boston University 's
I called the Boston University IRB office .
The direct approach works .
They 've gotten a lot of emails regarding Dr. Ogas .
He is no longer in any way affiliated with Boston University , except as a recent graduate .
They have asked him to stop using his official Boston University email address in connection with this project , or his website .
He is officially on his own , and this project is NOT IRB APPROVED .
That is the official status as stated by the Boston University IRB office .
And in the end , from a neuroscientific viewpoint , the premise of their work was fatally flawed .

The poll was taken down ( although you can view the questions elsewhere : part 1 part 2 ) and the LiveJournal deleted ( but here 's a remnant ) :
This article was originally published in VSJ , which is now part of Developer Fusion .
The whole premise of Silverlight was that it should be .NET for the browser .
That is , a well - educated .NET programmer should be able to simply start a Silverlight project and work on it without knowing anything radically new .
It is arguable that Silverlight versions 1.0 through 3.0 have n’t really made this promise come true .
Now we have Silverlight 4 and perhaps it is time to take the promise seriously .
Take a few simple steps and you might be surprised at just how quickly a Silverlight project can be yours and , more to the point , how little extra you need to learn .
The beta of Silverlight 4 was announced at PDC 2009 and was immediately made available for download .
Perhaps more importantly , Visual Web Designer 2010 Express and Visual Studio 2010 betas both have tools incorporated that for the first time make working with Silverlight seem as easy as working with a forms or WPF - based application .
Indeed , given Silverlight uses WPF , as long as you are familiar with it then creating a web application should be almost second nature .
First , download Visual Web Designer 2010 Express .
You can use the full Visual Studio 2010 if you want to , but the Express version is all you need to evaluate Silverlight .
To upgrade to Silverlight 4 , download the Tools for Visual Studio .
With the tools installed you can now target either Silverlight 3 or 4 , according to how you set the project ’s properties .
Once you have Web Designer 2010 installed , simply start a new project using File , New Project and select either Visual Basic or C# and then select the Silverlight group .
Finally select Silverlight Application – this is the simplest Silverlight project you can create .
This might be the simplest of projects but you still might be concerned at the apparent complexity of the files and folders listed in the Solution explorer .
In fact this is an attempt to make the development process easier by providing you with a ready - made website and page to test the Silverlight application .
If you examine the project structure you will see that there are two distinct projects – the one with the name ending .
Web is the website .
The actual Silverlight application can be seen in the project called SilverlightApplication1 or whatever name you assigned .
If you focus on the Silverlight application you should recognise the basic structure of a .NET application .
There is the MainPage . xaml XAML file and its code behind MainPage.xaml.cs ( or vb ) .
This is where your application code mostly resides .
The App.xaml and App.xaml.cs contain the code that gets your application started .
If you would like to simply run the application , use Debug , Start Debugging or press F5 , then you should see a browser open with what looks like an empty page .
If you dismiss the browser , or stop debugging , you can add some details to make the page look less empty .
Load the MainPage.xaml file into the designer and if you are in the least bit familiar with WPF you should recognise the XAML code that generates the page .
By default a grid layout has been use and you can now use the Toolbox to drop a button onto the page .
Again you should recognise the XAML code added by the designer .
< Grid x: Name= " LayoutRoot " Background = " White " > < Button Content= " Button " Height = " 23 " HorizontalAlignment= " Left " Margin= " 146,139,0,0 " Name= " button1 " VerticalAlignment = " Top " Width = " 75 " /> </ Grid>
private void button1_Click ( object sender , RoutedEventArgs e ) { MessageBox .
Show ( " Hello Silverlight World " ) ; }
If you now double - click on the button you will be transferred to the code editor ready to enter instructions into the button ’s click event handler .
To give the button something to do let ’s just pop up a messagebox with a hello world message :
Now if you run the application again you will see a button and if you click it then a messagebox pops up as requested .
This should seem all so familiar that it verges on the dull and boring but … notice that this now works in any browser that has a Silverlight plug - in – e.g. Firefox as well as IE .
It is also a client side technology .
The page that you are viewing in the browser happens to be an ASP .
NET page , but if you change the URL to end .html then you will see the same button and the same behaviour .
The test website set up by the Visual Web Developer contains an ASP.
NET page and a standard HTML page which can be severed by any web server .
What this means is that you can integrate Silverlight , and hence .NET , with any web technology you may already be using .
You can use much of what you already know about WPF and .NET in general .
For example , if you want to draw a line on the page you can use :
Line myLine = new Line ( ) ; myLine.X1 = 1 ; myLine.X2 = 50 ; myLine.Y1 = 1 ; myLine.Y2 = 50 ; myLine .
Stroke = new SolidColorBrush ( Colors .
Black ) ; LayoutRoot.Children .Add(myLine ) ;
This should be familiar as a use of a basic WPF drawing object , i.e. Line .
The idea is you create the Line object , customise it and then add to the grid ’s children after checking the XAML to discover the name generated for the grid .
If you run the program above you will find that it draws a retained mode diagonal line – i.e. there is no need to buffer the drawing to make the line persist when the page is covered , the redraw is automatic .
So what more is there to say about Silverlight ?
As I ’ve hinted presumably you know it all already ?!
Well not quite .
Silverlight is running in a browser and this makes a lot of difference .
Your programs need to interact with the browser , its navigation and the user in ways that are n’t quite the same as when running a desktop application .
In addition there is the not - unimportant fact that the Silverlight .NET
Class framework is n’t an exact copy of the entire .NET Class framework that you are familiar with .
In fact you will very quickly discover that under Silverlight there are a lot of missing and modified facilities .
There is much to learn if you want to make your Silverlight application standout .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
A huge portrait of Dave Grohl hangs in the Control Room of the Foo Fighters ' Studio 606 .
He 's wearing a smoking jacket , holding a brandy snifter and looks very much like the Man of the Manor -- albeit one in need of a haircut .
At age 40 , Grohl is , without a doubt , the master of his domain here in Northridge , California .
The walls of the industrial complex are lined with dozens of gold and platinum records from his days with Nirvana , Queens of the Stone Age and , of course , the Foo Fighters .
Some -- from France and Germany -- are little works of art , elaborately displayed in shadow boxes or gothic frames .
Others -- like those from the United States -- are more utilitarian .
Grohl points out a nondescript plaque from the Foos ' self - titled debut album in 1995 .
It contains a cassette with a fake metal finish .
" The first record was a demo tape , " he says .
" This is my favorite one right here .
Platinum cassette , baby !
Yeah ! "
It seems that everything Grohl touches turns to gold -- or , in his case , platinum .
Instead of going into a tailspin in 1994 , when Kurt Cobain 's death abruptly put an end to Nirvana , the drummer , then 25 years old , headed into the studio to record what would become the first Foo Fighters album .
He sang lead on all 14 tracks , and played just about every instrument on the record .
Fifteen years later -- with bassist Nate Mendel , drummer Taylor Hawkins and guitarist Chris Shiflett -- the Foos have become one of the top rock bands on the planet , and after six studio albums , six Grammys and an estimated 20 million CDs sold worldwide , the quartet is finally releasing a greatest hits compilation .
And then , the Foo Fighters will quietly slip into indefinite hiatus .
CNN talked to the group members about the break and about the band 's history .
CNN : The new album contains 16 greatest hits .
But in the liner notes , Dave , you say they 're not necessarily your favorite songs or your best songs .
Dave Grohl :
On each album , there 's diversity .
There are songs that are very heavy , and there are songs that are acoustic .
We have fans that love some songs , but dislike others .
And I think even within the band , there are songs that I love that I 'm sure the other guys do n't .
...
I like to think of it as a truck stop cassette .
When you go on a road trip , and when you stop to get some smokes and gas , there 's that little cassette thing next to the cash register with , you know , Kansas ' greatest hits or Dire Straits ' greatest hits .
I do n't want to know about their other songs .
I want to know their greatest hits .
And you put it in , and you listen to it on the drive .
CNN : It 's been 15 years since the Foo Fighters came into existence .
Did you think it was going to go on this long ?
Grohl : No way .
Every time you make one , you sort of imagine that it could be your last album -- because it would n't make sense that anything could last this long , and in most cases , it does n't .
Most bands hang out and make music with each other for a while , until the people get sick of it , or the band gets sick of it .
That has n't seemed to happen with us yet , so it 's kind of nice .
CNN : So what is going on with the Foo Fighters right now ?
Grohl : I think the band decided to take a break not because we wanted to stop making music , but because we thought the world needed to take a break from us .
This greatest hits record -- that 's the end of something , you know .
It 's time to move on into this next chapter or another phase .
Maybe it will be different in whatever way .
I do n't know .
But to be honest , we put our hearts and a lot of thought into what we do , but never so much that anything feels overly calculated or choreographed .
It 's nice to not know what 's going to happen next .
We 're going over to do some shows in Europe ( this week ) , but after that , it 's like I do n't even know when I 'm going to see these guys .
So it 's kind of weird .
CNN : Do you guys get together in the off - times for barbecues , stuff like that ?
Grohl : F*** no !
Are you kidding ?
We just spent five years together !
( Laugh )
CNN : Everyone seems to be working on side projects , but I 've got to ask about Them Crooked Vultures ( Grohl 's side project with Led Zeppelin 's John Paul Jones and Queens of the Stone Age 's Josh Homme ) .
Have you all seen them ?
Nate Mendel : No. I think the L.A. show is coming up , so Dave 's going to be in the hot seat .
Taylor Hawkins : I do n't even have a ticket .
I 'll be on the side of the stage .
I 'll probably be loading Dave 's drums for him .
( Chuckles )
Grohl :
Things are good with the Vultures .
Album 's coming out in a couple of weeks ( November 17 ) .
I love being the front man in the Foo Fighters , stomping around in stadiums and stuff like that .
But to be able to sit back in the back and play the drums -- I do n't even talk into a mic , I just sort of sit there and smile .
( Puts on big goofy grin )
CNN : Do you have any idea what you want to do for the second chapter of the Foo Fighters ?
Grohl : I do know I want to try to make the next record in my garage .
I 'm serious .
CNN : Think you 'll be around for another 15 years , and a greatest hits , part 2 ?
Grohl :
As long as I take my thyroid medicine .
( Laughs )
In popular imagination , at least , the 1970s was the golden age of excess in Hollywood .
This was the decade when the studios were taken over by a new generation of maverick , mostly male , artists and film - makers , whose creative brilliance was matched by their wild feats of self - indulgent hedonism when they were off duty .
Thirty years on , as the media buzzes with the news about the arrest in Switzerland of 76 - year - old director Roman Polanski , and the revelations about the incestuous relationship between Mamas and Papas star John Phillips and his daughter Mackenzie , that golden era of excess begins to look more than a little shabby .
Of course , there was a large amount of myth - making in the way Seventies Hollywood has been memorialised .
The excess was n't only in the Hollywood players ' private lives – it was in the wildly far - fetched stories they and others told about it .
If the cocaine and orgies had been as rife as some chrociclers believe , then the decade surely would n't have given us films like The Godfather , Chinatown , Five Easy Pieces , The Deerhunter , Cutter 's Way , Apocalypse Now , Being
There and the other masterpieces that were produced with such apparent ease .
Nevertheless , books like producer Julia Phillips 's You 'll Never Eat Lunch In This Town Again , Peter Biskind 's Easy Riders , Raging Bulls and former studio boss Robert Evans 's The Kid Stays In The Picture provided enjoyably lurid accounts of the drug - and sex - fuelled decadence of the time .

This was a pre-Aids era .
Directors were young and vain enough to think that promiscuity carried few risks and that the drugs would n't frazzle their brains .
There was a sense of droit de seigneur – the notion that the best film - makers were the equivalents of the old feudal lords who used to have the right to copulate with their vassals ' brides on their wedding nights .
Photo - shoots with starlets were just another example of the casting - couch syndrome that had prevailed in Hollywood since the earliest days of the studio system .
In Hollywood , the older man often played the role of Svengali as much as that of exploiter .
As Marina Zenovich 's excellent documentary Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired ( 2008 ) shows , Polanski 's relationship with the teenage Nastassja Kinski , who he met in the mid-1970s and photographed for a magazine , helped set Kinski on the road to stardom .
There are many other examples of real - life couples whose story matches that of the characters in George Cukor 's A Star is Born .
The young starlet outstrips the star who preys on her .
Her career blossoms .
He drifts into obscurity .
You can hardly blame film - makers for behaving with such recklessness after Hollywood let them in during the 1970s .
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the film that helped them break down the barriers , Easy Rider ( 1969 . )
Before Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper burst onto the scene , the old Hollywood system had often seemed hermetically sealed to the outside world .
The studios ran along strictly regimented lines .
Actors were all under contract .
Directors did more or less what they were told .
Read F Scott Fitzgerald 's Pat Hobby stories or his " Crazy Sunday " , and skim through Kenneth Anger 's Hollywood Babylon books , and you will realise that alcohol , sex and drugs existed in Hollywood long before the 1970s .
The 1920s had seen the Fatty Arbuckle scandal .
In 1921 Roscoe Conkling Arbuckle , the hard - living , boulder - shaped , heavy - boozing comedian who had become hugely popular in silent comedy , was charged with the murder of a young starlet called Virginia Rappe , who died in murky circumstances after a wild party in a hotel in San Francisco .
The sensationalist media coverage of the scandal throws into stark relief the idea that muck - raking , celebrity journalism is a new phenomenon .
In Locarno this summer , director William Freidkin ( director of The French Connection and The Exorcist ) spoke eloquently about the " vast change " that took place in American cinema in the wake of Easy Rider .
" It [ Easy Rider ] was made for very little money by people who were complete unknowns and it was a great success .
It was about the American drug culture .
The studios in Hollywood were looking for other young film - makers to make other such films . "
Friedkin himself , Francis Ford Coppola , Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese were among the figures who gatecrashed their way into the new Hollywood .
The films that they made were primarily influenced by the work of European film - makers .
Audiences in their turn became more and more interested in the " new " Hollywood .
Studio bosses may have felt incomprehension and even revulsion at the new Easy Rider subculture but that did n't stop them greenlighting films by young , iconoclastic directors who probably would n't have been allowed into their offices a few years before .
Jack Nicholson 's story is emblematic of the sudden transformation in the fortunes of many young film - makers and actors .
In 1968 , Nicholson had been an out - of - work actor living in Harry Dean Stanton 's basement and working on a very goofy script with Bob Rafelson for the Monkees vehicle Head .
After he played lawyer George Hanson in Easy Rider , he was on his way to becoming an American icon .
Whatever the similarities between the scandals that 1920s and 1970s Hollywood yielded , the two eras were fundamentally different .
By the 1970s , the old studio system had collapsed .
Moreover as William Friedkin puts it , film - makers were passionately interested in and influenced by the events of the late 1960s and early 1970s .
" America was going through a national nervous breakdown .
It started with the assassination of John Kennedy and then the assassination of Martin Luther King , then Robert Kennedy , then the onset of the Vietnam War in which America stumbled very badly and has never really recovered , " Friedkin suggested .
" The 1960s ended with the Charles Manson murders – the murder of Sharon Tate and a bunch of people for no apparent reason at all by a bunch of drug - infested people who were aimless and sort of adrift from the American culture . "
Friedkin , Coppola , Scorsese and Co all emerged in this period , making movies that reflected the upheaval in the society around them .
" We were reflecting what we could perceive , which was paranoia everywhere and irrational fear .
Certainly , my films of the 1970s reflected just that . "
What was happening in the early 1970s Hollywood of The Exorcist and The Godfather had been partially anticipated in the British film industry of the late 1960s .
Swinging London had yielded a series of very bleak and unsettling films .
Donald Cammell and Nic Roeg 's Performance , which had been made in 1968 but not released until two years later , took the ingredients of an East End gangster film and of a 1960s rock - star movie and blended them together to make a phantasmagoric horror film .
Whether it was Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup ( 1966 ) , Joseph Losey 's Accident ( 1967 ) or Roman Polanski 's febrile psychodramas Repulsion ( 1965 ) and Cul - de-sac ( 1966 ) , the best British - made films of the era invariably had a very dark core .
Just because they made such intense and unsettling films did n't mean that the directors in swinging London or , a few years later in 1970s Hollywood , were going to live austere and monastic lives .
Of course , they did quite the reverse .
Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski , who met Polanski in film school and co-scripted his first feature Knife in the Water ( 1962 ) recently testified how startling it was for young film - makers from the communist - era Soviet bloc to experience life in late 1960s London .
Skolimowski came to the city when his film Bariera ( 1966 ) was in the London Film Festival .
He stayed in the Savoy Hotel .
Polkanski took him around him the town .
" Roman was living in Belgravia .
I was very impressed with his situation , " Skolimowski recalls .
" Roman introduced me a little bit to the London scene .
He explained to me what was the King 's Road . "
Polanski even took him to the Playboy Club , where he met Victor Lowndes .
" It was quite an event for a young man .
Suddenly , I was on a dance floor with those bunnies .
As a young man , I had a wild life – as Roman did too .
We were quite similar in our adventures . "
It was the austerity of their backgrounds combined with their rebellious nature and the sheer wealth of temptation on offer that led so many other directors , too , to behave so wildly .
There was something epic and even heroic about their self - abuse .
There was also a sense of an Oedipal struggle .
They often had distrust and contempt for their paymasters , who belonged to a different era in Hollywood , and saw it as a point of honour never to conform or obey .
Much that has been written about the 1970s has been wilfully exaggerated .
Friedkin has complained that Easy Riders , Raging Bulls was based on " garbage and dirt " and " the ravings of ex-girlfriends and ex-wives . "
You 're often aware that the biographers and even the protagonists themselves are engaged in a myth - making process .
All those stories about Sam Peckinpah 's misdeeds or Hal Ashby 's drug - taking and erratic behaviour seem juiced up .
When Julia Phillips goes to quite such lengths to tell us what was in her system the night she won an Oscar for The Sting , you can't help but ask how she can remember all the pharmaceutical details when she was quite so " high . "
British writer Lucretia Stewart recently described how , when she was a schoolgirl in the late 1960s , it was fashionable " not just to admire Nabokov 's Lolita ... as a work of art but also to embrace it wholeheartedly , to regard it as exemplary . "
Stewart wrote of teenage British schoolgirls playing the nymphet to predatory , Humbert Humbert - like older men without quite realising what they were doing .
This is the theme of Lone Scherfig 's excellent and strangely melancholy new film , An Education , based on Lynn Barber 's hugely enjoyable childhood memoirs .
It 's a long way from the 1970s Hollywood of Polanski , Robert Evans , Jack Nicholson and Co to the early 1960s London suburbs shown in Scherfig 's film .
What the film captures , though , is the excitement , pathos and ultimately extreme seediness of the precocious schoolgirl 's affair with the older , ostensibly much more experienced man .
The irony is that the older man ( played by Peter Sarsgaard ) is really the naive one .
Viewers are likely to ask how on Earth he thought he was going to get away with it , as they watch him pick up the teenage girl at the bus -stop .
It 's the same question that could be asked of the satyr - like 1970s Hollywood figures who often seemed to think that they had their own special licences to transgress .
Ironically , the best book about 1970s Hollywood is n't really to do with sex and drugs at all .
David McClintick 's Indecent Exposure : A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street is n't about Jack Nicholson or Roman Polanski .
Instead , it tells the grim and utterly compelling story of Columbia Studio boss David Begelman .
A former talent agent who had represented Judy Garland , Begelman was an inveterate gambler .
He was popular and successful .
With him at the helm , Columbia enjoyed big successes with movies like Shampoo and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
Begelman had everything – status , money , power .
He was even well - liked .
The only problem was that he was a crook of the first order .
His long and slow downfall , which ended with his suicide in a Los Angeles hotel in 1995 , started when he was caught forging cheques for relatively insignificant amounts and embezzling money from actor Cliff Robertson .
When Robertson complained , it was the actor who was vilified .
Hollywood closed ranks around Begelman and Robertson was blacklisted .
What was fascinating about the Begelman story , expertly told by Wall Street Journal investigative reporter McClintick , is the way it shows graft and corruption as being endemic in Hollywood .
A little embezzlement and forgery are seen as very minor misdemeanours .
The Hollywood community reacts with disdain to what it clearly sees as petty score - settling by dreary - minded reporters and disgruntled actors .
If a studio boss wants to steal , why should n't he ?
If a film - maker takes a shine to a starlet , that goes with the territory too .
" The occasional embezzlement , fraud , cheating , and chiselling – serious as they are – constitute symptoms of a more pervasive and subtle corruption , a corruption that is more difficult to combat than outright theft , " McClintick writes in conclusion .
" It is the corruption of power and arrogance ... the corruption that inevitably pervades a large and glamorous institution when that institution is tightly controlled by a handful of people , and thousands upon thousands of other people are clamouring for entry . "
McClintick is writing about Hollywood of the 1970s but his language is eerily familiar to that found in Polanski's Chinatown ( 1974 ) , a film with incest and corruption at the core .
In 1970s Hollywood , the battle - lines were more complicated than they first seemed .
The Easy Rider generation , disgusted by the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War , was n't interested in graft and embezzlement .
This seemingly was the province of an older generation .
Begelman may have flourished in the " new Hollywood " but his roots harked back to earlier showbusiness times .
The wild living of the younger film - makers who came to prominence in the 1970s was , surely , at least partly motivated by their desire to show their disdain for the conservative old - style studio executives and corporate officers .
It was inevitable that the new Hollywood would be short - lived .
Peter Biskind 's book has a final chapter titled " We Blew It " in reference to a famous line from Easy Rider .
The combination of profligate spending and profligate living helped sabotage the Hollywood careers of Coppola , Michael Cimino , Polanski et al .
Their hubris was self - evident , whether it was the belief that they could do what they liked on screen , whatever the expense , or behave how they liked off - screen , whatever the cost in broken lives .
We , the public , were complicit too .
Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired makes it very apparent that the abusive excesses of the film - makers of the era were more than matched by the equally seamy behaviour of the media and judicial system .
This , in turn , was fuelled by the public 's appetite for hearing the dirt .
The double - standards are astonishing .
As has again become evident in the last week , we love to hear this stuff .
We still buy into the idea that 1970s Hollywood was as close as the 20th Century came to Nero or Caligula 's Rome .
Our disapproval comes tinged with prurient curiosity .
Right - wing commentators relish dredging up old misdeeds in all their grisly detail so that they can wax indignant about them all over again .
We wo n't let the fact that a corrupt judge broke his word or that much of the reporting at the time ( and since ) was wildly inaccurate get in the way .
Our minds about 1970s Hollywood were made up a long time ago , and we 're not going to change them now .
Actually , I can't skate worth a damn and I 'm still daydreaming about grabbing a board and attempting to abuse this building as a huge skating ramp .
Granted the photovoltaic panels might trip me up a bit .

Algunos alcaldes de Edomex apenas saben leer , advierten
[ email protected ] ECATEPEC , Méx . —
El diagnóstico del organismo civil que evalúa el desempeño de los ayuntamientos en el estado de México , el Centro Integral de Apoyo para el Desarrollo Local ( CIADL ) , es contundente : cerca de 50 mil funcionarios carecen de la preparación para ocupar un cargo público , incluidos los alcaldes , miembros del cabildo , directores y el personal administrativo .
La falta de formación académica implica que los funcionarios no cuentan con el perfil profesional requerido para un puesto de responsabilidad , lo que se traduce en una mala conducción de la administración y baja calidad de los servicios a la población , advirtió el coordinador del CIADL , Jorge Godínez .
Laura Benhumea González , coordinadora de la Maestría de Administración Pública y Gobierno de la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales de la Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México ( UAEM ) , señala que algunos alcaldes apenas saben leer y escribir .
Jorge Godínez dijo que la Ley Orgánica municipal debe modificarse para que se exija a los directores de los municipios conurbados , que son los más poblados y los que enfrentan más problemas para la dotación de servicios , contar con perfiles profesionales que permitan mayor certidumbre sobre la calidad del desempeño de sus funciones .
El Instituto de Administración Pública del Estado de México da cursos de capacitación para los funcionarios , pero a las autoridades no les interesa hacerlo , dice Godínez .

The last Jew in Afghanistan : Caretaker of Kabul synagogue survives conflict with good luck , whisky and donations from friendly Muslims
Zebulon Simentov lives , eats and prays alone as he is the last known Jew in a country dominated by conservative Muslim culture .
Mr Simentov is the caretaker and sole member of Afghanistan 's only working synagogue .
The last eight or nine Jewish families left after the 1979 Soviet invasion , he said .
Fond of whisky and aged about 50 , Mr Simentov lives in the dilapidated two - story synagogue in Kabul and gets by on donations from Jews abroad and sympathetic local Muslims .

In the late 19th century , Afghanistan 's Jews numbered about 40,000 , many of them Persian Jews who had fled forced conversion in neighboring Iran .
Beginning with an exodus to Israel after it became a state in 1948 , the community has been in decline ever since .
Mr Simentov 's wife and children moved to Israel years ago , but he stayed even through the Taliban regime .
Mr Simentov pours himself a cup of chai during Shabbat dinner in his Afghan home
Though Mr Simentov has a Muslim friend who visits a few times a week , he spends most of his days in the company of his pet partridge , reading a Hebrew prayer book and watching Afghan TV
He was born in the western Afghan city of Herat in 1959 and says Afghanistan is home .
But having survived numerous beatings under the Taliban , he now only wears his yarmulke , or skullcap , in private .
Until 2005 , Mr Simentov shared the house with one other Jew , but the two feuded and lobbed allegations at each other of having let a sacred Torah scroll go missing and of having spread rumours that resulted in Taliban beatings .
The last known remaining Jew in Afghanistan lights the candles at the start of Shabbat in the synagogue he cares for in Kabul

When his 80 - year - old housemate died , Mr Simentov said he was happy to be rid of him .
Why are people in R&S so sickeningly judgmental ?
Why do you think you take the place of God , judging your president 's soul ?
He worships Christ weekly at an Episcopal church .
I 'm sorry if that does not satisfy your personal whims .
Duh , of course he calls the Quran holy if he is making an address to Muslim leaders .
That is simple respect in their culture .
Mr. Obama represents the United States , not just the Christian faith .
According to the standards of people in this forum , neither George Washington nor Abraham Lincoln were Christians either !
What of it ?
But as I discovered on Thursday , when I watched a Senate hearing on the current Postal Service crisis , that ’s not likely to happen .
For one thing , Mr. Potter is n’t really asking for the tools he needs to turn the Postal Service into a real business .
He is asking Congress to relieve it from the health prepayments , which he is likely to get , at least temporarily .
He is also asking that the Postal Service be allowed to reduce mail service to five days a week , and to eliminate some postal branches .
These are n’t exactly revolutionary ideas  yet they are viewed as highly controversial in Congress , which frets that constituents might get angry if the local postal branch closes .
Image Congress expects the Postal Service , run by John E. Potter , to turn a profit , but also wants a say in its operation .
Credit ... Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times
But even if Mr. Potter were to get his way on these two items , they would still be only stop - gap measures that fail to tackle the bigger question .
As the Internet continues to erode the use of snail mail , does the Postal Service ’s business model still make sense ?
Do we even still need the government to deliver the mail anymore ?

To me , the answer is obvious : no .
Think for a minute about the mail that comes into your home .
In the modern age , very little of it is personal mail .
The vast majority is commercial mail of some sort  advertisements , bills , movies from Netflix or catalogs .
Once upon a time , said Rick Geddes , an associate professor in the department of policy analysis and management at Cornell University , the postal service was viewed as “ a way to bind together the nation .
In subsidizing mail service to rural communities you were keeping them connected to the rest of the country . ”
But today , he added , “ it is kind of silly to say we are binding together the nation through advertisements and catalogs . ”
These days , the main justification for keeping the postal service as a quasi - government entity is the belief that no private company would be willing to deliver the mail to sparsely populated rural areas of the country .
People fear that it would be a little like airline deregulation : communities that were n’t large enough to justify flights in the newly deregulated environment lost their carriers .
But that mission of universal service has all but blinded just about everyone connected with the Postal Service .
Congressmen  many of whom , after all , come from rural areas  are loath to give the Postal Service too much free rein for fear that Mr. Potter ’s minions will start shutting down post offices .
( Never mind that 2,000 of them serve fewer than 100 people each . )
The postal unions , with their no - layoff clauses , have used universal service to justify benefits so generous the Postal Service would save $ 600 million just by bringing them in line with other federal employees .
As for Mr. Potter himself , while he may want more freedom to run the Postal Service like a real business , he , too , seemed surprisingly wedded to outmoded ideas about mail service in America .
“ This country needs to have and to protect universal service , ” he said .
“ Our business is all about making sure every American can stay connected with every other American . ”
I failed to ask him the obvious follow - up question :
Do n’t e-mail messages now do that ?
For most of us , of course , it does  and that will increasingly to be the case , as broadband makes it way into , yes , even those rural areas that everyone is so worried about .
Michael A. Crew , a professor of regulatory economics at Rutgers told me that that while the Postal Service ’s “ short - term situation is bleak , its long - term situation is really bleak . ”
He is one of a number of experts who say they believe that even when the recession ends , the Postal Service ’s woes wo n’t be over .
As businesses look to save money in the recession , for instance , they are starting to do end - arounds the Postal Service .
Online bill - paying is become ever more popular .
Evite is starting to replace mailed invitations to parties .
None of that business is ever coming back .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A painstaking analysis of thousands of genes and the proteins they encode shows that human beings are biologically complex , at least in part , because of the way humans evolved to cope with redundancies arising from duplicate genes .
" We have found a specific evolutionary mechanism to account for a portion of the intricate biological complexity of our species , " said Ariel Fernandez , professor of bioengineering at Rice University .
" It is a coping mechanism , a process that enables us to deal with the fitness consequences of inefficient selection .
It enables some of our proteins to become more specialized over time , and in turn makes us more complex . "
Fernandez is the lead author of a paper slated to appear in the December issue of the journal Genome Research .
The research is available online now .
Fernandez said the study drew from previous findings by his own research group and from seminal work of Michael Lynch , Distinguished Professor of Biology at Indiana University and a recently elected a fellow of the National Academy of Science .
Lynch 's work has shown that natural selection is less efficient in humans as compared with simpler creatures like bacteria .
This " selection inefficiency " arises from the smaller population size of humans as compared with unicellular organisms .
" In all organisms , genes get duplicated every so often , for reasons we do n't fully understand , " Fernandez said .
" When working efficiently , natural selection eliminates many of these duplicates , which are called ' paralogs . '
In our earlier work , we saw that an unusual number of gene duplicates had survived in the human genome , which makes sense given selection inefficiency in humans . "
In prior research on protein structure , Fernandez 's team found that some proteins are packaged more poorly than others .
Moreover , they found that the least - efficiently packed proteins are structurally stable only when they bind with partner proteins to form complexes .
" These poorly packed proteins are potential troublemakers when gene duplication occurs , " Fernandez said .
" The paralog encodes more copies of the protein than the body needs .
This is called a ' dosage imbalance , ' and it can make us sick .
For instance , dosage imbalance has been implicated in Alzheimer 's and other diseases . "
Given selection inefficiency , Fernandez knew that paralogs encoding poorly packed proteins could remain in the human genome for quite a while .
So he and graduate student Jianpeng Chen decided to examine whether gene duplicates had remained in the genome long enough for random genetic mutations to affect the paralogs dissimilarly .
Fernandez and Chen , now a senior researcher in Beijing , China , cross - analyzed databases on genomics , protein structure , microRNA regulation and protein expression in such troublesome paralogs .
" The longer these duplicate genes stick around due to inefficient selection , the more likely they are to suffer a random mutation , " Fernandez said .
" Portions of every gene act to regulate protein expression -- by binding with microRNA , for example .
We found numerous instances where random mutations had caused paralogs to be expressed dissimilarly , in ways that removed detrimental dosage imbalances . "
Lynch said one aspect of Fernandez 's research that is potentially groundbreaking is the observed tendency of proteins to evolve a more open structure in complex organisms .
" This observation fits with the general theory that large organisms with relatively small population sizes -- compared to microbes -- are subject to the vagaries of random genetic drift and hence the accumulation of very mildly deleterious mutations , " Lynch said .
In principle , he said , the accumulation of such mutations may encourage a slight breakdown in protein stability .
This , in turn , opens the door to interactions with other proteins that can return a measure of that lost stability .
" These are the potential roots for the emergence of novel protein - protein interactions , which are the hallmark of evolution in complex , multicellular species , " Lynch said .
" In other words , the origins of some key aspects of the evolution of complexity may have their origins in completely nonadaptive processes . "
Fernandez said the research reveals how increasingly specialized proteins can evolve .
He drew an analogy to a business that hires two delivery drivers that initially cover the same parts of town but eventually specialize to deliver only to specific neighborhoods .
" Eventually , even if times become tough , you cannot lay off either of them because they each became so specialized that your company needs them both , " he said .
The more simple a creature is , the fewer specialized proteins it possesses .
Humans and other higher - order mammals need many specialized proteins to build the specialized tissues in their skin , skeleton and organs .
Even more specialized proteins are needed to maintain and regulate them .
This complexity requires that the duplicates of the original jack - of - all - trades gene be retained , but this does not happen unless selection is inefficient .
This is frequently a point of contention between proponents of evolution and intelligent design .
Fernandez and Chen looked at duplicate genes across the human genome and found that the more poorly packed a protein was , the more likely it was to be distinguished through paralog specialization .
" This supports the case for evolution because it shows that you can drive complexity with random mutations in duplicate genes , " Fernandez said .
" But this also implies that random drift must prevail over Darwinian selection .
In other words , if Darwinian selection were ruthlessly efficient in humans -- as it is in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes -- then our level of complexity would not be possible . "

( Idee geklaut von nomnomnom )
Bezüglich der Forderungen gegen das Blog nom nom nom erreichte mich gestern Nacht , etwa eine Stunde nach der Veröffentlichung unseres Artikels , eine Mail von Mathias Broeckers von der taz .
Er hatte Frau Schweitzer erreicht , die ihm angekündigt hatte , „ Leute vom Haken “ zu lassen , „ die nichtkommerzielle Blogs betreiben “ , außerdem stellte er eine Mail von Frau Schweitzer an mich in Aussicht .
Diese kam auch eine weitere Stunde später .
Die Genehmigung von Frau Schweitzer , ihre Zeilen als Stellungnahme zu veröffentlichen , nehme ich gerne wahr und erlaube mir ein paar Anmerkungen .
Lieber Herr Häusler , Also , erst einmal , wenn
Sie etwas über mich veröffentlichen , fände ich es ganz gut , wenn Sie sich vorher an mich wenden würden , das entspricht journalistischen Standards und man erspart sich damit erfahrungsgemäß auch viel Ärger ( stellen Sie sich mal vor , ich wäre Johnny Eisenberg ! ) .
Sie selber betreiben ja eine professionelle Website , wo Sie sich urheberrechtsmäßig absichern und Kommentatoren für Werbung zur Kasse bitten .
Deswegen vermute ich mal , dass Sie mit solchen Formalien vertraut sind .
Zur Sache : Ich habe eine
Art digitale Schleppnetzfahndung veranlasst , um herauszufinden , wer alles meine Artikel nachdruckt .
Das richtet sich vor allem gegen Zeitungen und kommerzielle Reiseportale .
Das Kriterium ist , wurde ein ganzer ( oder fast ganzer ) Artikel abgedruckt , womöglich ohne Namensnennung .
Links darf man natürlich setzen .
Das hat einiges ergeben , und dabei sind auch ein paar Blogs hängengeblieben .
Der Grund , warum das so teuer ist , ist folgendes :
Dies ist ein ziemlich aufwendiger Abgleich , und den mache ich natürlich nicht selber , damit muss man Profis beauftragen , und dann befindet man sich bei den Preisen sozusagen in der Erwachsenenwelt .
Verglichen mit dem , was ein New Yorker Anwalt nehmen würde , ist es übrigens noch billig .
Wer nun ein politisches , nicht - kommerzielles Blog betreibt und das mit einem meiner Artikel aufgehübscht hat , kann sich gerne an mich wenden , ich lasse mit mir reden , ich will ja nicht die zarte Blüte der deutschen Bloggoszene in den Ruin treiben .
Noch besser wäre es , mich ( oder überhaupt jeden Journalisten ) vorher zu fragen , ob man den Artikel verwenden darf .
Es gibt eine amerikanische Website , die regelmäßig Sachen von mir übersetzt , die haben mich vorher um Erlaubnis gebeten , und so ist das auch in Ordnung .
Grundsätzlich ist es aber schon so , dass es nicht erlaubt ist , seine Website mit Artikel und Fotos andere Leute aufzupeppen , auch wenn die einfach so im Internet herumliegen .
Sie können ja auch keinen Obstladen aufmachen , und den mit Äpfeln aus dem Garten Ihres Nachbarn bestücken , bloß weil die einfach so am Baum hängen .
Man kann das aus politischen oder kommerziellen Gründen falsch finden , so wie man ja auch fordern kann , die BVG müsse umsonst sein .
Aber die derzeitige Rechtslage ist halt so .
Ich selber habe auch deshalb etwas gegen Wildwuchs , weil man da auf einer politisch fragwürdigen Website landen könnte , die einem womöglich noch das Wort im Mund herumdreht .
Ich vermute mal , wenn ein Artikel von Ihnen bei einer Website auftaucht , deren ideologischen Ziele Ihnen nicht passen , wären Sie damit auch nicht einverstanden .
Mit freundlichen Grüßen , Eva Schweitzer
Liebe Frau Schweitzer ,
zunächst vielen Dank für Ihre schnelle Reaktion , die mich sehr gefreut hat .
Gestatten Sie mir ein paar Anmerkungen zu Ihren Zeilen .
Bitte verzeihen
Sie dabei die Kürzungen , ich habe versucht , den Sinn ihrer Zeilen nicht zu entstellen .
Also , erst einmal , wenn
Sie etwas über mich veröffentlichen , fände ich es ganz gut , wenn Sie sich vorher an mich wenden würden , das entspricht journalistischen Standards (… ) .
Ich bin kein Journalist , dennoch sind mir grundlegende Standards der menschlichen Kommunikation nicht fremd .
Im Rahmen dieser fände ich es ganz gut , wenn Sie einen kurzen recherchierenden Blick auf den jeweiligen Fall werfen und Privatpersonen ggf. persönlich kontaktieren ( lassen ) würden , bevor Sie Ihren Anwalt quasi „ blanko “ zur Abmahnung und Rechnungslegung bevollmächtigen .
Ich weiß nicht , ob Sie verstehen können , welche Wirkung ein Anwaltsschreiben plus Rechnung auf einen Menschen haben kann , der Leser / innen seines offensichtlich nichtkommerziellen Blogs auf einen Ihrer Artikel aufmerksam gemacht hat und Ihnen damit nichts anderes als seine Achtung ausgesprochen hat .
Die Tatsache Ihrer Abmahnung war uns seit einer Woche bekannt .
Diese eine Woche hatte Philipp mit der Recherche juristischer und auch moralischer Unterstützung und mit dem Versuch verbracht , Sie zu kontaktieren .
Da er auf ihrem taz - Blog keine Mailadresse von Ihnen gefunden hat , nutzte er ihre im Netz gefundene Telefonnummer , unter der sie nicht erreichbar waren .
Der Kollege Markus Beckedahl von netzpolitik.org nutzte derweil leider ergebnislos seine Kontakte zur ZEIT , bei der Ihr Artikel erschienen war .
Ganz sicher hätte man weitere Versuche unternehmen können , Sie zu erreichen , Philipp war vielleicht etwas zu erregt und unsicher ob Ihrer nicht gerade geringen Forderungen und dem harschen Ton des Begleitschreibens .
So bot ich ihm Hilfe an und gedachte zunächst , weiterhin zu versuchen , Sie persönlich zu kontaktieren .
Nachdem ich jedoch das Schreiben Ihres Anwalts gelesen hatte , das ich — pardon — für eine Frechheit halte , verlor ich an einer direkten Kontaktaufnahme das Interesse .
Während Sie also — statt den Betreiber der Website zunächst zu kontaktieren — Ihren Anwalt bevollmächtigten , entschieden wir uns für die Veröffentlichung .
Mit Erfolg : Binnen einer Stunde hatten wir ein Signal , dass die Abmahnung und Rechnung zurückgenommen werden würde .
Oder , um es mit Ihren Worten auszudrücken , dass sie Phillipp „ vom Haken lassen würden “ .
Ich habe eine
Art digitale Schleppnetzfahndung veranlasst , um herauszufinden , wer alles meine Artikel nachdruckt .
Das richtet sich vor allem gegen Zeitungen und kommerzielle Reiseportale .
Das Kriterium ist , wurde ein ganzer ( oder fast ganzer ) Artikel abgedruckt , womöglich ohne Namensnennung .
Selbstverständlich ist es ihr gutes Recht , kommerzielle Anbieter , die Ihre Texte unberechtigerweise übernehmen , anzugehen .
Ich muss aber zugeben , dass ich neugierig wäre , wie viele der im Rahmen Ihrer Schleppnetzfahndung u.U. zu Unrecht abgemahnten , nichtkommerziellen Sites aus Angst und Unprofessionalität einfach bezahlen , ohne sich zu wehren .
Aber das geht mich natürlich nichts an .
Links darf man natürlich setzen .
Das ist äußerst großzügig von Ihnen , liegt aber gar nicht in Ihrem Ermessen .
Das hat einiges ergeben , und dabei sind auch ein paar Blogs hängengeblieben .
Verstehe .
Kollateralschaden .
Kann man nichts machen .
Der Grund , warum das so teuer ist , ist folgendes :
Dies ist ein ziemlich aufwendiger Abgleich , und den mache ich natürlich nicht selber , damit muss man Profis beauftragen , und dann befindet man sich bei den Preisen sozusagen in der Erwachsenenwelt .
Ach , soooo aufwendig ist das gar nicht .
Das erzählen Dienstleister , die sich auf das Abkassieren im Internet spezialisiert haben , nur denjenigen , denen sie dafür das Geld aus der Tasche ziehen können .
Erwachsenenwelt , sozusagen .
Ich denke , dass
Sie verstehen können , worum es mir geht .
Keineswegs unterstütze ich die unerlaubte Nutzung ihrer Texte .
Ebenso wenig unterstütze ich jedoch das ungeprüfte Abmahnen von privaten Websites , die als Tipp an ihre Leser einen Teil eines Textes mit Link zum Original veröffentlicht haben .
Es ist Ihnen sicher nicht entgangen , dass solche Vorgehen seit einigen Jahren einen Wildwuchs erleben , der einige private Blogger bereits in den Ruin getrieben und an vielen Stellen dazu geführt hat , dass sich Menschen kaum noch trauen , auf die Inhalte Dritter hinzuweisen .
Natürlich gibt es Fälle , in denen ich Ihnen sofort zustimme — zu viele schwarze Schafe mit dem Blick auf das schnelle Geld bestücken , oft automatisiert , ihre Sites mit den Inhalten Dritter .
Doch glauben
Sie mir :
Die wenigsten halten das durch , die wenigsten erreichen dadurch eine Relevanz , die für Sie als Autorin eine tatsächliche Bedrohung darstellt .
Und : Blogs fungieren als Medienfilter , als Wegweiser durch den unendlichen Dschungel des Netzes .
Ihr Sinn besteht nicht zuletzt im Verweis auf andere und die wenigsten von ihnen verfolgen kommerzielle Absichten .
Dass es sich im Fall von nom nom nom um einen netten Hinweis auf ihren Artikel hält und außerdem keineswegs um ein Blog mit „ gestohlenen “ Inhalten , konnte man innerhalb von Sekunden feststellen .
Schade , dass
Sie sich diese Mühe nicht gemacht haben .
Kommentare zu dem Rest Ihrer Belehrungen möchte ich mir an dieser Stelle sparen , da sie wenig zur Sache beitragen würden .
Auf Ihren Blogeintrag zum
Thema gehe ich jedoch gerne noch ein .
Dort schreiben
Sie unter anderem :
Die ZEIT schrieb mir , ich schrieb zurück , ruhig , ruhig , wir einigen uns schon , geben Sie dem jungen Mann mal meine Emailadresse .
Schade , dass die ZEIT dies anscheinend nicht getan hat .
(… ) ein gewisser Johnny schrieb über den Fall , selbstredend , ohne sich vorher mit mir in Verbindung zu setzen , wir reden ja von Deutschen .
Mein vollständiger
Name steht , sogar korrekt geschrieben , unter jedem meiner Artikel .
Mein Desinteresse daran , Sie zu kontaktieren , habe ich oben bereits ausgeführt .
Ich sehe keine Veranlassung , mich an jemanden zu wenden , der mit Kanonen auf Spatzen schießt und es nicht schafft , eine klärende Mail zu schicken , bevor er seinen Anwalt Rechnungen schreiben lässt .
Eventuell hätte ich mir dafür auch noch Ärger mit Ihrem Anwalt eingefangen , könnte gut sein , wir reden schließlich von einer Deutschen in Amerika .
Ich könnte jetzt im Rahmen einer kostenpflichtige Gegendarstellung dies und das richtigstellen ( ich war zum Beispiel nie ein Hippie ) (…)
Unfug .
Was würden Sie richtigstellen wollen ?
Die Angaben zu Ihrer Person entstammen ihrer eigenen Biografie und ich habe Sie nicht als Hippie bezeichnet ( Update : In den Kommentaren taucht der Begriff „ Hippie “ auf ) .
Den ursprünglichen Satz , sie wären Hausbesetzerin gewesen , habe ich nach wenigen Minuten korrigiert , denn sie haben sich nach eigenen Angaben lediglich „ in der Hausbesetzerszene engagiert “ .
„ Eigentum ist Diebstahl “ und so , dieser ganze Kinderkram .
(… ) es brach eine große , große Aufregung aus ( …)
Liebe Frau Schweitzer , Ihre offensichtliche Neigung zur Selbstüberschätzung in allen Ehren , aber Sie haben anscheinend noch keine „ große , große Aufregung “ erlebt .
Die Sache war doch im Grunde nach wenigen Stunden — glücklicherweise und durch Ihr Einlenken — durch .
Das hier ist nur der Bonus - Track .
(… ) verbunden mit der Drohung , mir eine „ Avalanche “  von Kommentaren zu schicken (…)
Man hat Ihnen gedroht ?
Das tut mir leid , denn im Gegensatz zu Ihnen ( ich zitiere aus ihrem gleichen Blog - Eintrag : „ Mein Anwalt schickte also ein paar Drohbriefe “ ) halte ich sehr wenig von Drohungen .
Ich habe keine solche gegen
Sie ausgesprochen und hoffe ehrlich , dass dies auch niemand anderes getan hat .
Muss ja aber , sonst würden
Sie das so sicher nicht veröffentlichen .
Darf ich fragen , von wem das Zitat der „ Avalanche “  stammt ?
Es kam dann aber keine Avalanche , sondern nur ein paar .
Vielleicht knete ich die einfach mal zusammen und veröffentliche die im nächsten Post .
Nun , aktuell befindet sich zumindest unter dem Artikel , aus dem das Zitat stammt , kein einziger Kommentar .
Und falls Sie Kommentare per Mail bekommen haben : Die würden
Sie doch nicht wirklich ohne Genehmigung veröffentlichen , oder ?
Briefgeheimnis und so ?
(… ) was Philipp angeht , ich habe immer noch nicht die leiseste Ahnung , wer das ist (…)
Warum sollten
Sie das auch wissen , schließlich wollten Sie ja niemanden kennenlernen , sondern nur 1.200,00 Euro von ihm kassieren .
Man findet bei nom nom nom übrigens sehr leicht eine Kontakt - Adresse .
Bei Ihnen nicht .
Was mache ich nun mit Philipp ?
Hier ist mein Vorschlag : Ich lasse die Forderung fallen .
Da er aber offenbar auf dem in - der IT - Welt - wird - nicht - bezahlt - Planeten lebt , sollte er etwas für mich tun , kostenfrei .
Ein Hinweis :
Was mir wirklich fehlt , ist ein Apple - Reparaturservice in Berlin .
Schön , dass Sie die Forderungen fallen lassen , vielen lieben Dank dafür .
Ein Gespräch oder ein kurzer Mailaustausch mit Philipp würde

A recent paper by Hyland and Power speculates about an alternative universe in which languages like Haskell develop along a path in which monads do n't play a starring role .
This post will be about making tentative steps in that direction to see what developer - friendly alternatives might exist to solve problems like writing code using I/O in an elegant and readable manner .
I think all of what I 'll say was worked out 20 years or more ago but there may be some good reasons to think about this stuff again .
We 'll need some Haskell language extensionsLet 's start with this problem :
We 'd like to write pure functional code to read input values of typesequentially from some source .
In an imperative language we could define a function taking no arguments and returning type .
It might look like , or even just .
But in Haskell such a thing is impossible .
Unlike in imperative languages , the value of something of typeis a constant so it can't give a different value each time it is used .
How could we implement something like the impossible functionin Haskell ?
Here 's a general sketch of how I plan to proceed :
In some sense we want to add a new language feature to Haskell .
So we need a new language that is Haskell plus .
Rather than write a whole new language , we can just define an embedded DSL using Haskell as our host language .
When we want to performoperations we build an abstract syntax tree ( AST ) for our code in the new language and pass it to an interpreter .
Sounds complicated ,
But the last step will be to show how we can eliminate all of these steps and be left with simple and efficient Haskell code that does exactly what we want .
I 'll show you what the final code will look like for ourexample :
The same methodology will also work for other non-functional features .
We start by defining a type to represent our AST in our read - extended language : I 'm using GADTs because it 's useful to make explicit the type of the constructors .
The reason forandwill be explained by the signatures of the constructors .
Firstly , we need to represent the value of computations of any type that do n't read anything .
So we need a constructor like : Now how should we represent a computation that reads something ?
Well suppose we 're reading something of type ( for input ) from some source .
We 'd like the AST to tell us how such a value would be used once it is read .
We express such an idea by writing a function that takes an input value and maps it to an AST .
In other words : The argument tois an example of a .
It describes how to continue after an input is received .
That 's it .
Now we can write code like
There 's just one thing wrong .
It does n't do anything .
We have the syntax but no semantics .
So we need to write an interpreter .
We have some choice here , but I 'll do something easy .
I 'll make our imaginaryfunction pick off values one by one from a list of inputs .
Here is the implementation .
We interpret anby simply unwrapping it and ignoring the list of inputs :
We handleby picking off the first input , applying our continuation to it , and then carrying on by interpreting the result :
Now we 're ready to go :
One obvious advantage of leaving things as an AST is that we can apply different interpreters to read from different sources .
But if we know what our source is to be we can optimise a bit by completely eliminating the interpreter .
We can do this using a completely generic method that I described here .
Thetype is a pretty standard recursive type .
In our examples we build a type , but when we interpret we immediately tear it apart again in a reduction operation .
The reduction is an example of a generalised fold .
Following what I described in that earlier post , the reduction operation looks like this :
If you look atyou can see there are two parts .
There 's the part that does the work of picking off inputs , and there 's the part that recursively appliesprovides the latter so we only have to implement the former .
So we now get :
Now comes the magic step described in that earlier post .
Rather than separately build a tree , and then fold it , we can fuse the two operations together by simply replacing the constructors with the arguments to And now we can test the first example :
All that remains is to work out the details of some more examples .
An obvious one is a writer .
In an imperative language we 'd expect a signature like .
Our AST will need a node to represent a write operation .
It 'll need to contain both the written value , and the continuation .
In this case the continuation does n't actually depend on a hypothetical input , it 's just another AST .
So we get Again we need to interpret .
We can do this a bit like themonad .
The final value will be a pair consisting of a value and a list of outputs .
And now we can implement things like : Again we can construct a fold for this type :
And eliminating the fold gives us : Maybe you might have guessed an implementation like that without going through the AST .
But it 's good to step back and look at the pattern emerging here .
For an imperative function of typewe want an AST constructor of type , whereis the type of our tree .
Figuring that out gives us a half - way point making the job of writing our interpreter slightly easier .
You can sort of read the signature as saying " there 's no function mapping mappingdoing what I want , but imagine I had one anyway , what would I do with the result it gave me ? " .
But , if you look closely at the definition ofyou might notice that it is , in fact , a type of list structure .
It 's basically a list of elements of typeterminating in an element of type .
All the interpreter is doing is converting it to a conventional list structure .
And if you go back to the definition ofyou'll see that it too is exactly the right type for the class .
It 's a sort of dual to a list , one that consumes elements as you work along its length rather than yielding them .
We only need an interpreter because we want to apply this object to a specific datatype , a list of inputs .
The fact that we can derive these types automatically from signatures is a really wonderful and deep point that I 'm going to have to return to in another post .
Usually , when you implement a monad , you have to come up with a type that can express the semantics you want .
But that type can ( in some sense ) be derived automatically from the signatures of the operations you want , and some equations specifying how these operations interact .
We can now try to comine the writer and reader to handle simultaneous input and output :
The interpreter is very similar to each of the individual interpreters .
It applies our AST to a list of inputs and gives us back a pair consisting of a return value and a list of outputs :
The corresponding fold function is an amalgam of the previous ones :
But we 're not just limited to these kinds of side - effects .
We can also play with control flow .
For example , consider an imperative function of tyethat throws a value out of our computation to the top level .
If we followed the description above we'd be tempted to replace that with something of type , just like with .
But that type uses a continuation to say how to proceed after writing .
We do n't want there to be any continuation , we just want to bomb out with the thrown value .
So the type we need is actually You might recognise that .
It 's just .
But we can go through the motions anyway :
On its own that 's not a very useful example .
Still , it gives a warmup for a much more interesting control - flow affecting example .
Suppose we want to implement the imperative functionthat forks one process for each element of the list with each fork getting that element as the return value .
Sowould result in three threads , one with , one withand one with
The following line follows directly by applying the principle I described earlier toNow we need an interpreter .
The state of the system at any time is a list of values , one for each thread .
So we can useWhen we fork , we want to apply the continuation to each element of the list .
We 'll then have a list of lists of threads which we collect together into a single list using Again we can write this as a fold :
And the interpreter - free version is : I hope that looks familiar !
Here 's a recursive example to generate the cartesian product of a bunch of lists :
This section is just to give a taste of some deeper stuff going on .
The problem to solve is this : given two side - effectful " extensions " like those above , how to you combine them and still keep functional purity ?
As above , given just the signatures of the " functions " in our extensions to Haskell we can build a datatype .
These signatures form part of the description of an .
The other part is a set of equations , something I skipped above .
For example , if I had talked aboutthen we might have an equation stating that if we do a , followed by twos , then thes would both " get " the same value .
With a bunch of signatures and equations , the corresponding type , and even a monad , follow automatically .
( You can probably see the monads lurking behind all of my examples above . )
Now , when we write two monads , there is no automatic way to combine them .
We have to instead write monad transformers and there is no theory for how to automatically construct them .
On the other hand , there are ways to automatically combine algebraic theories ( and hence the monads derived from them ) .
So the latter approach seems like it could be much more powerful .
The theory is the primary thing , the monad is just something derived from it .
But the catch is that when I said " automatically " I meant in the sense that there is a precise mathematical description .
It 's not clear to me yet how to turn the entire process into something that a compiler could perform for you .
And the goal is n't really to eliminate monads .
In fact , do - notation is a great way to work and gives nicer looking code than my examples .
It 's just that maybe we need to be thinking about the theories first and monads second .
Anyway , on a tangent , here 's a bit of code I spun off from the above that runs as a self - contained example in its ownfile .
I tweakedandfor the IO case by using the constructorto construct heterogeneous lists instead of usingto construct homogeneous lists .
I then feed the outputs of a pair of IO expressions into each other as inputs .
The result is a type - safe way to implement simple imperative looking coroutines in a couple of lines of code .
Good for playing with protocols as a opposed to algorithms :
Stamattina sono stato ( immagino per l'ultima volta ) tra gli ospiti di Omnibus , il bla bla di politica in onda all ' alba su La7 .
Qualche backstage e qualche nota a caldo .
1. Fuori onda , Pierluigi Battista ha scommesso con gli astanti « la sua reputazione » sul fatto che il Lodo Alfano verrà approvato dalla Consulta .
Non ho idea di quali fonti abbia Battista , ma curiosamente non ha ripetuto la scommessa in onda .
Mi limito ad aggiungere , per chi non lo sapesse , che Battista è uomo piuttosto potente a Roma e con ottime conoscenze nei giri « giusti » , diciamo .
2. Sempre fuori onda , Battista ha sostenuto che se il risarcimento di 750 milioni stabilito dal tribunale civile diventasse esecutivo , « Mediaset chiuderebbe » .
SIngolare tesi , anch 'essa stranamente non ripetuta in onda .
Intanto perché si parla di Finivest - non di Mediaset - che peraltro ha in cassa liquidità per oltre un miliardo di euro , e poi perché Mondadori in 18 anni di proprietà abusiva del Cavaliere ha fruttato 1,2 miliardi di utili netti , quindi mezzo miliardo in più del risarcimento stabilito .
E comunque per non pagare il risarcimento in questione bastava non corrompere il giudice , mi pare .
3 . Per aver fatto notare a Battista queste cose in diretta ( senza alcun attacco personale nei suoi confronti ) l'editorialista del Corriere mi ha detto che io sono « l ' Emilio Fede di De Benedetti » .
E ' la consueta arma dei manganellatori : in assenza di argomentazioni , vai con l'attacco personale , umiliante , all ' olio di ricino - sei un servo del tuo padrone .
L'idea che uno abbia idea proprie , non insufflate da padroni , neppure li sfiora , forse perché loro non ne hanno mai avute .
Comunque , ho chiesto in diretta a Battista di non insultarmi , lui mi ha risposto che " Emilio Fede " non è insulto , io gli ho risposto che invece sì , poi il conduttore ci ha fermati .
Mi piacerebbe fare querela ( ovviamente non la farò ) solo perché un tribunale della Repubblica possa stabilire che " Emilio Fede " è un insulto .
4 . Il medesimo Battista , che fuori onda mi dava del tu , in onda mi ha chiesto di dargli del lei .
Boh .
5 . Tra i presenti , si è discusso venti minuti su quanto era stato sgarbato Di Pietro con Napolitano , e nessuno che avesse un ' idea del fatto che lo scudo fiscale estingue reati che prevedevano fino a sei anni di carcere , quindi ha effetti di amnistia , e per fare una legge di amnistia ci vuole una maggioranza qualificata di due terzi del Parlamento , che invece non c'è stata , quindi Napolitano avrebbe avuto ottimi motivi per rinviare la legge alle Camere per un secondo esame .
Non mi sembrava un concetto difficile né da capire né da comunicare in tivù , dove invece il centro della discussione è stato il mancato bon ton di Di Pietro .
6 . A un certo punto ho fatto capire che a mio avviso , anche per raggiunti limiti d'eta , Napolitano non è più lucidissimo .
Mi riferivo peraltro a un video appena mandato in onda , durante il quale era piuttosto evidente un certo obnubilamento .
Il conduttore mi ha tirato le orecchie nella pausa , credo che abbia paura del reato di " vilipendio del capo dello Stato " .
Non ho vilipeso nessuno , ma in ogni caso vorrei sollevare se possibile La7 da ogni responsabilità prendendomela per intero ( io ormai mi sa che me la sono giocata , ma non vorrei che per causa mia non invitassero più a parlare - nemmeno loro - nessun altro di questo giornale ) .

User Stories are one of the key agile artifacts for helping implementation teams deliver the most important capabilities first .
They differ from use cases in some important ways , but share more commonalities than you might think .
User Stories Applied
Mike Cohn wrote User Stories Applied : For Agile Software Development .
It is the book for understanding how to write , estimate , and use user stories .
If you ’re thinking about trying out “ agile ” for the first time – and you have n’t read his book , you need to .
He provides great detail and anecdotes about how to write , manage , and utilize user stories .
What are user stories ?
A user story is a user - centric description of the goals that one or more people will achieve by using your product .
User stories are applicable whenever there is a person , interacting with an interface to a product , to achieve a goal .
They are n’t just for software – even though the tone of this article may imply it ( since I live in a software mindset most of the time ) .
A user story is written in the format
As a [ person in a role ] I want to [ perform some activity ] so that [ some goal is achieved ] .
That ’s it .
No more .
Perfectly atomic , very concise and unambiguous .
Where did this elegant idea come from ?
User -centered design ( UCD ) is an approach to product design that can almost be considered a philosophy .
In college , I used to say that industrial designers designed things from the outside in , and engineers designed things from the inside out .
The ideal products are the ones that marry form ( outside ) and function ( inside ) in an elegant solution that blurs the lines of distinction .
The first designers of engineered products were the engineers , and the first designers of software were the programmers – they were the only ones who knew what could be accomplished .
Anyone who has used an application with a user interface designed by a database expert can remember what that was like .
Eventually , someone successfully adopted the mindset of designing a product based on what someone could use it to do instead of looking at what it could do and figuring out how to use it .
That under - emphasizes the importance of UCD , but you get the idea .
Out of UCD come different things that really drive how we create products today .
Kessler and Sweitzer focus on understanding these user goals in Outside - In Software Development .
Stakeholder goals drive ( arguably , are ) requirements .
But it is difficult to develop actionable implementation plans directly from goals .
You need something to bridge that gap .
A user story , in an agile process , bridges that gap .
In Wiegers ’ world of structured requirements , that gap is spanned with use cases .
Conceptually , a user story crosses the same chasm as a use case .
A user story defines what people need to accomplish ( e.g. faster call processing ) , in order to achieve the goals of the company ( e.g. lower call - center costs ) , given a solution approach ( write software versus outsource to lower - cost call center employees ) .
Now we find ourselves in a confusing situation – there are user stories , use case scenarios , and at least three different kinds of use cases – formal and informal use cases , and use case briefs .
How are they different , and how are they the same ?
Usage Descriptors
Use cases , use case scenarios , and user stories all document descriptions of how a product will be used .
They vary , along a continuum , in terms of the amount of overhead required to create each .
Formal use cases require the most effort .
They have a lot of pomp and circumstance going on , but they describe all the permutations of how some person does some activity ( or its variations ) .
Informal use cases are pretty much the same – just less formal .
The challenge is to provide the right level of detail , without the guide - rails of the formal use case to remind you .
Use case briefs have almost no overhead , but have the same “ how much is enough ” challenges of informal use cases , only more so .
Think of it as a single - paragraph description of a formal use case .
User stories have the least overhead , and provide the least context .
Use case scenarios are a slightly different breed .
Like a user story , a use case scenario describes one path through a multi- path use case .
But you ca n’t ( or at least I ’ve never seen anyone ) create a use case scenario without first creating the formal use cases .
This artifact basically combines the weakness of a formal use case ( high overhead ) with that of a user story ( limited context ) .
It can be very handy for developing test cases if your testing team is not well versed in writing test cases .
We ’ll leave use case scenarios out of the rest of the discussion .
The cost of high overhead in documentation comes with a benefit – increased detail .
Because a user story captures a single path through a use case , while having less overhead , it also captures less detail .
This is ok , because an agile process stresses communication over comprehensive documentation .
You start to run into inefficiencies when the amount of conversation ( especially when repeated ) is burdensome .
The amount of conversation required is a function of the amount of domain expertise , or context , that the implementation team already has .
Should I write User Stories or Use Cases ?
It depends on your audience .
The formal and informal use cases , in addition to having more overhead , also provide more context , and allow you to describe more complex usage patterns of your product .
Some uses are so complicated that you have to use a use case to describe them .
Others are so simple that anything other than a story is wasted effort .
The interpretation of complicated and simple , though , is not purely an assessment of what the users want to do – it varies with the level of domain expertise of your implementation team .
Some teams simply are n’t equipped to consume user stories or use case briefs .
You have to write your requirements for the readers , so you need to know when people are struggling to implement solutions based upon stories or briefs , and give them more structure and formality .
You have to adapt to the realities of your current situation , and the experience of your team .
You could replace the words “ Reader Domain Expertise ” with “ Writer Trust of the Team ” if you wanted , and the graph would look about the same .
This is another concept that is critical to a team working effectively – trust equates to delegation .
If you can trust your team to come up with a solution that matches the story , delegate that “ next level of detail ” to them .
If you ca n’t trust them , then do n’t .
But you should .
One of the benefits of agile is that your team will quickly give you a solution , and then you can give them feedback .
If they do n’t create a solution that meets your interpretation of your user ’s needs , then give them feedback , and they will change it .
The agile process actually relies on this dynamic to allow less - verbose artifacts to still be effective .
Someone on the team will sketch out what the solution will look like , and get your feedback , before implementing .
The more this collaboration happens , the more effective a light - weight document will be .
Conclusion
Do n’t just rely on platitudes about stories and use cases .
Think about the nature of the different artifacts .
Think about their strengths and weaknesses .
Consider how you interact with your team .
Should you trust your team ?
Do you trust your team ?
Determine what they need , and give it to them .
Introduction
Through intense self - reflection , it has come to the attention of several Kubuntu developers that Kubuntu is not currently reaching its full potential .
Whether due to major architectural changes in the software stack , the usage of certain Ubuntu technologies or limited developer time , we have realized that deep changes must occur .
In order to fix this situation will do all in our power to make sure Kubuntu stands the test of time .
Project Timelord aims to establish a solid base for Kubuntu to build upon that will last a lifetime .
To accomplish this , we have compiled a list of improvements and changes which we feel need to be made to Kubuntu , as well as a roadmap for implementing them .
The roadmap outlines both immediate and ongoing technical remedies to improve developer efficiency and the overall quality of Kubuntu , as well as plans to promote the growth of both the developer and user support communities in the long term .
A detailed specification of Project Timelord can be found here .
The original brainstorming document can be found here .
Proposed Solutions
The following is a condensed form of the solutions brought forward by Project Timelord :
Following the improvements of Kubuntu 9.10 , translation and localization issues will be dealt with once and for all , to provide quality localization for both KDE and Kubuntu software .
Concrete strategies for publicity , vision , marketing and software branding will be hammered out .
To increase the efficiency of our bug trackers , only serious upstream bugs will be tracked at Launchpad .
This way developers will be able to efficiently track distribution - specific issues without being lost in a sea of upstream bugs .
Measures to ensure the continuing quality of our KDE packages will be put into place .
Over the next few releases a push to improve the integration of Kubuntu - specific tools with KDE and the surrounding system will be made .
A roadmap for these solutions can be found in the full specification document previously linked to .
Help wanted !
Would you like to help Kubuntu achieve world domination ?
We have big plans for the future , and would love help in all areas , including packaging , bug triage , artwork , user support , promotion and much more .
This is going to be big !

This is why the world produces more than 16 billion pounds of coffee beans per year .
It 's actually an alkaloid plant toxin ( like nicotine and cocaine ) , a bug killer that stimulates us by blocking neuroreceptors for the sleep chemical adenosine .
The result : you , awake .
Water
Hot H 2 O is a super solvent , leaching flavors and oils out of the coffee bean .
A good cup of joe is 98.75 percent water and 1.25 percent soluble plant matter .
Caffeine is a diuretic , so coffee newbies pee out the water quickly ; java junkies build up resistance .
2- Ethylphenol
Creates a tarlike , medicinal odor in your morning wake - up .
It 's also a component of cockroach alarm pheromones , chemical signals that warn the colony of danger .
Quinic acid
Gives coffee its slightly sour flavor .
On the plus side , it 's one of the starter chemicals in the formulation of Tamiflu .
3,5 Dicaffeoylquinic acid
When scientists pretreat neurons with this acid in the lab , the cells are significantly ( though not completely ) protected from free - radical damage .
Yup : Coffee is a good source of antioxidants .
Dimethyl disulfide
A product of roasting the green coffee bean , this compound is just at the threshold of detectability in brewed java .
Good thing , too , as it's one of the compounds that gives human feces its odor .
Acetylmethylcarbinol
That rich , buttery taste in your daily jolt comes in part from this flammable yellow liquid , which helps give real butter its flavor and is a component of artificial flavoring in microwave popcorn .
Putrescine
Ever wonder what makes spoiled meat so poisonous ?
Here you go .
Ptomaines like putrescine are produced when E. coli bacteria in the meat break down amino acids .
Naturally present in coffee beans , it smells , as you might guess from the name , like Satan 's outhouse .
Trigonelline
Chemically , it 's a molecule of niacin with a methyl group attached .
It breaks down into pyridines , which give coffee its sweet , earthy taste and also prevent the tooth - eating bacterium Streptococcus mutans from attaching to your teeth .
Coffee fights the Cavity Creeps .
Niacin
Trigonelline is unstable above 160 degrees F ; the methyl group detaches , unleashing the niacin — vitamin B3 — into your cup .
Two or three espressos can provide half your recommended daily allowance .

The Ubuntu Linux distribution has received a major update today .
The new version , Ubuntu 9.10 , will introduce several significant new features and will deliver the latest version of the GNOME desktop environment and other applications .
This is the eleventh release of Ubuntu since the project 's inception five years ago .
The distribution has achieved an unprecedented level of popularity in the Linux desktop ecosystem and has attracted a considerable audience .
Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , touts the new release as its best yet and says that the latest improvements will take the Ubuntu user experience to the next level .
Ubuntu 9.10 , codenamed Karmic Koala , is the first release to include Ubuntu One , Canonical 's new Web synchronization service .
We first looked at Ubuntu One earlier this year during the beta testing stage .
The service has gained several new features , including support for synchronizing contacts from the Evolution mail application and notes from Tomboy .
Users can activate the Ubuntu One service by launching it from the Applications menu in the GNOME panel .
The new version of Ubuntu also offers an improved startup experience with new artwork and significantly improved boot performance .
There are minor usability improvements throughout the entire distribution thanks to the Papercuts project , an initiative launched by Canonical to address user interface weaknesses in GNOME and other upstream projects .
Ubuntu 9.10 has a new framework for programmers called Quickly that will automatically generate code templates to help get application development up and running faster .
GNOME 2.28 , the latest version of the GNOME desktop environment , brings some nice enhancements to Ubuntu 9.10 .
This is the first version of Ubuntu to include GNOME 's Empathy instant messaging client and overhauled audio preferences tool .
Empathy has support for voice and video chat , Adium themes , and a number of other features .
Other important upstream software shipped with Ubuntu 9.10 includes version 2.6.31 of the Linux kernel and Firefox 3.5 , which adds new features like private browsing mode and support for the HTML 5 video element .
" Ubuntu 9.10 gives users more reasons than ever to seriously consider Linux at a time when many are thinking again about their operating system options .
We are delivering a platform for users interested in an easy - to - use , great - looking , web - friendly operating system , " said Canonical COO Jane Silber in a statement .
" A faster , more beautiful boot and login sequence , file and contact synchronisation through online services and great experiences on the most popular notebook , desktop and netbook models continue to drive Ubuntu into the mainstream of computing choices . "
The Ubuntu development community has also released updated versions of the Ubuntu server and netbook editions along with a number of other variants such as KDE - based Kubuntu .
For more details , check out the feature tour and official release notes .
Users can download the new version from the Ubuntu website .
Watch for our detailed review next week .

This year 's Leonid meteor shower will peak early Tuesday , forecasters say , producing mild but pretty sparks over the United States and a more intense outburst over Asia .
" We 're predicting 20 to 30 meteors per hour over the Americas and as many as 200 to 300 per hour over Asia , " said Bill Cooke , of NASA 's meteoroid environment office .
" Our forecast is in good accord with ... work by other astronomers . "
The Leonid shower is made of bits of debris from the Tempel - Tuttle comet , which streaks through Earth 's inner solar system every 33 years .
It leaves a stream of debris in its wake .
Forecasters , however , say it 's hard to know exactly how many of the meteors will be visible .
" We can predict when Earth will cross a debris stream with pretty good accuracy , " Cooke said .
" The intensity of the display is less certain , though , because we do n't know how much debris is in each stream . "
The first stream will cross over Earth about 4 a.m. ET .
That stream should produce about two or three dozen meteors per hour over North America , NASA said .
Experts say people who want to watch the shower , which is visible with the naked eye , should get as far away from city lights as possible .
The darker the sky , the brighter the meteors will appear .
High - altitude sites are best for viewing , reducing glare from the moon , and there 's no particular direction one should look for the best shot at seeing one , they say .
The next Tuesday streams will peak over Indonesia and China shortly before dawn there .
The pair of streams there were actually laid down by Tempel - Tuttle in A.D. 1466 and 1533 , and the two of them crossing at the same time is the reason for the 300 or so visible meteors expected .
" Even if the rates are only half that number , it would still be one of the best showers of the year , " Cooke said .
Share photos , video from the meteor shower
Overall , and especially in the United States , this year 's Leonids are mild .
From 1999 to 2002 , the streams produced outbursts of more than 1,000 meteors per hour .
But one added plus this year , Cooke said , is that , coincidentally , Mars will be passing nearby at the time of the showers .
" Leonids will appear to be shooting almost directly out of the planet Mars , " he said .

THE rise in unemployment that has occurred in the current recession has been hardest on young workers , while having a smaller effect on older workers than previous downturns .
Women have been more likely than men to hold on to their jobs .
The overall unemployment rate , which reached 10.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis last month , remains below the post - World War II peak of 10.8 percent , reached in late 1982 .
But the proportion of workers who have been out of work for a long time is higher now than it has ever been since the Great Depression .
The persistence of joblessness for so many people  5.6 million Americans have now been out of work for more than half a year even though they have continued to seek employment  may provide the greatest challenge for the Obama administration if it decides to seek a new economic stimulus program .
The short - term unemployment rate  the proportion of the work force that has been jobless for less than 15 weeks  has begun to decline , however , and stood at 4.5 percent in October after peaking at 4.9 percent in May .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A man who claims to be the " Godfather of Spam " has been sentenced to 51 months in prison by a federal judge in Detroit for his lead role in an e-mail stock scam scheme , according to court documents .
Alan Ralsky , 64 , also faces five years probation and will have to forfeit $ 250,000 that was seized by the government in 2007 .
U.S. District Judge Marianne Battani also sentenced three others Monday for their involvement in the scheme , including Ralsky 's son - in - law Scott Bradley , 48 , who received 40 months in prison and five years probation .
Ralsky and Bradley were charged for conspiring to commit wire and mail fraud and violating the CAN - SPAM Act , which criminalizes large , commercial e-mail messages sent using an unauthorized computer or with the intent to hide the e-mail 's original source , according to the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan .
They were also charged with committing wire fraud and engaging in money laundering .
Ralsky and Bradley , both of West Bloomfield , Mich. , pleaded guilty to the charges in June .
Ralsky 's history as a prolific spammer dates back to 1997 .
Before the Bush administration passed a law to crack down on e-mail marketers in 2003 , Ralsky reportedly sent 70 million messages a day from fake names .
In the operation that began in January 2004 , the team sent billions of illegal e-mail advertisements to inflate the price of Chinese penny stocks and then reaped the profit , according to the prosecutor 's office .
They raked in nearly $ 3 million during the summer of 2005 .
The prosecution said Ralsky worked with How Wai John Hui , a resident of Hong Kong and Canada , to run the operation .
Hui was also sentenced to 51 months in prison and 3 years of probation , and he agreed to forfeit $ 500,000 .
Hui was the CEO of China World Trade and served as the lead dealmaker representing companies whose stocks were being promoted in the spam e-mails .
Hui plead guilty in December 2008 .
John Bown , 45 , of Fresno , Calif. , was sentenced to 32 months in prison for his role in the scheme .
He will face 3 years of probation and will forfeit $ 120,000 .
" With today 's sentence of the self - proclaimed ' Godfather of Spam , ' Alan Ralsky , and three others who played central roles in a complicated stock span pump - and - dump scheme , the court has made it clear that advancing fraud through the abuse of the Internet will lead to several years in prison , " said U.S. Attorney Terrence Berg , in a statement Monday .
Though the government originally recommended that Ralsky receive up to 87 months in prison , it lowered the sentence recommendation range in November to between 35 and 43 months because of Ralsky 's cooperation .
Ralsky 's lawyer , Steven Fishman , said he believed the sentence was " excessive . "
" It was the most disappointing event that I have ever experienced in 36 years as a lawyer , " Fishman said .
" The sentence was higher than even what the government recommended , and I never imagined that in a million years .
Everyone in the court house was stunned . "
The FBI conducted a 3 - year investigation and indicted the 11 involved individuals in December 2007 .
Five others , who also pleaded guilty , were to be given their sentence Tuesday .
Cases for two other individuals that were indicted were still pending .
Conservative Base Stands Up to GOP in NY Race
Created : October 20 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Doug Hoffman , Michelle Malkin and Dick Armey ( doughoffmanforcongress.com , michellemalkin.com , house.gov )
Asked what he ’d do if he got to Congress , Doug Hoffman hesitates .
He has a few ideas , such as revisiting the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act , putting the breaks on cap - and - trade legislation .
But the idea of winning the Nov. 3 election and becoming the only non-Republican , non-Democrat in the House is a bit much .
The national media would descend on him , right away .
And that still takes Hoffman by surprise .
Image by : Matt Mahurin
“ I ’m not in this to get the splash and the notoriety , ” said Hoffman , “ I ’m only in this , as an average American , standing up and saying it ’s time we take our country back .
But , certainly , if it does encourage other people to get up and do that , then so be it . ”
In July , Hoffman bid to become the Republican Party ’s nominee for a special election in New York ’s 23rd Congressional District .
The nominee would be chosen by party leaders in the district ’s 11 counties ; few people were surprised when they chose Deirdre “ Dede ” Scozzafava , a five - term assemblywoman who ’d voted with Democrats on abortion and labor issues , factors that could help the party hold a historically conservative district that had voted for the Obama - Biden ticket last year .
Hoffman , a 59 - year - old accountant making his first run for office , forged ahead and grabbed the nomination of the venerable Conservative Party .
Since then , Hoffman ’s campaign has become this election cycle ’s great conservative crusade .
On Sept. 5 , the candidate was endorsed by 9 - 12 Candidates , an offshoot of Glenn Beck ’s 9 - 12 Project , and a reflection of the support he was getting on conservative blogs .
On Sept. 28 , both Fred Thompson and the Club for Growth put their weight behind Hoffman , with the Club putting $ 250,000 into TV ads attacking Scozzafava and Democratic candidate Bill Owens .
Those endorsements , coupled with reports that Scozzafava was struggling , brought the American Conservative Union and the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List into the fray to back Hoffman .
On Monday afternoon , FreedomWorks chairman Dick Armey announced that he ’d campaign for Hoffman , putting the Tea Party movement ’s seal of approval on the upstart campaign .
Two weeks out from the election , the battle in upstate New York is being portrayed in the press as a “ civil war ” between Republican factions .
That might understate how much support for Hoffman , and how little for Scozzafava , there is in the conservative movement .
As far as the roiling Republican base is concerned , support for Hoffman has become a test of whether a conservative leader can be trusted .
Conservative media , from magazines to blogs , are using the low - stakes special election to test their ability to drive news cycles and raise money .
“ This is not a tea party hangover , ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser , the president of the Susan B . Anthony list .
“ It is every piece of the conservative base –the Club for Growth , social conservatives , right to work , pro-lifers , everyone –coming together . ’
The timeline of Hoffman ’s surge could become a guide for other conservative rebellions .
On Sept. 14 , The Weekly Standard ran a glowing profile of Hoffman by conservative journalist Kenneth Tomlinson ( “ he joined the Army reserves , got married , started a family , and went to work for Price Waterhouse ” ) , that made the case for a “ Buckley scenario ” in NY - 23 .
Tomlinson ’s reference was the 1970 campaign in which the Conservative Party ’s Jim Buckley , brother of the late National Review Editor - in - Chief William F. Buckley , blew past a liberal Republican and Democrat to win a Senate seat from New York with 38 percent of the vote .
Tomlinson ’s scenario was less eccentric than it may have looked .
Rob Ryan , Hoffman ’s campaign manager , cut his teeth on Buckley ’s unsuccessful 1976 re-election bid ; he came on board after a conversation with John McLaughlin , a Republican pollster who was one of the first to rule Scozzafava out as a credible candidate .
The campaign set about working conservative blogs , conservative media and Tea Party groups who were plugged into both to drive home the message that Scozzafava was a liberal , backed by unions , who would say anything to anyone .
The Republicans who ’ve endorsed her , said Ryan , have “ fallen for a scam . ”
“ I ’ve long said that she ’s the Bernie Madoff of New York Republican politics , ” said Ryan .
“ If you ’re talking face - to - face to Assemblywoman Scozzafava , ” said Hoffman , “ she ’ll tell you what you want to hear and it sounds great .
And then she ’ll talk to another group of people and tell them what they want to hear . ”
Conservative media outlets pushed Scozzafava harder than the candidate could have expected .
A reporter for Human Events got her campaign to say that Scozzafava opposed “ card check , ” labor reform that would make it easier for workers to start unions , while she ’d said the opposite of that in a union questionnaire .
The Weekly Standard asked the campaign whether Scozzafava would promise not to switch to the Democratic Party if she got to Congress ; her noncommittal answer sparked the rumor that she might actually consider bolting the GOP .
Conservative muckraker Michael Patrick Leahy conducted interviews for his TCOT Report web site that pieced together a “ breach of trust ” in the process that selected Scozzafava .
Stories like these motivated the conservative “ netroots ” to jump into the race for Hoffman .
The key mover was Patrick Ruffini , a veteran of the 2004 Bush - Cheney campaign who had programmed fundraising drives that netted hundreds of thousands of dollars for Republican candidates in previous special elections .
But on Oct. 17 , Ruffini endorsed Hoffman , arguing that “ the RNC and NRCC are doubling down on a flawed candidate with little chance of generating any significant momentum in the last 16 days . ”
Coming from a consultant who drove crucial funds to Jim Tedisco , the failed Republican candidate in the June NY - 20 special election , this was an indictment of the GOP .
“ What ’s noteworthy about the comparison between NY - 20 and NY - 23 is that Jim Tedisco was not a textbook conservative either , ” Ruffini told TWI .
“ In fact , his reluctance to oppose the stimulus early on was a factor in his defeat .
Yet the conservative grassroots went all out for Tedisco because he agreed with us on most issues and was a good fit for a district we had a real chance of picking up .
Scozzafava , on the other hand , appears to agree with us on nothing . ”
None of the conservative activists that TWI spoke to were particularly worried about being seen as “ spoilers ” if Owens wins NY - 23 for the Democrats .
David Keating , the executive director of the Club for Growth , said that Scozzafava had no chance of winning anyway , and that nothing could be spoiled .
The Susan B. Anthony List ’s Dannenfelser suggested that a Scozzafava victory might be the worst possible outcome .
“ We ’ve seen this with Olympia Snowe , ” said Dannenfelser .
“ We do n’t need another Olympia Snowe .
We will be dealing with her for the rest of our days . ”
As the campaign draws to a close , Republicans who ’ve endorsed Scozzafava have been scorched by Hoffman supporters .
Conservative blogger and columnist Michelle Malkin , who used her syndicated column last week to label Scozzafava “ An ACORN - Friendly , Big Labor - Backing , Tax - and - Spend Radical in GOP Clothing , ” blasted the RNC and Newt Gingrich for endorsing the candidate .
“ If you have given to the NRCC , RNC , or Newt Gingrich under the impression that they are using the money to support conservatism , ” wrote Malkin , “ you might want to ask for your money back . ”
Later , Malkin posted an RNC mail survey defaced by a Hoffman supporter , and let Hoffman write a guest post on her site .
If the conservative base pulls off the NY - 23 upset , it would get a congressman who backs every one of their key priorities .
In an interview with TWI , conducted while he drove to speak at the opening of his fourth campaign office–one fewer than Owens , three more than Scozzafava– Hoffman sounded conservative notes on taxes , climate change legislation , the stimulus , abortion rights , and gay marriage .
“ The jury ’s out on what ’s really going on and whether we have global warming or not , ” said Hoffman , explaining why he ’d oppose cap - and - trade legislation , “ but we all want to protect our environment . ”
Unlike Scozzafava , he opposed and opposes the economic stimulus package and further bailouts , and said he ’d use whatever clout he had in Congress to stop funds that had n’t been appropriated yet , making an exception for “ infrastructure ” spending .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday declined to block the execution of John A. Muhammad , the sniper who terrorized the Washington area seven years ago .
The step cleared the way for Mr. Muhammad to be put to death on Tuesday unless Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia intervenes .
The court did not comment in refusing to hear Mr. Muhammad ’s appeal , but three justices objected to the relative haste accompanying the execution .
Justice John Paul Stevens complained that “ under our normal practice , ” Mr. Muhammad ’s petition for the court to take his case would have been discussed at the justices ’ conference scheduled for Nov. 24 .
But because Virginia scheduled the execution for Tuesday , the judicial process was rushed , Justice Stevens said in a statement joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor .
Justice Stevens wrote that , having reviewed Mr. Muhammad ’s argument , he did not disagree with the majority ’s decision to decline the case .
Nevertheless , he said , because the court declined to stay the execution , “ we have allowed Virginia to truncate our deliberative process on a matter  involving a death row inmate  that demands the most careful attention . ”
Whatever the starting date , the law makes it much harder for banks to change interest rates on existing balances , and requires more time and notice before a new rate can go into effect .

In their defense , banking officials say they have no choice but to raise rates and limit credit .
Because of the new rules and the prolonged economic malaise , they say it is now far riskier to issue credit cards than it was just a few years ago .
“ We sell credit ; we do n’t sell sweaters , ” said Kenneth J. Clayton , senior vice president for card policy at the American Bankers Association .
“ The only way to manage your return is through the price of the product or the availability . ”
The nation ’s largest banks are scrambling to figure out a new business model that fits within the new rules and current economic conditions .
Those banks made handsome profits over the last decade by charging high interest rates and penalty fees to a small group of customers who routinely paid late or exceeded their balances .
Already , banks are shifting to a model in which a smaller pool of Americans will be eligible for credit cards , and customers with cards will probably pay more for the privilege through annual fees and higher interest .
Meanwhile , the banks are in the process of shedding customers considered too risky .
That means tens of thousands of Americans will no longer be able to splurge on Nike gym shoes or flat - screen televisions unless , of course , they have enough cash to pay for them .
Still , even consumer advocates have said that the banks were too quick in the past to give out credit .
“ You know , it does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you keep borrowing and borrowing in order to consume now , eventually you crash and burn , ” said Martin Eakes , chief executive for the Center for Responsible Lending .
“ That ’s what we ’re facing . ”
This should be on the front page of every newspaper in America — in large bold letters .
This was a “ letter to the editor ” in August 29th Jackson , MS newspaper .
Dear Sirs : During my last night ’s shift in the ER , I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient with a shiny new gold tooth , multiple elaborate
tattoos , a very expensive brand of tennis shoes and a new cellular telephone equipped with her favorite R&B tune for a ringtone .
Glancing over the chart , one could not help noticing her payer status : Medicaid .
She smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and , somehow , still has money to buy beer .
And our Congress expects me to pay for this woman ’s health care ?
Our nation ’s health care crisis is not a shortage of quality hospitals , doctors or nurses .
It is a crisis of culture — a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on vices while refusing to take care of one ’s self or , heaven forbid , purchase health insurance .
A culture that thinks “ I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me ” .
Life is really not that hard .
Most of us reap what we sow .
Do n’t you agree ?
STARNER JONES , MD
Jackson , MS
The item reproduced above is one of several Internet - circulated variants of an 23 August 2009 letter to the editor published by the Jackson , Mississippi , Clarion Ledger from Dr. Roger Starner Jones , a physician who specializes in emergency medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center .
Dr. Jones ’ letter was printed under the title “ Why Pay for the Care of the Careless ? ” and read as follows :
Dear Sirs : During my last night ’s shift in the ER , I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient with a shiny new gold tooth , multiple elaborate tattoos , a very expensive brand of tennis shoes and a new cellular telephone equipped with her favorite tune for a ring tone .
Glancing over the chart , one could not help noticing her payer status : Medicaid .
She smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to purchase beer .
And our President expects me to pay for this woman ’s health care ?
Our nation ’s health care crisis is not a shortage of quality hospitals , doctors or nurses .

A culture than thinks I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me .
Life is really not that hard .
Most of us reap what we sow .
Starner Jones , MD Jackson , MS
On 6 September 2009 , the Clarion Ledger published a follow - up letter from another reader under the title “ Health Care Reform Is Not ‘ Us vs. Them ' ” :
I ’ve been stewing about an Aug. 23 letter to the editor ( “ Why pay for the care of the careless ? ” ) in which Dr. Starner Jones questioned the worth of a patient to receive Medicaid because of her gold tooth , tattoos , R&B ring tone on a new cell phone , cigarette - smoking and beer - drinking .
This kind of personal attack is nothing new with the hateful rhetoric of late .
But it ’s a real slippery slope when one questions whether another human merits support for health care because of appearances and choices .
There are a lot of folks in this state who make less - than - perfect choices about finances and health .
We are the poorest , fattest state , after all .
We need to turn off our TVs and radios and do our own research on health care reform .
All the Fox - fed and MSNBC - led masses are out spewing the same language the pundits are using .
Look at entities who , bottom line , want to raise their ratings and celebrity , not facilitate a meaningful or productive discourse .
This country deserves more .
Read the health care reform bill .
And learn the real issues of our entire community .
We ’re all Americans .
This is no “ us vs. them ” issue .
We are all in this together .
Jennifer Sigrest Clinton
Dr. Jones submitted another letter to the Ledger which was published ( under the title “ America Is Still the Land of Opportunity — for Everyone ” ) on 11 January 2010 :
WASHINGTON  The United States will propose a near - term target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions before the United Nations climate change meeting in Copenhagen next month , a senior administration official said Monday .
President Obama , the official said , will announce the specific target “ in coming days . ”
The announcement of a target will take the current legislative stalemate over a climate bill into account , the senior official said , and thus might present a range of possible reductions rather than a single figure .
The lack of consensus in Congress puts Mr. Obama in a tricky domestic and diplomatic bind .
He cannot promise more than Congress may eventually deliver when it takes up climate change legislation next year .
But if he does not offer some concrete pledge , the United States will bear the brunt of the blame for the lack of an international agreement .
The official also said the president would decide shortly whether and for how long he might attend the December climate meeting , which runs from Dec. 7 to Dec. 18 .
He repeated the president ’s assertion that he would consider attending if his presence could be a useful impetus to a deal .
A Russian rocket will next year for the first time blast off from a European launch pad in South America , officials said Saturday , as the first rockets headed for the site on board a ship .
Two Russian Soyuz rockets , the mainstay of its space programme , were later Saturday to depart the northern city of Saint Petersburg by ship bound for the French overseas department of French Guiana .
Packed in containers , they will arrive 15 days later ahead of the first planned launches next year of Soyuz rockets from France 's Kourou launch site in French Guiana .
" We are in line for the first launch in the second quarter of next year , " the chief executive of French aerospace firm Arianespace Jean - Yves Le Gall told AFP .
Finally confirming the project is ready after a string of delays , he said that the first satellite to be launched by a Soyuz from French Guiana will be the Hylas telecommunications satellite of British firm Avanti Communications .
The satellite will deliver broadband and corporate data network services across Europe , according to the company .
Two other such launches are planned in 2010 -- the Pleiades Observation Satellite and a launch of two satellites in Europe 's Galileo programme .
The first Soyuz launch had been envisaged in 2009 but was delayed due to hold - ups in the delivery of the infrastructure that the rocket needs in order to function .
The move to French Guiana is a major step for Russia , which has mostly relied on the Baikonur launch pad in Kazakhstan from where the first man-made object and the first astronaut were launched into space .
Launching Russian rockets so close to the United States is likely to send a strong message about Russia 's continued role in space .
It brings several other advantages for Moscow , including reducing dependence on Baikonur , which has been the subject of periodic disputes with Kazakh authorities .
French Guiana 's closeness to the equator also enables heavier payloads -- three tonnes compared with 1.7 tonnes from Baikonur -- as launches can gain extra momentum from the Earth 's own spinning motion .

David Letterman 's musical director , Paul Shaffer , hit Los Angeles Wednesday night as part of a tour to promote his new biography with the lengthy title " We'll Be Here For the Rest of Our Lives : A Swingin ' Showbiz Saga . "
He co-wrote the book with David Ritz .
It details his days on Broadway , his " Saturday Night Live " stint and his 27 years working with Letterman .
It 's tough to be out promoting your book when your boss is embroiled in a sex scandal .
Inevitably there will be questions regarding the brouhaha , questions that go unanswered .
Shaffer did say " I 'm not allowed to even talk about that situation .
It 's like an ongoing legal proceeding and as such , you can't comment on it . "
After 27 years on Letterman , you may think Shaffer has seen it all .
Is there anybody he has n't worked with throughout the years ?
Is there someone with whom he 'd really like to collaborate ?
Yes , actually , and it may surprise you :
" I heard Kim Kardashian has a record deal .
Can you get me a meeting with her agent ?
I would like to bring her in the studio and lay down some happening tracks and put my coffee right on the top of her a** and just leave it there . "
Really , Paul ?

A Recipe for Pagination in Django
By Sean Reifschneider Date March 19 , 2008
Introduction
Pagination Tag Snippet
The pagination class in Django is fairly low - level .
While youuse it to implement pagination in Django , you probably do n't need to do that .
This article puts together a number of components to easily do pagination in Django .
Over at djangosnippets there is a snippet for a " paginator " tag .
This is a good start , but it is n't very smart about handling pagination links with direct links to the first and last page , an ellipsis , and links around the current page .
If you want to have pagination links like this , you will need to use my modified version :
3 pages around the current page .
But no ellipsis if we are towards the beginning or end , or if the ellipsis would only cover for one page .
And hide next / previous if at the beginning or end .
So , either get the snippet from the above link at djangosnippets , or use my modified version ( required for these examples to fully work )
Save this into the file " templatetags / paginator.py " in the top level of your application directory .
You can determine where this would be by looking at the value of " INSTALLED_APPS " in your " settings.py " file , for example I had :
INSTALLED_APPS = ( ' django.contrib.auth ' , ' django.contrib.contenttypes ' , ' django.contrib.sessions ' , ' django.contrib.sites ' , ' photoblog.photos ' , )
Which meant I needed to write this to " photoblog/photos/templatetags/paginator.py " .
If you do n't already have a " templatetags " directory , create it with :
mkdir templatetags touch templatetags / __init__.py
Hooking Pagination Into Your View
The " __init__.py " file needs to be there so that the directory can be imported as a module .
Next you will need to make it so that pagination works in your view .
In my case , I 'm using a custom query , but otherwise I can use the " object_list " generic view , so my " index " view looks like :
from django.views.generic.list_detail import object_list def index ( request , format ) : from django.db.models import Q photo_list = Photos.objects.filter ( Q( album = None ) | Q( isalbumleader = True ) ) .order_by ( '- uploadedon ' ) return object_list ( request , template_name = ' index.html ' , queryset = photo_list , paginate_by = 25 )
Your Site - Wide Paginator Template
This tag relies on a site - wide template for what the pagination renders to .
This is handy if you have pagination on many different pages , they will all have the same style .
So , in your " templates " directory you will need a file called " paginator.html " , here is an example of mine :
< div class= " pager " > { % if has_previous %} < span class = " page " > < a href= " ?
page={{ previous }} " >< Prev</a > </ span > { % endif %} { % if show_first %} < span class = " page " >< a href= " ? page=1 " >1</a></span> < span class =" ellipsis " >...</ span > { % endif %} { % for linkpage in page_numbers %} { % ifequal linkpage page %} < span class = " current " >{{ page }}</ span > { % else %} < span class = " page " >< a href= " ?
page={{ linkpage }} " >{{ linkpage }}</a></span> { % endifequal %} { % endfor %} { % if show_last %} < span class = " ellipsis " >...</ span > < span class= " page " >< a href= " ? page=last " >{{ pages }}</a></span> { % endif %} { % if has_next %} < span class = " page " >< a href= " ?
page={{ next }} " >
Next ></a></span > { % endif %} </div >
Call Paginator Tag From Template
This can basically be used un-modified .
The last item to do is to put the paginator tag into your template ( in my case , this is the " templates/index.html " file .
It should look something like this :
{ % if is_paginated % }{ % load paginator % }{ % paginator 3 %}{ % endif %}
The " 3 " is the number of surrounding pages around the current page to show .
In your template , the object_list generic view presents the list of items for the page as " object_list " .
So a minimal full page would be something like :
{ % if is_paginated % }{ % load paginator % }{ % paginator 3 %}{ % endif %} { % if object_list %} < ul > { % for photo in object_list %} < li />{ { photo.name }} { % endfor %}</ul > { % endif %} { % if is_paginated % }{ % load paginator % }{ % paginator 3 %}{ % endif %}
Sample CSS
This example includes pagers both above and below the paged data , and a simple list of the photo names .
The CSS I 'm using to style the above is :
< style type =" text /css " > . pager { padding - top : 20 px ; padding - left : 40 px ; } . pager . page a { border : 3 px solid # bbbbbb ; margin - left : 1 px ; margin - right : 1 px ; padding - left : 4 px ; padding - right : 4 px ; text - decoration : none ; color : # 000000 ; } . pager .current { border : 3 px solid # 444444 ; margin - left : 2 px ; margin - right : 2 px ; padding - left : 2 px ; } </style >
Final Notes
The number of objects per page is specified in the view in the call to object_list ( ) , via the " paginate_by " argument .
You will need to plug your own query into the view .

Joshua found a post over at Letters of Note about this letter , written by an Australian government employee in 1963 to the Director of Trade Commissioner Services , arguing against hiring women :
Text :
WOMEN TRADE COMMISSIONERS ?
Even after some deliberation , it is difficult to find reasons to support the appointment of women Trade Commissioners .
In countries where publicity media is well developed , such as North America and England and where there are no other major drawbacks , such as the Islamic attitude towards women , a relatively young attractive woman could operate with some effectiveness , in a subordinate capacity .
As she would probably be the only woman Assistant Trade Commissioner in the whole area , as other countries employ women in this capacity hardly at all , she could attract a measure of interest and publicity .
If we had an important trade in women ’s clothing and accessories , a woman might promote this more effectively than a man .
Even conceding these points , such an appointee would not stay young and attractive for ever and later on could well become a problem .
It is much easier to find difficulties , some of which spring to mind are :-
( i) Women are not employed , except to an extremely minor degree , as career Trade Commissioners in any known service ;
( ii ) It is difficult to visualise them as Trade Commissioners , firstly because they could not mix nearly as freely with businessmen as men do .
Most mens clubs , for instance , do not allow women members ;
( iii ) Relationships with businessmen would tend to be somewhat formal and guarded on both sides .
This would make it more difficult for a woman to obtain information ;
( iv ) It is extremely doubtful if a woman could , year after year , under a variety of conditions , stand the fairly severe strains and stresses , mentally and physically , which are part of the life of a Trade Commissioner ;
( v) A man normally has his household run efficiently by his wife , who also looks after much of the entertaining .
A woman Trade Commissioner would have all this on top of her normal work ;
( vi ) If we engaged single graduates as trainees , most of them would probably marry within five years ;
( vii ) If we recruited from the business world , we would have a much smaller field from which to recruit , as the number of women executives in business is quite small ;
( viii ) A spinster lady can , and very often does , turn into something of a battleaxe with the passing years .
A man usually mellows ;
( ix ) A woman would take the place of a man and preclude us from giving practical experience to one mail officer .
She could marry at any time and be lost to us .
she could not be regarded as a long term investment in the same sense as we regard a man .
CONCLUSION
It would seem that the noes have it .

13th March , 1963 .
P.S. I have since ascertained the following , which , it would seem , only serves to support the foregoing views –
Mr. H. W. Woodruff , U.K. Trade Commissioner :
They have a few women Trade Commissioners but only in capital city posts , for they have found that women cannot operate where contact with businessmen is necessary .
The women are fairly senior people from the U.K .
Departments and presumably handle trade policy work only .
Mr. N. Parkinson , External Affairs :
Since their recruitments of trainees are made under the Public Service Act , there is no way of precluding women from applying and in fact , many more applications are received from women than from men .
Some are chosen and all appointments are made on the basis of the quality of their educational achievements .
About one woman is appointed to every twelve men .
This year one out of sixteen , last year one out of twelve and the previous year , none .
They have to be trained for 18 months before going to their first post .
The average marries within five years .
It is a very expensive process , but External Affairs lack courage to slam the door because of parliamentary opinion , pressure groups and so on .

In Zukunft auch Zäpfchenbomber ?
Thomas Pany
Der französische Geheimdienst warnt vor Selbstmordattentätern , die den Sprengstoff in den Eingeweiden verstecken
Die französische Tageszeitung LeFigaro ist von ungenannten Quellen aus dem Inlandsgeheimdienst DCRI ( Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur , man spricht vom französischen FBI ) davon in Kenntnis gesetzt worden , dass islamistische Selbstmordattentäter ihre Bomben künftig möglicherweise nicht mehr nur am Gürtel tragen , sondern innerhalb des Martyrer - Körpers , im Darm .
Konkreter Anlass für die Zäpfchen - Warnung ist der gescheiterte Anschlag auf den saudischen Prinzen Muhammad bin Naif bin Adbul Aziz Al Saud im August dieses Jahres .
Der Vize - Innenminister , Sohn des Innenministers Naif bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud , einem Halbbruder des herrschenden Königs Abdullah , ist verantwortlich für die Terrorbekämpfung im Königreich .
Naif entkam dem Anschlag mit Glück und leichten Verletzungen .
Der Attentäter hatte sich laut Berichten in deutschen Medien Zugang zum Vize - Innenminister unter dem dem Vorwand verschafft , er wolle sich bei einem Empfang anlässlich des Fastenmonats Ramadan " stellen " und um Nachsicht bitten .
Beim Nähertreten habe er die Bombe mit einem Mobiltelefon gezündet .
Während Spiegel und FAZ im Sommer davon ausgingen , dass die Bombe " in einem Mobiltelefon " , bzw .
" am Körper " versteckt war , weiß es der Figaro jetzt dank einer brisanten Notiz aus dem DCRI besser .
Dass der Attentäter die Bombe in seinen Eingeweiden trug , hat angeblich eine Untersuchung herausgefunden , über deren Ergebnis und Folgen ein dringliches Treffen der " Einheit zur Koordination des Kampfes gegen den Terrorismus " ( Unité de coordination de la lutte antiterroriste ( Uclat ) ) beriet .
Die Zeitung zitiert einen hohen , ungenannten Funktionär aus dem Innenministerium :
" Eine Bombe eingeführt wie ein Zäpfchen .
Anders gesagt , nicht zu entdecken .
Der Selbstmordattentäter musste sie nur zünden mit Hilfe seines Taschentelephons , die Zerberus - Wächter waren nicht geistesgegenwärtig genug , um es ihm abzunehmen . "
Da sich al - Qaida für diesen Anschlag als verantwortlich zeichnete , geht man in Geheimdienstkreisen davon aus , dass sich der Modus operandi der Selbstmordattentäter weg vom Sprengstoffgürtel hin zu internen Speicherplätzen verändern könnte , was größere Implikationen hätte .
Beunruhigt zeigt man sich in Geheimdienstkreisen besonders im Hinblick auf Flughafenkontrollen .
Um derart versteckte Bomben auszumachen , genügen die bisherigen Kontrollgeräte nicht .
Man müsste Verdächtige mit Röntgenstrahlen durchleuchten .
Dafür wären Geräte in einer Anzahl und einer Belastungsfähigkeit erforderlich , die immens teuer wären .
Dazu kommt , dass derartige Untersuchungen zeitraubend wären und den Flughafenbetrieb vor große Probleme stellen würden .
Selbst wenn man sich auf die Mobiltelefone als mögliche Auslöser konzentrieren würde , ergäbe dies massive Kontrollprobleme ; es sei nicht vorstellbar , dass man von reisenden Geschäftsmännern verlange , ihr Mobiltelefon vor dem Flug in einer Plastiktüte abzugeben .
Das wäre wahrscheinlich selbst für den französischen Innenminister Hortefeux , der intensivere Kontrollen der Flugpassagiere fordert ( z.B. Übersendung der Reservierungsdaten der Fluggesellschaften an die Polizei ) , " un peu trop " .
Dass solche Kontrollen nicht nur mit missliebigen Reaktionen von Fluggästen zu rechnen haben und einen generellen Unmut erregen können , der von Behörden , die sich weit weg von solchen Erregungszone befinden leichterhand in Kauf genommen wirden , sondern zu unangenehmen , nicht einberechneten Konsequenzen führen können - darauf macht das Beispiel der US - Stadt Chicago und deren Olympiabewerbung aufmerksam .
Wie ein Blogger der New York Times berichtet , hat die amerikanische Stadt - ungeachtet der prominenten Rückenstärkung durch Präsident Obama - unter anderem deswegen verloren , weil sie das Gebot der Gastfreundlichkeit , besonders des freundlichen Empfangs Gäste aus aller Welt , nicht erfüllt .
Die Nerven raubenden Sicherheitsprozeduren an den amerikanischen Flughäfen wurden bei der IOC - Befragung als kräftiger Minuspunkt herausgestellt : " eine ziemlich erschütternde Erfahrung " .
The former British prime minister Tony Blair , now an envoy to the Middle East , was branded “ a terrorist ” by a Palestinian protester while on a visit to the West Bank .
The protesters ’ raucous calls echoed through the hall where he was visiting Hebron .
Guards pushed the protester into a corner and “ tried to shut him up , ” according to a news report of the incident .
ADVERTISEMENT
Blair bushed off the protester , saying , “ He made his protest .
That ’s fair enough .
I think it ’s important for you guys as well not always to mistake the protests for the general view of the whole population .
I think people here want to see this issue resolved . ”
The Sydney Morning Herald has more details here .
Blair has faced criticism in the Arab world for his support of the US - led invasion of Iraq and what Palestinians see as his favoritism toward Israel in any peace talks .

The warlords we champion in Afghanistan are as venal , as opposed to the rights of women and basic democratic freedoms , and as heavily involved in opium trafficking as the Taliban .
The moral lines we draw between us and our adversaries are fictional .
The uplifting narratives used to justify the war in Afghanistan are pathetic attempts to redeem acts of senseless brutality .
War can not be waged to instill any virtue , including democracy or the liberation of women .
War always empowers those who have a penchant for violence and access to weapons .
War turns the moral order upside down and abolishes all discussions of human rights .
War banishes the just and the decent to the margins of society .
And the weapons of war do not separate the innocent and the damned .
An aerial drone is our version of an improvised explosive device .
An iron fragmentation bomb is our answer to a suicide bomb .
A burst from a belt - fed machine gun causes the same terror and bloodshed among civilians no matter who pulls the trigger .
" We need to tear the mask off of the fundamentalist warlords who after the tragedy of 9/11 replaced the Taliban , " Malalai Joya , who was expelled from the Afghan parliament two years ago for denouncing government corruption and the Western occupation , told me during her visit to New York last week .
" They used the mask of democracy to take power .
They continue this deception .
These warlords are mentally the same as the Taliban .
The only change is physical .
These warlords during the civil war in Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996 killed 65,000 innocent people .
They have committed human rights violations , like the Taliban , against women and many others . "
" In eight years less than 2,000 Talib have been killed and more than 8,000 innocent civilians has been killed , " she went on .
" We believe that this is not war on terror .
This is war on innocent civilians .
Look at the massacres carried out by NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Look what they did in May in the Farah province , where more than 150 civilians were killed , most of them women and children .
They used white phosphorus and cluster bombs .
There were 200 civilians on 9th of September killed in the Kunduz province , again most of them women and children .
You can see the Web site of professor Marc Herold , this democratic man , to know better the war crimes in Afghanistan imposed on our people .
The United States and NATO eight years ago occupied my country under the banner of woman 's rights and democracy .
But they have only pushed us from the frying pan into the fire .
They put into power men who are photocopies of the Taliban . "
Afghanistan 's boom in the trade in opium , used to produce heroin , over the past eight years of occupation has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to the Taliban , al - Qaida , local warlords , criminal gangs , kidnappers , private armies , drug traffickers and many of the senior figures in the government of Hamid Karzai .
The New York Times reported that the brother of President Karzai , Ahmed Wali Karzai , has been collecting money from the CIA although he is a major player in the illegal opium business .
Afghanistan produces 92 percent of the world 's opium in a trade that is worth some $ 65 billion , the United Nations estimates .
This opium feeds some 15 million addicts worldwide and kills around 100,000 people annually .
These fatalities should be added to the rolls of war dead .
Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , said that the drug trade has permitted the Taliban to thrive and expand despite the presence of 100,000 NATO troops .
" The Taliban 's direct involvement in the opium trade allows them to fund a war machine that is becoming technologically more complex and increasingly widespread , " said Costa .
The UNODC estimates the Taliban earned $ 90 million to $ 160 million a year from taxing the production and smuggling of opium and heroin between 2005 and 2009 , as much as double the amount it earned annually while it was in power nearly a decade ago .
And Costa described the Afghan - Pakistani border as " the world 's largest free trade zone in anything and everything that is illicit , " an area blighted by drugs , weapons and illegal immigration .
The " perfect storm of drugs and terrorism " may be on the move along drug trafficking routes through Central Asia , he warned .
Profits made from opium are being pumped into militant groups in Central Asia and " a big part of the region could be engulfed in large - scale terrorism , endangering its massive energy resources , " Costa said .
" Afghanistan , after eight years of occupation , has become a world center for drugs , " Joya told me .
" The drug lords are the only ones with power .
How can you expect these people to stop the planting of opium and halt the drug trade ?
How is it that the Taliban when they were in power destroyed the opium production and a superpower not only cannot destroy the opium production but allows it to increase ?
And while all this goes on , those who support the war talk to you about women 's rights .
We do not have human rights now in most provinces .
It is as easy to kill a woman in my country as it is to kill a bird .
In some big cities like Kabul some women have access to jobs and education , but in most of the country the situation for women is hell .
Rape , kidnapping and domestic violence are increasing .
These fundamentalists during the so - called free elections made a misogynist law against Shia women in Afghanistan .
This law has even been signed by Hamid Karzai .
All these crimes are happening under the name of democracy . "

Thousands of Afghan civilians have died from insurgent and foreign military violence .
And American and NATO forces are responsible for almost half the civilian deaths in Afghanistan .
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have also died from displacement , starvation , disease , exposure , lack of medical treatment , crime and lawlessness resulting from the war .
Joya argues that Karzai and his rival Abdullah Abdullah , who has withdrawn from the Nov. 7 runoff election , will do nothing to halt the transformation of Afghanistan into a narco - state .
She said that NATO , by choosing sides in a battle between two corrupt and brutal opponents , has lost all its legitimacy in the country .
The recent resignation of a high - level U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan , Matthew Hoh , was in part tied to the drug problem .
Hoh wrote in his resignation letter that Karzi 's government is filled with " glaring corruption and unabashed graft . "
Karzi , he wrote , is a president " whose confidants and chief advisers comprise drug lords and war crimes villains who mock our own rule of law and counter - narcotics effort . "
Joya said , " Where do you think the $ 36 billion of money poured into country by the international community have gone ?
This money went into the pockets of the drug lords and the warlords .
There are 18 million people in Afghanistan who live on less than $ 2 a day while these warlords get rich .
The Taliban and warlords together contribute to this fascism while the occupation forces are bombing and killing innocent civilians .
When we do not have security how can we even talk about human rights or women 's rights ? "
" This election under the shade of Afghan war - lordism , drug - lordism , corruption and occupation forces has no legitimacy at all , " she said .
" The result will be like the same donkey but with new saddles .
It is not important who is voting .
It is important who is counting .
And this is our problem .
Many of those who go with the Taliban do not support the Taliban , but they are fed up with these warlords and this injustice and they go with the Taliban to take revenge .
I do not agree with them , but I understand them .
Most of my people are against the Taliban and the warlords , which is why millions did not take part in this tragic drama of an election . "
" The U.S. wastes taxpayers ' money and the blood of their soldiers by supporting such a mafia corrupt system of Hamid Karzai , " said Joya , who changes houses in Kabul frequently because of the numerous death threats made against her .
" Eight years is long enough to learn about Karzai and Abdullah .
They chained my country to the center of drugs .
If Obama was really honest he would support the democratic - minded people of my country .
We have a lot [ of those people ] .
But he does not support the democratic - minded people of my country .
He is going to start war in Pakistan by attacking in the border area of Pakistan .
More civilians have been killed in the Obama period than even during the criminal Bush . "
" My people are sandwiched between two powerful enemies , " she lamented .
" The occupation forces from the sky bomb and kill innocent civilians .
On the ground , Taliban and these warlords deliver fascism .
As NATO kills more civilians the resistance to the foreign troops increases .
If the U.S. government and NATO do not leave voluntarily my people will give to them the same lesson they gave to Russia and to the English who three times tried to occupy Afghanistan .
It is easier for us to fight against one enemy rather than two . "

But hours after a liberal news forum brought attention to a series of days old controversial photos on the Republican National Committee ’s Facebook page , the photos were finally taken down .
Among them was a picture of President Barack Obama eating fried chicken , subtitled with a call to prohibit interracial marriage .
The photo ’s caption read : “ Miscegenation is a CRIME against American Values .
Repeal Loving v. Virginia . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Miscegenation refers to the “ marriage or cohabitation between a man and woman of different races . ”
Loving v. Virginia was a landmark Supreme Court case that , in 1967 , struck down all of the US ’s laws against interracial marriage .
This is the photo as it appeared on the GOP ’s Facebook profile on Monday :
Members of the liberal news forum Democratic Underground launched a discussion about the photos on Sunday night .
“ That ’s blatant f—ing racism , against Facebook rules and basic human decency , ” one upset commenter stated .
ADVERTISEMENT
Another commenter noted the Obama photo had been on the RNC Facebook page since October 20 .
“ So it has been up five days and not one person administering the site did anything about it .
Apparently the site administrator finds this correctly sums up Republican philosophy . ”
The photo was posted by a Facebook user named “ Gee Dub , ” apparently in reference to President George W. Bush .
A comment by someone using the same user name , posted to the comments section of the RNC ’s photo page , stated :
“ Racism is necessary in our capitalistic system .
To subject ourselves to the the socialist ideal of equality will surely destroy the American way of life .
As a black man , racism has served as a great inspiration for me to work harder .
God bless the Republican Party and God bless America . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
It was impossible to tell whether the writer was being sincere , or acting as a “ troll ” pretending to be a black man in favor of racism .
Other photos causing consternation included one of Mother Teresa , in which the revered religious activist was shown feeding a child .
The caption underneath read , “ Enabling scab - eating mouth breathers will do them no good .
How do we expect them to take care of themselves ? ”
That photo , also posted by Gee Dub , was also removed .
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet another photo showed former presidential candidate John Kerry with what at first sight appears to be a rifle pointed at his head .
The picture was framed in such a way that a gun several feet away from Kerry was made to look like it was aimed at his temple .
That photo was removed as well .
None of the photos in question appear to have been posted by the administrator of the GOP ’s Facebook site .
The anti-interracial marriage photo comes on the heels of a recent controversy over a Louisiana justice of the peace who refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple , sparking outrage among social - justice activists and minority groups .
ADVERTISEMENT
While most Republicans were quick to distance themselves from the justice ’s sentiments , at least one high - profile Republican politician — Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana — has been criticized for failing to condemn the justice ’s actions .
The Obama photo was posted to the GOP ’s Facebook page less than a week after the Louisiana justice ’s controversial move was made public .
EAST LANSING , Mich . —
A 21 - year Michigan State University experiment that distills the essence of evolution in laboratory flasks not only demonstrates natural selection at work , but could lead to biotechnology and medical research advances , researchers said .
Charles Darwin ’s seminal Origin of Species first laid out the case for evolution exactly 150 years ago .
Now , MSU professor Richard Lenski and colleagues document the process in their analysis of 40,000 generations of bacteria , published this week in the international science journal Nature .
Lenski , Hannah Professor of Microbial Ecology at MSU , started growing cultures of fast - reproducing , single - celled E. coli bacteria in 1988 .
If a genetic mutation gives a cell an advantage in competition for food , he reasoned , it should dominate the entire culture .
While Darwin ’s theory of natural selection is supported by other studies , it has never before been studied for so many cycles and in such detail .
“ It ’s extra nice now to be able to show precisely how selection has changed the genomes of these bacteria , step by step over tens of thousands of generations , ” Lenski said .
Lenski ’s team periodically froze bacteria for later study , and technology has since developed to allow complete genetic sequencing .
By the 20,000 - generation midpoint , researchers discovered 45 mutations among surviving cells .
Those mutations , according to Darwin ’s theory , should have conferred some advantage , and that ’s exactly what the researchers found .
The results “ beautifully emphasize the succession of mutational events that allowed these organisms to climb toward higher and higher efficiency in their environment , ” noted Dominique Schneider , a molecular geneticist at the Université Joseph Fourier in Grenoble , France .
Lenski ’s long - running experiment itself is uniquely suited to answer some critical questions — such as whether rates of change in a bacteria ’s genome move in tandem with its fitness to survive .
“ The coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive , ” Lenski concluded .
“ The genome was evolving along at a surprisingly constant rate , even as the adaptation of the bacteria slowed down a lot .
But then suddenly the mutation rate jumped way up , and a new dynamic relationship was established . ”
A mutation involved in DNA metabolism arose around generation 26,000 , causing the mutation rate everywhere else in the genome to increase dramatically .
The number of mutations jumped to 653 by generation 40,000 , but researchers surmise that most of the late - evolving mutations were not helpful to the bacteria .
Gene mutations involved in human DNA replication are involved in some cancers .
Many of the patterns observed in the experiment also occur in certain microbial infections , “ and cancer progression is a fundamentally similar evolutionary process , ” observed collaborator Jeffrey Barrick .
“ So what we learn here can help us better understand the course of these diseases . ”
Barrick , a postdoctoral researcher in MSU ’s Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , developed computational tools to discover and validate often complex mutations .
“ We know an astounding amount about the details of evolution in these little Erlenmeyer flasks , ” he said .
The Nature paper involved collaboration with scientists from South Korea as well as France and MSU .
The research , said genomics team leader Jihyun Kim of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology , “ is not only useful in understanding the tempo and mode of evolution , but can serve as a nice framework for practical applications in biotechnology , such as improving the performance or productivity of an industrial strain . ”

WASHINGTON 
In a last effort to give the Senate a bipartisan health care bill , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee circulated a comprehensive proposal on Sunday to overhaul the health care system and proposed a new fee on insurance companies to help pay for coverage of the uninsured .
The proposal is the culmination of more than a year of work by the chairman , Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana .
A similar fee was proposed by several liberal Democrats in July .
In making it part of his proposal , Mr. Baucus may help cover the costs of the bill but also risks alienating Republicans whom he is trying to win over .
Mr. Baucus is struggling to forge a bipartisan consensus among 6 of the 23 senators on his committee before President Obama puts new pressure on lawmakers in an address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday evening .
The proposal by Mr. Baucus does not include a public option , or a government - run insurance plan , to compete with private insurers , as many Democrats want .
The White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , appearing Sunday on the ABC News program “ This Week , ” said Mr. Obama saw the public plan as “ a valuable tool ” to promote choice and competition in the insurance market .
But he stopped short of saying that the president would veto a bill without it .
It 's coming — and we just made it worse .
To many observers , the Federal Reserve has never looked more heroic than it does right now .
This past winter , America ’s financial system faced the prospect of utter ruin .
And , while the economy has suffered plenty in 2009 , the worst did not come to pass .
The banking system that lends to our employers , thereby allowing our economy to function , never did collapse .
Now , many of the accolades for averting catastrophe are going to the Fed .
President Obama himself ratified this analysis last week when he renominated Fed chairman Ben Bernanke for a second term .
Bernanke , the president told reporters , had marshaled “ his background , his temperament , his courage , and his creativity ” to help prevent a second Great Depression .
What these words of presidential praise obscured was that the Fed may well have mitigated our current crisis by sowing the seeds for the next one .
All modern economies need a financial system that can connect people who want to save with those who have good investment projects .
This is essentially what banks do .
But , unfortunately , this process often goes wrong .
And that is precisely what is happening now .
Our banks have gotten into the habit of needing to be rescued through repeated bailouts .
During this crisis , Bernanke -- while saving the financial system in the short term -- has done nothing to break this long - term pattern ; worse , he exacerbated it .
As a result , unless real reform happens soon , we face the prospect of another bubble - bust - bailout cycle that will be even more dangerous than the one we ’ve just been through .
If you ’ve studied U.S. economic history , none of this will come as a surprise .
We have seen this spectacle -- the Fed saving us from one crisis only to instigate another - - many times before .
And , over the past few decades , the problem has become significantly more dire .
The fault , to be sure , does n’t lie entirely with the Fed .
Bernanke is a prisoner of a financial system with serious built - in flaws .
The decisions he made during the recent crisis were n’t necessarily the wrong decisions ; indeed , they were , in many respects , the decisions he had to make .
But these decisions , however necessary in the moment , are almost guaranteed to hurt our economy in the long run -- which , in turn , means that more necessary but harmful measures will be needed in the future .
It is a debilitating , vicious cycle .
And at the center of this cycle is the Fed .
Banking was once a dangerous profession .
In Britain , for instance , bankers faced “ unlimited liability ” -- that is , if you ran a bank , and the bank could n’t repay depositors or other creditors , those people had the right to confiscate all your personal assets and income until you repaid .
It was n’t until the second half of the nineteenth century that Britain established limited liability for bank owners .
From that point on , British bankers no longer assumed much financial risk themselves .
Busy Beaver puts another one on the Turing Machine 's tape .
( image from book " the new turing omnibus " )
The busy beaver problem is a fun theoretical computer science problem to know .
Intuitively , the problem is to find the smallest program that outputs as many data as possible and eventually halts .
More formally it goes like this -- given an n-state Turing Machine with a two symbol alphabet {0 , 1} , what is the maximum number of 1s that the machine may print on an initially blank tape ( 0 - filled ) before halting ?
It turns out that this problem can't be solved .
For a small number of states it can be reasoned about , but it can't be solved in general .
Theorists call such problems non-computable .
Currently people have managed to solve it for n=1,2,3,4 ( for Turing Machines with 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 states ) by reasoning about and running all the possible Turing Machines , but for n ?
5 this task has currently been impossible .
While most likely it will be solved for n=5 , theorists doubt that it shall ever be computed for n=6 .
Let 's denote the number of 1s that the busy beaver puts on a tape after halting as S(n ) and call it the busy beaver function ( this is the solution to the busy beaver problem ) .
The busy beaver function is also interesting -- it grows faster than any computable function .
It grows like this :
S(1 ) = 1
S(2 ) = 4
S(3 ) = 6
S(4 ) = 13
S(5 ) ?
4098 ( the exact result has not yet been found )
S(6 ) ?
4.6 · 101439 ( the exact result shall never be known )
If we were to use one atom for each 1 that the busy beaver puts on the tape , at n=6 we would have filled the whole universe !
That 's how fast the busy beaver function is growing .
I decided to play with the busy beaver myself to verify the known results for n ?
5 . I implemented a Turing Machine in Python , which turned out to be too slow , so I reimplemented it in C++ ( source code of both implementations below ) .
I also wrote a visualization tool in Perl that shows how the Turing Machine 's tape changes from the start to the finish ( source code also below ) .
I used the following best known Turing Machines .
Their tapes are initially filled with 0's , their starting state is " a " and halting state is " h " .
The notation " a 0 -> b1l " means " if we are in the state " a " and the current symbol on the tape is " 0 " then put a " 1 " in that cell , switch to state " b " and move to left " l " .
This process repeats until the machine ends up in the halting state .
Turing Machine for 1 - state Busy Beaver :
a0 -> h1r
Turing Machine for 2 - state Busy Beaver :
a0 -> b1r a 1 -> b1l b0 -> a1l b1 -> h1r
Here is how the trace of tape changes look like for the 2 - state busy beaver :
Tape changes for 2 state busy beaver .
Turing Machine for 3 - state Busy Beaver :
a0 -> b1r a 1 -> h1r b0 -> c0r b1 -> b1r c0 -> c1l c1 -> a1l
Tape changes for 3 state busy beaver .
Turing Machine for 4 - state Busy Beaver :
a0 -> b1r a 1 -> b1l b0 -> a1l b1 -> c0l c0 -> h1r c1 -> d1l d0 -> d1r d1 -> a0r
Tape changes for 4 state busy beaver .
Turing Machine for 5 - state Busy Beaver :
a0 -> b1l a 1 -> a1l b0 -> c1r b1 -> b1r c0 -> a1l c1 -> d1r d0 -> a1l d1 -> e1r e0 -> h1r e1 -> c0r

Turing Machine for 6 state Busy Beaver :
a0 -> b1r a 1 -> e0l b0 -> c1l b1 -> a0r c0 -> d1l c1 -> c0r d0 -> e1l d1 -> f0l e0 -> a1l e1 -> c1l f0 -> e1l f1 -> h1r
Here is my Python program to simulate all these Turing Machines .
But as I said , it turned out to be too slow .
For the 5 state Busy Beaver it took 5 minutes to generate the currently best known solution .

I rewrote the Turing Machine simulator in C++ and the speedup was huge .
Now it took 14 seconds to execute the same Busy Beaver 5 .

And I also wrote a Perl program that uses the GD library to draw the tape changes on Turing Machines .

You can play with these programs yourself .
Here is how .
Run " busy_beaver.py < n > " with n=1,2,3,4,5,6 .
This will run the n-state busy beaver Turing Machine .
The output will be the tape changes .
Then use " draw_turing_machine.pl " to visualize the tape changes .
For example :
$ busy_beaver .py 4 > bb4 $ draw_turing_machine.pl bb4
There are variations of this problem .
For example , the busiest beaver with 3 and more symbols .
See " The Busy Beaver Competition " for these .
The historical development is also interesting -- see The Busy Beaver Historical Survey for more info .
I first learned about the Busy Beaver problem from a book called " The New Turing Omnibus . "
It contains 66 different essays on various computer science subjects such as algorithms , turing machines , grammars , computability , randomness , and other fun topics .
These essays are written in an accessible style that even a high school student can understand them .
Each essay does n't take more than 10 minutes to read .
I recommend this book .

The email sent by Assad Sarwar from an internet cafe in High Wycombe to an account in Pakistan in the summer of 2006 was meant to sound innocuous .
With its reference to " Calvin Klein aftershave " costing " 80 quid " , its contents were crafted to meld seamlessly into the blizzard of data sent across cyberspace without attracting undue attention .
In reality , what looked like email trivia was one of dozens of coded updates sent by Sarwar , a restaurant delivery driver and the quartermaster of the liquid bombs plot , to the overseas jihadist masterminds of the conspiracy to cause carnage on an " unprecedented scale " in the skies above North America and the mid-Atlantic .
The " Calvin Klein aftershave " was far from being a business opportunity .
It was code for hydrogen peroxide hair bleach , bought by Sarwar from a Welsh hairdressing supplies wholesaler , which had been concentrated by Abdulla Ahmed Ali , the charismatic ringleader of the British cell , to the 80 per cent purity required to turn it into the key explosive to be used in the attempt to simultaneously destroy at least seven airliners .

Unbeknown to both men , their visits to public telephone boxes and internet cafes in Walthamstow , north - east London , and Buckinghamshire between January and August 2006 were the subject of Operation Overt – the biggest surveillance operation in Britain since the Second World War – as dozens of MI5 and undercover Metropolitan Police Special Branch officers painstakingly tracked the conspirators ' every move .
As well as collating the coded emails sent to and from Pakistan , the authorities used more than 200 undercover officers drafted in from across Britain to follow the plotters .
On 6 August 2006 , Ali entered a small communications shop in Walthamstow to sit down in front of a pay - as - you - go internet screen .
Watched by a plain - clothes officer , the computer systems graduate opened the timetable page of the American Airlines website and began to note down the times of flights heading from London to North America .
Crucially , the services were all leaving from Heathrow airport 's Terminal Three on the same day and all within a window of about two - and - a - half hours .
The information was just the latest piece of a complex jigsaw of evidence , collated over thousands of hours of surveillance and investigation conducted across two continents , which led the Security Service and Scotland Yard 's Counter Terrorism Command to the unshakeable – and terrifying – conclusion that the plot dubbed " Britain's 9/11 " was moving to its " execution phase " .
Equipped with technology bought from corner shops , electrical wholesalers and a street stall in Pakistan selling a brand of AAA - sized Toshiba batteries , Sarwar , Ali and his right - hand man , Tanvir Hussain , had brought together a sophisticated and well - financed mission to cause death and destruction with an ingenious tool previously unknown to law enforcement agencies across the world .
In a two - bedroom flat at 386a Forest Road , Walthamstow , which Ali bought for £ 138,000 in cash in July 2006 , the team of young radicalised British Muslim men , gathered by their 28 - year - old emir from among his acquaintances and childhood friends , began making the liquid bombs disguised in soft drinks bottles that were key to their " blessed operation " .

The flat was also used by the group to record a series of suicide videos in which Ali warned Britons to expect " floods of martyr operations " in which " you will be destroyed " .
Using instructions given by a bomb maker in Pakistan with links to al - Qa'ida , Ali and Hussain were in the finishing stages of preparing the empty 500 ml bottles of Lucozade and Oasis which were to be filled with an explosive charge of hydrogen peroxide and a powdered soft drink called Tang – prepared in High Wycombe by Sarwar with such precision that he could recite the formula by heart .
It was a measure of the extraordinary detail of the planning that the men had perfected a way of ensuring each of the 18 bottles in the second - floor flat remained unopened by injecting the liquid explosive through the plastic nodule at the bottom and sealing the hole with superglue .
Footage from a camera hidden in the property by MI5 showed Ali drilling holes in the bottles .
Hussain , 28 , from Leyton , east London , who in his suicide video recorded on a camera kept by Sarwar bragged that he wanted to be resurrected to kill others until people realised " do n't mess with the Muslims " , was also tracked by police as he bought ingredients to make a powerful explosive , HMTD , which was to be placed in detonators concealed inside the hollowed - out Toshiba batteries .
The resulting hole was to be concealed with black foam .
Experts declared the resulting weapons , which would have been detonated with the use of a power source such as the flash from a disposable camera , as " highly viable " and capable of completing their intended task : ripping a hole in an aircraft fuselage at 35,000ft .
Seven of the defendants in yesterday 's retrial insisted that the devices , along with the suicide videos , were part of an alarming but ultimately harmless publicity campaign that was to have involved a " big bang " in the Houses of Parliament or Heathrow 's Terminal
Three , followed by the release of a " spoof " documentary containing the martyrdom films .
But after hearing six months of evidence at Woolwich Crown Court , a jury yesterday decided that the real intentions of Sarwar , Ali and Hussain were in a different league – that of calculating mass murder .
At about 9.30 pm on 9 August 2006 , after hurried consultation with the American authorities , the police moved in to arrest Ali and Sarwar .
When officers asked Sarwar , whose work to buy the ingredients for the bombs had begun in April , if there was anything dangerous in his red Nissan Primera , he had the presence of mind to reply : " Only the handbrake . "
The contents of his boot – and the pockets of Ali – in fact contained damning evidence .
In the boot were two of the six suicide videos , while , in Ali 's jacket , was a computer memory stick containing the details of seven coinciding flights out of Heathrow to North America along with information about hand luggage rules at BAA airports .
In a second pocket was a diary containing what prosecutors described as a " blueprint " for the attacks .
Among the notes discovered in the diary were : " select date , five days before jet , all link up " ; " calculate exact drops of tang " ; " one drink use , other keep in pocket , maybe will not get through machine " ; and " dirty mag to distract " .
The instructions tallied with an intercepted email sent from Pakistan to Ali on 13 July , which suggested a " rapping concert rehearsal " using " the bus service which is the most common over there " – code , according to prosecutors , for a dry - run in which one of the plotters was to test airport security and fly to North America using one of the " target " airlines – United Airlines , Air Canada and American Airlines .
A senior counter - terrorism source said : " By the time of arrest , we believe they were within days of executing the plot .
A lot of separate information came together to make it clear we were in the final stages . "
What came together in the frenzied weeks of Operation Overt had begun in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks .
As Allied forces poured into Afghanistan , a refugee crisis that had festered for decades on the border with Pakistan grew worse and British charities , including the Islamic Medical Association , raised money to send volunteers and equipment to help .
Among those volunteers were Ali and Sarwar who , at separate times between 2002 and 2003 , worked at the bleak , windswept camps containing children wounded in fighting between Islamists and American forces .
The experience radically altered the world view of the two men and , as they began to shuttle between Pakistan and Britain over the next four years liaising with their jihadist controllers ,
Ali became the subject of interest for MI5 to the extent that they attempted – and failed – to recruit his alleged fellow conspirator , Arafat Khan , to become an informant .
Unknown to Ali , when he returned to Heathrow from Pakistan in June 2006 , agents opened his baggage before it reached the arrivals hall .
Inside they found a tin of Tang and a large number of AAA Toshiba batteries .
The final unravelling of the plot had begun .
When officers eventually searched the home Ali shared with his wife and young son , they found a document in which he had outlined the chilling core of his beliefs .
It read : " The psychology of war is that you can defeat your enemy if you take away that which they love the most and strike terror into their hearts .
With martyrdom operations they achieve that as the most beloved thing is life and wealth .
When your enemy is not scared to die it scares you . "
The couple said the secret of their marriage was " give and take " , always making up after rows and never going to bed without a kiss and cuddle .
In the Biblical Period
The idea of what constituted a prohibited degree of kinship for sexual relations seems to have broadened during the biblical period .
Among the ancestors of Israel there occurred an unusual number of marriages that are incestuous by later standards ; evidently this was not merely condoned , but favored , as ensuring good stock ( cf. Gen. 24:3 –4 ; 38 ff . ; 28:1 ff . ) .
Thus Abraham married his paternal sister ( Gen. 20:12 against Lev. 18:9 ) , Jacob married two sisters ( Gen. 29:21 ff . against Lev. 18:18 ) , and Amram , Moses ' father , married his aunt ( Ex. 6:20 , against Lev. 20:19 ) .
As late as the time of David , marriage to a half sister was condoned ( II Sam. 13:13 ) .
The standard of the laws thus reflects a tendency ( that reached its culmination in post - biblical legislation ) to broaden the scope of incest with the passage of time .
Rabbinic theory recognized this , justifying the patriarchs ' disregard of the Torah prohibitions on the ground that they were subject only to the * Noachide law of incest , which was far less comprehensive than that of the Torah ( Sanh. 58 a–b ; Maim .
Yad , Melakhim , 9:5 ) .

In a new study , researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital ( The Neuro ) , McGill University have found an important mechanism involved in setting up the vast communications network of connections in the brain .
A signaling pathway involving interactions between a schizophrenia - linked gene product , Calcineurin , and a transcription factor known as Nuclear Factor in Activated T - cells ( NFAT ) contributes to the connectivity at nerve cell ( neuron ) junctions or synapses and affects the extent of nerve cell projections or dendritic branches , in the visual system .
The results of this study , published in the journal Neuron , may bring hope to adults suffering from brain injuries and offer the possibility of early diagnosis , treatments and therapies for schizophrenia , autism , or other developmental disorders where abnormal neurological wiring is thought to occur early in life .
In early brain development , there is an overabundance of unspecified connections between neurons .
During development ( and learning ) , these connections are pruned , leaving the stronger and more specific ones .
This refinement occurs in response to a set of inputs from the environment , and is traditionally thought to be mediated through changes at synapses - the specialized junctions through which neurons communicate with each other .
Neurons possess an innate tendency to extend branched projections from the cell body known as dendrites .
Dendrites receive information and form synaptic contacts with the terminals of other nerve cells to allow nerve impulses to be transmitted .
In the so - called " synaptotropic model " of dendritic development , interactions between dendrites and potential synaptic partners provide the extrinsic cues that help direct dendritic growth into patterns that optimize synaptic interactions .
Therefore , growth or branching is most likely to occur in regions where there is a stabilized synapse and retraction is more likely in regions where synapses fail to mature or become destabilized .
" Our study shows that changes in synaptic connections are also controlled by alterations in the transcriptional profile of the cell which governs protein production , " says Dr. Edward Ruthazer , neuroscientist at The Neuro and lead investigator of the study .
There is a growing body of evidence that transcriptional regulation , an important step in the process of making proteins , is a key regulator of long - term changes in synaptic connectivity .
The protein Calcineurin ( CaN ) regulates transcriptional programs that control synapse formation and function .
It has also has been strongly implicated in weakening connections between cells , and is a likely regulator of pruning of connectivity .
CaN instructs the neurons through the transcription factor NFAT , which in turn plays an important role in axonal outgrowth and neuronal response to extrinsic cues involved in circuit development and refinement .
Neil Schwartz , a graduate student in Dr. Ruthazer 's lab designed a method of specifically blocking the interaction between CaN and NFAT at the nucleus in order to examine the effects on neuronal connections in the visual system .
" We found that inhibiting the function of CaN resulted in more dendritic branches and more synapses , demonstrating that CaN is a potent regulator of dendritic complexity and synaptic function , " explained Dr. Ruthazer .
" We further demonstrated that CaN mediates its effects on neurocircuitry through its activation of NFAT transcription factors and that NFAT activity in the developing brain can be regulated by natural visual stimulation .
This extension of the synaptotrophic model taking into consideration not only the interactions with synaptic partners that shape the neural architecture , but also the transcriptional profile of nerve cells , provides vital insight into diseases in which there is abnormal neural connectivity and offers the possibility of early diagnosis and treatment .

Users can see snapshots of life on Earth that range from something as innocent as a child playing on a swing in a Sydney park to a secret nuclear submarine base in China .
" I do n't really think it 's tipping the balance in favour of the bad guys , " John Hanke , the director in charge of Google Earth and Google Maps , said in an interview .
" The evilness is in the philosophies and the desires of those that want to do evil .
They will use the tools at hand to do that , whether it 's throwing a Molotov cocktail , or shooting a rifle or using some piece of technology as part of the process . "
The comments made by Hanke during our interview at Google 's headquarters in Mountain View , California , this month represent his most public contribution yet to the debate about the use of modern information technologies by the " bad guys " - as he put it .
They come at a time when India is investigating the circumstances surrounding November 's deadly attack on Mumbai , amid a chorus of calls for access to the service to be restricted or banned entirely .
In December , a petition entered at the Mumbai High Court alleges that Google Earth " aids terrorists in plotting attacks " and asked that Google be directed to blur images of sensitive areas pending all full hearing .
The Jerusalem Post reported in December that a documentary called The Field of Death posted on the Hamas military wing 's website showed terrorists using Google Earth to plot a rocket attack on a fuel depot inside Israel last April that killed two men .
To avoid knee - jerk reactions , Hanke cautioned that it was important to understand if what people were doing with these tools was any different from what they would have done anyway .
" If Google Earth did n't exist , would they have used a tourist map they could have bought or was the real intelligence actually coming from an on - the - ground informant who was working in the hotel and drawing layouts of everything on a napkin ? " he said .
" You have cars ; you have car bombs .
You have GPS transceivers that help you navigate ; those GPS transceivers could be used for lots of nefarious purposes .
Cell phones have all kinds of benefits ; cell phones can be used to detonate a remote explosive device . "
While this debate had " mostly died off " in the West , it was still a live issue in countries where the " government is used to controlling everything " , Hanke said .
Often this concern was a pretext for a government trying to reassert control over its " closed information societies " , he said .
" The idea that open information is valuable is more baked onto Western culture , " he said .
" You have top down command and control types of governments like those in China to some extent and in Russia and legacies of that in places like India where these issues at the government level are more prevalent for us . "
He also expressed the view that the concerns raised about personal privacy on the new Street View feature on Google Maps was largely tied to the novelty of the products and a lack of understanding about the nature and frequency of the intrusion .
Street View is a free online feature that gives users a continuous ground - level street panorama .
" We went through a cycle with satellite imagery where it was new and there was some level of concern and then some level of hyped - up concern , I would say , about what it means , " he said .
" And as people came to understand about what satellite imagery did and about what it did n't [ do ] , that level of concern went down and , as people began to appreciate the value it brought to them , that became effectively a non-issue .
" If you know that this satellite can come over maybe once a year and it takes a picture , that 's different from believing there 's an eye in the skye that can follow wherever you go all of the time . "
Google last year incorporated a process that automatically blurs faces of people and licence plates of cars whose photographs appear on Street View .
Google will also remove " objectionable " images .
Those privacy concerns reared up again this week when it was revealed that the Street View feature on Google Maps contained an image of a man sitting on his outhouse dunny in an inner-city Melbourne backyard .
The photo was snapped by a camera mounted on the roof of one of a fleet of specially kitted - out cars that Google dispatched around the country in late 2007 and early 2008 to capture images for Street View .
Google swiftly removed the image from Street View once it was noticed , but on the internet it is almost impossible to obliterate all traces of something you do n't want seen .
Google is facing opposition to its latest geo technology in Germany , where Street View has yet to be launched , and in Japan , where it was launched last year .
" With Street View , it 's going through the same cycle of people understanding exactly what it is and what it is n't and ... what they should n't really be concerned about , " he said .

This Is Exactly What You Think It Is
There ’s a clock on the other side , yet I never seem to be able to tell the time .
A question I ’m occasionally asked at public events is , why are n’t we creating jobs with a WPA - type program ?
It ’s a very good question .
As it is , job - creation efforts are generally indirect .
Tax cuts and transfers in the hope that people will spend them ; aid to state governments in the hope of averting layoffs .
Even infrastructure spending is routed through private contractors .
You can make a pretty good case that just employing a lot of people directly would be a lot more cost - effective ; the WPA and CCC cost surprisingly little given the number of people put to work .
Think of it as the stimulus equivalent of getting the middlemen out of the student loan program .
So why are n’t we doing this ?
Politics , of course : government is the problem , not the solution , even when it is , you know , the solution , and cheaper than running things through the private sector .
Still , it might be worth discussing whether we should n’t try to include an , um , public option in stimulus , too .
Mars Express flew over the boundary between Kasei Valles and Sacra Fossae and imaged the region , acquiring spectacular views of the chaotic terrain in the area .
The images are centred at 12°N / 285 °E and have a ground resolution of about 21 m / pixel .
They cover 225 x 95 km or 21.375 sq km , an area roughly half the size of the Netherlands .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Mars Express flew over the boundary between Kasei Valles and Sacra Fossae and imaged the region , acquiring spectacular views of the chaotic terrain in the area .
The images , obtained by the High Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) , are centred at 12 °N / 285 °E and have a ground resolution of about 21 m / pixel .
They cover 225 x 95 km or 21.375 sq km , an area roughly half the size of the Netherlands .
The upper portion of the image swath shows the eastern margin of Kasei Valles and the western margin of the Lunae Planum plateau and the adjoining Sacra Fossae .
Kasei Valles is one of the largest outflow channels on Mars , spanning 3000 km , from the Chryse Planitia basin in the north to Echus Chasma to the south .
Sacra Fossae is a fault system that extends for more than 1000 km .
It is several hundred metres deep and separates Kasei Valles to the south and west from Lunae Planum .
It was named after Isola Sacra , an island at the estuary of the river Tiber in Italy .
The images show an old 35 km - diameter impact crater in the north .
The crater ’s south - western rim is eroded strongly .
The erosion is caused mostly by flowing water .
The source of the water was located in Echus Chasma , which lies roughly 850 km to the southwest .
The crater floor and the northwestern part of the imaged region are remarkably flat and have been formed by sediments and basaltic lava flows originating from the Tharsis volcanic region .

The lower part of the image clearly shows the boundary between the heavily cratered plain and the area with numerous fracture zones .
Most of the fractures along the boundary are parallel to the edge of the Lunae Planum .
It is likely that the entire region experienced tectonic stresses as well as ‘ subrosion ’ — a process where subsurface rocks are dissolved and removed by water — causing overlying strata to collapse partially and form chaotic terrain .
Several fracture zones are also visible in the western part .
Up to 10 - km large areas that experienced ‘ subsidence ’ ( gradual compaction and sinking owing to the weight of the layers ) are still intact .
Comparable processes that form chaotic terrain on Aram Chaos were described earlier .
This ortho-image was rectified using elevation data derived from a high - resolution Digital Terrain Model ( DTM , obtained from HRSC data ) , such that distortions introduced during imaging are corrected .
Such an image can be used to derive maps .
Elevation data from the DTM are colour - coded and overlaid on the ortho- image so that elevation data and the image itself are displayed in a single scene .
The scale is in metres .

The colour scenes were derived from the three HRSC - colour channels and the nadir channel .
The perspective views were calculated from the digital terrain model derived from the stereo channels .
The anaglyph image was derived from the nadir channel and one stereo channel .
The black and white high - resolution images were derived from the nadir channel , which provides the greatest detail of all channels .

Dear Colleagues :
Would Martin Luther King have had an “ I ’d Rather Go Naked than Sit in the Back of the Bus ” campaign ?
Of course not .
He would have recognized that such a campaign would trivialize the important message of civil rights .
Why do n’t animal advocates recognize that sexist campaigns similarly trivialize the issue of animal rights and give people yet another reason to dismiss the animal rights issue ?
That is the topic of our ninth Commentary .

WASHINGTON 
The inspector general who oversees the government ’s bailout of the banking system is criticizing the Treasury Department for some misleading public statements last fall and raising the possibility that it had unfairly disbursed money to the biggest banks .
A Treasury official made incorrect statements about the health of the nation ’s biggest banks even as the government was doling out billions of dollars in aid , according to a report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program to be released on Monday by the special inspector general , Neil M. Barofsky .
The report also provides new insight into the way the Treasury allocated billions of dollars to nine of Wall Street ’s largest players .
The report says that Bank of America appeared to qualify for more aid earlier , under the government plan .
That assertion adds another element of intrigue to continuing investigations of the bank ’s merger with Merrill Lynch and the role that regulators played in the deal , even as Merrill ’s condition deteriorated .
The bailout formula called for banks to get an amount equal to as much as 3 percent of their risk - weighted assets , with aid capped at $ 25 billion for each institution , according to the report .
By size , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America could have qualified for more , and the first two received $ 25 billion .

-SEE UPDATE II BELOW : TeaParty group smears Seeger , plans to attend rally **
actual
Nyack Memorial Park at 53 Piermont Ave. in Nyack , NY will be the venue for an event advocating the understanding of health care as a human right and exposure of the indecencies of the for - profit health insurance industry .
Legendary folk singer Pete Seeger will be there armed with his banjo at age 90 , as will Grammy Award winning singer - songwiter Tom Chapin and songsmith Emory Joseph who has collaborated with Odetta , Bonnie Raitt and Wavy Gravy .
The event came together quickly following a recent Health Care event hosted by Organizing For America nearby in Rockland County which was attended by so - called " Teabaggers " who held up rude signs and were heard claiming the meeting was arranged by ACORN members .
Organizing For America ( formerly Obama For America ) will be returning for a more civil discussion this time to present " mythbusting " information but the event was conceived and planned by local groups including The Rockland Progressive Dems who recently launched a local news blog and the Hudson Valley arm of The Fellowship of Reconciliation , the largest , oldest interfaith Peace organization in the US which happens to be headquartered in Nyack .
The Nyack N.A.A.C.P. , the 30 - year old WESPAC Foundation for peace and justice ( from neighboring Westchester County ) and this site , OpEd News have co-sponsored the rain - or - shine event which has also been endorsed by Rockland Coalition For Peace and Justice , a group of dedicated " vigilers " who have protested the Iraq War on a local street corner every Saturdayregardless of the weathersince the war began in 2002 , .
Kucinich organization reps are also expected to be in attendance as are a plethora of local politicians trying to solidify support for upcoming elections .
Organizers invite all to bring blankets or lawn chairs to picnic on the large lawn area overlooking the Hudson River .
Below follows the official statement posted by organizers on their Health Care For All Now page .
Look for a follow - up report here early next week .
** UPDATE 2-- A " Tea Party " group from White Plains -- A " Tea Party " group from White Plains has announced intentions to gather a large group of " Patriots " to stand against the President and the 90 year old Seeger , who they call an " unrepentant 60's commie " .
Bringing signs and flags , they intend to " ensure the American side of the debate is heard " since the rallyers are " likely to have media coverage that we never get . "
HCFA organizers encourage attendees to show support for healthcare reform civilly and refrain from engaging anyone trying to stop the proceedings , announcing " the Orangetown Police Dept. will not allow them to disrupt this event " .
Though one OFA rep has been invited , all are reminded this event was organized by the actuallocal grassroots groups and not " the government " as pro-health industry supporters would have you believe .
* UPDATE 1--
The above page , set up by Health Care For All Now , hosted on the Tripod web service has started featuring opposition ads right below their message !
Paid for by " Patients First , a project of Americans for Prosperity " , the ad seems targeted specifically to the message delivered on the page and displays the warnings " Hands Off My Healthcare " and " Stop Government - Run Healthcare " .
This is a brilliant example of how well - funded and responsive the for - profit insurance industry is , how they mobilize and how they are so effectively spending corporate cash to influence this debate !
From the HFCA page : Health Care for All Whereas : Health Care is a Human Right ;
Whereas :
The private , for profit health insurance industry has failed to deliver quality health care to all the people and failed to control the cost of health care :
Whereas :
The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has published a report , " Insuring America 's Health : Principles and Recommendations " , which offers the following set of guiding principles to assess policy options :
1 . Health care coverage should be universal ; 2 . Health care coverage should be continuous ; 3 . Health care coverage should be affordable to individuals and families ; 4 . The health care coverage strategy should be affordable ; 5 . Health care coverage should enhance health and well - being by promoting access to high - quality and equitable care ; THEREFORE WE DO HEREBY RESOLVE : to advocate and lobby the federal government for a national universal health care plan which meets these policy recommendations ; to inform and educate all the people in our community and beyond as to the terrible price paid in both lives and in dollars caused by delays in implementing a health care policy that recognizes health care as a human right .
Join us at 4:30 pm , October 4 that Memorial Park in Nyack Advocate for : 1 . the understanding of healthcare as a human right ; 2 . exposure of the failures of the for - profit system that leaves people on their own in the current private insurance industry : 3 . government bargaining with the pharmaceutical industry for lower prescription drug prices ;
A number ofgrass roots organizations have joined forces to organize the Health Care For All Rally in Nyack , NY Sunday Oct. 4th starting at 4:30 pm featuring music , speakers and outreach .
Goldman Sachs is once again warning the world of a coming spike in oil prices that will remind everyone of 2008 .
The current financial crisis is to blame .
While we focus on fixing the banking sector , we 've forgotten that there are fundamental problems with the commodites markets .
The spike from 2008 will return because there 's been " decades " of poor investment decisions by oil producers .
When the economy kicks into gear around the world , supply shortages will become problematic , and the price of oil will spike .
Says Goldman via Alphaville , " As the commodity markets rebound with the broader global economy we expect a redux of 2008 when severe supply constraints forced the rationing of demand through sharply higher prices to keep the markets balanced . "
Apparently , Goldman Sachs did n't get the memo .
We 're going to chase the speculators out of the market , so none of this will be a problem .
Thousands of working parents in Hawaii are scrambling to make childcare arrangements ahead of the closure on Friday of all public schools , in a bid by the state 's education authorities to cut costs .
All 256 of Hawaii 's public schools will be closed in the first of 17 " furlough Fridays " that will see a drastic cut in school time for up to 171,000 children .
The reduction of the school week from five to four days will last for at least the next two years .
The furloughs are the most draconian measure yet taken in the US , where the recession has forced many states to slash public services .
At least 25 states have forced teachers to take unpaid days off , but most of the cuts have fallen on holidays or on preparation days rather than on actual school days .
Hawaii's cuts have been particularly punishing because unlike other parts of the US , the entire education budget is paid for by the state which is labouring under a $ 1bn deficit .
Education accounts for about a quarter of the state 's overall resources .
Most of its 13,000 public school teachers approved the furlough Friday plan because although they must swallow an 8 % reduction in their pay packages , their time off for holidays and teacher planning days is left untouched .
A proposal to bring in random drug testing for teachers has also been pushed back .
The first of the furloughs , however , are likely to be greeted by widespread protests from parents angered that a state that is already towards the bottom of America 's league table for schools performance is further slashing facetime in the classroom .
The Hawaiian school year is the shortest across the country .
Yet the cuts will reduce the number of teaching days in the academic year to 163 compared with 180 in most US school districts .
Hawaii is ranked 47th out of 50 in reading and mathematics among its 13 - year - old public school students .
A further paradox is that the Hawaii cuts come at a time when President Obama - himself a product of the Hawaiian education system , though he attended a private school in his later years - is trying to increase the amount of time American children spend in school .
" The challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom , " he said recently .
Parents at Noelani Elementary , the primary school Obama went to , will be staging one of many " walk - in " protests culminating with a rally at the state Capitol in downtown Honolulu .
A Noelani parent , Vernadette Gonzalez , told the Honolulu Advertiser : " Since education is being taken away , we thought it would be symbolic when the schools are being shut down by the state to say , ' We want to learn ' .
My daughter doe n't understand why she has no school on Friday . "
At least one legal action is likely to be lodged with the federal courts in an attempt to stop the furloughs on behalf of the children and parents affected .
A poll released over the weekend shows that only 34 percent of Californians approve of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's ( D - Calif . ) job performance , down 14 points from March .
The study , conducted by the Field Research Corportation , also showed that 44 percent of respondents disapproved of her job performance while 22 percent held no opinion .
In the organization 's last poll in March , 48 percent of respondents approved of Pelosi's job performance while 35 percent disapproved .
Democrats approved of Pelosi 's performance as leader by a count of 51 - 23 , with 26 percent expressing no opinion .
Republicans overwhelmingly disapproved of her performance : 7 percent approved , 79 percent disapproved and 14 percent said they held no opinion .
ADVERTISEMENT
39 percent of " non-partisans " approved of her while 37 percent disapproved , with 24 percent responding that they had no opinion .
Pelosi's job approval had sunk to similar lows in October and December 2007 during President George W. Bush 's second term .
In the last seven months , the House of Representatives has taken on a number of big - ticket issues .
The lower chamber passed a cap - and - trade energy bill and has drafted sweeping healthcare reform legislation that includes a controversial public health insurance option .
The economic stimulus bill was signed into law in February but critics of the legislation have pointed to high unemployment as a sign the bill has failed to achieve its goals .
Democratic leaders and the Obama administration have defended the measure 's role in stabilizing the economic downturn .
The study polled 1,005 Californians by phone from Sept. 18 to Oct. 5 .
These findings led directly to the notion that low - density lipoproteins carry “ bad ” cholesterol and high - density lipoproteins carry “ good ” cholesterol .
And then the precise terminology was jettisoned in favor of the common shorthand .
The lipoproteins LDL and HDL became “ good cholesterol ” and “ bad cholesterol , ” and the lipoprotein transport vehicle was now conflated with its cholesterol cargo .
Lost in translation was the evidence that the causal agent in heart disease might be abnormalities in the lipoproteins themselves .

The truth is , we ’ve always had reason to question the idea that cholesterol is an agent of disease .
Indeed , what the Framingham researchers meant in 1977 when they described LDL cholesterol as a “ marginal risk factor ” is that a large proportion of people who suffer heart attacks have relatively low LDL cholesterol .
So how did we come to believe strongly that LDL cholesterol is so bad for us ?
It was partly due to the observation that eating saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol , and we ’ve assumed that saturated fat is bad for us .
This logic is circular , though : saturated fat is bad because it raises LDL cholesterol , and LDL cholesterol is bad because it is the thing that saturated fat raises .
In clinical trials , researchers have been unable to generate compelling evidence that saturated fat in the diet causes heart disease .
The other important piece of evidence for the cholesterol hypothesis is that statin drugs like Zocor and Lipitor lower LDL cholesterol and also prevent heart attacks .
The higher the potency of statins , the greater the cholesterol lowering and the fewer the heart attacks .
This is perceived as implying cause and effect : statins reduce LDL cholesterol and prevent heart disease , so reducing LDL cholesterol prevents heart disease .
This belief is held with such conviction that the Food and Drug Administration now approves drugs to prevent heart disease , as it did with Zetia , solely on the evidence that they lower LDL cholesterol .
But the logic is specious because most drugs have multiple actions .
It ’s like insisting that aspirin prevents heart disease by getting rid of headaches .
One obvious way to test the LDL cholesterol hypothesis is to find therapies that lower it by different means and see if they , too , prevent heart attacks .
This is essentially what the Vytorin trial did and why its results argue against the hypothesis .
Other such tests have likewise failed to confirm it .
A recent trial of torcetrapib , a drug that both raises HDL and lowers LDL cholesterol , was halted midstream because the drug seemed to cause heart attacks and strokes rather than prevent them .
Estrogen replacement therapy also lowers LDL cholesterol , but it too has failed to prevent heart disease in clinical trials .
The same goes for eating less saturated fat .
The Baucus Bill : The Neutered Co-Ops
The co-ops have never been a satisfying alternative to the public option .
But the version in Baucus 's bill is n't even a satisfying alternative to the co-op option .
It 's a neutered version of the co-op idea , which was in turn a neutered version of the public option .
The co-ops are on the state level , with each state pretty much required to have one .
The 50 co-ops can then band together to leverage their national purchasing power .
Sounds good , right ?
Sort of .
The co-ops can only compete in the small group and individual markets .
That is to say , if the co-ops prove effective , and The Washington Post would like to offer co-op coverage as an option to its workers , it can't .
The co-ops are not allowed to contract with large employers , which is to say , they can't compete with private insurers in the largest market , and they can't get the purchasing power that would come from a serious foothold among corporate customers .
Not only is their size restricted , so too is what they can do with their size .
The co-ops can band together to increase their purchasing power , but they can't set national payment rates for their members , a la Medicare .
As I understand it , they have to bargain with each provider and drug manufacturer and hospital and so forth separately , meaning they 're denied one of the main advantages of size .
The insurance industry is , in other words , being protected from not just public competition , but co-op competition .
Sex , Shaving , and Bad Underwear
Or how to trick yourself into exerting self - control
Recently , I gave a lecture on the problem of self - control .
You know the one :
At time X you decide that you ’re done acting a certain way ( No more smoking !
No more spending !
No more unprotected sex ! ) , but then when temptation strikes , you go back on your word .
As I mention in Predictably Irrational , this predicament has to do with our inherent Jekyll - Hyde nature :
We just are n’t the same person all the time .
In our cold , dispassionate state , we stick to our long - term goals ( I will lose ten pounds ) ; but when we become emotionally aroused , our short - term wants take the helm ( Oh but I am hungry , so I ’ll have that slice of cake ) .
And what ’s worse , we consistently fail to realize just how differently we ’ll act and feel once aroused .
Fortunately , there ’s a way around the problem : pre-commitments , or the preemptive actions we can take to keep ourselves in check .
Worried you ’ll spend too much money at the bar ?
No problem , bring just the cash you ’re willing to part with .
Afraid you ’ll skip out on your next gym visit ?
All right , then make plans to meet a friend there .
And so on .
Pre -commitments can take many a form , and some get pretty creative .
For example , I surveyed my audience at the lecture hall for their pro-self - control tactics , and I received two noble suggestions .
One woman reported that when she goes out on a date with someone she should n’t bed , she makes a point to wear her granniest pair of granny underwear .
Similarly , another woman said that when faced with that kind of date , she just does n’t shave .
Both are great ideas , I think , and are likely to work — well they ’re certainly better than only relying on the strength of your self - control — but there is a risk .
Let ’s say the woman with the ugly underwear finds herself uncontrollably attracted to her date and decides that , you know what , ugly underwear be damned , there will be sex tonight !
Chances are she will wake up in the morning wishing she had worn her silk lingerie after all .
Irrationally yours
Dan
p.s if you have any personal self control stories that you are willing to share — please send them my way
“ Viagra has brought women out of the closet on this , ” Dr. Whitmore said .
“ It ’s given them a way to talk about it .
Suddenly he ’s got a sex life again and she ’s crying in pain .
No one ’s talked about the impact Viagra would have on her , which is why it ’s important to work with the couple .
She needs to understand what she ’s going through is normal . ”
Their practice includes six sex therapists and a psychologist who often wind up seeing both partners .
Originally , Dr. Kellogg and Dr. Whitmore had separate practices and referred patients to each other .
They estimate that in 50 percent of cases , there ’s an overlap between pelvic - area health problems and sexual dysfunction , which led them to merge their practices 15 years ago .
Dr. Owen Montgomery , chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Drexel University medical school , said that the treatment model Dr. Kellogg and Dr. Whitmore have created for women  a combination of sophisticated pelvic and urinary care along with sexual medicine and therapy all under one roof  is one of just a few in the country .
“ They ’re on the cutting edge of a new field , ” he said .
“ I used to have a gynecologist partner and if a middle - aged woman asked him about sex , he ’d say , ‘ I do n’t talk about sex . ’
Thankfully , that ’s changing . ”
Patty Maisano , 50 , a nurse who ’s been married to her second husband for 13 years , first visited the office with pain problems that required a hysterectomy and urinary surgery .
But once these issues were addressed , she said , she continued to have pain during sex .
Dr. Kellogg and her team offered a variety of medications , injections , lubricants , sprays and exercises over the next few years , which Ms. Maisano said made only “ moderate improvements ” in her sex life .
What finally worked , she said , was a nonhormonal topical product called Zestra , made from botanical oils and meant to heighten sensitivity to touch .
“ This last month , I feel like I ’m back in my 20s , ” Ms. Maisano said .
“ My husband is just thrilled that we can be intimate and both get pleasure out of it .
I can see a sigh of relief that I ’m not in pain . ”
“ So many women give up , ” she added .
“ That ’s a shame .
It ’s so important .
You marry your best friend , but intimacy is what makes a marriage work . ”
Zestra is a favorite of the center ’s patients , said Dr. Kellogg , who has worked as a paid consultant for Semprae Laboratories , which makes the product .
But she cautions that even if a product helps arousal , that is not the same as desire , and rekindling desire is the most complex challenge in her work .
The Dublin School District here in central Ohio has deigned to allow kids to watch tomorrow 's speech IF they bring a permission slip from their parents , allowing them to leave the classroom and watch the telecast in a designated area !

" Despite the warnings of right - wing radio hosts , and fully cognizant that my daughter risks learning a lesson in civics , I , nonetheless , grant her permission to watch a televised address by the duly - elected leader of these United States , President Barack Obama , on the controversial subject of the importance of school .

“ Now are n’t we ALL having more fun ? ”
[ @wilw submitted this comic to Reddit .
Cross that one off my “ geeky thing to accomplish before I die ” list ]
This comic comes from an actual occurrence at an actual shopping man in actual America .
The kids ’ dialog is almost entirely lifted from the real life youths I observed .
It just struck me as odd that Star Wars is alive and breathing in the lives of these pre-adolescent kids .
I assume this is mainly due to The Clone Wars animated series ( which I rather despise for being as boring and empty as the prequels ) .
Return of the Jedi came out in theater ’s when I was only 3 , and thus the only Star Wars I remember experiencing first hand was The Ewok Adventure ( which came out a year later ) .
I had nightmares about getting trapped under a frozen river for … well essentially forever .
My point is where as I was at least alive during the decade that the final movie of the original trilogy was released , the Star Wars franchise is probably having larger impact on the lives of kids that were born 20 years after me .
Practically as long as they ’ve been alive Lucas has been pumping out prequels , CGI movies , cartoon series , toys , costumes , video games , etc .
And do n’t forget the Internet .
THE INTERNET !
When a kid signs on to the damned Internet these days they have to select “ Star Wars ” or “ Everything else . ”
Even when they select “ Everything Else ” they still get a pop up of C - 3PO saying “ I have a bad feeling about this . ” every 30 seconds .
I ’m not complaining .
As dry as the franchise is now it still gets kids interested in Sci-Fi and boost their imaginations .
I guess I was just surprised at the realization that “ my Star Wars ” was 30 years old and “ their Star Wars ” was still being born .
NOTE : This will be the last comic this week so I can catch up on Artist Edition sketching and shipping .
It ’s not hard to become numb while competing in an online shooter .
As these components continue to become beefier and more complex , the impact an individual has in the outcome of a match shrinks .
But not every upcoming online setup is following this trend : Digital Illusions CE is blending massive team strategy with individual , hard - nosed impact in Battlefield : Bad Company 2 .
I ’ll give you an example .
In a single match of BC2 last evening , I sabotaged two Russian beacons while keeping my feats - in - progress going with a hot barrel and a magazine packed with lead death - dealers .
I butchered ten combatants , helped to defend a position from incoming armor , and jolted around six fallen comrades with a vicious blast of electrical current -- all in a span of nine or so minutes .
I did n’t need to kill 20 people in a row or compete for countless hours for the privilege of experiencing success .
I just needed to load the BC2's closed beta and hop into a match .
Rush Arica Harbor
The BC2 beta showcases one map , Arica Harbor .
It ’s a Middle Eastern - themed map featuring a sea of light - colored sand , twisted and broken set pieces , and tons of sun .
Breathtaking at first glance , the brightness reminds that not all shooters require murk and gloom to be special .
Likewise , the sharp contrasts between the sand , the demolished vehicles , and the various set pieces provide a platform for the stunning visuals .
If BC2 ’s full online component keeps to this same bar , I see it becoming one of the best - looking multiplayer games of this generation .
No doubt .
Arica Harbor hides its scale with a bit of cleverness .
It ’s the people competing in the beta ’s single game mode , Rush , who decide the size of the colorful map .
The mode pits two 12 - person teams against each other -- the Attackers and the Defenders .
The Attackers ' immediate goal is annihilate two marked beacons with explosives , while the other side attempts to defend this .
If the Attackers succeed , two more beacons appear further down the map , forcing all to rush the new positions .
This can happen a total of three times until the map uncoils to its crescendo : the harbor itself .
I ’ve experienced some of the nastiest , most intense slugfests in the game at the harbor .
DICE put both targets inside a lone building , with both sides spawning outside of the structure .
That ’s conducive to plenty of brawling outside of the objectives , which are easy to defend , yet playfully exposed to outside influences .
This tends to create some major satisfaction after the objective is completed -- even for the Defenders .
If the aggressors ca n’t hit both targets within 100 collective spawns , the game ends .
Guns , Tanks , and Gadgets , oh my !
Sticking with Battlefield tradition , there are several vehicles that both sides of the conflict can use to maim each other in various ways .
Arica Harbor has tanks , ATVs , and even Halo - style motorbikes for fast , flanking travel .
Also continuing with Battlefield tradition are the terrible vehicle controls .
While there ’s fun to be had and strategic opportunities with the inclusion of vehicles , something fascinating happens as objectives are destroyed and the map expands : the game starts reducing vehicle spawns , forcing people to forgo them and fight on the ground with guns .
The shift in warfare puts the focus on the tight gunplay .
BC2 ’s mechanics remind me of Infinity Ward ’s Call of Duty : Modern Warfare .
The guns are lifelike -- heavy , and accurate to a point .
The emphasis is thus on stop - and - pop .
You ca n’t hold down the trigger and expect magic to happen .
Executing a kill requires a bit of patience and skill .
In contrast to this is the sniper rifle , which seems to walk on the Halo side with its accuracy while running .
Similar to the gunplay , the class and leveling systems borrow a bit from the MW model , allowing for snappier ( than usual ) progression regardless of success and skill .
Four classes are represented in the beta : Medic , Engineer , Assault , and Recon .
Each one carries its own specific equipment .
For example , Medics have bullet - heavy LMGs and defibrillators to revive fallen opponents .
Assaults carry long - range rifles with grenade launcher attachments , and so on .
Being a class man reaps rewards in terms of specific and universal progression .
An well - performing Medic earns guns as he kills , and specific tech perks as he deploys health packs and revives others .
In turn , this makes Medics more valuable to any team .
And that ’s not quite all there is to earn , of course -- a quick look at the “ Weapons and Gadgets ” screen reveals tons of medals , universal unlockables based on specific levels , special dog tags and even insignias .
The progression is simple , yet effective .
Medics who can defend ( or attack ) with success while scanning the field for the fallen are valuable to Squads .
Plus , Medics who can do these sorts of things ramp up the opportunity for collective success because of their reviving ability in Rush .
Meaningful experiences
I think the BC2 beta boils down to meaningful experiences .
The game does n’t force you to become a cog in the machine , shackled to a class or arbitrary orders by an overarching commander who needs to see the sun every now and then .
Rather , it allows players to express themselves to some degree and experience success on their own terms .
The particular match I mentioned earlier is a great example .
While on my way to an objective , I jolted teammates and blasted several enemies before placing an explosive brick on the marked target .
That ’s impact , a meaningful experience within the online component .
I was n’t sitting in a corner eating kills or relying on others to do all the dirty work .
I was able to do my thing at my own pace and directly affecting the outcome of the match .
The marketing talks a lot about BC2 being “ dynamic . ”
I agree -- it has a dynamic edge , which in turn provides fodder for tons of individual and unique stories and shared experiences within .
The squad - based tactical spawns and the hardcore destruction engine are certainly a major part of this idea , providing unique chaos in every match .
Regardless of how often I play Arica Harbor , each match is a different one -- parts of the environment are blasted away , forcing me to take different routes and seek shelter in other places , and my squad members do just the same , forcing me to spawn in different locales .
In short , it ’s all fresh in Arica Harbor to some degree .
And that ’s it
I look forward to seeing the full online component in BC2 .
This Arica Harbor - based beta was a fascinating one , allowing me to see the little touches that should make this game pop in March .
That is to say , if things remain the same from the beta .
And if the larger things go unchanged , and this is a real , accurate reflection of what to expect with the full game , then Battlefield fans wo n’t walk away from BC2 disappointed : its beautiful look and spectacular mechanics will keep people playing hungrily , begging for more between each match .
We ’re ready to be consumed all over again .

You may ease your symptoms of colitis , rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , and other inflammatory disorders without taking drugs .
That ’s what new scientific research out of Australia suggests .
But before we get into the details , let ’s get a grip on how these problems take hold in the first place .
Why your immune system goes rogue …
A healthy immune system defends you against diseases , bacteria , and toxins .
But sometimes , it becomes confused .
It attacks the very stuff it ’s supposed to protect .
So , for example , if you suffer from rheumatoid arthritis , your immune system strikes your joints .
Your bones and cartilage also come under attack .
Then , your body reacts with inflammation to fix the damage .
As a result , your joints become swollen and sore .
Now — most conventional treatments for autoimmune disorders focus on drugs that suppress your immune system .
So , for instance , if you ’ve got RA , your doctor has probably told you to take a drug like Humira or Enbrel to ease the pain .
And sure , these drugs may control your flare - ups .
But , remember , they also suppress your immune system .
And this comes with its own fair share of problems .
In fact , new evidence suggests that taking these drugs ( called TNF blockers ) may increase your risk of getting a certain type of skin cancer by 50 percent .
Scary stuff , I know .
But , according to new research out of Australia , you may be able to bring your symptoms under control without resorting to drugs .
Control your inflammation with food
Australian scientists found that mice that eat plenty of insoluble fiber have healthier immune systems with less inflammation .
Sounds too simple , I know .
But stick with me .
Insoluble fiber comes from fruits and vegetables as well as nuts and seeds .
Your body converts the insoluble fiber you eat into ‘ short - chain fatty acids . ’
Scientists believe these fatty acids help reduce inflammation in the body .
In fact , previous studies have shown that these compounds ease the inflammation of colitis .
Sure , that makes sense .
Eat more fiber and your colon problems settle down .
No big surprise there .
But what about other inflammatory disorders ?
Does insoluble fiber work on them too ?
Turns out , it does !
In fact , it appears insoluble fiber has a calming affect on your immune system .
That ’s because short - chain fatty acids bind with a molecule in your body called GPR43 .
And according to the new research , your immune system needs GPR43 to function properly .
But if your body does n’t make enough GPR43 , your immune system goes haywire , attacking its own tissues and creating inflammation .
The good news is , by getting more insoluble fiber , you make more GPR43 available to your body .
According to Professor Charles Mackay , one of the study authors :
" The notion that diet might have profound effects on immune responses or inflammatory diseases has never been taken that seriously .
We believe that changes in diet , associated with western lifestyles , contribute to the increasing incidences of asthma , Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases .
Now we have a new molecular mechanism that might explain how diet is affecting our immune systems . "
Immune health starts in your gut
According to the new research , there ’s one other factor critical to keeping your immune system toned down .
And that ’s healthy bacteria .
You ’ve got to get plenty of it .
According to Kendle Maslowski , the other lead author in the study , " Changing diets are changing the kinds of gut bacteria we have , as well as their by - products , particularly short chain fatty acids .
If we have low amounts of dietary fibre , then we ’re going to have low levels of short chain fatty acids , which we have demonstrated are very important in the immune systems of mice . "
Now , I ’m the first to admit it .
Mackay ’s research is just a drop in the bucket .
And they used mice , not humans .
Nevertheless , I ’m a believer .
And that ’s because naturopaths have preached this same stuff for decades .
Your gut is the frontline of your immune system .
And certain foods help tame an inflamed immune system .
Mackey ’s just added the scientific proof .
My advice ?
If you ’ve got an autoimmune disorder , go ahead and boost your intake of insoluble fiber ( good sources include : dark greens , beans , broccoli , zucchini , celery , nuts , seeds , whole grains , and the skins of fruits ) .
And take a daily probiotic with billions of active units of healthy bacteria .
What ’s it going to hurt ?
And besides , if Mackay ’s research is on target ( and I think it is ) , it just might help tone down your symptoms .

Those two countries  the United States and China  account for more than 40 percent of the carbon emissions , roughly divided between both .
Speaking at the green marble lectern of the General Assembly chamber , President Obama told the audience of some 100 heads of state and government that “ unease is no excuse for inaction . ”
China ’s president , Hu Jintao , spoke of reducing the “ carbon intensity ” of his fast - growing economy , or cutting emissions as a percentage of future economic output , by a “ notable ” margin that he did not specify .
Mr. Obama acknowledged that the United States once played down the issue , but now recognized its gravity .
The world “ cannot allow the old divisions that have characterized the climate debate for so many years to block our progress , ” he said , adding that forging consensus would come slowly .
“ And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge . ”
“ Wall Street focuses on big companies because they are in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 , but small businesses are still in a very grim state , ” he says .
“ Small - company activity according to the N.F.I.B. is still at deep recession levels . ”
And while small businesses do not make up the big stock indexes , they do contribute significantly to the overall economy .
The tens of millions of people who work at small concerns are , after all , customers of those big , high - profile corporations like McDonald ’s , Wal - Mart and Whirlpool .
What we all are enduring  and what small businesses , workers and consumers continue to be pummeled by , even as Wall Street wizards jump back into the bonus pool  is the dismantling of the great credit boom of the early 2000s .
This necessary but grueling deleveraging began last year and is now in full swing .
But it is nowhere near over .
Bank credit outstanding peaked in October 2008 at $ 7.3 trillion and is now down to $ 6.72 trillion .
Still , Mr. Shepherdson says he thinks that banking - sector loan and lease assets have to fall by an additional $ 2 trillion .
That could take another two years .
“ We are in unknown territory here , ” he said .
“ Since the peak in October ’ 08 , bank credit has dropped by 8 percent .
That is enormous and it is accelerating .
The peak - to - trough drop in the early ’90s was just 1.3 percent and that was enough to scare the pants off the Fed . ”
This credit cave - in is the driving force behind the Federal Reserve ’s mortgage purchase program , Mr. Shepherdson says .
The last thing the central bank wants to see is a decline in the broad - based money supply , because when that happens it usually means a depression is afoot .
Money supply did n’t fall in the early 1990s , but it fell by one - quarter during the 1930s .
The Fed ’s asset purchase program is therefore not about driving down mortgage rates , Mr. Shepherdson says , but about trying to prevent a collapse in the money supply .
When the Fed buys assets it creates deposits , which , in turn , helps offset the credit pullback .
If the Fed was n’t buying mortgages with both hands , Mr. Shepherdson estimates , the money supply would be falling 1 percent a month .
My friend is geeky and he likes a lot of anime and games and cards and stuff .
Problem is he now is talking about how girls are ‘ b — - s ’ and how no girls are ‘ worth it ’ .
Advice ?
I like to call this geek - brand misogyny , and it ’s out there a lot more than you think .
Here ’s how to deal with it in a nutshell .
First off , understand where this comes from - it ’s not entirely strange to think like your friend .
Many geeks find , through various circumstances , that “ real ” women ( i.e. the kinds of girls they want and / or admire or whatever ) are inaccessible - and through some interesting mental processes , rather than thinking “ I want and I cannot have ” , they think “ I do n’t want so it ’s not an issue ” .
This , tied in with the way in which games / anime / eroge / the like portray women in “ perfect ” lights , really develops a unique kind of woman hating energy that can really come across as crass .
This is also why dating sims / eroge / romance anime exist , in sort of a circular way - they exist because geeks want idyllic women because real women do n’t seem good enough because they play / watch because geeks want idyllic women ( etc etc ) .
So what do I recommend you do ?
First off , help him find opportunities to approach and interact with real , interesting women .
Do not let him become excessively attached ( many “ Geek - brand misogynists ” ironically do this easily ) , but let him actually go out and do things with real women in groups - re-orient him to real , breathing , interesting , and normal women .
Do not let him recede into his fantasy world - shove him out there and make him stay there to the best of your ability .
Once you begin that , it may be best to enlist some ( female ) help .
While you ’re shoving them out there , get some female buddies to help him pull further out of his shell - let them help him meet interesting people , and let them do some of the heavy lifting with him .
This does n’t have to be a full out intervention - the more subtle , arguably the better - but let them try using their own skills .
Guys can only do so much in this situation .
Finally , remember that if he ’s like this , he might simply not change .
While I admire you wanting to help him , if he ’s adamant , there ’s not much you can do .
He might have to learn on his own time , unfortunately .

Download the Zip of the Latest Build .
Upzip the files .
Build according to instructions here .
In the end , you will end up with a file called
< abcl-dir>\dist\abcl.jar
You will need to add abcl . jar to your class path for ABCL projects .
to your class path for ABCL projects .
That 's it !
Hello , world !
Type the following at the command line ( adjust the path as necessary ) : C:\abcl-src-0.15.0 > cd dist C:\abcl-src-0.15.0\dist > java - jar abcl.jar

ABCL Cons and LispObject classes
Cons Corresponds to a Lisp cons or list Has car ( ) and cdr ( ) methods if you want to write Java code in a Lisp style .
Can also unbox Cons objects into arrays , if you wish by using the copyToArray ( ) method which returns LispObject [ ] .
LispObject A Lisp S-expression Can unbox LispObject s to Java primitives with methods such as intValue ( ) which returns ( surprise ! ) an int .
Other important ABCL classes
org.armedbear.lisp
Interpreter createInstance ( ) : Creates a Lisp interpreter . eval ( String expression ) : Evaluates a Lisp expression .
Often used with load to load a Lisp file .
Packages findPackage ( String packageName ) : Finds a Lisp package .
Package findAccessibleSymbol ( String symbolName ) :
Finds a symbol such as that for a function .
Symbol getSymbolFunction ( ) : Returns the function for a corresponding symbol .
Function execute ( ) : Executes a function taking a variable number of LispObject s as arguments .
JavaObject : A subclass of LispObject for objects coming from Java .
Getting a Lisp package from Java
To load a file of Lisp functions from Java , you do the following : Interpreter interpreter = Interpreter.createInstance ( ) ; interpreter.eval ( " ( load \ " my-lisp-code.lisp \ " ) " ) ;
You can then load the package containing a function you want to call .
In this case , our function is in the default Lisp package : Package defaultPackage = Packages.findPackage ( " CL - USER " ) ;
Getting a Lisp function from Java
Suppose we have a function called my - function defined in my - lisp - code.lisp ( which was loaded above ) .
We obtain it in two steps like this : Symbol myFunctionSym = defaultPackage.findAccessibleSymbol ( " MY - FUNCTION " ) ; Function myFunction = myFunctionSym.getSymbolFunction ( ) ;
Calling a Lisp function from Java
Call a Lisp function like this : Cons list = ( Cons ) myFunction.execute ( Fixnum.getInstance ( 64 ) , Fixnum.getInstance ( 64 ) ) ;
Our original Lisp function returned a list .
ABCL's Cons Java class corresponds to a Lisp list .
Note also that we wrap the int s ( in this example ) as Fixnum s .
Java class corresponds to a Lisp list .
Note also that we wrap the s ( in this example ) as s .
On the Lisp side , we can access these integers as if they came from directly from another Lisp method : ( defun my - function ( n1 n 2 ) ...)
Converting Java objects to Lisp values and vice - versa
Since the user can't be expected to know how to map every Java type to Lisp and vice - versa , there are a couple
of nice methods you can use in all cases :
public static LispObject JavaObject.getInstance( Object , boolean ) : Converts ( or wraps ) a Java object to a Lisp object , if the boolean is true ( else it just wraps it in a JavaObject ) .
: Converts ( or wraps ) a Java object to a Lisp object , if the boolean is true ( else it just wraps it in a ) . public Object LispObject.javaInstance ( ) : Converts ( or unwraps ) a Lisp object to Java .
You can invoke this on any Lisp object ; if it can't be converted , it will be returned as - is .
Calling Java from Lisp
This code sample is by Ville Voutilainen .
Java code
public class Main { public int addTwoNumbers ( int a , int b ) { return a + b ; } }
Lisp code
We need to get the
class ( Main ) classes of the parameters ( int ) method reference ( getting that requires the class of our object and the classes of the parameters )
After that we can invoke the function with jcall , giving the method reference , the object and the parameters .
The result is a Lisp object ( no need to do jobject - lisp - value , unless we invoke the method with jcall - raw ) .
( defun void - function ( param ) ( let* ( ( class ( jclass " Main " ) ) ( intclass ( jclass " int " ) ) ( method ( jmethod class " addTwoNumbers " intclass intclass ) ) ( result ( jcall method param 2 4 ) ) ) ( format t " in void - function , result of calling addTwoNumbers ( 2 , 4 ) : ~a~ % " result ) ) )

The App Engine USB drives - in bright primary , Google ( tm ) colors - are finished !
They 're currently winging their way to the Dublin office ( and a separate batch direct to the .astronomy venue .
Ca n't wait to get my hands on them .
Want to get your hands on one of them too ?
Post a suggestion for what topic you 'd like to see me write about - be it App Engine , Go , Damn Cool Algorithms , or something else - and I 'll send a USB drive , loaded with App Engine goodies and a Wave invite , to the authors of the best few suggestions .
I 'm going to be at .astronomy all next week , so I 'm not going to be putting up new posts on my regular schedule .
I will , however , be blogging about the conference , so look out for posts on some of the more interesting talks and breakout sessions / hackathons .
In one final , unrelated item , I 'd like to draw your attention to an amazing bit geekery .
Last week , I posted this code golf competition to Stack Overflow , for the shortest Fractran interpreter .
As an extra challenge , I offered a bonus to anyone who could provide a Fractran interpreter in fractran .
Not one but two people took me up on this , and it's the second one I particularly want to draw your attention to .
Amadeus managed to implement a self - hosting Fractran interpreter in a mere 84 instructions , and made it fast enough to actually run some of the test cases extremely fast , too .
Take a look - it 's an amazing bit of code , and deserves some serious kudos .

Editor Note :
In our ‘ best of MasterResource ’ weekend series , we are pleased to reprint the September 30th post by Ken Green in light of the stalemate of U.S. climate legislation for 2009 .
Obviously , the onset of Climategate will only reinforce a worst - case scenario for climate alarmism politics .
Desperation is setting in among climate alarmists who by their own math can see that the window is rapidly closing on “ saving the planet . ”
James Hansen , for instance , said three years ago in the New York Review of Books : “ We have at most ten years — not ten years to decide upon action , but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions . ”
That was also Al Gore ’s estimate in “ An Inconvenient Truth . ”
But the time has been ticking away , and it ’s increasingly obvious that the Gore / Hansen “ wrenching transformation ” of the U.S. energy system is simply not going to happen .
Perhaps Copenhagen will make it official .
U.S. cap - and - trade has become a big political liability , in particular , as polls show voters are relatively unconcerned about climate change , and are deeply averse to higher energy prices .
That has led Senator John Kerry , for example , to try to hide the ball by changing the name of scheme to “ pollution reduction ” in order to obscure the reality that it ’s basically a massive energy tax .
Other Left - leaning politicians ( the latest being Houston Mayor Bill White , who is running for the U.S. Senate ) are announcing their opposition to cap - and - trade . ( 1 )
Renewable energy is also getting more scrutiny than ever before , awakening not only cost - conscious middle America but grass - roots environmentalists concerned about negative local impacts and big- business intrusion .
Anti-Alarmist Momentum
Here is the death spiral that I believe the the Climate Crisis Industry fears ( and is probably right to fear ) consciously or subconsciously :
1. U.S. rejects cap - and - trade in 2009 , leaving a climate bill in serious trouble for election - year 2010 and beyond .
2 . Copenhagen flounders without any U.S. commitment and from developing country opposition , among other things .
The failed Kyoto Protocol creeps toward its 2012 expiration date with an all pain , no gain tag .
3 . EPA action is delayed by court action and public / political opposition , negating implementation for years and effective implementation for longer .
Congressional action to de-authorize EPA becomes more and more likely as businesses , and electric utilities in particular , demand certainty to meet growing U.S. electricity demand coming out of a recession .
4 . The climate continues its decade long trend of non-warming for another 10 years , as some scientists have predicted .
The return of bitterly cold winters , and more years “ without a summer ” increases public skepticism about climate science .
More revelations come out about data manipulation by NASA , and cherry - picking by scientists trying to paint a false picture of recent warming in historical perspective .
5 . Climate initiatives ( renewable energy subsidies , etc. ) are increasingly scrutinized and attacked as job - destroying corporate welfare by the Right and political capitalism by the Left .
6 . Grassroots opposition builds against wind and solar farms because of landscape , wildlife , and people issues–and with the knowledge that such are not going to make a climatological difference .
Environmentalists continue to block renewable projects at the local level , making it increasingly obvious that the U.S. risks energy shortages as conventional power generation is also stalled 7 .
Given the political impasse , and feeling somewhat duped , more and more science writers and academics will start covering hard climate data / trends rather than uncritically flogging the latest garbage - in / garbage - out forecasting .
[ Okay , this could be wishful thinking on my part , based on a mistaken belief that left - leaning science writers actually care about balanced reporting , and that academics dependent on government grants might develop something resembling a spine , but a person can dream , ca n’t they ? ]
8 . More attention focuses on adaptation and climate engineering , both of which spark furious debates on the Left as , respectively , “ defeatist ” and “ playing God with climate . ”
9 . The “ Great Climate Scare ” becomes scrutinized for bad behavior and lessons - learned –which magnifies the intellectual and media turnaround on the issue .
10 . Political support ebbs for government - dependent wind , solar , and energy efficiency companies , deflating the bubble and leaving a sad industrial trail of broken , obsolete , or uneconomic wind turbines and solar panels .
Conclusion
In the face of the risks to the climate crisis agenda outlined above , we can expect the climate crisis industry to grow increasingly shrill , and increasingly hostile toward anyone who questions their authority .
Politicians are likely to try to ram as much through as they can for their favored constituencies and technologies before the climate crisis runs out of steam , and public concern drops even lower .
This is the time for those concerned about public policy to be on high alert , as panicked activists and politicians will be trying every trick in the book to enact their agenda by hook or by crook .
Vigilance is called for more than ever in contentious climate debate .

Leonids in the 1999 shower above the Torre de la Guaita , an observation tower used during the 12th century in Girona , Spain ( Image : Juan Carlos Casado / GSFC )
Well - placed skywatchers could see hundreds of meteors an hour on Tuesday , at the peak of the annual Leonid meteor shower .
Meteors are bits of dust or rock that collide with Earth ’s atmosphere .
The friction heats up gas particles that produce a glowing trail .
A handful of meteors can be seen each hour on any clear night , but this number can spike significantly during a meteor shower .
The Leonid shower occurs each year when the Earth passes through streams of debris ejected by the comet 55P / Tempel - Tuttle , which often leaves behind dusty trails as it passes through the inner solar system every 33 years .
Advertisement
Earth will cut across the first such stream around 0900 GMT on 17 November , an event that is expected to produce dozens of meteors an hour .
But the spectacle will reach its peak between 2100 and 2200 GMT , as Earth passes through two debris trails left by Tempel - Tuttle in 1466 and 1533 .
Leonids rising
These stream crossings could create as many as 300 Leonid meteors per hour , according to NASA ’s Meteoroid Environment Office .
Skywatchers in Asia and the easternmost parts of Europe will have the best view of these intense showers , because the sky will be dark and the apparent point of origin of the meteors – called the radiant – will be over the horizon .
The Leonid shower is so called because the radiant is in the northern constellation Leo .
The best time to view the shower is after this spot rises , around 2400 GMT .
North American observers may be able catch a glimpse of dozens of meteors before dawn on 17 November , but an elevated number of meteors may also be visible on the following night .
European observers will get their best glimpse of the shower after the peak , in the early hours of 18 November .

Minoan Prince circa 1600BC
The mural painting of the young Minoan nobleman ( C 1600 BC ) above seems surprisingly modern .
The reason for this is immediately evident when we compare it with the Matisse painting , The Romanian Blouse .
Matisse said about his painting , “ I do not insist upon the details of the face , ” indicating that the overall effect of the painting was his main concern .
Both works are examples of abstract painting in the sense that a great deal of detail has been omitted in favor of a few bold elements of form and colour .
Matisse , The Romanian Blouse
Each painter ( the Minoan artist being unknown ) has created a work according to his own style but has achieved a similarly pleasing result .
Both paintings are examples of figurative art , that mainstay of painting over the 3,600 years between the two .
Matisse writes :
What interests me most is neither still life nor landscape but the human figure .
It is through it that I best succeed in expressing the nearly religious feeling that I have towards life .
Both the Matisse and Minoan paintings express a sunny optimism and refinement that is conspicuously absent in many contemporary works of art .
The Minoans painted animals and fish as well as the human figure , but the immediate aesthetic aims of the two artists can be examined for what they have in common .
They drew on the forms of nature but also on their skills of subordinating visual experience to composition , colour harmonies and the balance between descriptive detail and the division of the surface into shapes .
Notice how the white area in the Minoan mural corresponds to the white area of the Romanian blouse , and how these areas are decorated with calligraphic or geometric details , serving to interest the eye rather than the mind .
In the Minoan work , the white area is negative , but in the Matisse painting it represents the positive form of the woman ’s torso .
The lack of modelling in the face , which relies on the almost undifferentiated pink tone , corresponds to the similar treatment of the Minoan youth ’s body .
The mind is left free to “ read ” the implied form from the bounding tonal areas ; and the effect of such simplification is to increase the impact of the coloured areas and the importance of the overall design .
In this context , the radical departure from three dimensional modeling , usually attributed to Gauguin and the influence of Japanese prints , can be seen as a return to the simpler forms of the past .
Picasso takes up this approach in his rose period , but soon abandons it to establish a hefty neo-classical modelling of the figure , post cubism .
However , Picasso ’s intensive studies of Greek vase decoration place him closer to Minoan , Etruscan and Greek linear art than Matisse , who drew much of his inspiration from Islamic decorative art .
It is evident from the Minoan murals that have survived , that Minoan culture was hedonistic .
The early paintings , despite heavy stylisation , reflect the similar kind of joi de vivre found in much of Matisse ’s work .
Picasso’s portrait of his eldest son Paulo as a clown provides another example of extreme simplification of form and the suppression of detail in aid of composition .
The white of the costume and the black accoutrements define the figure with the red , grey and pale blue elements , and the decorative balcony defines the background .
The message of these apparently simple works is that less can be more in presenting a feast for the eye , especially when it is used to being bombarded with thousands of messages an hour via computer and television screens .
These works , and many more like them from all periods of history , evoke a contemplative state of mind that appeals to the sensualist in those of us who hanker after a simpler life .
Picasso , Paulo as Pierrot Picasso , Portrait of a Woman
In the final example , Picasso leaves the white area of the figure and the red chair undecorated , but he uses the wallpaper and the panelling of the background as decorative elements .
These elements create the illusion of space while retaining the high impact of large areas of “ flat ” pigment in the foreground .
The result is that sensuous and relaxed feeling evident in the previous examples .
While a great many complex styles of painting have evolved since the Palace of Knossos was decorated , the involuntary responses of the human eye and brain to areas of colours on a flat surface remain the same .
Learning to appreciate different styles educates the mind to accept a wide range of images as aesthetically valuable , but the underlying principles used by painters to please the viewer remain .
These are the fundamentals that the good painter seeks to understand .
Matisse expresses this idea best in his aphorism :
A work of art must carry in itself its complete significance and impose it upon the beholder even before he can identify the subject matter .
Tony Thomas was born in England in 1939 , and is a retired bureaucrat living in Brisbane , Australia .
He has an Australian wife , two adult daughters , a dog and a cat .
He holds a degree in economics from the University of Queensland .
His interests are catholic , and include : writing fiction , poetry , and blogging political diatribes .
Other abiding interests include political and social philosophy , with occasional forays into logic and the foundations of mathematics .

US and Afghan forces have killed three al Qaeda operatives who served as embedded trainers for the Taliban in western Afghanistan .
The three al Qaeda operatives were killed along with with three Taliban fighters during a clash in the Gazara district in the western province of Herat , which up until two years ago was a relatively peaceful area .
“ A joint operation of Afghan and NATO forces was kicked off in Gazara district since Monday to clean up the area from rebels and so far six militants including three Arabs have been eliminated , ” Abdul Basir Ghori , a spokesman for the Afghan military told Xinhua .
The three al Qaeda operatives “ provided military training to Taliban insurgents in the area , ” Xinhua reported , based on Ghori ’s statement .
Al Qaeda operatives serving as embedded trainers to Taliban forces are occasionally killed during fighting in Afghanistan , even in the far - flung regions of western Afghanistan .
In August 2008 , al Qaeda leader Abu Gharib al Makki was killed during a clash with US and Afghan forces in Farah province .
US intelligence officials later told The Long War Journal that Makki was one of several al Qaeda trainers detached to Taliban units in order to impart knowledge on explosives and military tactics to local Taliban forces .
The embedded al Qaeda fighters are members of al Qaeda ’s paramilitary Shadow Army , or the Lashkar al Zil .
The Shadow Army is the successor to al Qaeda ’s notorious Brigade 055 , the military formation that fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan .
During the reign of the Taliban in Afghanistan prior to the US invasion in 2001 , the 055 Brigade served as “ the shock troops of the Taliban and functioned as an integral part of the latter ’s military apparatus , ” al Qaeda expert Rohan Gunaratna wrote in Inside al Qaeda .
At its peak in 2001 , the 055 Brigade had an estimated 2,000 soldiers and officers in the ranks .
The brigade was comprised of Arabs , Central Asians , and South Asians , as well as Chechens , Bosnians , and Uighurs from Western China .
The Shadow Army has been expanded to six brigades , and has an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 fighters .
In addition to dispatching small teams of embedded trainers to Taliban units , the Shadow Army fights in military formations along the Afghan and Pakistani border region .
The Shadow Army occasional fights alongside the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban , Hezb - i- Islami , and the Haqqani Network , in formations ranging from squad to company level .
Evidence of this was seen recently in Swat and Bajaur in Pakistan , where the Pakistani Army met stiff resistance in some battles , as well as in North and South Waziristan in 2007 and 2008 .
The Shadow Army also played a role in last weekend ’s assault on joint US and Afghan outposts in Nuristan province , as well as in a series of attacks last year on outposts in the Afghan provinces of Paktika , Paktia , Khost , Kunar , and Nuristan .
The most publicized attack took place in July 2008 in Wanat in Nuristan , when nine US soldiers were killed and the base was nearly overrun .
The US has targeted the leaders of the Shadow Army during its air campaign in Pakistan ’s northwest .
The US killed Khalid Habib , the former leader of the Shadow Army , during an airstrike in South Waziristan in Pakistan last November .
Habib was replaced by Abdullah Sa ’id al Libi .

Health Care Premiums Also Used for Lavish Salaries , Luxury Items , Underwriters Sen. says your premiums fund lavish salaries , luxury items and underwriters .
Nov. 3 , 2009  --
A significant portion of health insurance premiums go not for actual medical care but for private jets , generous CEO salaries and underwriters who decide when to drop patients who become too expensive , according to a Senate committee report .
Sen . John D. Rockefeller , D - W.Va. , chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation , wrote to 15 of the biggest health insurance companies in August , asking them to provide information on how much of policyholders ' monthly premiums was spent on medical care versus the amount that went to administrative costs and company earnings .
Such figures are known in insurance industry - speak as " medical loss ratios . "
But when insurance companies balked , saying the information was confidential and proprietary , Rockefeller 's investigators went digging through public documents and found that much of policyholder premiums was going to nonmedical costs .
The insurance industry has long pointed to federal data that says about 87 percent of every dollar that people spend on premiums goes toward actual medical care , but Rockefeller 's investigators found the average for the top six insurance companies is closer to 82 cents on the dollar for medical care .
That five - point difference represents billions of dollars .
And when investigators broke down the information by insurance type , they found that people who buy individual insurance from those companies rather than being part of a small or large business , get the least bang for their buck .
On average just 74 cents of every premium dollar for individual coverage goes to medical care .
Coventry Health Care had the lowest figure at 66 cents .
It 's Easier to Buy a Car
Rockefeller contends that consumers get more information from window stickers on new cars for sale than they do from insurance companies .
" Instead of disclosing medical loss ratios to help consumers and small business owners make informed health care choices , health insurance companies have hidden them behind a wall of corporate secrecy , " he wrote , adding that the committee found Cigna appeared to have submitted inaccurate state insurance regulatory filings for its activities in certain areas .
Insider Shares Industry Practices
None of this surprises Wendell Potter .
He is a former Cigna insurance company executive turned whistle - blower and has testified before the committee about industry practices .
Potter has long said that insurers spend less than they claim on medical care and spend a big chunk of money to actively seek ways to avoid paying claims .
Rockefeller 's letter also said a large portion of money consumers pay for premiums is spent on analyzing claims .
According to Potter , companies will carefully review an individual 's policy to see if the insured has omitted a minor illness or pre-existing condition , and will use that as a justification for cancellation .
In an interview with ABC News Monday , Potter said insurance companies drop consumers who cost too much -- " to get rid of any individuals or customers that might cost more money than they take in in premiums . "
In the small group market , Potter has described how insurers " purge " small businesses with high health care expenses by increasing premiums to unsustainable levels , Rockefeller wrote .
According to small business owner Bruce Hetrick , that happened to him .
He testified about his experiences before a House committee .
Hetrick said he was priced out of his insurance when his wife , who was his business partner , got cancer .
" A few months before her death , our health insurance renewal came up .
Lo and behold , the quoted increase for the health insurance portion of our benefits was a whopping 28 percent .
That would have been devastating to our business and our employees , " Hetrick said .
After Hetrick 's wife died , he was told by the company that the rates would rise only 10 percent , according to published reports .
Premiums Also Fund Some Perks
What else is your premium dollar being spent on , if not on health care ?
Potter points to the CEO 's multimillion - dollar salaries and the perks of that job .
In the Monday interview , Potter described the industry 's corporate jets .
" A favorite jet is the Falcon series made by a French manufacturer .
Very luxuriously equipped , " he said .
" The big leather seats , polished mahogany and other fine wood .
Usually for a long or short trip , there 's a flight attendant who serves you breakfast , lunch or a snack or drink .
If it 's food , often it will be on china , gold rimmed . "
Insurers Dispute Report's Findings
A group representing the health insurance industry said Monday that Rockefeller and his committee are mischaracterizing the way companies spend their customers ' health premium dollars .
America 's Health Insurance Plans , a health insurance industry group , argues that the quality of health care cannot be judged based on a single number -- the medical cost ratio .
It says a low medical cost ratio may be deceiving because nonmedical costs in every dollar can include beneficial , cost - saving measures such as fraud reduction or round - the - clock nurses .
AHIP also stands by the federal data compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which says that overall in the industry , 87 cents of each premium dollar goes to medical care .
Cigna said its numbers are even better than that .
In a statement to ABC news , the company , which said it had only just received a copy of Rockefeller 's letter and had n't been able to conduct an in - depth review , said that at least 88.8 percent of premiums pay for medical services for those who buy insurance through small and large businesses .
For individuals , Cigna claims that 93.1 percent goes to medical care .
Aetna , Coventry , Humana , UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint did not respond to ABC News ' requests for comment .
Implications for Congressional Debate
The health care reform bills currently under debate on Capitol Hill take up the issue of medical loss ratios .
The House bill would require that health insurance companies spend a minimum of 85 percent of every premium dollar on health care .
The Senate bill has no such minimum requirement , but Rockefeller has pledged to push for one when the bill comes before the full Senate .
Both the House and Senate bills do contain provisions that would require health insurance companies to provide consumers more information on how their premium dollars are being spent .
On Monday , Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee had not yet seen the letter to Cigna , even though ranking minority member Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was copied on the letter .
They could not comment on the specific data presented but said Rockefeller 's investigation all year has been " a partisan attempt to get support for a public option in the health care debate . "

Police are shutting websites without keeping any records , hampering government efforts to address online extremism , it 's been revealed .
The Terrorism Act 2006 granted powers for police to compel web hosts to shut down websites promoting terrorism .
But the powers have never been used , and forces have instead persuaded providers to take down websites voluntarily , according to the security minister Lord West .
He told the Lords on Wednesday that he could not say how many websites have been censored because no records have been kept .
" When we passed the Act in 2006 , we laid down a requirement to make such records , but it has not really been done , " he said .
" The Office for Security and Counter - Terrorism is now talking in great detail to the Association of Chief Police Officers , and the requirement will be met .
We need to make sure that records are properly kept because we need to have precise facts to work on . "
When measures against extremist websites were announced , the government suggested ISPs might introduce filtering arrangements similar to the Internet Watch Foundation 's blocklist of URLs leading to images of child abuse .
No system has emerged , however , and industry sources say the idea is not being discussed .
SOCA and GCHQ are both involved in investigating extremism online , and regional police act to shut websites down where possible .
However , in common with abuse sites , most extremist sites are hosted overseas .
" A lot of this is abroad — it is carried on by ISPs abroad , " West said .
" We have to deal with them internationally .
However , I can assure this House that we are really working hard in this area .
We will jolly well get there , and we will jolly well knock them for six finally .
" Finding out who has done something , finding out which server the information is on and where it has come from , is very difficult .
It takes very detailed and hard work .
I am glad to say that we have some of the best people in the world doing this work , but it is highly complicated . " ®

Krash Boom Bam recently had the pleasure of interviewing one of my personal favorite drummers Steve Taylor .
What kind of set up are you using ?
Mike Van Eyes and Ron Scott saw this kit in New West that was under a car port in a back alley .
It has a cool brown / grey swirl to it .
I think it ’s called root beer swirl .
They approached the owners and offered $ 50.00 for them and I put another $ 150.00 into them for new drum heads .
They ’re some proto - type for maybe premier or Japan models .

The hottest news this week is now in .
Early call perhaps , but I think you 'll all agree .
Toyota has , via its Japanese - language outlet , issued a press release declaring that the Lexus LF - A will indeed compete in the upcoming Nurburgring 24hr race , officially titled the 36th ADAC Zurich 24 h Race 2008 , to be held in May from the 22nd to the 25th .
This represents the LF - A's first official public outing in a genuine racing capacity , and is surely a sign that the car is moving ahead in leaps and bounds .
The announcement points to the fact that Toyota is seeking to expand and build on the development of the LF - A by gathering research and experience via the race .
This will provide Toyota with the kind of data that can only be accumulated through a good hard slog against the best cars the world can offer .

Police have arrested a man over an alleged assault on former X Factor winner Leona Lewis at a book signing .
A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed police were called to Waterstone 's book store at Piccadilly in London but said Leona Lewis " did not require hospital treatment " .

SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized .
Dated : October 19 , 2009
Last week 's item on " The Manchurian Clergyman " made me seek out one of my collections of the writings of H.L. Mencken , a man who might well take credit for the modern artform of " merciless rhetorical spankings of fanatics , villains , and ignoramuses . "
But , I wonder , could Mencken write a column for a newspaper today in America ?
Doubtful .
Consider this item that appeared in the Baltimore Evening Sun on December 9 , 1929 :
N0 , there is nothing notably dignified about religious ideas .
They run , rather , to a peculiarly puerile and tedious kind of nonsense ....
One may forgive a Communist or a Single Taxer on the ground that there is something the matter with his ductless glands ...[ b]ut the average theologian is a hearty , red - faced , well - fed fellow with no discernible excuse in pathology .
He disseminates his blather , not innocently , like a philosopher , but maliciously , like a politician .
There is , in fact , nothing about religious opinions that entitles them to any more respect than other opinions get .
On the contrary , they tend to be noticeably silly .
If you doubt it , then ask any pious fellow of your acquaintance to put what he believes into the form of an affidavit , and see how it reads ....
" I , John Doe , being duly sworn , do say that I believe that , at death , I shall turn into a verterbrate without substance , having neither weight , extent nor mass , but with all the intellectual powers and bodily sensations of an ordinary mammal ; ... and that , for the high crime and misdemeanor of having kissed my sister - in - law behind the door , with evil intent , I shall be boiled in molten sulphur for one billion calendar years .... "
The most curious social convention of the great age in which we live is the one to the effect that religious opinions should be respected .
Its evil effects must be plain enough to everyone .
All it accomplishes is ( a ) to throw a veil of sanctity about ideas that violate every intellectual decency , and ( b ) to make every theologian a sort of chartered libertine .
No doubt it is mainly to blame for the appalling slowness with which really sound notions make their way in the world ....
Or what of this from the Baltimore Evening Sun of June 29 , 1925 , regarding the Scopes trial :
Such obscenities as the forthcoming trial of the Tennessee evolutionist , if they serve no other purpose , at least call attention dramatically to the fact that enlightenment , among mankind , is very narrowly dispersed .
It is common to assume that human progress affects everyone -- that even the dullest man , in these bright days , knows more than any man of , say , the Eighteenth Century , and is far more civilized .
This assumption is quite erroneous .
The men of the educated minority , no doubt , know more than their predecessors , and of some of them , perhaps , it may be said that they are more civilized -- though I should not like to be put to giving names -- but the great masses of men , even in this inspired republic , are precisely where the mob was at the dawn of history .
They are ignorant , they are dishonest , they are cowardly , they are ignoble .
They know little if anything that is worth knowing , and there is not the slightest sign of a natural desire among them to increase their knowledge ....
Every step in human progress , from the first feeble stirrings in the abyss of time , has been opposed by the great majority of men .
Every valuable thing that has been added to the store of man 's possessions has been derided by them when it was new , and destroyed by them when they had the power .
They have fought every new truth ever heard of , and they have killed every truth - seeker who got into their hands .
The so - called religious organizations which now lead the war against the teaching of evolution are nothing more , at bottom , than conspiracies of the inferior man against his betters .
They mirror very accurately his congenital hatred of knowledge , his bitter enmity to the man who knows more than he does , and so gets more out of life .
Certainly it cannot have gone unnoticed that their membership is recruited , in the overwhelming main , from the lower orders -- that no man of any education or other human dignity belongs to them .
What they propose to do , at bottom and in brief , is to make the superior man infamous -- by mere abuse if it is sufficient , and if it is not , then by law ....
The popularity of Fundamentalism among the inferior orders of men is explicable in exactly the same way .
The cosmogonies that educated men toy with are all inordinately complex ....
But the cosmogony of Genesis is so simple that even a yokel can grasp it .
It is set forth in a few phrases .
It offers , to an ignorant man , the irresistible reasonableness of the nonsensical .
So he accepts it with loud hosannas , and has one more excuse for hating his betters .
Politics and the fine arts repeat the story .
The issues that the former throw up are often so complex that , in the present state of human knowledge , they must remain impenetrable , even to the most enlightened men .
How much easier to follow a mountebank with a shibboleth -- a Coolidge , a Wilson or a Roosevelt !
What all this amounts to is that the human race is divided into two sharply differentiated and mutually antagonistic classes , almost two genera -- a small minority that plays with ideas and is capable of taking them in , and a vast majority that finds them painful , and is thus arrayed against them , and against all who have traffic with them .
The intellectual heritage of the race belongs to the minority , and to the minority only .
The majority has no more to do with it than it has to do with ecclesiastic politics on Mars .
In so far as that heritage is apprehended , it is viewed with enmity .
But in the main it is not apprehended at all .
