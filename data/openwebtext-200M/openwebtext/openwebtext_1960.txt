Thousands of convicted sex offenders are reporting to police that they are homeless , raising concerns that their lack of a permanent address could make them difficult to track , a USA TODAY analysis shows .
Sex offenders , who are required to register with police and often barred by law from living near places where children gather , list addresses such as a tent , " near a bike path , " " behind a cemetery " or " woods behind Wal - Mart . "
OFF THE MAP : Homeless and dangerous LIST : Registered sex offenders by state In Boston , nearly two - thirds of 136 high - risk sex offenders lack permanent addresses .
In New York City , more than 100 registered at two homeless shelters .
In Miami last month , 22 reported living under the Julia Tuttle Causeway that links the city to Miami Beach .
" People should be concerned about this , " says Jill Levenson , sex-crimes policy analyst at Lynn University in Boca Raton , Fla .
She says homeless sex offenders are more likely to commit another crime .
USA TODAY reviewed each state 's sex - offender registry , searched tens of thousands of addresses and interviewed officials in 45 states after contacting all states .
The analysis shows : • Two - thirds of the states allow convicted sex offenders , including violent predators , to register as homeless or list a shelter or inexact location as long as they stay in touch with police .
• At least a dozen states list hundreds of sex offenders without specific addresses .
California registered 2,716 as " transient . "
Washington state listed 564 as homeless , but the number is probably much higher , says Carolyn Sanchez of the Washington State Patrol .
• Arkansas , Connecticut , Florida , Illinois , Maine and other states say the number of homeless sex offenders is rising .
Landlords often wo n't rent to them , and laws in dozens of states and hundreds of cities bar them from living near areas where kids play .
" Residency restrictions are the linchpin for causing homelessness among sex offenders , " says Frances Breyne of the Kansas Department of Corrections .
In California , about 500 have registered as " transient " since a law last year blocked them from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park , says Bill Sessa of the California Department of Corrections .
They must report daily where they 'll spend the night .
An exact count of convicted sex offenders who are homeless could not be done because not all state records are online .
Some states do not list homeless as an address but allow shelters , post office boxes , highway mile markers and streets without house numbers .
Illinois prefers that an offender register as homeless and report weekly to police rather than register once a year and list a shelter where he might stay one night , says Cara Smith , deputy chief of staff to the attorney general .
Some states keep sex offenders locked up until they find housing .
In Michigan , they are less likely to get parole than murderers , says Russ Marlin , spokesman for the state Department of Corrections .
In Georgia , sex offenders can be arrested for being homeless .
Homeless sex offenders are not necessarily more dangerous than those with housing , says Laura Rogers , director of the Justice Department 's office for tracking sex offenders .
She says , " The people you need to be worried about most are the ones who are n't registering at all . "

From The Largest Minority :
The United States is the only industrialized nation where hemp is not an established crop , much to the delight of oil , coal , and chemical industries which benefit from the ban .
Cultivation of hemp is currently illegal under US federal law thanks to the lobbying of the aforementioned groups .
The California Narcotic Officers ’
Association has testified that the passage of such a bill would only make law enforcement more difficult because farmers might hide illegal marijuana in their legal hemp fields .
I could be wrong , but it seems like this association is either admitting that they ’re too incompetent to do their jobs correctly , or they ’re making the case for the legalization of marijuana so that they ’re not forced to make the distinction .
Either way , I say let the layoffs begin .
Stuff is actually cheaper in relative terms now than it was one and two generations ago .
The big difference is that people want more stuff .
They get caught up in a cycle of wanting / needing / desiring the latest / greatest / newest gadgets / appliances / toys / cars .
Thirty years ago , people had one phone bill for one phone line .
They usually drove a car for 8 - 10 years instead of getting a new one every few .
They lived in the same house their entire lifetime , instead of " trading up " every decade or so .
They bought little or no " fast food " , and drove smaller cars .
When oil prices skyrocketed in the late 70's , we closed off our upstairs in the winter and camped out in the living room .
We traded in our big cars for smaller ones .
We conserved .
Weekends used to be about something besides shopping .
Kids used to play outside with their friends instead of being involved in sports all year , saving tons of wear and tear on cars , lots of gas , and hey , we were creative enough to be the ones who developed computer systems in garages .
Kitchens were remodeled every 30 years , not every 5 .
No one except chefs would consider buying commercial appliances .
If we scale back our living , live without some of the stuff , we can live on one income .
Many of my friends and family are able to , and raise kids , and save for retirement .
Life is actually much more enjoyable when weekends are not only for shopping for more stuff , but for doing things together as a family .
Want to save on groceries ?
Grow a garden or buy a share of a CSA ( community supported agriculture ) .
Do n't buy stuff with ingredient lists ... buy whole foods and cook them yourself .
Get your books from the library instead of buying them .
Make your own coffee and lunch .
Want to spend more time with your kids ?
Be one of the millions of people who have found a way to supplement their income by working from home , if you need to work at all .
You may find that by not having a second job , your expenses will go way down , especially with childcare , wardrobe , food , and you will also pay a lower tax rate .
And you wo n't feel like you have to buy your kids all the latest and greatest gadgets because you feel guilty for being away so much .
We used to both work full time .
We paid about 40 % of our income in tax because we did n't have kids .
Now , I work part time , from a home office , my own business .
We make less , but actually have more money in the bank , more money at the end of the year .
We live more frugally , but enjoy it so much more .
We plan to retire early .
Life is what you make it .
Make it the best you can .
It took thirty years for “ Frost / Nixon ” to reach Broadway .
Assuming that civilization survives and the Great White Way remains above water , we can expect “ Cheney / Bush ” to mount the boards sometime in the late twenty - thirties or early twenty - forties .
The playwright and the actors , whoever they are , will have plenty to work with .
The story of the scowling , scheming , domineering , silently sinister Vice - President and the spoiled , petted prince who becomes his plaything is irresistible — set in a pristine White House , played against an ominous , unseen background of violence and catastrophe , like distant thunder , and packed with drama , palace intrigue , and black comedy .
Robert Risko
A thick sheaf of new material has lately been added to the Cheney folder .
For four days last week , the front page of the Washington Post was dominated by a remarkable series of articles slugged “ ANGLER : THE CHENEY VICE PRESIDENCY . ” ( “ Angler , ” Cheney ’s metaphorically apt Secret Service code name , refers to one of his two favorite outdoor pastimes , the one less hazardous to elderly lawyers . )
The series , by Barton Gellman and Jo Becker , occupied sixteen broadsheet pages and topped out at twenty thousand words .
The headline over last Monday ’s installment encapsulates the burden of the whole : “ The Unseen Path to Cruelty . ”
Some of the Post ’s findings have been foreshadowed elsewhere , notably in Jane Mayer ’s dispatches in this magazine .
( See , especially , Letter from Washington , “ The Hidden Power , ” July 3 , 2006 . )
But many of the details and incidents that Gellman and Becker document are as new as they are appalling .
More important , the pattern that emerges from the accumulated weight of the reporting is , as the lawyers say , dispositive .
Given the ontological authority that the Post shares only with the New York Times , it is now , so to speak , official : for the past six years , Dick Cheney , the occupant of what John Adams called “ the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived , ” has been the most influential public official in the country , not necessarily excluding President Bush , and his influence has been entirely malign .
He is pathologically ( but purposefully ) secretive ; treacherous toward colleagues ; coldly manipulative of the callow , lazy , and ignorant President he serves ; contemptuous of public opinion ; and dismissive not only of international law ( a fairly standard attitude for conservatives of his stripe ) but also of the very idea that the Constitution and laws of the United States , including laws signed by his nominal superior , can be construed to limit the power of the executive to take any action that can plausibly be classified as part of an endless , endlessly expandable “ war on terror . ”
More than anyone else , including his mentor and departed co-conspirator , Donald Rumsfeld , Cheney has been the intellectual author and bureaucratic facilitator of the crimes and misdemeanors that have inflicted unprecedented disgrace on our country ’s moral and political standing : the casual trashing of habeas corpus and the Geneva Conventions ; the claim of authority to seize suspects , including American citizens , and imprison them indefinitely and incommunicado , with no right to due process of law ; the outright encouragement of “ cruel , ” “ inhuman , ” and “ degrading ” treatment of prisoners ; the use of undoubted torture , including waterboarding ( Cheney : “ a no- brainer for me ” ) , which for a century the United States had prosecuted as a war crime ; and , of course , the bloody , nightmarish Iraq war itself , launched under false pretenses , conducted with stupefying incompetence , and escalated long after public support for it had evaporated , at the cost of scores of thousands of lives , nearly half a trillion dollars , and the crippling of America ’s armed forces , which no longer overawe and will take years to rebuild .
The stakes are lower in domestic affairs — if only because fewer lives are directly threatened — but here , too , Cheney ’s influence has been invariably baleful .
With an avalanche of examples , Gellman and Becker show how Cheney successfully pushed tax cuts for the very rich that went beyond what even the President , wanly clinging to the shards of “ compassionate conservatism , ” and his economic advisers wanted .
They show how Cheney ’s stealthy domination of regulatory and environmental policy , driven by “ unwavering ideological positions ” and always exerted “ for the benefit of business , ” has resulted in the deterioration of air and water quality , the degradation and commercial exploitation of national parks and forests , the collapse of wild - salmon fisheries , and the curt abandonment of Bush ’s 2000 campaign pledge to do something about greenhouse gases .
They also reveal that it was Cheney who forced Christine Todd Whitman to resign as the Environmental Protection Agency ’s administrator , by dictating a rule that excused refurbished power plants and oil refineries from installing modern pollution controls .
“ I just could n’t sign it , ” she told them .
Turns out she was n’t so anxious to spend more time with her family after all .
Cheney , Gellman and Becker report , drew up and vetted a list of five appellate judges from which Bush drew his Supreme Court appointments .
After naming John Roberts to the Court and then to the Chief Justice ’s chair , the President , for once , rebelled : without getting permission from down the hall , he nominated his old retainer Harriet Miers for the second opening .
( “ Did n’t have the nerve to tell me himself , ” Cheney muttered to an associate , according to the Post . )
But when Cheney ’s right - wing allies upended Miers , Bush obediently went back to Cheney ’s list and picked Samuel Alito .
The result is a Court majority that , last Thursday , ruled that conscious racial integration is the moral equivalent of conscious racial segregation .
That unfortunate day in the duck blind was n’t the only time the Vice - President has seemed more Elmer Fudd than Ernst Blofeld ; last week , Cheney provoked widespread hilarity by pleading executive privilege ( in order to deny one set of documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee ) while simultaneously maintaining that his office is not part of the executive branch ( in order to deny another set to the Information Security Oversight Office of the National Archives ) .
On Cheney ’s version of the government organization chart , it seems , the location of the Office of the Vice - President is undisclosed .
So are the powers that , in a kind of rolling , slow - motion coup d’état , he has gathered unto himself .
The laughter will fade quickly ; the current Administration , regrettably , will not .
However more politically moribund it may become , its writ still has a year and a half to go .
A few weeks ago , on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf , the Vice - President issued threats of war with Iran .
A “ senior American diplomat ” told the Times that Cheney ’s speech had not been circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered , adding , “ He kind of runs by his own rules . ”
But , too often , his rules rule .
The awful climax of “ Cheney / Bush ” may be yet to come . ♦

Stupid , Pointless Jobs CAUTION : THIS ARTICLE MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE
WHO IDENTIFY EMOTIONALLY WITH THEIR JOBS
It s more evil than CRIME ... its a greater threat than nicotine ... it s more corrupting than DIRTY words ...
No , not drugs or paedophiles .
Im talking about pointless , stupid , unnecessary work .
We re surrounded by it ... its in your mail box ( junk mail doesnt conceive , plan , budget , design , print and mail ITSELF  there are full - time jobs to do these things ) ...
Its on the phone ( have telemarketing jobs ever increased the quality of life for one single human being ? ) .
Then there is the ultimate menace , the absolute evil ... Financial Services .
Financial Services is a huge industry  banking , credit cards and insurance are bigger in the UK than manufacturing .
Financial Services has provided vast numbers of pointless jobs .
No creation of anything useful or worthwhile is involved Financial Services is pretty much all based on what used to be called usury - the practice of making money from money .
No creation of anything useful or worthwhile is involved .
No real wealth is being created ( to use Buckminster Fullers definition of real wealth as whatever nurtures and accommodates human life ) .
All that pointless work .
And its not just the thousands of unfortunate office wage - slaves .
Consider also the buildings that house the Financial Services companies , the computer systems used , the junk mail they send out by the thousand tons . *
All of this requires human work to conceive , plan , design , schedule , build , manage , implement , market and deliver .
Pointless jobs .
A recent survey showed that 60 % of UK workers feel their work is of no use to society .
Look around and be aware of the pointlessness of most work .
There are examples everywhere  the so - called loyalty cards which every large retail store seems to issue , the over - complex tax system which creates a necessity for accountants ( and for people who conceive , plan , design , schedule , write and print the tax form instructions , and the people who make the headache pills for everyone who has to fill in a tax return ) .
Everybody in my street ( except me ) has a burglar alarm installed ( in spite of the fact that the burglary rate in my area has been virtually zero for years ) .
Try to imagine the amount of human work involved in conceiving , planning , designing , producing , marketing , installing and maintaining all the products and services which owe their existence to our over - stimulated fears of crime and property loss .
Now try to imagine a society where people work only on things that are essential , beneficial or enjoyable .
The essential work would probably require only a few hours a week at the most .
There would still be unpleasant jobs , but if we had a true labour market , the most unpleasant jobs would be the highest paid jobs .
* Update : According to Dan Ariely 's book , Predictably Irrational [ p126 ] , the credit - card business alone sends out six billion pieces of direct mail a year .
The Canadian police announced that it will stop targeting people who download copyrighted material for personal use .
Their priority will be to focus on organized crime and copyright theft that affects the health and safety of consumers instead of the cash flow of large corporations .
Around the same time that the CRIA successfully took Demonoid offline , the Canadian police made clear that Demonoid ’s users do n’t have to worry about getting caught , at least not in Canada .
According to the Canadian police it is impossible to track down everyone who downloads music or movies off the Internet .
The police simply does not have the time nor the resources to go after filesharers .
“ Piracy for personal use is no longer targeted , ” NoÃ«l St - Hilaire , head of copyright theft investigations of the Canadian police , said in an interview with Le Devoir .
“ It is too easy to copy these days and we do not know how to stop it , ” he added .
St - Hilaire explained that they rather focus on crimes that actually hurt consumers such as copyright violations related to medicine and electrical appliances .
A wise decision , especially since we now know that filesharing has absolutely no impact on music sales .
On the contrary , a recent study found that the more music people download on P2P - networks , the more CDs they buy .
The international community is in danger of repeating in Afghanistan the mistakes made in Iraq .
Millions of Afghans have seen little material improvement in their lives since 2001 , and most still live in desperate poverty .
From the start , the damage inflicted by a quarter - century of war was underestimated ; this is not about repairing the state but building it from scratch .
Rural communities have seen some improvements , but essential services are scarce or inadequate .
In provinces where Oxfam works such as Daikundi , there is no mains water or electricity , and virtually no paved roads .
Average life expectancy in Daikundi is 42 and one in five children dies before the age of five .
Afghan children chew on mud they scratch from the walls of their homes to stave off hunger .
Most reconstruction work has focused on urban centres and national institutions and structures .
It has been supply - driven , not needs - driven .
Development urgently needs to go local , but there is confusion among state institutions about their roles , and district councils provided for by the constitution have yet to be elected .
For ordinary Afghans , the local or tribal council of elders - the shura or jirga - constitutes the central authority .
Yet these bodies have been largely neglected in the state - building process .
Four things need to be done : building the capacity of local government to deliver essential services at ground level ; achieving a coherent system of sub-national governance ; directing resources to communities to help them help themselves ; and supporting economic regeneration , especially in rural trades and non-opium agriculture .
America is bankrolling Afghanistan .
It is responsible for more than half of all aid to the country ( aid that accounts for about a third of GDP ) , and it plans to provide $ 10.6 bn in the next two years .
But as in Iraq , a vast proportion of aid is wasted .
Political pressure in donor countries for rapid results has led to projects that are unsuitable and unsustainable .
Most aid money goes to programmes in the opium - intensive , insecure provinces in the south .
To neglect secure provinces is to invite the insurgency to spread .
Close to half of US development assistance goes to the five biggest US contractors in the country .
Too much money is lost to high salaries and living costs , non-Afghan resources and corporate profits .
The overall cost of one expatriate consultant is about half a million dollars a year .
International contractors are indispensable , but there needs to be rigorous scrutiny , with targets for increased use of Afghan resources .
An aid ombudsman could monitor complaints and make recommendations .
There is rising anger about civilian casualties , particularly at the hands of US units outside Nato command - a recent assault in western Afghanistan left 50 civilians dead , and in the past six weeks coalition forces have killed up to 100 civilians , compared with about 230 for the whole of 2006 .
If international forces lose the support of the people , militants and insecurity will spread .
A third of Afghans think democracy is incompatible with Islamic values , and many resent the massive foreign presence .
If rapid steps are not taken to improve the delivery of aid and to control the excessive use of force , there could be devastating consequences .
At the same time , action is required at regional level to crack down on insurgents , control narcotics , manage refugees and promote trade and investment .
Achieving peace in Afghanistan is not an impossible task .
But the mistakes of Iraq are being repeated ; without a change of course the consequences are too awful to imagine .

Instead of going home , British troops headed to Iranian border : Report Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This
As tensions between the United States and Iran increases , military action along the Iran - Iraq border intensifies .
The latest moves comes from America 's primary ally in its invasion of Iraq : Britain .
Ostensibly to guard against importation of Iranian weapons and fighters targeting Western troops in Iraq , the UK is sending up to 350 troops to the Iranian border instead of bringing them home , The Independent of London reports Wednesday .
The troop move was requested by US commanders , the paper says , and it will delay -- perhaps indefinitely -- the homecoming of 250 British troops who were told just days ago that they would be returning to the UK as part of a drawdown of forces in Iraq .
Newly elected Prime Minister Gordon Brown initiated the drawdown , and about 500 British troops completed their withdrawal from Basra Palace , their last remaining base in the city , to an airport on the city 's outskirts .
The move was expected to be the final stage in Britain 's complete extraction from Iraq .
Wednesday 's report follows on the heels of news that US troops would be establishing a base on the border to guard against Iranian - imported weapons .
Tensions between the US and Iran have gone from bad to dismal in recent years , with some fearing all - out war will erupt between the two countries , and the top US commander in Iraq has refused to rule out that possibility .
US Army Gen. David Petraeus demurred Tuesday when he was asked by Sen. Joseph Lieberman whether the war should be expanded " in Iranian territory . "
And Petraeus " strongly implied " that action against Iran would be necessary soon , The Independent reported .
" There is a pretty hard look ongoing at that particular situation , " he told the paper in an interview after Congressional testimony Monday in which he often invoked the threat American troops face from Iran 's intervention .
Petraeus and his diplomatic counterpart Ambassador Ryan Crocker told lawmakers that Iran was providing weapons and training to Shiite militias in Iraq , although he never overtly suggested an expansion of the war effort .
RAW STORY has previously reported that the Bush administration has shifted its focus from Iran 's alleged nuclear ambitions to its meddling in Iraq as a possible justification for war with that country , and the US has the capability to launch a " massive " military strike against the country without warning .
Along with British and US troops , Georgia recently sent about 1,200 extra troops to Iraq to patrol the border with Iran .
Bush wars to cost 40 times higher than original estimates ; $ 8,000 per man , woman child in US Nick Juliano

Print This Email This New estimates show Iraq , Afghanistan will cost US $ 2.4 trillion ; White House refuses to provide estimate The United States is spending about $ 8,000 per man , woman and child in the country to pursue wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to new estimates that show the wars will cost about $ 2.4 trillion over the next decade .
More than one - fourth of the money spent in Iraq and Afghanistan -- $ 705 billion -- will go to paying interest on the wars ' costs , which are being funded with borrowed dollars , according to an estimate to be released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office .
Iraq accounts for about 80 percent of the costs with a $ 1.9 trillion tab , including $ 564 million in interest , a House budget committee staff director told USA Today , which reported the numbers Wednesday morning .
" The number is so big , it boggles the mind , " Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) told the newspaper .
The CBO previously estimated the war 's costs at $ 1.6 trillion , which did not include interest payments or Bush 's latest request for an extra $ 46 billion in war funding .
Since President Bush decided to invade Iraq in early 2003 , the war 's costs have skyrocketed as government number - crunchers continue to revise their estimates .
The latest estimate is more than 40 times higher than the Bush administration 's initial estimates that the war would cost between $ 50 billion and $ 60 billion ; meanwhile a proclivity for cutting taxes has marked Bush 's tenure almost as much as his dedication to mounting international invasions .
The latest CBO report puts government estimates in line with those from outside economists , who have long warned against the war - on - the - cheap pipe dreams of Bush and his allies .
In 2002 , Yale economist William Nordhaus estimated the war would cost $ 1.6 trillion by 2012 , and last year Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said the costs could exceed $ 2 trillion .
Responding to the latest estimate , White House spokesman Sean Kevelighan refused to provide USA Today with an administration estimate of the war 's cost , but he could n't resist accusing Democrats of " playing politics " and " trying to artificially inflate " funding levels .
The CBO assumed that 75,000 troops will remain in Iraq a decade from now in calculating the estimate .
Although it is " very speculative , " that estimate is far from unreasonable , Loren Thompson , a nonpartisan defense analyst at the Lexington Institute , told the newspaper .
Already , the wars ' $ 604 billion price tag is higher than than the costs of conflicts in Korea and Vietnam , when adjusted for inflation , according to a report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .

Cheney : ' I frankly think a Republican will win the '08 election ' Katie Baker

In an interview Friday afternoon with conservative radio - show host Mike Gallagher , Vice President Dick Cheney said he is certain that a Republican will win the upcoming presidential election .
 There s no question in my mind ,  Cheney said .
Cheney neglected to comment on which specific candidate he hopes to see elected , stressing his desire to stay scrupulously neutral on the topic .
 It would n't be fair to whoever I did n't name ,  Cheney said .
 Or , on the other hand , if I named somebody , it might not help him . 
Cheney also discussed a variety of other issues with Gallagher , including how he deals with what Gallagher called the terrible stuff  his critics say about him .
 You 're by all accounts a really decent guy ,  Gallagher said .
 Somewhere you got to be saying , man , this is over the top . 
Cheney said traveling around the country and spending time with troops is what keeps him going .
 When you get out around the country and have people come up to you  which happens all the time  and say we really believe in what you re doing  its fairly easy then , in a sense , to keep your mind focused on what you re doing and why you re doing it ,  Cheney said .
At the end of their interview , Gallagher thanked Chaney for appearing on his show .
 I know what a venture this is to come to a radio show like this one ,  Gallagher said .
 Please know how much we 're praying for you . 

Jamie Cooper , 19 , the youngest Briton seriously injured in Basra , had hoped to join the march past at the Cenotaph in Whitehall .
He is one of a number of young soldiers recuperating from injuries suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan the Royal British Legion had wanted to include in Britain 's centrepiece remembrance ceremony .
But last week , the head of the Legion contacted Jamie 's 's father , Phillip , to say that government rules for participating in the parade stipulated that only veterans , not ' serving soldiers ' , could take part .
Last year 1,500 civilians were among the 9,500 allowed by the government to participate in the official march past .
' I am absolutely outraged , ' Cooper said .
' I would not have made an issue of it .
But Jamie , who is thankfully recovering well from his latest major operation , said to me : " Dad , do you remember how we always used to go to Remembrance Day when I was younger ?
Do you think we could go this year ? "
He feels strongly about it , because he has lost friends on the battlefield and wants to pay tribute to them . '
It is also understood that several soldiers currently recuperating from serious injuries at Headley Court , the military rehabilitation centre near Epsom in Surrey , had wanted to attend , but were also not able to join the official parade .
Cooper said that when he raised the possibility with the Legion , the veterans ' organisation was very supportive and initially suggested that he join the main ceremony at the Cenotaph .
But Peter Cleminson , chairman of the Legion , later phoned ' apologetically ' .
Cooper added : ' He said that he wished he could have arranged for Jamie to take part , as well as some of the others who are recuperating at Headley Court .
But he said that the government is in charge of the parade guidelines , and the policy is that no serving soldiers can participate .
A spokesman confirmed : ' Current guidelines do not allow serving personnel to take part in the march past . '
The Legion did not say whether it would be pressing either of the Whitehall departments involved in overseeing the event - the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Culture , Media and Sport - to change the rules in future .
Cooper said : ' It is outrageous .
I know any father would say this , but I am just so , so proud of Jamie , of all he has sacrificed , and of how he has fought against all the odds to survive and get better .
His government ought to be proud too - not ashamed of him . '
Jamie lost the use of one leg and suffered serious hand and stomach wounds in a mortar attack near Basra in November 2006 .
His father 's anger was echoed yesterday by the mother of Ben Parkinson , the 23 - year - old whose horrific injuries from an Afghan landmine explosion sparked a nationwide controversy over compensation levels for seriously wounded soldiers .
' Ben , Jamie and the other young men who have been badly injured are an inspiration , ' Diane Dernie said last night .
' But the government wants them hidden away , not be seen or heard from . '
She said the young service personnel should be ' celebrated ' for their sacrifice and positively encouraged to be part of the ceremony .
She recently took her son to visit the army museum in Chelsea to see the exhibit on operations in Afghanistan .
' People kept coming up to him in his wheelchair and touching him , smiling , and saying : " Well done , young man . "
These boys are an inspiration , but the current government guidelines suggest they are embarrassed by them .
It 's bizarre . '
Dernie said yesterday that men such as Ben and those fortunate to have survived serious injury deserved to join the march past and that she was determined to devote her life to helping ' these incredibly brave , very young people ' rebuild their lives .
' They are really heroes , refusing to feel down or depressed and determined to carry on .
I feel that I have to do all I can to fight for them , ' she added .
Cooper told The Observer that he was determined not to disappoint Jamie and planned to take him as a spectator to today 's Remembrance Day ceremony in Bristol .
Parents of other soldiers said they understood that a nurse at Headley Court was also planning to accompany several of the recuperating Iraq and Afghan wounded in her own time to watch the London ceremony .
The Royal British Legion is running an Honour the Covenant campaign to improve support for British soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It said that Jamie Cooper had been offered , as an alternative , a vantage point to watch the march past on a specially raised viewing platform .
' Participation in the march past is subject to ticketing in order to maintain the dignity of the event and keep numbers within the bounds of safety , ' a spokesman said .
A statement from Peter Cleminson read : ' Today 's serving man and woman is tomorrow 's veteran and the Legion will ensure , as it has done since 1921 , that the annual service at the Cenotaph will be a fitting tribute to their honour and their sacrifice . '
The controversy came as the weekend 's first remembrance events took place in the capital .
The Queen led yesterday 's Royal Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Festival Hall before an audience of veterans .
Among them was 109 - year - old Harry Patch , the last British man alive to have served in the trenches during the First World War , a unique living link with the carnage of Passchendaele , a name synonymous with the mud and carnage of the conflict .
Speaking before the service , Patch , from Wells , Somerset , said : ' Today is not for me , it is for the countless millions who did not come home with their lives intact .
They are the heroes . '
At the Cenotaph , 150 widows gathered to honour their husbands who were killed in wars fought by Britain .
Today major events include a service at the new National War Memorial , Alrewas , Staffordshire , as well as ceremonies from the Falklands to France .
For the first time there is even a ' virtual Cenotaph ' organised online by the Legion .
Yesterday , the Ministry of Defence named a soldier killed in a road accident in southern Afghanistan .
He was Lance - corporal Jake Alderton , 22 , from Bexley , south London , the 83rd British soldier to die in the country since 2001 .
Last night , an army padre described the significance of Remembrance Day to those servicemen and women currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In an article released by the MoD , Padre Duncan Weaver explained that today 's act of remembering those who died serving their country is as relevant as ever .
He said that his service today will ' bring to the fore again ' the repatriation services held during the summer .
' As the sun set , the coffins were carried into the hold of the aircraft and one was reminded on one 's own mortality and no doubt on Remembrance Day that sense of vulnerability will surface again , ' he said .

Where I 'd been , before the journey referred to here , was at Tuesday night 's Intelligence Squared debate on the motion ' We should not be reluctant to assert the superiority of Western values ' .
At the beginning of the evening 313 people had indicated they were for the motion , 221 against , with 207 do n't knows .
After the debate , the vote was 465 in favour and 264 against , with 18 do n't knows .
One confusion that obstructed clear discussion arose from the description of these values as ' Western ' .
The proposers of the motion themselves clearly regarded the values as universal and as having been fed historically by some non-Western influences as well as Western ones .
Nonetheless , the greater hold that these values - democracy , the rule of law , equality before the law , human rights , freedom of speech and opinion , self - critical rationalism - had taken in the West was said by several people , including from the floor , to justify talking of them as Western .
The opponents of the motion made much of the supposed ' arrogance ' of asserting the superiority of those values .
There is nothing sinister in it .
To assert the superiority of some values over others is no different from defending the former - a standard critical activity and unavoidable for anyone who does n't think that all values are on a par .
How could one think that ?
You'd have to believe that caring for the sick was no better than drowning them .
The speakers against the motion also assimilated the assertion of the superiority of the relevant values to being willing to impose them by military force .
That is not an innocent confusion , of course .
But it is one of the very values that were under discussion in that debate that , within the limits of not doing harm to other people , differences in values have to be negotiated by persuasive argument rather than by violence and military might .
Anyway , you can listen to the whole debate by downloading the podcast here ( see right - hand panel ) .
Even if you do n't have time to listen to it all , I recommend you listen to the first nine or ten minutes ( after the three minutes of introduction ) .
This was Ibn Warraq 's opening contribution , and he does n't mince his words .
He also closed the debate with a bit of a flourish :
Finally , I do not wish to live in a society where you are stoned for adultery ; I prefer to live in a society where we get stoned first and then commit adultery .
It 's the most honest car on the road — two seats , four wheels , zero pretensions .
No phony rear seats , no attempt to ease the aesthetic shock by trying to ape a conventional sedan .
The smart fortwo , the first truly modern microcar to arrive in the US , scrambles ashore with the irrepressible glee of a 2 - year - old .
It is absolutely confident it will win you over .
And with unmatchable urban maneuverability , praiseworthy gas mileage , and startling safety credentials , it more than earns the love .
Form , Meet Function
For a teensy little car , the fortwo is one tough mother —
Shut your mouth !
Its unique design follows the shape of its safety cell , which transfers and dissipates collision forces around the passengers .
Standard - equipment ABS , stability control , plus cornering and traction - control systems designed explicitly for an ultralight vehicle will help keep you from testing the safety cell 's limits with your head .
Shockingly Roomy
For a car that 's just 8.8 feet long — nearly 4 feet shorter than a Mini Cooper — it 's as spacious inside as any decent - size sedan .
Our 6 ' 1 " tester had no problem fitting behind the wheel .
The lesson : Size does n't matter after all .
That is , until you glance over your shoulder and realize that the body just sorta stops — right behind you .
Ultralight , Ultra - Efficient
Packing a three - cylinder , 1 liter , 71 horsepower engine between its rear wheels , this 1,800 - pounder rolls about 40 miles for each gallon of gas .
This is no golf cart , though :
The fortwo will hit 90 mph with nary a complaint .
Twisty Fun
The big wheels , competent suspension , and automated manual transmission make it fun to drive .
And even though it 's not an actual automatic — it has a robotic clutch that engages on its own — the fortwo does have a full - auto mode , so anyone can drive it .

Frontiers in Neuroscience is a leading journal in its field , publishing rigorously peer - reviewed research across a wide spectrum of specialties and disciplines .
Field Chief Editor Idan Segev at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is supported by an outstanding Editorial Board of international researchers .
This multidisciplinary open - access journal is at the forefront of disseminating and communicating scientific knowledge and impactful discoveries to researchers , academics , clinicians and the public worldwide .
These are historical times for brain research - namely for the Brain itself .
The convergence of novel molecular and optical techniques paves the way to the era of " causation neuroscience , " whereby many thousands of cells composing the system studied can be recorded from and manipulated in a very specific manner ( e.g. via " optogenetics " ) and the behavioral and functional consequences of these manipulations explored in vivo .
It is also a new era of " anatomical neuroscience " - as recently developed techniques , both at the whole - brain level ( " connectome " ) and the local circuit and synaptic level ( " connectomics " ) become more widely used .
These approaches allow us to link structure of specific brain regions and local circuits to function more astutely .
New research fields have recently emerged , e.g. " neuroeconomics " and " neuroenergetics . "
In addition , and critically , in our information - generating world , new informatics - based methods are being developed to store the enormous amount of new “ big data ” in a systematic manner , for data - preservation , data - mining and for extracting key information from these data .
And , importantly , theoretical and computational approaches are being developed for integrating this diverse data and for deriving principles of brain operations that may otherwise lie hidden within the intricacies of brain circuits .
As the field is growing fast , we seek to integrate and cross - link studies and citations in related subfields , providing an overview of the state - of - the - art in these fields and the ways in which they complement each other .
After all , we may each of us look at the brain from particular standpoints - all the way from " genes to behavior " - yet the brain integrates all these levels seamlessly ; this journal should reflect this in the best possible way .

VIDEO : Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Together : Part 1 of 7
In their rare joint appearance at All Things Digital 5 , Steve Jobs and Bill Gates discuss their contributions to the technology industry , the qualities they most respect in one another , and former Apple CEO Gil Amelio ’s seamanship .
Text and video coverage of the complete Steve Jobs and Bill Gates interview :
A couple of days ago , I made
an offhand mention of the value of knowing what your time is worth so you can quickly determine whether or not it ’s worth your time to do a task yourself , pay someone else to do it , or simply not do it at all .
This resulted in several emails from readers asking all sorts of questions on the topic .
For the most part , I pointed them to the true hourly wage , which is a portion of the 31 Days to Fix Your Finances series , but I thought it might be worthwhile to actually address the calculation itself .
Calculating this number is fairly easy .
First of all , how much did you make while gainfully employed last year ?
Do n’t include investment returns or anything like that .
Now , from that amount , subtract every single extra cost incurred because of that employment , such as child care , transportation costs ( gas , car maintenance and repair , etc. ) , your work wardrobe , extra meals , office supplies , gifts , and so forth .
Spend a bit of time thinking about this : what extra costs do you have because of your job ?
If you do n’t know an annual amount , figure out what it costs you per week and multiply that by 52 .
You can handle taxes , Medicare , and Social Security either way – it ’s your call on those .
I would also add back in any benefits given to you by your employer , like health insurance and so on .
Then , calculate how many hours you devote to your gainful employment each year .
You might work 40 hours a week for 48 weeks a year , but that ’s not really it .
You also have your commute , the extra time you work outside the office , business travel , time invested in securing and maintaining child care , business dinners and parties , and so on .
Again , if you do n’t know how much time you invest , make a week ’s estimate and multiply by 52 , or make a month ’s estimate and multiply by 12 .
Once you have those two numbers , take your real wages and divide it by the real number of hours you put in for your job .
That , my friend , is what your time is worth per hour using your current employment as a benchmark .
Obviously , doing this in ten minutes as a napkin sketch will be a real shock , and many of you will brush off what that number is actually telling you – I ’ve seen it happen many times .
But here are just a few things that you can get out of that number :
If your job makes you miserable , really look at that hourly wage and ask if your misery is worth it , and realize that you can earn $ 9 an hour at Home Depot while saving your creative juices for other things .
You ’d be surprised how many people who have “ good ” jobs in actuality are being paid McDonalds - esque wages for their true efforts .
If you ’re working hard at building a career or a business and that makes this number seem low , then realize that you ’re building a small amount of non-financial capital with each hour you work .
I like to use the analogy of my blogging with this : I make a little more than minimum wage from blogging , but with each post , my hourly wage from it goes up slightly .
Why ?
That post is more than just the time I invested in it : it sticks around and continues to earn over time as visitors to the site find it and read it .
If you ’re trying to decide if doing some task is worth your time , calculate how much money that task is worth to you .
Let ’s say that you can make $ 12 an hour sitting on your back porch writing , but your lawn needs mowed .
If you can pay the neighbor kid $ 10 to mow your yard , then it ’s worth it – you actually earn $ 2 by sitting on your porch writing while the neighbor kid mows the yard .
But if your time is worth only $ 8 an hour , then you ’re better off mowing it yourself .
Once I figured out my true wage , I started thinking of a lot of things in this light .
For me at least , when blogging significantly surpasses my true hourly wage , I may consider making blogging my full - time job .
It ’s not there yet , so for now I just do it in the evenings as a hobby .
NEW YORK , May 3 ( Reuters ) - A falling dollar may complicate the U.S. inflation outlook , creating another headache for the Federal Reserve as it attempts to gauge whether stubbornly high inflation will be tamed .
The Fed has historically put less weight on exchange rates compared with its central bank peers in some Asian and European countries , because the impact from trade on prices and on the U.S. economy usually has been relatively limited .
But the Fed may have less room for complacency now .
The dollar ’s recent decline comes at a time when the labor market has remained surprisingly tight -- “ gangbusters ” as one policy - maker put it -- in spite of sluggish growth .
“ A weaker dollar could become more of an inflation factor , ” said Michael Feroli , an economist at J.P. Morgan in New York .
“ At the margin , a weakening dollar makes it difficult to be sure that inflation comes under control . ”
The dollar has fallen considerably over the past year , hitting life - time lows against the euro and 26 - year lows against sterling last week .
At the same time , a Fed index that measures the trade - weighted value of the dollar against a basket of seven major currencies hit the lowest level in its 34 - year history .
A declining dollar could increase inflationary pressure through various channels .
Higher import prices could feed into retail costs and lessen the competitive pressures domestic firms face , giving them greater leeway to raise prices .
Recent signs suggest some easing in inflationary pressures .
A report this week showed the Fed ’s favorite core inflation gauge held steady in March , with the year - on - year rate easing to a 2.1 percent gain , just above the 1 percent to 2 percent range many officials have described as their “ comfort zone . ”
But the Fed expects growth to pick up later this year , and policy - makers may not be convinced prices will steadily fall until there is more slack in the labor market
In March , the jobless dipped to 4.4 percent from an already low 4.5 percent , even though the economy posted a sluggish 1.3 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter .
PASS - THROUGH
A staff report by the New York Federal Reserve Bank last April that measured the impact shifts in exchange rates have on domestic inflation in 21 countries , which are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , found the United States to be the least sensitive .
The ‘ sensitivity ’ of the U.S. consumer price index was less than 5 percent , while the average for the 21 countries was 15 percent .
For Germany and France , it was around 20 percent .
So far , Fed policy - makers have not addressed the issue of a weaker dollar .
When asked last week about the impact of a declining dollar on monetary policy , San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said only that it was difficult to predict exchange rates , adding : “ The Fed is focused on the dual mandate ” of price stability and maximum employment .
In contrast , some euro zone policy - makers have suggested currencies have become more of a policy risk .
The euro hit a record high of $ 1.3683 against the dollar on Friday .
“ The euro is one of the very important factors in our considerations , ” European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher told Reuters in an interview on Monday .
A stronger euro could lessen the need for further rate increases , as it would ease inflationary pressures in the euro zone by cutting the import cost of dollar - denominated oil and commodities and depressing the costs of consumer goods from overseas .
But others played down the effect of the euro on the economy .
The EU ’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia on Thursday said the euro ’s gains in recent years have not damaged exports from the nations using the single currency .
Many analysts expect the dollar to remain under pressure , as U.S. interest rates look set to stay steady amid a slowing economy and still high prices , while rates in other major economies such as Britain and the euro zone look set to rise as policy - makers attempt to rein in inflation amid robust growth .
Such narrowing of interest rate differentials make dollar - denominated assets less attractive for investors and reduce demand for the greenback .
It is college application time .
While kids scamper to put the application packages together , parents fret and worry about the choice of degree and choice of colleges .
While the kids are busy rating how “ party ” friendly the different schools are , parents are busy trying to figure out how “ pocket ” friendly they will be .
A teenager ’s idea of a cool career is bound to be different from their parents ’ idea .
Unsurprisingly , this could lead to a lot of flare ups when parents do n’t quite agree with their children ’s choice and the children do n’t want their parents to interfere .
Consider for example the case of my colleague .
She wants to make sure that her daughter goes into a major that will lead to good career prospects .
She wants her daughter to lead a worry - free life .
My colleague is a brilliant engineer .
As a first generation immigrant , she knows what it is like to struggle through life to get to a financially comfortable position .
She wants to protect her daughter from having to go through what she considers “ unnecessary pains ” of making bad career choices .
She feels that her children have a lot more opportunity and guidance than she did when she was younger and so they must be able to coast through life .
She would prefer for her daughter to major in engineering .
If her daughter must rebel she wishes it were to pursue a professional degree like law or medical school 🙂
He daughter on the other hand wants to pursue fine arts .
She is an honor student with several advanced placement classes under her belt .
But in her senior year in high school she was influenced by her peers into thinking that professional degrees are for dorks and losers .
And now she wants to pursue a fine arts degree .
Which degree ( or discipline in general ) is better is only one of arguments that they have .
Which college to send apps to is another huge point of contention .
Some of the schools of choice for the daughter come at a hefty price tab of $ 40,000 per year .
And they are known “ party ” schools .
My colleague has the money stashed up , but it took a lot of blood and sweat to raise that money .
She believes it is a complete waste to throw it away on an arts degree from an expensive party school .
I do n’t think there is anything very unique about my colleague ’s situation .
This drama is played out over and over every year in thousands of households across the country .
Parents in their infinite wisdom want to protect their children from making stupid mistakes .
They want to give their children the opportunities they perceive that they were not provided .
They want to save their children from making some of the mistakes they did .
The children on the other hand are not really children anymore , but young adults .
They believe that they know what they want .
They want to stand for themselves and what they believe is their best option .
So , should the parents try to influence their children ’s choices ?
I believe that if the parents are paying for the education , they have every right to set some ground rules .
Unless the parents inherited the money themselves , they must be able to have some influence over what and how their hard - earned money gets spent .
Now , if the parents ca n’t afford to pay the children ’s college expenses and the child is actually taking out a loan , things get a bit dicey .
Some of my friends believe that the parents do n’t really have a right to interfere in such a situation .
I disagree .
I think that it is a parent ’s responsibility to prevent the children from making what might be a choice that they will regret later in life .
Just like a parent would never allow a child to walk into a busy street with a lot of traffic , they should also try to protect their children from burdening themselves with huge college debt for majors that ca n’t provide for them in later life .
The children may not listen , and they may fight back , but that did n’t stop you from teaching them the right thing to do when they were younger and wanted to play with a knife !
It ’s easier said than done .
But there are ways in which this can be achieved .
For instance , in my colleague ’s case , they have established a truce of sorts now .
My colleague has convinced her daughter to consider a degree in computer animation .
Since a degree in computer animation requires her daughter to take some computer courses as pre-requisites , she feels comforted , that later in life if push comes to shove , her daughter can work as a software programmer .
Her daughter has agreed to the option since a degree in animation will allow her to explore her creative side .
As for the school they are still working it out 🙂
The current offer on the table is that my colleague must allow her daughter to go to any school that the daughter can obtain at least 50 % financial aid .
In some schools ( particularly the one that the daughter wants to go to ) , that is still a huge amount .
But I am sure they will find a way to resolve it .
What would you do if your kids wanted to take up a major that you firmly believe will not prepare them for life in the real world ?
What if it involves taking our a huge student loan ?
How did your parents try to convince you ?
In the mean time , if you are looking for some resources to share with your kids , here are some good starters –

CANTON , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Record - high milk prices are stinging Americans at the dairy case , just as millions of thirsty school children are returning to classes .
The average retail price of a gallon of whole milk has never been higher -- $ 3.80 a gallon -- according to July Department of Agriculture statistics .
Experts blame the price spike -- up 51 cents since February -- on milk shortages in Europe and Australia .
Prices are approaching $ 5 a gallon in Georgia , where on a sweltering summer day last week , about 100 children and parents toured Mark Cagle 's dairy farm north of Atlanta .
Tim and Beth Byington wrangled their two preschool children around the farm , surrounded by mooing Holsteins .
" It 's really expensive when you 're on a budget , " said Beth Byington , who explains that her hands are tied when it comes to the cost of milk .
Watch the Byingtons describe their struggle with higher prices »
" We can't do anything , and we have to buy our milk , " she said .
" So sometimes we cut back on other food -- like buying store brands and other things . "
Her husband agrees .
" I can't remember a time when it was this high , " he said .
The farm 's black and white dairy herd gives about 400 gallons of milk a day -- a drop in the bucket compared to sprawling corporate - owned facilities that supply most of the nation .
Do n't Miss Cagle's Dairy Farms
But shoppers at the grocer 's dairy case are n't the only consumers feeling the pinch .
Starbucks coffee and Papa John 's pizza blame their recent price hikes in part on more expensive milk .
Cheese and ice cream makers such as Kraft and Ben & Jerry 's said they 're taking notice .
The cost of dairy products also touches millions of children who depend on America 's federal school lunch program , which includes milk as a necessary part of their nutrition .
See more about milk prices and school lunches »
" If milk prices do go up in a big way , certainly people who run school meal programs will notice it , " said Joanne Guthrie at the USDA .
" Just as a family that buys milk regularly would notice it and somehow adapt -- schools would too . "
Lunch ladies -- and lunch gentlemen -- whose cafeteria budgets are stressed by higher milk prices may try to offset costs by substituting menu items with less expensive fruits or veggies , say analysts .
Uncle Sam wo n't be adjusting federal school lunch subsidies -- if necessary -- until fall of 2008 , at the earliest .
As she accompanied her daughter around the Cagle farm , Margaret O'Neill said she would prefer that her school - age daughter drink milk instead of soda .
" It 's much healthier , " said O'Neill .
" If milk 's $ 5 a gallon , it 's going to impact your lunches at school but it 's still important to at least get something that 's nutritious . "
What gives ?
Grocery shoppers in Omaha , Nebraska , may be surprised to know that the blame rests on the other side of the Atlantic -- and the other side of the world .
It 's all about supply and demand .
Decreasing dairy supplies and rising demand for it are forcing prices up .
Supply is down in Australia and Europe , while demand is up in nations with rising standards of living such as China .
" A drought in Australia has reduced their dairy export potential while the European Union has quotas that limit increases in milk production , " said professor Michael Hutjens , a dairy industry scholar at the University of Illinois .
Also playing a smaller role in the price spike is higher demand for corn - based ethanol fuel , according to USDA analyst Ephraim Leibtag .
Increased demand for corn pushes up costs for cattle feed , which is then added to the price of milk .
Although farmers such as Cagle are getting more money for their milk , they also are forced to pay higher prices to feed their dairy cows .
The Southeast has been plagued for the past few years by droughts which have pushed feed corn prices higher .
" The dairy farmer is not making a significant amount of money because the input costs are so much higher than they were , " said Cagle .

Do the fruits of Rove include the death of bipartisan internationalism in American foreign policy ?
Charles Kupchan and Peter Trubowitz fear so :
The Bush administration ’s brand of international engagement , far from being an aberration , represents a turning point in the historical trajectory of U.S. foreign policy .
It is a symptom , as much as a cause , of the unraveling of the liberal internationalist compact that guided the United States for much of the second half of the twentieth century .
The polarization of the United States has dealt a severe blow to the bipartisan compact between power and cooperation .
Instead of adhering to the vital center , the country ’s elected officials , along with the public , are backing away from the liberal internationalist compact , supporting either U.S. power or international cooperation , but rarely both .
…
Prominent voices from across the political spectrum have called for the restoration of a robust bipartisan center that can put U.S. grand strategy back on track .
…
These exhortations are in vain .
The halcyon era of liberal internationalism is over ; the bipartisan compact between power and partnership has been effectively dismantled .
In retrospect , this may have been a goal of some of the more hard - core neoconservatives all along : to destroy the bipartisan consensus of using force for internationalist ends in the world , and to replace it with raw power , one - party rule at home , and American militarist unipolarity abroad .
Today 's Republicans have palpable disdain for sharing power with another party - and almost as much discomfort for allies abroad .
The Rove project was an attempt not just to defeat but to destroy the Democratic party at home , by cultural polarization , gerry - mandering , a K - Street monopoly and even abuse of the Justice Department .
And the neoconservative project is close to degenerating into a program of constant war - making abroad that can be used in turn to polarize the country still further .

An F.C.C. spokesman , Clyde Ensslin , declined to comment on the issue or the case in Maryland .
Cellphone carriers pay tens of billions of dollars to lease frequencies from the government with an understanding that others will not interfere with their signals .
And there are other costs on top of that .
Verizon Wireless , for example , spends $ 6.5 billion a year to build and maintain its network .
“ It ’s counterintuitive that when the demand is clear and strong from wireless consumers for improved cell coverage , that these kinds of devices are finding a market , ” said Jeffrey Nelson , a Verizon spokesman .
The carriers also raise a public safety issue : jammers could be used by criminals to stop people from communicating in an emergency .
In evidence of the intensifying debate over the devices , CTIA , the main cellular phone industry association , asked the F.C.C. on Friday to maintain the illegality of jamming and to continue to pursue violators .
It said the move was a response to requests by two companies for permission to use jammers in specific situations , like in jails .
Individuals using jammers express some guilt about their sabotage , but some clearly have a prankster side , along with some mean - spirited cellphone schadenfreude .
“ Just watching those dumb teens at the mall get their calls dropped is worth it .
Can you hear me now ?
NO !
Good , ” the purchaser of a jammer wrote last month in a review on a Web site called DealExtreme .
Gary , a therapist in Ohio who also declined to give his last name , citing the illegality of the devices , says jamming is necessary to do his job effectively .
He runs group therapy sessions for sufferers of eating disorders .
In one session , a woman ’s confession was rudely interrupted .
“ She was talking about sexual abuse , ” Gary said .
“ Someone ’s cellphone went off and they carried on a conversation . ”
“ There ’s no etiquette , ” he said .
“ It ’s a pandemic . ”
Gary said phone calls interrupted therapy all the time , despite a no-phones policy .
Four months ago , he paid $ 200 for a jammer , which he placed surreptitiously on one side of the room .
He tells patients that if they are expecting an emergency call , they should give out the front desk ’s number .
He has not told them about the jammer .

State , federal police surround tax evaders ' home Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 7 , 2007 Print This Email This Reports began emerging Thursday afternoon that dozens of police officers are surrounding the New Hampshire home of tax protesters Ed and Elaine Brown , but a protracted stand - off seems to have been averted .
The Browns have been convicted on tax evasion charges and have refused to leave their 110 - acre compound in rural New Hampshire to serve lengthy prison terms .
Details are scare about the police action around the home , with reporters in the area being kept away .
The US Marshals Service , which is handling media inquiries , did not immediately return a call from RAW STORY Thursday .
According to a statement from the Marshals Service reported by the New Hampshire Union Leader , federal agents said they would not raid the home Thursday .
" We are here , in conjunction with authorities , from the Department of the Treasury , to serve that warrant , " the statement said .
" As we have said from the beginning , we will continue to communicate with Ed and Elaine Brown to convince them to surrender peacefully . "
PrisonPlanet.com , which has been closely following the story , reported that police began withdrawing from the Brown compound Thursday afternoon .
Speaking on an internet radio broadcast , Brown suggested the police action was a test by authorities to see what the response to a raid would be , according to PrisonPlanet .
The Associated Press reports police SWAT teams and at least one armored vehicle have gathered near the home , according to the Browns ' neighbors .
The police presence includes at least 50 state troopers , some armed with high powered rifles , according to the New Hampshire Union Leader .
The Browns have been convicted in federal court of failing to pay more than $ 500,000 in taxes , according to the Union Leader .
The couple skipped sentencing hearings in April , when they were sentenced to more than five years in prison .
The Browns say they will refuse to surrender to police .
Predicting that a " new Waco could be underway , " PrisonPlanet.com reports the Browns ' phone line has been cut .

Humans have not evolved to handle modern currency for two reasons :
1 . The paper that currency is based on has zero inherent value .
When you are gambling at a casino you tend to make bets you would not have made with paper money because you do n’t have a strong attachment to decorative pieces of clay .
But as we get older , the attachment we have to paper money lessens and we get desensitized to its value .
Spending money becomes easier .
Price tags would have more meaning if it listed how many hours of labor it would take you to buy it .
That iPod now costs 13 hours of labor the HDTV is 2 weeks of labor .
That $ 7 slice of cheesecake took you 15 minutes of labor .
You may buy these things anyway but its real value is clear because you know exactly how much of your time and energy it takes to obtain it .
2 . There are too many streams of income and expenditures to keep track off .
We are not designed to make daily purchases , pay bills , deal with emergencies , spoil ourselves , and then be able to have a balanced budget each month .
If you were to ask people how much they spend on food , a necessity , each month , they can only give you an estimate which I guarantee is a lot less than they actually spend .
Humans need extra help to keep track of multiple streams of data .
I ’m sure you know someone whose life is consumed by huge credit card debt .
It ’s even possible that they are much bigger debt than you even though your living situations are n’t that different .
Why are some people just bad with money and others are not ?
The answer lies in a person ’s belief system .
Some people believe in things that make going into serious debt an inevitability .
“ I know I ’m spending more than I make now , but I will be making more money soon . ”
This is counting your chickens before they hatch .
Unfortunately , there is absolutely no guarantee that you will be making more money in a year or two .
There is no way to predict if you will even have a job .
In case you do make more money a year from now , this belief ensures you keep increasing your spending anyway , preventing you from having the extra cash you planned on using to pay off debt obligations .
Spending money you do n’t yet have is an assumption that keeps you in perpetual debt .
“ I know I ’m in credit card debt , but these are things I need and they are making me happy . ”
There is not a documented case of human fulfillment coming from items manufactured in China .
Fact is , other than a quick rush when purchasing something new , your mind quickly gets accustomed to the new possession and your happiness level remains constant .
And now you have this consumer good that you need to maintain until you throw it in storage .
The ability to increase the amount of happiness you can generate only comes with committed changes on how you view the world and yourself .
I know many girls who own very expensive handbags , and when I ask them why they bought these bags they usually make a reference to the quality and not the image the brand represents .
But those expensive handbags are not handmade and come off the same factory lines as those that cost significantly less .
And then I have the friends who insists on buying luxury automobiles because living without soothing German engineering would be uncomfortable .
Now I do n’t know if they are telling me the truth and they are really buying these things for the status , but I do know that the idea of turning these needs into wants is a basic marketing principle that drives the sale of these products .
If you can afford these items without going into debt then great , but otherwise you should resort to the free alternative of fantasizing about the objects instead .
“ I want other people to know that I am very successful . ”
This stems from insecurity .
You are concerned that you are less worthy as a person because someone else is displaying material possessions — probably bought on credit — that is worth much more than yours .
So you catch up so this person by going into debt .
Problem with this strategy is not that there is no end — there will always be someone who has more than you .
So your life is a pattern of trying to keep up , going into more debt , but never really getting there .
You sit at home , with all your stuff , still upset and wondering if you can pay more than the minimum payment on your credit card statements .
Most advertising put out by marketing agencies aim to make you feel insecure and inadequate , and this is financial death for those that are already insecure .
Unless you are on top of the latest rotating style , it ’s assumed , you are a loser and the girl with the latest pair of boots will show her disgust with dirty looks .
I once read a question on some Dear Abby column by someone who asked how she can get her girlfriends to stop picking expensive restaurants for girls night out without having to tell them she is broke .
But your friends should have no problem knowing you ca n’t afford something and if they do maybe it ’s time to get friends who do n’t judge you or make as much as you do .
( I ’m not saying to go hang out in the ghetto but having friends that are poor will save you an incredible amount of money . )
By not caring what other people think , you immediately start living a more simple life that allows you to focus on things that make you happy instead of things that other people approve of .
There is nothing wrong with not having enough money .
Having correct beliefs makes it very easy stay on top of your finances because you do the right things without having to consciously think about it , in a way that fits your own unique situation .
I do n’t read finance sites or lists of 1,000 ways to save money , but I ’m able to put save a large percentage of my income each month because I have internalized the right beliefs .
One of my most important beliefs is knowing that demand increases to fill supply .
If a friend buys you a chocolate chip cookie , you are going to eat it even though you may have not been craving for a chocolate chip cookie .
If your coworker brings a cake to the office , that cake will be gone even though no one was really hungry .
If you just get a bonus at work , you will spend it on things you would n’t have bought otherwise .
If you buy an extra large bottle of cologne , you will use it more often than if you bought a small bottle .
If you have $ 100 in your pocket , two days later you will wonder where it went .
If you happen upon a stash of hot porn , you will masturbate more than usual , maybe into the early dawn hours if you got a lot of sleep the night before .
If your mind knows that something is there , it will find a reason to use or consume it .
When people complain to me about their inability to lose weight , I simply tell them not to buy food .
You ca n’t eat what you do n’t buy , and a midnight snack craving loses its punch when you know you have to get in the car to find some Doritos instead of reaching your meaty paws in the cupboard .
Places like Costco and Sam’s Club exist because people think they are saving money when they buy things in bulk .
They see the cost - per - unit price and then toss the extra large jar of mayonnaise into the cart .
Without even thinking about it , they will now consume more mayonnaise because their mind knows there is a lot of it .
If you look around your house right now , you have a lot of consumables that are just sitting there , inching towards their expiration dates .
What this really represents is cash not earning interest .
That cash is in the hands of the companies instead .
There is little reason to buy more than one week ’s worth of food or goods unless there is a natural disaster coming .
I only buy what I need , do n’t tie up my cash in things that just sit there , and do n’t let anything go to waste .
This ends up saving me much more money in the long run .
We are tricked into believing that buying the largest size possible makes economic sense .
Flyers will advertise how much you are saving by purchasing the warehouse sized packaging of hypoallergenic ass wipes .
But are they selling thousands of ass wipes because they are trying to help you save money , or because it benefits them ?
Companies do n’t want you to save money — they want you to spend and contribute to their profits .
Sizes are getting larger because it benefits corporations .
If they did n’t make more money on quantity , the larger sizes would not exist .
At the grocery store there is now a gigantic jar of spaghetti sauce that is so big it has a built - in ergodynamic handle .
You will buy these and consume more or throw away a large amount , and then go back and buy more again because you think you ’re saving money .
How about if I buy in bulk something that I use a set amount of every week ?
For me this applies to my Tuna Helper habit .
I consume two boxes a week , no more or less , so you think I ’d load up on this “ food ” during 2 - for - 1 specials .
I do n’t .
The point of a sale should be for you to spend less .
But what happens is you load up on the sale item so your weekly spending never goes down .
In the short - run it may cost me a couple bucks , but in the long - run I save because I strengthen the belief to only buying what I need , cutting spending in almost everything else .
Do n’t turn your house into a warehouse .
The opposite of this principle also holds true : if you constrict supply , demand will lower .
If at the beginning of the month you commit to saving a large amount of money and enter it into the budget , and you can see how little you have left to spend on everything else , you have no choice but to constrain your spending for that month .
But if you wait until the end of month to save what is left over , you will find there is nothing left over to save .
A tool that reinforces all these correct beliefs is having a monthly budget where you monitor every dollar you spend .
I believe that if people simply knew where their money was going , they would be a lot more careful with it .
It ’s just too hard to understand how much you are spending with credit cards and check cards until you have to manually enter your spending into a spreadsheet and see your monthly balance go down .
This act tells your brain that this money you earned no longer exists .
I recently gave my budget spreadsheet to a friend .
Like me he set up a line for going out , and estimated that he spends maybe $ 400 a month in bars and restaurant .
Three weeks into December , he was already at $ 500 .
Then when he went out to the club , he spent half of the amount that he normally spends because that $ 500 expenditure was something he could n’t ignore .
He saved $ 30 that night only because he knows how much he spends when he goes out .
Every dollar counts .
In the long run it adds up to amounts you would leap at if you saw laying on the street .
When you use a budget , your finances become an obsession because they are in your face almost every day .
Every transaction , from ATM withdrawals to buying a coffee at 7 - 11 with your check card , gets logged .
Budget.xls spreadsheet ( Right click > Save as )
How To Maintain The Budget Spreadsheet
Step 1 : Put in your paycheck income and other guaranteed income .
If you are a freelancer , you may want to add lines to account from different sources of spending and income .
Or you can create a new worksheet in the same spreadsheet and link those values to the main budget .
Step 2 : Enter all known bill payment expenses ( rent , gym fees , car payment , etc. ) .
For other expenditures like going out and food , make an estimate .
You will be changing that number as the months go on .
Step 3 : Play with you expenditure numbers until you balance goes to zero .
If this seems impossible to you , then you are not living within your means , and having a budget will probably help you most .
Hint : cut back on leisure spending .
Step 4 : Take note of how much money will always be in your checking account ( your cushion ) .
On the first of every month when all bills are paid , that is the value you should have in your account .
My cushion is a low $ 200 because I do n’t like tying up too much cash .
But when my first paycheck does n’t come until the second week of the month , I temporary bring in money from my savings account to cover those early expenses .
The more you monitor your account activity online , the less you can leave your cushion since you are always aware of your balance and catch surprises before they overdraft your account .
Step 5 : Keep track of every dollar that moves in and out of your main account ( usually your checking account ) .
If you mostly use your check card for transactions , save all receipts and pile them on one side of your desk .
After you enter them every few days , move them to the other side .
I do n’t recommend forgoing receipts and using online banking to log spending because you will forget whether you entered items or not .
Make sure you do n’t miss transactions that have no receipt , like buying something from the internet or getting a lap dance at the strip club .
If you mostly take out ATM withdrawals , I recommend categorizing what you can and then putting the rest in Leisure > Stuff .
For instance say you take out $ 100 one day then spend $ 40 on groceries and $ 50 on going out .
When you go home , put - $ 40 for groceries , - $ 50 for going out , and - $ 10 for Stuff .
Or just put the whole $ 100 into Stuff and not worry about categorizing .
Using mostly cash makes it a pain to itemize your spending unless you always get receipts .
Important :
You are only keeping track of money that moves into and out of your main account .
If you charge something on your credit card , it does not get reflected in the budget until you pay that bill .
For instance if you charge something in late January but do n’t pay the bill until February , you enter the expense in February .
If you purchase an electronic gadget with a rebate , you have to enter the full cost of the item in your budget and enter the rebate separately when it comes months later .
I like to itemize my credit card bills by putting the individual items into their own category .
For instance if I get a $ 20 credit card bill with $ 10 from internet hosting and $ 10 from Netflix , I enter two separate $ 10 charges in my budget and send out a $ 20 check .
My budget does not record the fact that I just sent out a check to a credit card company .
If you have a credit card balance you are paying and it is from old spending , I would just use a separate Credit Card line .
Savings is negative in the budget because it is coming out of your main account .
Bringing savings money into your main account will be reflected as a positive amount .
If at the end of the month you are running a deficit , you need to draw money in from somewhere .
If you are running a surplus , put it into a savings account .
Since you are not the federal government , you need to maintain a balanced budget every month .
If you run a deficit from high spending , and you do n’t have savings money to make up for it , you need an immediate reality check .
Your way of living is unsustainable and will catch up to you sooner than later .
It will just take one accident or layoff to send you into deep financial crisis .
Plus the recent change in bankruptcy laws make it harder to wipe away unsecured debt .
The nice thing about the monthly budget if you receive a paycheck is the two months a year when you get three paychecks .
Since you will not account for this third paycheck when setting up your budget , these checks are like the bonuses you wish your company would give out .
Put it directly into your savings account or credit card debt , or do something fun for yourself .
These two extra paychecks have gone to my travel fund for the past two years .
I first started using the budget spreadsheet after I spent $ 320 at French Connection in winter 2002 .
I felt incredibly guilty because I did n’t have that money to spare .
After sacrificing on clothing and Starbucks , I started making $ 200 monthly payments to my debt .
Then I squeezed myself even more each month until I was able to make consistent payments in the $ 400 range .
Fourteen months later I made my final payment and was debt free .
My income since then has doubled but my costs of living have actually decreased , so all that extra money is gravy .
I consider credit card debt to be a form of mental slavery , and even though I have much less possessions than my peers ( I do n’t even own a bed ) , I depend on myself to generate my happiness instead of products made by companies that view me as nothing more than a FICO score .
I still have the French Connection clothing that sent me over the edge , including the $ 120 pair of corduroy pants that I have worn about six times .
Mother Nature is usually very patient when she needs to get something done .
Erosion , continental drift , tides , wind , and water all work powerfully to mold and shape the world around us but they work very , very slowly .
When she needs to move a mountain in a hurry Mother Nature lights off a volcano .
A volcanic eruption is arguably the most spectacular and terrifying natural phenomenon one could ever witness .
Even a relatively minor lava flow is fascinating ; it 's the nearest thing to an irresistible force we 're likely to ever see in real time .
Unfortunately getting close enough to see volcanic activity is quite dangerous .
Professional vulcanologists are constantly on guard for signs of dangerous outbursts of lava , steam , ash , and other deadly volcanic effects as they study these burning mountains .
Whenever possible scientists use remote sensing and monitoring instruments to study volcanoes from a safe distance .
Now , thanks to the Internet , some of those instruments are accessible to the rest of us .
A number of active volcanoes around the world have one or more Web cameras focused on them , giving near real - time views of everything from steam quietly rising from a snow - capped peak to red - hot lava flowing from a vent .
It 's almost as good as being there and it's a lot safer .
Here are some links to volcano webcam sites around the world .
As you visit them remember a few things :
1 ) Volcanoes perform when they feel like it .
A webcam may show nothing but rising steam every day for months , then one day show the aftermath of a lava dome collapse .
2 ) Volcanoes are scattered around the world .
At any given time some will be in darkness while others will be in daylight .
I 've tried to list here a selection from around the world so no matter what time you visit at least a few will have daylight .
3 ) Volcanoes are mountains and experience typical mountain weather .
You may see a camera view obscured by clouds , fog , snow , rain , or insects .
Keep checking back - the weather will eventually change and you 'll be welcomed with a sparkling sunlit scene .
4 ) Most volcano webcams are in remote environments that are hostile to electronics .
A camera and associated equipment may fail frequently and it can take days to months before someone can visit the site to repair or replace it .
5 ) Most volcano camera
Web sites have " best of " collections where you can see some of the more interesting images their camera has produced .
Looking at collected images gives a quick summary of what the volcano has been up to over the past weeks or months .
6 ) Most volcano webcams display the date and time at which the current image was taken but the display may either be in local time or UTC ( Coordinated Universal Time or GMT ) .
The time display can help you determine if it 's currently nighttime at the volcano or if the camera is offline .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia has tested the world ’s most powerful vacuum bomb , which unleashes a destructive shockwave with the power of a nuclear blast , the military said on Tuesday , dubbing it the “ father of all bombs ” .
The bomb is the latest in a series of new Russian weapons and policy moves as President Vladimir Putin tries to reassert Moscow ’s role on the international stage .
“ Test results of the new airborne weapon have shown that its efficiency and power is commensurate with a nuclear weapon , ” Alexander Rukshin , Russian deputy armed forces chief of staff , told Russia ’s state ORT First Channel television .
The same report was later shown on the state - sponsored Vesti channel .
“ You will now see it in action , the bomb which has no match in the world is being tested at a military site . ”
It showed a Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bomber dropping the bomb over a testing ground .
A large explosion followed .
Pictures showed what looked like a flattened multi-storey block of flats surrounded by scorched soil and boulders .
“ The soil looks like a lunar landscape , ” the report said .
“ The defense ministry stresses this military invention does not contradict a single international treaty .
Russia is not unleashing a new arms race . ”
Such devices generally detonate in two stages .
First a small blast disperses a main load of explosive material into a cloud , which then either spontaneously ignites in air or is set off by a second charge .
This explosion generates a pressure wave that reaches much further than that from a conventional explosive .
The consumption of gases in the blast also generates a partial vacuum that can compound damage and injuries caused by the explosion itself .
“ The main destruction is inflicted by an ultrasonic shockwave and an incredibly high temperature , ” the reports said .
“ All that is alive merely evaporates . ”
Rukshin said : “ At the same time , I want to stress that the action of this weapon does not contaminate the environment , in contrast to a nuclear one . ”
“ FATHER OF ALL BOMBS ”
The Tu-160 supersonic bomber that dropped the bomb , widely known under its NATO nickname of “ Blackjack ” , is the heaviest combat aircraft ever built .
Putin , who has overseen the roll - out of new tactical and anti-aircraft missiles and combat aircraft , has ordered “ Blackjacks ” and the Tu - 95 “ Bear ” bombers to patrol around the world .
The report said the new bomb was much stronger than the U.S. - built Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb -- MOAB , also known under its name “ Mother of All Bombs ” .
“ So , Russian designers called the new weapon ‘ Father of All Bombs ’ , ” it said .
Showing the orange - painted U.S. prototype , the report said the Russian bomb was four times more powerful -- 44 metric tons of TNT equivalent -- and the temperature at the epicenter of its blast was two times higher .
In 1999 Russian generals threatened to use vacuum bombs to wipe out rebels from the mountains during the “ anti- terrorist operation ” in its restive Chechnya province .
New York - based Human Rights
Watch then appealed to Putin to refrain from using fuel - air explosives .
It remains unclear if weapons of this type were used during the Chechen war .
U.S. forces have used a “ thermobaric ” bomb , which works on similar principles , in their campaign against al Qaeda and Taliban forces in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan .
“ It ( the bomb ) will allow us to safeguard our state ’s security and fight international terrorism in any circumstances and in any part of the world , ” Rukshin said .

PLUS : Follow - Up Article to Come Detailing Response to Our Monday Exclusive and the ' Gagged ' FBI Whistleblower 's Challenge to the American Mainstream Media ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/31/2007 , 3:00 pm PT
Well , this is interesting .
It seems our Monday Exclusive on " gagged " FBI Whistleblower Sibel Edmonds has disappeared from Google News .
Sort of .
A simple news search for " Sibel Edmonds " at Google no longer offers the rather blockbuster story , in which it 's announced that she is now challenging American mainstream media television outlets to allow her to tell her story , uncensored and in violation of the ridiculous years - long " State Secrets Privilege " that the DoJ has been using to keep her quiet .
The story can be found via Google News , but it requires a search for both " Sibel Edmonds " and " Brad Blog , " or drilling by date , etc .
We 've got no idea why the story fails to show up otherwise .
That 's particularly odd since it's been incredibly popular since we first blogged it , having made it 's way to # 3 at Digg.com and # 4 at Reddit.com , as well as becoming the # 1 " recommended " diary at DailyKos.com for most of the day it first ran .
( Those rankings alone translate to big traffic on the Internets , for those not familiar with how these things work . )
We also ran a version of the report over at Huffington Post .
That one does n't show up either .
Oddly , our much older story from two weeks ago , in which we referred to and quoted Edmonds --- in relation to the recent House resolution declaring " genocide " in Turkey , and her damning allegations concerning former Speaker Dennis Hastert 's corrupt bargain while pushing the same legislation in 2000 --- does show up via the Google News search for " Sibel Edmonds . "
Even though that one , unlike this week 's , does n't even have her name in the headline and was far less popular and infrequently linked to .
No idea what all of that is about , of course , but it seems noteworthy .
In related news , we 'll have an exclusive follow - up soon on Edmonds , and the interesting response ( or lack thereof ) , she 's so - far received from the American mainstream media in the wake of the blockbuster Monday report .
Here 's a hint , she 's called it " disgusting . "
In the meantime , the blogger who pointed out the above anomaly suggests the " Stephen Colbert Effect " might be useful in Edmonds ' matter as well .
UPDATE 11/1/07 12:02 pm PT :
The original story that would n't appear via simple Google News search for " Sibel Edmonds " now does show up as a result of that search .
We have no idea what , if anything , has changed , but since we ran this report ( which also shows up on the same search ) 24 hours ago or so , the story now shows up as expected , when it did not previously .
No clue what to make of it all still , of course , but noting it nonetheless .
# 18 : “ Would You Go To Bed With Me Tonight ? ”
If you were a man walking across the campus of Florida State University in 1978 , an attractive young woman might have approached you and said these exact words : " I have been noticing you around campus .
I find you to be attractive .
Would you go to bed with me tonight ? "
If you were that man , you probably would have thought that you had just gotten incredibly lucky .
But not really .
You were actually an unwitting subject in an experiment designed by the psychologist Russell Clark .
Clark had persuaded the students of his social psychology class to help him find out which gender , in a real - life situation , would be more receptive to a sexual offer from a stranger .
The only way to find out , he figured , was to actually get out there and see what would happen .
So young men and women from his class fanned out across campus and began propositioning strangers .
The results were n't very surprising .
Seventy - five percent of guys were happy to oblige an attractive female stranger ( and those who said no typically offered an excuse such as , " I'm married " ) .
But not a single woman accepted the identical offer of an attractive male .
In fact , most of them demanded the guy leave her alone .
At first the psychological community dismissed Clark 's experiment as a trivial stunt , but gradually his experiment gained first acceptance , and then praise for how dramatically it revealed the differing sexual attitudes of men and women .
Today it 's considered a classic .
But why men and women display such different attitudes remains as hotly debated as ever .

I would suggest that , seeing as a female needs to carry the baby , she needs to be the one picky about males , both their willingness to stay with the female , and how attractive the male is .
In this case , the suggestion is n't a long term relationship , just a one night stand .
Males on the other hand , just try to mate with an acceptable level of beauty .
O_o ?
Yeah , sure the baby ...
Everybody knows sex is about babbies ... always ... I think that one reason for the fact that almost no women agreeded , has to do with culture , and how males are much less scared about rape / murder scandals , etc , than their female counterparts .
I agree with Rishi that culture is a more satisfying explanation than evolutionary just - so stories .
Both hypotheses need testing , though ... that was almost 30 years ago .
now would be 100 % man would said yes and 50 % for woman .
I tend to favour the evolutionary explanation .
If you look at many animals , and including certain primates we closely resemble ( i.e. , chimps ) , males always oblige when females choose to make themselves available ( you will also see male primates trading in food , etc. for sexual favours ) .
You can hardly talk about primates having " culture " , so the explanation must have more to do with our biology .
I think the evolutionary explanation makes more sense .
You can thank our science that today we have sex for pleasure without much chance of pregnancy .
Thats not to say that people in the past did n't have sex for pleasure but a pregnancy was always a much bigger factor .
Humans as a species have existed for hundreds of thousands of years and more ( way , way longer than our written history ) and I believe certain behavior is still drawn from those early ancestors of ours , only today we see it as human nature .
I do n't wanna make this into an essay so I 'll stop there .
Kris is right .
Males are programmed to pass their seed to as many mates as possible , to sustain the species .
Females can only become pregnant and deliver a baby during a long period , and have no internal biological need to mate often .
There are some women out there that enjoy sex for gratification with many partners , but they seem to require a little more sophistication beyond a bold proposition in public .
I always thought the difference between a man and woman 's actions were due to the basic fact that people and animals are much more cautious about what they put into their body than what they put parts of their body into .
For example , Consider putting your finger into feces vs. eating feces .
One is unpleasant , the other is horrifically disgusting .
Woman as receivers of foreign bodies into their own are rightly cautious .
Culture has nothing to do with it .
And a bit over 20 years later , someone turned it into a song !
Could n't help but be struck with the similarities with the spoken text mentioned above and the lyrics of this : I have often said something similar to John in the UK .
Imagine a complete stranger who looks quite filthy .
Now you have a choice , you can put your finger in thier mouth or they can put thier finger in your mouth .
This is not to say that sex is filthy but one cannot be sure of a stranger 's " condition " and taking something unknown into the body obviously produces more caution then putting the body into somthing unknown .
I remember reading of a story of a guy in Germany not too long ago who asked random womans whether they want to go to bed with him .
Many agreed .
I think that the evolutionary aspect is part of it , but culture also plays a part .
First of all , girls are taught from a young age to be afraid of rape and kidnap , more than men .
And if a girl sleeps around with strangers , she gets a bad reputation , and if a guy does then he 's a " playa " .
I 'm a Chinese .
In China , or maybe in the east , if you ask a strange women such a question , it will be a very big problem , you will be underarrested .
The main reason is the woman has the power .
A woman can get sex any time she wants - while the man has to get permission from the woman .
Thus when offered a " freebie " the man will say yes .
The woman will be more selective , because she can .
John and Lisa are right , of course .
Then there 's also the fact that even with contraception , there 's always at least a small chance of pregnancy , which is hardly a minor thing .
I would n't have much sex either if it meant a chance I 'd end up carrying around a parasite for nine months ( unless I went through a painful procedure to get it removed ) .
And then there 's the issue of what it 'll do to your reputation , and the threat of abuse .
With all these perfectly logical practical reasons , I do n't know why you 'd resort to a speculative evolutionary motive .
Promiscuity certainly is n't " programmed " in anybody as though we 're robots , and all other things being equal women do have evolutionary incentive to sleep around , even if it 's less incentive than men .
( Women want genetic diversity in their offspring - and in hunter - gatherer tribes women provide most of the food * and * childcare , while men hunt communally , so keeping the father happy is not as huge a concern as you 'd think . )
This experiment was done over thirty years ago when feminism and the sexual revolution was still very new and using the pill still had some social stigma to it .
I would be interested to see this experiment tried again in today 's more liberated society .
I 'll bet if the guy were attractive many more women would readily accept the offer .
Thanks for the analogy , Lisa , much better than mine and to the same point .
For all mammals around the world , through all time , woman control sex and select mates .
The only explanation for this fact is the biological one .
Woman recieve and carry children , men just give .
Why bother inventing alternative exlanation that merely confuse the issue ?
Until the mechanism of sex changes , woman and men will ALWAYS view it differently .
No amount of enducation , indoctrination or argument will ever change this .
Accept and move on .
Evolutionary psychology is bullshit because you we do n't really know much about our past , so you can easily give any behavior an " evolutionary basis " and finally , we will never know the right answer .
I 've seen women accept advances of this kind from men they do n't know - in bars .
Men get things to have sex .
Women have sex go get things .

The papers of Thomas Jefferson ( 1743-1826 ) , diplomat , architect , scientist , and third president of the United States , held in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division , consist of approximately 25,000 items , making it the largest collection of original Jefferson documents in the world .
Dating from the early 1760s through his death in 1826 , the Thomas Jefferson Papers consist mainly of his correspondence , but they also include his drafts of the Declaration of Independence , drafts of Virginia laws ; his fragmentary autobiography ; the small memorandum books he used to record his spending ; the pages on which for many years he daily recorded the weather ; many charts , lists , tables , and drawings recording his scientific and other observations ; notes ; maps ; recipes ; ciphers ; locks of hair ; wool samples ; and more .
The collection documents Jefferson ’s whole life , both public and personal -- as a delegate to the second Continental Congress , Virginia legislator and governor , diplomat and residence in France , secretary of state , and president .
The purchase of Louisiana , the expedition of Lewis and Clark , the building of Washington , D.C. as the national capital , and Jefferson ’s profound engagement with science and technology are all documented here .
Jefferson ’s family life at Monticello is reflected in correspondence with his daughters , Martha ( Patsy ) Jefferson Randolph ( 1776 -1836 ) and Mary ( Maria ) Jefferson Eppes ( 1778 -1804 ) , and his grandchildren , and in household accounts kept by his wife , Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson ( 1748-1782 ) .
Some aspects of the lives of Jefferson ’s slaves , including members of the Hemings family of Monticello , including James Hemings ( 1765 -1821 ) , a brother of Sally Hemings , who trained as a French chef in Paris , can be traced in these papers .
The twenty - one volumes of legal and legislative records from colonial Virginia , 1606 - 1737 , that Jefferson collected , are divided between this collection and one held by the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress .
Notable correspondents include Abigail Adams , John Adams , Joel Barlow , Aaron Burr , François Jean de Chastellux , José Francisco Correia da Serra , Maria Cosway , Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours , Alexander Hamilton , Jean Antoine Houdon , Alexander von Humboldt , Tadeusz Kościuszko , the Marquis de Lafayette , Benjamin Henry Latrobe , Pierre Charles L'Enfant , Meriwether Lewis , James Madison , James Monroe , Charles Willson Peale , Joseph Priestley , David Rittenhouse , Benjamin Rush , William Short , Samuel Harrison Smith , J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur , William Thornton , John Trumbull , Charles Gravier , comte de Vergennes , C. -F. Volney , Caspar Wistar , and George Washington .
Description of Series
The Thomas Jefferson Papers are divided into ten series as follows :
Transcriptions
Some of Jefferson ’s papers are supplemented on this website by transcriptions from the published editions listed below and from others supplied by Manuscript Division specialist Gerard Gawalt ( since retired ) .
There are some discrepancies with dates and other text between documents in the published editions and the manuscript images .
This is because in some cases editors transcribed a different draft than the one the Library of Congress owns .
In other cases archivists at the Library of Congress and editors of the published editions arrived at different interpretations of dates , correspondents , or other data .
The published editions listed below were the source of the transcriptions used on the Library ’s Web site .
They were chosen because they are out of copyright or otherwise in the public domain .

WASHINGTON , June 14 — Senate Democratic and Republican leaders announced on Thursday that they had agreed on a way to revive a comprehensive immigration bill that was pulled off the Senate floor seven days ago .
The majority leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , and the minority leader , Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky , said they expected the bill to return to the floor before the Fourth of July recess .
In a joint statement , Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell said : “ We met this evening with several of the senators involved in the immigration bill negotiations .
Based on that discussion , the immigration bill will return to the Senate floor after completion of the energy bill . ”
The immigration bill , ardently sought by President Bush , would make the biggest changes in immigration law and policy in more than 20 years .
Continuing with my Adga programming practice .
Part of the mergesort example became easy once Max showed me how I should perform the pattern matching in insert .

Length - Indexed Lists
Firstly , define length - indexed lists and its fold function .
> data List ( a : Set ) : Nat ->
Set where > [ ] :
List a zero > _::_ : {n : Nat} -> a ->
List a n ->
List a ( suc n ) > foldr : {a : Set} -> {n : Nat} -> ( b : {m : Nat} ->
List a m -> Set ) > -> ( {m : Nat} -> {xs : List a m} > -> ( x : a ) -> b xs -> b ( x :: xs ) ) > -> b [ ] > -> ( xs : List a n ) -> b xs > foldr b f e [ ] = e > foldr b f e ( x :: xs ) = f x ( foldr b f e xs )
Apart from the extra parameter b , the body of foldr is not too different from the ordinary fold on lists .
For genericity , however , its type is more complicated .
I wonder whether it is still appropriate to call it a “ fold ” , now that xs appears as a parameter .
Perhaps that is why people talk about “ eliminators ” rather than folds or catamorphisms .
Size - Indexed Balanced Trees
This is one of the possible ways to define sized - indexed balanced trees .
The parity bit keep notes of whether the number of the elements is even or odd .
> data Parity :
Set where >
Even : Parity > Odd : Parity > parity : Parity ->
Nat > parity Even = 0 > parity Odd = 1
The Bin constructor enforces the constraint that if the size is even , the two subtrees must have the same size .
Otherwise the left subtree contains exactly one more element than the right .
> data Tree ( a : Set ) : Nat ->
Set where >
Nul : Tree a 0 > Tip : a ->
Tree a 1 > Bin : {n : Nat} -> ( p : Parity ) -> >
Tree a ( parity p + n ) ->
Tree a n ->
Tree a ( parity p + ( n + n ) )
Fold on trees is defined in a way similar to fold on lists .
> foldT : {a : Set} -> {n : Nat} -> ( b : {m : Nat} ->
Tree a m -> Set ) > -> ( {m : Nat} -> ( p : Parity ) > -> {t : Tree a ( parity p + m ) } -> {u : Tree a m} > -> b t -> b u -> b ( Bin p t u ) ) > -> ( ( x : a ) -> b ( Tip x ) ) > -> b Nul > -> ( xs : Tree a n ) -> b xs > foldT b f g e Nul = e > foldT b f g e ( Tip x ) = g x > foldT b f g e ( Bin p t u ) = f p ( foldT b f g e t ) ( foldT b f g e u )
Mergesort
The function insert adds one element to a balanced tree .
I did not know how to get the case for Bin Odd t u type - check until Max pointed out that I could just pattern match the implicit argument {n} of Bin .
> insert : {a : Set} -> {n : Nat} -> > a ->
Tree a n ->
Tree a ( suc n ) > insert x Nul = Tip x > insert x ( Tip y ) = Bin Even ( Tip x ) ( Tip y ) > insert x ( Bin Even t u ) = >
Bin Odd ( insert x t ) u > insert {a} x ( Bin {n} Odd t u ) = > subst ( \\ i ->
Tree a ( suc i ) ) ( sym ( + suc n n ) ) >
( Bin Even t ( insert x u ) )
The function dealT , dealing elements of the input list to a balanced tree , can thus be defined as a fold :
> dealT : {a : Set} -> {n : Nat} ->
List a n ->
Tree a n > dealT {a} = foldr ( \{m} xs ->
Tree a m ) insert Nul
The function merge has been discussed before :
> merge : {m n : Nat} -> > List Nat m ->
List Nat n ->
List Nat ( m + n ) > merge [ ] ys = ys > merge {suc m} {zero} ( x :: xs ) Nil = > subst ( List Nat ) ( + zero ( suc m ) ) ( x :: xs ) > merge {suc m} {suc n} ( x :: xs ) ( y :: ys ) = > if x < y then > x :: merge xs ( y :: ys ) > else ( y :: > subst ( List Nat ) ( + suc m n ) ( merge ( x :: xs ) ys ) )
The merging phase of mergesort can be seen as a fold on a binary tree :
> mergeT : {n : Nat} ->
Tree Nat n ->
List Nat n > mergeT = foldT ( \\ {m} t -> List Nat m ) > ( \\ {m} p xs ys -> > subst ( List Nat ) ( + assoc ( parity p ) m m ) ( merge xs ys ) ) > ( \\ x -> x :: [ ] ) > [ ]
I needed +assoc to type - cast ( parity p + m ) + m into parity p + ( m + m ) .
Finally , here comes mergesort .
> msort : {n : Nat} -> List Nat n ->
List Nat n > msort = mergeT ∘ dealT
Of course , when it comes to sorting , one would expect that we prove that it actually sorts the list than merely that it preserves the length .
It will perhaps be left to the next exercise .
The NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT was designed to succeed the GeForce 7600 GT by not only offering better performance but also support for DirectX 10 .
For many gamers on a budget , the DirectX 10 support was the biggest reason to upgrade to the GeForce 8600 GT .
It would allow them to play DirectX 10 games , or so they thought .
The NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT does offer DirectX 10 support on a low budget .
However , its DirectX 10 performance is so abysmal , it is virtually useless at all but the lowest resolutions .
Short of some miraculous driver optimizations , there is no way you can run any DirectX 10 game with a usable frame rate at resolutions of 1280 x 1024 or greater .
The only possible use for its DirectX 10 support is in games that have very minimal use of DirectX 10 features , like BioShock .
In Company Of Heroes , switching to the DirectX 10 render path killed its frame rate from 89 fps to just 35 fps at 800 x 600 .
Although that is a playable frame rate , it came at the cost of using a very low resolution .
As Company Of Heroes is hardly a very graphics - intensive game , we expect even poorer performance with more graphics - intensive DirectX 10 titles .
In fact , the GeForce 8600 GT had trouble delivering a good frame rate for more graphics - intensive DirectX 9 titles .
In BioShock , the GeForce 8600 GT only managed to deliver a frame rate of 24 fps at 1280 x 1024 .
BioShock was only playable at lower resolutions of 1024 x 768 or 800 x 600 .
That is not very surprising though , since the GeForce 8600 GT is really not much faster than the GeForce 7600 GT .
In fact , it is slower than higher - end DirectX 9 cards like the NVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT and the ATI Radeon X1950 GT .
The only performance advantage the GeForce 8600 GT has over its predecessor is in texture fillrate , where it has a 28.6 % higher fillrate than the GeForce 7600 GT .
Both cards have the same memory bandwidth of 22.4 GB /s .
This was confirmed by our benchmark results where the GeForce 8600 GT was only 17 - 30 % faster than the GeForce 7600 GT .
So , what is the NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT good for ?
This card runs best in DirectX 9 and at lower resolutions like 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 .
If you are using a lower - end card like the GeForce 7600 GS or the GeForce 7300 cards , the NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT offers a good upgrade but only for its DirectX 9 performance .
Its DirectX 10 performance is just too abysmal to matter , unless you are stuck with a 15 " CRT monitor .
If you have a faster GeForce 7 - series card like the GeForce 7600 GT , it would not make much sense upgrading to the GeForce 8600 GT .
It would be much better to upgrade to a faster GeForce 8 - series card that would not only be able to offer a significant performance boost , but also usable frame rates in DirectX 10 games .
The new NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT would be a very good choice .
It offers not only a tremendous amount of performance , it is only cost twice as much as the GeForce 8600 GT .

WASHINGTON — Conservatives claim to be in favor of stable families , small businesses , hard work , private schools , investment and homeownership .
So why in the world are so many on the right attacking the family of Graeme Frost ?
Graeme is the 12 - year - old from Baltimore who delivered the Democrats ’ reply to a radio address by President Bush in September .
The seventh - grader pleaded — in vain , it turned out — that the president not veto Congress ’ $ 35 - billion expansion of the children ’s health care program known as SCHIP .
A car crash in December 2004 left two of Halsey and Bonnie Frost ’s children comatose , Graeme with a brain stem injury and Gemma , his sister , with a cranial fracture .
The kids were treated , thanks to SCHIP .
The Frosts spoke out so the public would know that real people lie behind the acronym .
Their reward was to be trashed on right - wing blogs and talk radio as if they were multimillionaires ripping off the system .
The assault on the Frosts apparently began on the Free Republic Web site and quickly spread to National Review Online , Power Line and Michelle Malkin ’s blog , as well as Rush Limbaugh ’s radio show .
And of what were the Frosts guilty ?
Well , they own their own home , which they bought for $ 55,000 in 1990 and is now worth about $ 260,000 ; they invested in a commercial property , valued at $ 160,000 ; Halsey Frost , a self - employed woodworker , once owned a small business that was dissolved in 1999 ; and Graeme attends a private school on scholarship .
I rely here on facts reported this week in The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times , both of which set straight the more outlandish claims made by the Frosts ’ attackers .
The right is unapologetic .
“ The Democrats chose to outsource their airtime to a seventh - grader , ” wrote National Review ’s Mark Steyn .
“ If a political party is desperate enough to send a boy to do a man ’s job , then the boy is fair game . ”
OK , the Democrats are “ fair game , ” but a 12 - year - old ?
No wonder nobody talks about compassionate conservatism anymore .
As a general rule , I am a fan of the blogosphere .
It has broadened the public debate and brought new people into politics .
And nasty stuff is by no means limited to the right - wing blogs .
Left - of - center blogs whose political views I largely share have published offensive stuff , too .
Shaun Mullen , who blogs at The Moderate Voice — yes , there are moderate blogs — is right to generalize when he says that the targeting of the Frost family reveals “ the vicious underbelly of the blogosphere . ”
So rather than just condemn the right - wingers as meanies , let ’s take their claims seriously .
Doing so makes clear that they are engaged in a truly perverse and incoherent form of class warfare .
The left is accused of all manner of sins related to covetousness and envy whenever it raises questions about who benefits from President Bush ’s tax cuts and mentions the yachts such folks might buy or the mansions they might own .
But here is a family with modest possessions doing everything conservatives tell people they should do , and the right trashes them for getting help to buy health insurance for their children .
Most conservatives favor government - supported vouchers that would help Graeme attend his private school , but here they turn around and criticize him for … attending a private school .
Federal money for private schools but not for health insurance ?
What ’s the logic here ?
Conservatives endlessly praise risk - taking by entrepreneurs and would give big tax cuts to those who are most successful .
But if a small - business person is struggling , he should n’t even think about applying for SCHIP .
Conservatives who want to repeal the estate tax on large fortunes have cited stories — most of them never check out — about farmers having to sell their farms to pay inheritance taxes .
But the implication of these attacks on the Frosts is that they are expected to sell their investment property to pay for health care .
Why ?
Oh , yes , and conservatives tell us how much they love homeownership , and then assail the Frosts for having the nerve to own a home .
I suppose they should have to sell that , too .
The real issue here is whether uninsured families with earnings similar to the Frosts ’ need government help to buy health coverage .
With the average family policy in employer - provided plans now costing more than $ 12,000 annually — the price is usually higher for families trying to buy it on their own — the answer is plainly yes .
All the conservative attacks on a boy from Baltimore who dared to speak out will not make this issue go away .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
The main U.S. hurricane tracking center was itself in the eye of a storm on Friday after its staff called for the resignation of their boss for picking a political fight with Washington and undermining the credibility of their forecasts .
The newly installed director of the National Hurricane Center , Bill Proenza , had launched a high - profile campaign to replace an aging weather satellite he said was crucial for accurate forecasts and publicly criticized his superiors for spending money on public relations .
He won the backing of several Florida politicians who portrayed him as a whistle - blower shedding light on the failings of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , which runs the Miami - based hurricane center .
But 23 of the center ’s staff -- half its work force -- issued a petition on Thursday night calling for Proenza to resign because he had pitched the agency into a distracting political battle and exaggerated the importance of the satellite , called QuikSCAT .
“ Bill has poisoned the atmosphere here at the hurricane center , ” said senior forecaster James Franklin in a televised news conference on Friday outside the bunker - like hurricane center in west Miami .
“ He went off and spoke about issues without getting the information or getting it correctly or relying on the decades of experience of hurricane forecasting that we have here and that he does n’t have . ”
Proenza dismissed the complaints of his senior staff as the grumblings of long - time employees facing change .
He told the Miami Herald on Friday he would not resign .
“ The staff here does n’t dictate who the leader is , ” he said according to an article on the newspaper ’s Web site .
Proenza , who has been in the job since the start of the year , was initially reprimanded by NOAA .
But the confrontation came to a head this week when the agency dispatched inspectors to Miami to review operations at the hurricane center .
Shortly after , several of the center ’s most respected hurricane experts told the Miami Herald that Proenza should go because he was misrepresenting the importance of QuikSCAT when he claimed that its demise would reduce the accuracy of long - range storm track forecasts by up to 16 percent .
Launched in 1999 and initially intended to have a mission life of just two years , what QuikSCAT actually does is measure surface wind speeds in distant parts of the globe where “ hurricane hunter ” aircraft cannot go .
Some independent weather experts have also challenged Proenza and noted that as a result of his QuikSCAT campaign , politicians had adopted the dangerously misguided notion that the satellite data was more important than information gathered by air crews on hurricane hunters .
The hurricane hunters are regarded as the best way to get accurate and useful information on a storm ’s intensity and structure as it nears vulnerable coastlines .
“ There is not a hurricane forecaster anywhere that would trade hurricane hunter data for QuikSCAT , ” wrote weather expert Jeff Masters on his tropical cyclone blog on the weatherunderground Web site .
Proenza replaced retired hurricane center chief Max Mayfield , who became a household name in the United States during the ferocious Atlantic hurricane season of 2005 when Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans and demolished the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Louisiana .
' Kid Nation ' Contestants No Fans of President Bush After the children on the CBS reality TV series Kid Nation create their own government , it might not be an ally of the United States .
Several of the contestants posted online profiles on the CBS web site that are highly critical of President Bush .
I think George W. Bush takes the cake .
The planet is disintegrating , we 're fighting an unnecessary war , millions are without health care , the school system has gone down the toilet , the country is billions of dollars in debt , the world seems to be headed on a path towards destruction , and America 's hypocrisy is mocked by many nations .
I think that merits recognition .
When asked to name some of the worst U.S. presidents in history , a 14 - year - old Florida girl named Sophia gave this answer :
Asked the same question , 9 - year - old Alex of Nevada wrote this : George W. Bush , for leading us into a war without checking his facts first and for not having a clear plan prior to the invasion .
He also suppressed anyone who wanted to question his decisions , which is against the American concept of free speech .
William Harrison because he was too stupid to wear a coat at his inauguration speech , and caught pneumonia and died without doing anything in office .
And here 's Anjay , 12 , one of the president 's fellow Texans :
The US president that comes to mind , due to recent events , is George W. Bush , because I do n't agree with the way he is handling the Iraq war .
D.K. , an Illinois 14 - year - old , was critical of both Presidents Bush : George Bush ; for not truly caring what happened to his country while he was in presidency , George W. Bush ; for trying to be an exact replica of his father and his poor decisions .
Bush does receive support from Emilie , a 9 - year - old Nevadan , aside from one issue :
My parents voted for George Bush and I agree with their decision .
Although I did not agree with Bush 's decision to send my brother and other soldiers to war .
One of the kids , Alex , named Al Gore as a world leader he admires and said he read Gore 's book An Inconvenient Truth .
" I admire the fact that Al Gore has committed himself to champion this worthy cause , " he writes .
These profiles were discovered by blogger Rafe Colburn .
The premise of Kid Nation is that 40 children , ages 8 through 15 , have been left in a desert ghost town to fend for themselves and create their own society , a la Lord of the Flies .
Producers choose one child an episode to receive $ 20,000 .
The Bush - loathing Sophia won the first prize on Wednesday 's premiere .
Give me a break !
I dont for a minute believe these comments are solely that of children .
I can understand that parents talk and kids listen and that is where these comments come from ( I believe ) .
I also believe that if we had more people from both parties supporting our President and our mission in Iraq we would be able to accomplish our goals much more efficiently .
The opinions of kids .
Sure .
These represent the opinions that were proposed by the same creative writers at the Leftist network CBS , aka Clinton Broacasting System , that write the scripted scenes for this ridiculous show and it's predecesor , Survivor !
Blast Bush and praise Gore .
We can see right through it .
These kids are a lot smarter than the idiot in the White House - a man who will go down in history as the worst president of all time .
He will be known as the man who lied to to the American people as he attacked a country that had done nothing to us and which did not have the means to do anything to us .
He will be known as the man who sacrificed the lives of thousands of American troops and maimed thousands more .
He will be known as the man responsible for the destruction of another country , the slaughter of at least a million of its citizens and making refugees of millions more .
He will be known as the man who has made American a pariah among the peoples of the world .
He will be known as the man who has driven the deficit to record heights and allowed foreign countries to finance our debt .
He will be known as the most secretive president in history who has also used the Constitution as a door mat .
It is obvious that these kids have a brain and have not been taken in by the occupant of the Oval Office who said that in his job he has to catapult the propaganda .
And , boy has he shoveled it out .
Thankfully more and more Americans are not buying his brand of garbage .
What I think is really interesting in these comments is that the first two people think that kids can't possibly have these kind of legitimate opinions on their own .
This is why so many rightwingers need to have their children homeschooled , so that they can be fed the " right " opinions and taught not to actually read and think for themselves .
I know lots of kids in this age group and many of them think George W. Bush is a great president and many of them think he 's a terrible president .
Just like the adults .
What the kids do n't do is characterize the opinions of people different than them as having been fed to them by some boogeyman ( the mainstream media , their leftist parents , their rightwing parents , their churches ) .
This disingenuous need to ignore the content of what they say and attack the possible " source " of their " infection " here is what is exactly wrong with the way rightwing discourse has come to be handled .
Talk about the actual content , not about the conspiracy that somehow keeps everybody from agreeing with you .
Sheesh .
To quote from the last post , " Many think George W. Bush is a great president and many think he 's a terrible president .
Just like the adults . "
It seems CBS filtered out any and all kids and / or their comments that felt he 's a great president .
And low and behold one prmotes Lying Al Gore .
In the true mold of CBS they now use unknowing children to promote their liberal bias !!
Amazing clarity of thought out of todays kids .
If you do n't think these kids said what they said , click on their names to go to their bio which reveals that they are capable of constructing a lucid , thoughtful sentence .
OR
Dispute the things which they say as tinfoiler induced like the first two posters who have drank the kool - aid and remain in the denial state ( no not Egypt 's river ) that things are different from the world they are fed by the neo -nazi's on talk radio / Faux .
Are you kidding ?
you do n't trust a 15 year old to drive , drink alcohol responsibly or see an R rated movie but your going to praise their intellect for some canned political statement you can read anywhere in the media today like it was their own thought ?
So it 's clear that you all are taken in by the false two party system .
They all talk a great game but what really counts is when they go to vote .
A few dissenters vote against to save party face but the bill still passes along with everyones special needs pet projects tacked onto the end that they do n't discuss much or publicize .
It 's a a lie pull away from the feed bag a second and really look at whats going on .
But hey as long as that monetary pacifier still taste good you 'll keep sucking up and believing what they feed you .
Do n't care : I do n't watch " reality TV " .
I 've no need .
I live down in the deep south .
Ergo , one visit to a relative of mine who owns and operates a beauty salon supplies me with more intel about people I could n't give two shits about for decades .
People who watch that crap need a lifestyle injection ....

Another generation of indoctrinated youth .
Pretty soon they 'll all be dressed in designer brown shirts and the cutest little jackboots you would ever want to see .
Why do n't we just let these kids be kids and stop trying to make them little clones of the politically correct machine .
I can't believe how stupid some people are .
It really does amaze me .
They actually think we will believe that a 9 year old kid said Bush led us into a war without checking his facts ?
Comeon ... I am 38 and I do n't know all the facts .
They are reading lines CBS gave them and coached them on .
I really hate the seperation of the country right now .
They have kids commenting on issues they have no idea about .
" Sophia " said this : " 1 ) The planet is disintegrating , 2 ) we 're fighting an unnecessary war , 3 ) millions are without health care , 4 ) the school system has gone down the toilet , 5 ) the country is billions of dollars in debt , 6 ) the world seems to be headed on a path towards destruction " .
1 ) WRONG : man has very little on the Earth 's climate .
Everything Gore said is BS .
2 ) Wrong :
We stopped a man that has killed millions of people and aided know terrorists .
He may not have attacked us , but he gave money and shelter to those that did .
3 ) WRONG : There is healthcare available ... anyone ever heard on Medicare ?
There may be people without healthcare insurance , but not as many as the Dems want you to believe .
There are people without jobs ... but the unemployment rate is lower that when Slick Willie was in office .
4 ) Ok ... I have to give partial truth to that one .
But it 's not necessarliy Bush 's fault , but I am sure some blame lies there .
5 ) TRUE , but the deficate is actually going down ... do the research .
6 ) TRUE , but in the 60's / 70's , people thought the same thing .
Different era , different views .
And this is my favorite : Alex : I admire the fact that Al Gore has committed himself to champion this worthy cause " LoL ... get a new role model kid .
Let 's see ... all the things these 9 and 12 year olds are saying ( supposedly on their own .... yeah , right ! ) are all the things the left - wing lemming Democrats think and believe .
Do you want your country to be run by adults whose thoughts can be easily espoused by 9 and 12 year olds ?
I do n't .... I want real adults who make hard decisions in a complicated and complex world , that is n't as cut and dried as 9 year olds believe it is .
Are you smarter than a 5th grader ?
Visitor at 06:18 does n't make the cut .
How does it feel yo wake up in the morning and actually be THAT wrong ?
1 ) The planet is disintegrating , 2 ) we 're fighting an unnecessary war , 3 ) millions are without health care , 4 ) the school system has gone down the toilet , 5 ) the country is billions of dollars in debt , 6 ) the world seems to be headed on a path towards destruction "
6:18 's attempts to prove these arguments false with dittohead logic would be laughable if it was n't so pathetic .
1 ) The planet is losing bio - diversity that it will never get back including mass extinctions .
2 ) The War in Iraq is a purely elective war that not only did n't have to be fought but should have never been considered in the first place .
3 ) Millions are w/o healthcare Medicaid does n't even begin to cut it .
4 ) Since shifting resources away from public schools in order to encourage the mass building of Xtian madrassas in the US it can be safely sed that the school system is failing American kids miserably .
5 ) The entire war in Iraq is being fought using a Chi-Com credit card and the small print on the back of the agreement is a guarantee that the US will become more and more beholden and subserviant to the rising Middle Kingdom until America officially becomes China 's bitch .
Even w/o this grim reality the twin trade deficits are ultimately unsustainable .
The only thing really keeping the US economy afloat at this point is the continued existence of the Petro dollar .
That situation is already changing .
6 ) The world is on a path to destruction .
Pollution , over - population , global warming , religious fueled wars , a coming World War over dwindling non renewable energy sources , all this combined with a hopelessly , corporately corrupted series of governement around the world who 's policies are being run by pan global elitists and disguised by a compliant MSM .

A hundred yards from a school playing field on the edge of Nayagarh , a small town in eastern India , is an innocuous damp circular patch covered with what appears to be sticks and stones .
A closer look reveals that the debris is shards of tiny skulls and bones , all that remains of more than 40 female foetuses - aborted because of their sex and then dumped in a disused well .
The secret tragedy of being conceived female in India burst into the open this week with the grim discovery of the well , dug on land earmarked for a private hospital - the Krishna clinic owned by an obstetrician , Nabakirshora Sahu , and his wife , Savitha .
The latter is in custody but the medic is on the run .
Last Thursday Santish Mishra , a health official , was poking at the top of the hole , from which had been exhumed 132 bags of putrefying human remains .
Above the grisly sight hangs an acrid smell , the telltale chemical stench of hospital waste used to hide the truth .
" Femur , skull , forearm - probably .
We are pretty sure these are all female , aborted at about five months which is the legal limit , " said Dr Mishra .
" You can say it was a hidden mass grave . "
In India ultrasound technology , coupled with a traditional preference for boys , has led to mass female foeticide .
Although gender - based abortion is illegal , parents are choosing to abort female foetuses in such large numbers that experts estimate India has lost 10 million girls in the past 20 years .
In the 12 years since selective abortion was outlawed only one doctor has been convicted of the crime .
Nursing homes
Authorities in Nayagarh said they will come down hard on clinics offering ultrasound scans to determine the sex of an unborn child and the " nursing homes " where abortions are carried out .
All five clinics and eight nursing homes have been shut and sealed .
It is hard to believe that in such a small town illegal terminations could happen without official connivance - at least one government doctor has been arrested .
Two weeks ago an 11 - year - old boy out playing in a grove at the edge of Nayagarh town opened a sealed bag to find bloody remains of seven female foetuses .
Although the alarm was raised and local television stations aired shocking images , by the time the police arrived - three hours late - they had been removed .
" I was very scared .
There was blood everywhere , " said Upendra Kalasha , the boy who found the remains .
" The people came but not the police . "
Paresh Nayak , the top local civil servant , said : " Nobody said anything to me .
The public have a responsibility to come forward .
They did not and we were overtaken by events . "
One of those events was the election of India 's first female head of state , president Pratibha Patil .
In her inaugural address this week to both houses of parliament she said India " must banish ( the ) social evil of female foeticide " .
What happened in Nayagarh is merely the tip of the iceberg .
Last month a doctor in Delhi was arrested after remains of aborted babies were found in a septic tank at his practice .
In February police found the remains of 15 infants buried in the backyard of a hospital in the central state of Madhya Pradesh .
A television investigation last year filmed dozens of doctors offering to perform illegal terminations of female foetuses and dump them in rivers or in fields .
The prejudices against having a daughter run deep in India , where tradition dictates that when she is married a woman 's family must pay the groom 's family a large dowry .
By contrast a son is considered an asset .
Even leaving aside the wealth his bride will bring , a boy will inherit property and is seen as a way of securing parent - care in old age .
Development has not erased traditional values : in fact , selective abortion has been accelerating in a globalising India .
Wealthier and better - educated Indians still want sons .
A survey revealed that female foeticide was highest among women with university degrees .
The urban middle classes can also afford the ultrasound tests to determine the sex of the foetus .
" We are seeing a rush of multinational companies selling ultrasound machines in India with little regard for how they are used , " said Sabu George , a campaigner against female foeticide .
" Chinese companies now sell machines at just 200,000 rupees ( £ 2,500 ) half the price of American ones .
Every small town doctor can get one and more families can afford the test . "
The mix of old customs and new technology means a shortage of girls that will haunt India for decades , say researchers .
The latest figures from a sample registration system which covers 1.3 m households shows that for the two years up to 2005 Indian had just 880 female babies born to each 1,000 males .
Prem Chowdhry , who has studied the implications of a widening gender deficit , says unmarried young men are turning to crime and violence against women has increased .
Some men in the rich northern state of Haryana have taken to buying brides from other parts of India .
Many of these wives end up slaves and their children are shunned .
" We are seeing five to 10 households in every village where wives are brought , " said Professor Chowdhry .
" The pattern is being reproduced across India and we are staring at a huge problem for the future . "
· The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday August 3 2007 .
Indian tradition does not usually dictate that when a woman is married her family must pay " the groom 's in - laws " a large dowry , as we said in the article below .
We meant to say that the dowry goes to the groom 's family .
This has been corrected .

The revelation that Comcast is degrading BitTorrent traffic has spawned many blog posts on how the Comcast incident bolsters the blogger ’s position on net neutrality – whatever that position happens to be .
Here is my contribution to the genre .
Mine is different from all the others because … um … well … because my position on net neutrality is correct , that ’s why .
Let ’s start by looking at Comcast ’s incentives .
Besides being an ISP , Comcast is in the cable TV business .
BitTorrent is an efficient way to deliver video content to large numbers of consumers – which makes BitTorrent a natural competitor to cable TV .
BitTorrent is n’t a major rival yet , but it might plausibly develop into one .
Which means that Comcast has an incentive to degrade BitTorrent ’s performance and reliability , even when BitTorrent is n’t in any way straining Comcast ’s network .
So why is Comcast degrading BitTorrent ?
Comcast wo n’t say .
They wo n’t even admit what they ’re doing , let alone offer a rationale for it , so we ’re left to speculate .
The technical details of Comcast ’s blocking are only partially understood , but what we do know seems hard to square with claims that Comcast is using the most effective means to optimize some resource in their network .
Now pretend that you ’re the net neutrality czar , with authority to punish ISPs for harmful interference with neutrality , and you have to decide whether to punish Comcast .
You ’re suspicious of Comcast , because you can see their incentive to bolster their cable - TV monopoly power , and because their actions do n’t look like a good match for the legitimate network management goals that they claim motivate their behavior .
But networks are complicated , and there are many things you do n’t know about what ’s happening inside Comcast ’s network , so you ca n’t be sure they ’re just trying to undermine BitTorrent .
And of course it ’s possible that they have mixed motives , needing to manage their network but choosing a method that had the extra bonus feature of hurting BitTorrent .
You can ask them to justify their actions , but you can expect to get a lawyerly , self - serving answer , and to expend great effort separating truth from spin in that answer .
Are you confident that you , as net neutrality czar , would make the right decision ?
Are you confident that your successor as net neutrality czar , who would be chosen by the usual political process , would also make the right decision ?
Even without a regulatory czar , wheels are turning to punish Comcast for what they ’ve done .
Customers are unhappy and are putting pressure on Comcast .
If they deceived their customers , they ’ll face lawsuits .
We do n’t know yet how things will come out , but it seems likely Comcast will regret their actions , and especially their lack of transparency .
All of which – surprise surprise – confirms my position on net neutrality : there is a risk of harmful behavior by ISPs , but writing and enforcing neutrality regulation is harder than it looks , and non-regulatory forces may constrain ISPs enough .

Speaking on Fox News Sunday about the latest Osama bin Laden video , White House Homeland Security advisor Frances Fragos Townsend told host Chris Wallace :
“ Remember , the last audiotape was in June of ’06 .
The last video was just before the election in October of ’ 04 .
This is about the best he can do .
This is a man on the run from a cave who is virtually impotent other than these tapes . ”
And in case one thought the “ impotent ” comment might have been a slip made by an administration operative feeling defensive for failing to get the chief perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks , Townsend said it again on CNN Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer .
Townsend :
“ But you know , we ought to remember , six years since the tragedy of September the 11th , we have n’t seen another attack .
This is a man on the run in a cave who is virtually impotent other than his ability to get these messages out .
It ’s propaganda . ”
While the White House effort to reassure rather than frighten people is refreshing , and it understandably feels compelled to make excuses for why it has failed to devote the resources necessary to capture bin Laden , Townsend ’s macho rhetoric seems strikingly ill advised and eerily reminiscent of Bush ’s infamous “ Bring ’em on . ”
More than 3,000 US lives have been lost to the insurgency and civil war in Iraq since his reckless comments .
Let ’s hope Townsend ’s words do n’t come back to haunt her — and us — in a similar fashion .
It 's been a rough week for our ol ' friends at Fox News .
Thanks to some IP - address based research , the political world learned that the FNC was responsible for " touching up " Wikipedia pages , editing content that did n't fit with the partisan network 's political agenda .
Download Download
For example , embarrassing content from Media Matters about FNC personalities was quietly removed .
Criticism of Keith Olbermann and Al Franken was accentuated .
The network that specializes in on - air propaganda had taken its usual schtick to Wiki pages .
With that in mind , it should n't surprise anyone that Fox News ' Chris Wallace -- you guessed it -- sought to undermine Wikipedia 's credibility with a report tonight .
The irony is rich .
Pay particular attention to the references to " self - serving agendas " and businesses desperate to " improve their public image . "
Fox News tried to exploit Wikipedia , and got caught , so naturally it 's time to undermine the source of the network 's embarrassment .
Typical .

As for obesity , it is complicated , Dr. Crandall said .
Fat may insulate the interior from very hot external temperatures , but it also may compromise heat transfer from interior to skin .
Carrying more weight generates more metabolic heat to get rid of .
That means more sweat , but research suggests that large people cannot grow more sweat glands to cope with the extra heat load .
Radiation of heat from skin to air may become especially important in their heat control .
Over all , though , these factors make small difference in sweat rate .
The bigger differences come from activities that may fall short of exercise .
Even brief spurts of walking or leg jiggling generate metabolic heat that turns into sweat , as do anger and frustration .
The sweatiest person on the subway platform is probably the one who just ran for a train and missed it , Dr. Crandall said .
And as for clothing : less is not always better .
In studies during World War II , researchers sat volunteers on wooden boxes in the California desert , some wearing standard olive drab military fatigues , some in light tan summer uniforms , and some “ near naked . ”
The unclothed “ soldiers ” sweated about 30 percent more than the others — an indication of how much heat their unprotected skin was absorbing from the environment .
And so the average urban warrior might be forewarned that near - nudity on hot subway platforms may be counterproductive , as may be vigorous fanning , pacing and gesticulating if the train is late .
What will happen as the planet heats and more is asked of our sweat glands ?
No problem , experts say : the system can easily rev up into a high , efficient gear .
The process is called heat acclimation and is routinely seen in athletes training in hot weather .
At first their internal temperatures climb , they sweat profusely , lose large quantities of salt in their sweat and feel miserable .
But as the days pass they sweat even more , their salt loss diminishes , both skin and internal temperatures drop , and their endurance improves .
Image Mark Sanders wore a sweat suit for testing recently at a Dallas research laboratory .
Credit ... Mark Graham for The New York Times
At least in part , heat acclimation reflects bigger , juicier sweat glands : in monkeys exposed to continuous heat and humidity , individual sweat glands more than doubled in volume after only two months .

This works by executing the module in a scratch namespace , and then patching classes , methods and functions .
This avoids the need to patch instances .
New objects are copied into the target namespace . " " " import imp import sys import types def xreload ( mod ) : " " " Reload a module in place , updating classes , methods and functions .

Blackwater provides security to US diplomatic staff in Baghdad
The company provides security to all US state department employees in Iraq .
It had been ordered by the Iraqi government to halt operations while a joint US - Iraqi inquiry was held .
A US embassy spokeswoman said the decision to allow Blackwater to resume work had been taken in consultation with the Iraqi government .
The spokeswoman , Mirembe Nantongo , said Blackwater operations would be limited to essential missions only outside Baghdad 's heavily - fortified Green Zone .
' Self - defence '
A separate Iraqi interior ministry investigation has found that Blackwater was " 100 % guilty " of the incident in which 11 Iraqi civilians were killed .
BLACKWATER USA FACTS

Anger in Iraq over shooting
Blackwater says its guards acted in self - defence , but this has been disputed by Iraqi eyewitnesses .
The interior ministry report , based on testimony from witnesses , concluded that Blackwater guards in Baghdad 's Nisour Square started shooting after two mortar rounds landed nearby .
" They started shooting randomly from four positions in the square , killing 11 civilians and injuring 12 others , " said interior ministry spokesman Maj Gen Abdul - Karim Khalaf .
" The first one who was killed was a driver who failed to stop and then his wife , " Maj Gen Khalaf said .
The report also calls for the lifting of legal immunity for foreign security companies operating in Iraq .
The US embassy said it would not comment on the Iraqi report while its own investigation is under way .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has described the shooting as a " criminal act " and vowed not to tolerate it .
In an effort to ensure that no Muslim doctors ever again try to bomb Glasgow Airport , bureaucrats at Glasgow ’s public hospitals have decreed that henceforth no staff may eat lunch at their desks or in their offices during the holy month of Ramadan , so that fasting Muslims shall not be offended by the sight or smell of their food .
Vending machines will also disappear from the premises during that period .
Apparently the bureaucrats believe that the would - be bombers were demanding sandwich - free offices in Glasgow hospitals during Ramadan .
This kind of absurdity is what happens when the highly contestable doctrine of multiculturalism becomes a career opportunity for the semi-educated and otherwise unemployable products of a grossly and unnecessarily swollen university system .
Meanwhile , the highest court in Italy was confirming an appeals court ’s acquittal of the father and brother of a Muslim girl , whom they beat and locked up for becoming too Westernized — that is to say , for having a Western friend .
The court ruled that , though they had undoubtedly beaten her and locked her up , this was not because of any culpable ill - feeling toward her .
It was , rather , because of “ her lifestyle , which did not conform to their culture . ”
The sound of a civilization committing suicide can be heard in these stories ; for civilizations collapse not because the barbarians are so strong , but because they themselves are so morally enfeebled .
UPDATE : The hospital boards in Scotland have denied the allegations against them , though they admit advising hospitals to consider avoiding working lunches during Ramadan if Muslims would normally participate in them , and to consider altering the route of lunch trolleys to accommodate “ sensitive colleagues who adhere to the Muslim faith . ”
No hospital board , as far as I am aware , has ever advised that one should not eat pork in front of Jews , or beef in front of Hindus ; the most likely explanation of the difference in the way religious sensibilities are treated by the hospital boards would appear to be fear .
It is characteristic of pusillanimity that it does not recognize itself .
I ’ve earlier performed a little test , comparing two files : one produced with MS Word , the other with OpenOffice.org Writer .
The purpose then was to demonstrate that Word is n’t necessarily such a bad piece of software — it ’s just not always used in a way which is likely to give nice results : most people do n’t change the default settings of Times New Roman / Arial and ragged right margin , and they apply formatting manually for each new element , which is bound to lead to inconsistencies .
Now it ’s time for the next round of tests , this time including another application in the comparison : the “ typesetting environment ” LaTeX .
I will also go more in detail with the points of comparison , not just considering the crude parameters such as font size and page margins , but also taking into account the finer typographical details .
In the former test , I had deliberately turned off hyphenation .
That led to a discussion about various hyphenation algorithms , and this time , I have decided to turn on automatic hyphenation in all three programs , using the default settings .
The contestants
MS Word probably needs no presentation : the omnipresent causer of headaches over lost or corrupted files ; the producer of hoardes of ~ WRL2354 .
TMP files in some hidden system directory ( look in C : \Documents and Settings \ < User Name > \Application Data\MicrosoftOffice if you do n’t believe me ) ; and the single most influential spreader of bad typographical taste in a hundred years , since the previous low point in the late nineteenth century .
OpenOffice.org is the flagship of the open source movement : a free equivalent to Word , which boasts an almost perfect and seamless conversion filter , so that you can edit almost any word file interchangeably in Word and Writer without ever noticing .
Oh yes , and it ’s free , both as in beer — you do n’t pay for it — and as in speech — the source code is open , the file format is open , so you do n’t need a particular program to view its files ( there are at least three word processors which natively use the same file format , and countless others which can read it ) .
Both of the “ W ” programs are so called Word Processors .
Some hold that the use of the same word in “ Word Processor ” and “ Food Processor ” is no coincidence , and anyone who has been met by a screenful of random characters from a ruined Word file will be likely to agree .
They are both parts of huge pieces of software , “ Office Suites ” , with several integrated applications in addition to the word processor : a spreadsheet program , a presentation program , a drawing program , a database application , etc .
The principle is WYSIWYG — “ what you see is what you get ” .
You type a “ b ” , select bold / italic , and that ’s what you see on the screen and on the paper you eventually print out .
LaTeX is a different beast : it is a “ typesetting environment ” rather than a word processor .
First of all , there is no icon on you desktop saying “ LaTeX ” which you can click on to bring up the LaTeX program .
There is no one particular “ LaTeX editor ” — any editor which can open and save plain text files without messing them up by adding Microsoft ’s secret codes at the end , can be used .
Already this is a concept which is foreign to most people who have gotten used to the modern point - and - click way of doing things .
( True story : most of the people I have sent LaTeX files to , have complained that they could not open them .
Here ’s lesson # 1 today : just because Windows does n’t automatically know which program to use , does n’t mean that there is no program to use ) .
Edit : Judging from the many comments I ’ve received about this parenthesis — most of them along the lines of “ What kind of an idiot sends LaTeX files to ordinary people ?!? ” — I think a clarification is in place .
I ’m referring to a handful of occasions when I ’ve needed an author to check some little detail , or a proof - reader to go through a text .
I ’ve sent them the files — accompanied with PDF files — along with instructions to disregard all the \command {this} and \environment {that} rubble .
I do n’t expect them to install some tex variant and process the file , just to be able to open it , since it ’s simply a plain text file .
These are people who think that word files live in Word and that it must be the same way for all other kinds of files too .
In fact , LaTeX is much closer to being a “ Text Processor ” than the other two , it just does the processing much better :
You feed it some raw materials , and out comes , not scrambled eggs , but a whole pie complete with chicken and cheese , pefectly seasoned and baked precisely long enough to give it a nice crispy surface without getting burned .
It fills the outer limits of the area where word processors occupy the middle ground .
The “ raw material ” in this case is text which looks like this :
oindent \lettrine {I}{t is easy} to be seduced by Dylan 's lyrics :
\textit {they} were essential when he was nominated for ` Voice of a
Generation ' , and \textit {they} stuck in the fans ' throats when he converted
It may look cumbersome , and it is , but the reward comes when you process it and print it out .
It then becomes clear why it ’s called a typesetting environment : LaTeX is in fact a tiny little typographer , trained by Gutenberg ( he ’s very old now ) and still upholding the craft with pride .
A Word document may look nice on the screen , but no publisher with any self - respect would ever publish a book directly from a word file .
The document
Layout in Word , Writer , and LaTeX ( pdf file )
For the test , I have used two pages from an upcoming chapter from Things Twice — the book .
I have tried to the best of my ability to use exactly the same layout in all three programs .
In theory , this is just a matter of writing down settings in one place and applying them in the other , but in practice , it is slightly more involved .
In Word , the header and footer are not considered to be part of the page area : if you want the header to start 3 cm down on the page , you will have to indicate a 4 cm upper margin and a 1 cm header , which is a strange way of dealing with the page layout parameters , and one which can cause quite a lot of frustration and trial and error .
But those problems aside , I have used a page area of 12x18 cm , a font size of 11.5/13.2pt ( i.e. 1.7pt leading ) , a three - line drop cap for the first paragraph , and a slightly stylish , book - type of chapter heading .
The font is Adobe ’s Garamond , the most beautiful font in the world .
The pdf file contains the following four versions :
MS Word OOo Writer , produced under Windows .
OOo Writer , produced under Linux .
LaTeX , produced with tetex , under Linux .
So how do our contestants fare ?
At first sight , all the versions seem pretty equal , which should not be surprising , since all the brute settings are the same .
The page number on the front page is a little lower in the Word Processors , but that ’s because of an oversight on my part , not because of intervention from the programs .
But let ’s look a little closer .
Small caps
The first major difference appears in the subtitle .
It is set in small caps .
Small caps are a separate set of characters where the lower - case letters have the same shape as the upper-case , but the same size as ordinary lower - case letters .
Most fonts do n’t contain any small caps .
If they exist for the font in question , they are usually supplied in a separate font file , but neither Word nor Writer can handle them directly .
Instead , they take the capital letters and scale them down .
This may seem like a good idea : why double the work ?
but there are some problems , which the W/W versions show .
There is no fixed proportion between upper - and lower - case letters .
Some fonts have high ascenders ( the long lines in letters like “ k ” , “ l ” or “ M ” ) and a small “ x - height ” ( the height of — you guessed it — a lower - case “ x ” ) ; others may have shorter ascenders and bigger “ x ” s .
But a word - processor has to make some choice , and Word has chosen to let the lower - case small caps be 80 % of the upper - case letters , whereas Writer uses c. 66 % .
Figure 1 : Small caps in Word , Writer , and LaTeX
In this particular font ( Adobe Garamond ) , the ratio between upper - and lower - case small caps is almost exactly the same as in Writer , and one would think that Writer ’s version would therefore look good , but it does n’t .
Why ?
Well , all letters in a font are designed to look good at their correct size , next to their neighbouring characters , but when they lose one third , the lines become way too thin .
They stand out as the only element on the whole page with a different “ colour ” , the typographical term for how the ink is distributed on the page .
It is apparent in the subtitle , but it becomes even more painful in the first couple of words , where the fake small - caps look like starved post - war kids next to the healthy regular letters .
Word ’s solution is slightly better , but it has its own problems .
First , the difference between upper - and lower - case letters is so small it is almost negligible .
And secondly , together with regular text , the lower - case substitutes become much too big .
This may be a minor problem since their function is to stand out from the rest , but the combination “ too tall and yet so skinny ” is forgivable in a teenager but not in a full - grown office application .
Now turn to LaTeX , which uses the characters which are designed specifically as small - caps .
Notice the color : it ’s the same as the rest of the text .
There is a clear difference between upper and lower case , and although the letters are about the same height as Writer ’s “ small - caps ” , they look infinitely much better , because the lines have n’t lost a third of their weight .
Latex : 3 , Word : 2 , Writer : 1
Numerals
While we ’re on the subject of letter shapes : a proper font should contain proper numerals , but most do n’t , at least not in places where simple programs like Word can find them .
The number shapes in the two Word processor files are fine for tables , phone books , and math exams , but they are not designed to be part of a running text .
What you will find in a book like this , is the shapes in the LaTeX version .
This is not because the LaTeX font is different from the one W&W use ( in this respect ; in many other respects it is ) , but because Latex knows where they are and you can order it to use them .
W&W only knows about one set , and uses that .
( In the Writer - Linux version , I have used a version of the font where I have moved the nice typographical characters to the place where tabular ones , which I will never want to use , are usually found . )
Latex : 3 , W&W : 1
Ligatures
But wait : there ’s more .
Some letter combinations are more difficult than others .
The letter “ f ” is particularly troublesome , and therefore , there ’s a long tradition — back to Gutenberg , actually — of making special characters for the combinations “ fi ” “ fl ” and “ ff ” ( and “ ffi ” and “ ffl ” ) — so called ligatures .
Most fonts actually have these , but again , W&W does n’t use them .
This is a consequence of the WYSIWYG paradigm : in order to produce the same output on screen as in the finished file , the word processor will have to change two characters — “ f ” and “ f ” — into one — the “ ff ” ligature — on the fly , and be ready to change that again into the three - character ligature “ ffi ” if the next input is an “ i ” .
With today ’s processing power , this should not be a problem , but when these programs were born , this would have slowed down the process too much , and a 600 - year long tradition of typographical cleanliness was thrown out the window ( example ; left side ) .
Figure 2 : Ligatures in Word ( left ) and LaTeX ( right )
For LaTeX ( right side ) , this is no problem , since the input and the output are two different processes .
With all the visual pollution in today ’s printing world , it may seem a small thing , but once one has gotten used to seeing niceties like the italicized “ ffi ” in “ office ” , one cringes when one sees the crash site that W&W can sometimes produce .
And while we ’re on the topic of crashes : have a look at the last example : italicized “ of ” followed by an upright parenthesis : of ) .
It is almost bound to create a mess .
Word certainly does , with the linux version of Writer close behind .
Strangely , the Windowpeoples version has a better solution , but still with a clash .
Again , LaTeX is the winner , with a clear separation between the characters .
EDIT : It has been suggested to me that MS Office 2007 has the option to enable typographical numerals and the ligatures if the font provides them .
When the article was written , I did n’t have access to the new beast from Microsoft .
Now I have , and if this is in fact featured , I have n’t been able to find out how .
A default document still prints out like in the images above .
“ Badness ” : laying out lines and paragraphs
These are all nice details having to do with how to deal with characters .
But the greatest difference between the two word processors and LaTeX , is in the area of paragraph and line formatting .
Most word processors adjust the inter - word space line by line , by filling up each line as much as possible .
But what if the next line ends with some indivisible , long words ?
In that case , the line - by - line approach becomes doubly bad : the second line will have big holes — bigger than necessary , even — and the contrast between an overstuffed line and a Swiss cheese line is a death - blow to even page colour .
LaTeX takes a different approach .
Instead of fixing the lines , which are just random segments of text , the whole paragraph is considered , and if a problem at the end of the paragraph can be solved by dividing a word differently in the beginning , then that ’s what will happen .
This prevents the problem with one tight line followed by a loose .
There are some examples of this in the example text .
None of them are catastrophic , but at least they illustrate the problem .
In the second paragraph , W&W hyphenate “ atten - tion ” , cramming as much of the word as possible into the first line .
But at the end of the next line , there is the word “ meaningfully ” , which cannot meaningfully be split so that any part of it will fit on the second line , which must end with “ cannot ” , leaving a number of holes in the line .
LaTeX , having looked at the whole paragraph before making a decision , knows this , and divides “ at - tention ” , in order to distribute the extra space more evenly .
The same is the case in the next paragraph , where there would have been room for the whole “ performance ” on the third line , as Word has done , but that again gives holes , which LaTeX avoids by dividing “ perform - ance ” .
Writer has somehow managed to get one more word into the fourth line , but there are lines with holes later on in this long paragraph , and they may have been caused by the zealous space - saving earlier .
In LaTeX jargon , this is called “ badness ” .
If LaTeX comes across a paragraph which it cannot divide in any good way , it will give a warning , in effect saying : “ as the text now stands , this is impossible to make nice .
Do something !
Rewrite ! ” .
This is a tremendous advantage : when one has compiled a document , one gets a list of the places where there are “ badnesses ” , which one can then correct manually .
I have edited books of 3–400 pages , and the ability at a glance to review all the dubious places is a time - saving miracle — on top of the comfort of knowing , when all is corrected , that you ( i.e. LaTeX ) have n’t overlooked anything .
Hyphenation
Hyphenation is a necessary evil : it maintains the flow of the line at the cost of breaking a word in two .
There is also the danger of splitting at wrong places , because hyphenation does not always follow strict rules .
The hyphenation points chosen by the three programs are all ok , as far as I can judge .
Word has followed the American practice of disregarding the original meaning of compound words , giving beauties like “ bi-ography ” in the last paragraph , and also the horrible “ danc-ing ” on the middle of that page .
But both are allowed , so that ’s ok .
LaTeX has been instructed to follow the British English rules , and so we get “ perform - ance ” instead of “ perfor - mance ” on the first page .
The only dubious decision is “ signific -ation ” , which according to Merriam - Webster ( with US rules ) should be “ sig- ni- fi- ca - tion ” and according to Oxford Advanced Learner ’s Dictionary “ sig-nif- ica - tion ” .
So we actually have an error …
The explanation may be that the other “ signific - ” words , “ significant ” and “ signification ” , split after the “ c ” .
Writer follows LaTeX concerning “ signification ” , but other than that has unproblematic decisions .
“ Uncials ” / Drop caps
The first paragraph begins with a drop - cap , an initial covering three lines .
All three programs do it slightly differently .
Writer ’s “ I ” is too big ; it breaks the square of the text area .
Word ’s is better : the top of the “ I ” aligns with the height of the ascenders , which is acceptable .
One thing to keep in mind concerning drop - caps is that the magnification of the letter also means that the space around it grows , and with some letters , this may call for some manual adjustment of the position of the letter , so that it will look right instead of being mathematically right .
An “ O ” will look smaller than it is ; “ A ” and “ W ” have limbs sticking out in various directions , which may trick the eye , and so forth .
In other words : there must be an option to fine - tune the size and position of the initial letter .
Both Writer and Word give you the option to adjust the space between the letter and the rest of the text , but nothing more than that .
LaTeX , on the other hand , lets you configure everything .
In this example , I have increased the size of the “ I ” by a fraction — mainly because I could …
Points and space
I have to confess : I have cheated — on one point .
The ellipsis points at the end of the first paragraph — they did n’t have to end up being separated from the “ cetera ” to which they belong .
I could have inserted a hard space between the word and the dots , but I did n’t , for two reasons .
One is that most people do n’t : either they type word –space–three dots , which the program may or may not replace with the “ ellipsis ” character ( consisting of three dots , but as a single character ) , or they insert the ellipsis character themselves — after a space .
And the result may be as in the W&W versions .
The other reason is to get a chance to illustrate one further point : regardless of how one deals with the ellipsis in the word processors , it will stand out , some way or another .
Use three dots , and they will come too close together .
Separate them with a space , and they will come too far apart .
Use the single - character ellipsis , and things are slightly better , but the three dots are still closer together than the surrounding spaces .
This will only get worse if there are extra holes in the line owing to bad paragraph justification .
The LaTeX dots remedy all these problems , because they neither use a fixed character , nor dot - space - dot - space - dot , but something in - between : single dots , separated by a fixed space , less than a full space .
In this case , I have even adjusted the space to my liking , both between the dots and the distance to the previous word .
The same can be said about the troublesome title of the Hymn of a Generation , ‘ The Times They Are A - Changin ” with the two apostrophes in a row .
It ’s bound to be ugly whichever way one treats it , but one can get decent results .
For the LaTeX version , I have used a 1pt space .
I could have done something similar in the other versions , but I did n’t , again because it ’s not what the default user — or even the advanced user — would do .
I ’ve used a normal space , which is too much .
Verdict
Time to sum up the evidence .
I think I stopped handing out point at some point , but that does n’t matter : I can form a verdict without them .
If the visual output is the decisive criterion , there really is no competition : LaTeX wins on all counts .
Word and Writer follow on a respectful distance : they both fulfill the most basic tasks reasonably well , but fail flat out on others .
Word has a slight edge because of the nicer small caps and the drop - cap , but the difference between Word and Writer are negligible ; and on other points , such as the italicized - f- plus - end - parenthesis , Writer wins , so let ’s call it a tie .
This short example has of course only scratched the surface of what the three applications can do .
Because of the integration with the other elements in the office suits , Word and Writer can handle embedded spreadsheets , drawings and diagrams , and similar effects , and including images is very easy , but once you try to place them where you want them on the page , the result tends to be horrible .
LaTeX is the industry standard for mathematical formulae , places images where they should be , and can do just about anything with a paragraph ( try to make a justified paragraph with the last line centered in Word… ) .
All in all , it is probably fair to say that there are few limits to what you can do in any of the three alternatives if you know them well , but LaTeX always produces the best results .
Another strength of LaTeX lies in the handling of large documents , where the separation of editing and processing can be a lifesaver .
I ’ve had 400 - page documents crash in Words more times than I care to remember , and the final stage of producing such a book is a desert journey on the verge of a nervous breakdown both for the author and the computer .
Not so with LaTeX : no matter how long the text is , since it ’s “ only ” plain text , and all the heavy formatting lies outside of the document , the concrete interaction with the text is always unproblematic .
Behind the scenes , the same paragraph for which I gave the LaTeX code initially , looks like this in Writer :
< text:h text : style - name = " ChapterNumber " text : outline - level= " 1 " >
Chapter 10</ text :h>< text:h text : style-name= " ArticleTitle " text : outline - level = "
3 " >
The Uneven Heart </ text :h>< text : p text : style -name = " ArticleSubtitle " > Bob Dylan the Musician </ text : p>< text : p text : style -name = " Standard " />< text : p text : style - name = " Standard " />< text : p text : style-name= " BodyTextDropCap " > I < text : span text : style - name = " T1 " >t is easy < / text : span > to be seduced by Dylan ’s lyrics : < text : span text : style - name = " T2 " > they </ text : span > were essential when he was nominated for ‘ Voice of a Generation ’ , and < text : span text : style - name = " T2 " > they < / text : span > stuck in the fans ’ throats when he converted to Christianity .
Equally easy is it to question his musical abilities : ‘ He ca n’t sing ’ , ‘he ca n’t play the harmonica ’ , ‘ he only knows three guitar chords ’ , ‘his lyrics are good , but I ca n’t stand the voice ’ .
Et cetera < text : span text : style - name= " T3 " >… et cetera …</ text :span></text:p>
Since the program has to deal with all that , constantly , a long document can become a huge workload .
That said , writing in LaTeX is n’t a bed of roses .
It can be a hassle to get anything other than text into the document ; looking at the extra code all the time is a nuisance ; setting up the basic document properties , which is done with a couple of clicks in W&W , can be a long process with a manual in your lap ; there is ample room for error to sneak into the code ( and it is code ; writing in LaTeX is a kind of programming ) .
For anything but short memos , all this is outweighed by the beauty of the final result .
But this is n’t even the main reason why working with LaTeX is such a thrill .
It has to do with control , with the difference between having a program which invites you do what you want , and one which you must frequenly fight to make it yield to your wishes if you wish anything which goes beyond the defaults .
It is easy to produce good results in Word , but it ’s hard to produce anything that ’s better than good .
In LaTeX , it ’s the other way around : it ’s cumbersome to get even to the default result , but once you ’re there , it ’s great , and from there to the truly magnificent specimens of typography it ’s just a series of small steps .
It ’s not having defaults that ’s the problem with Word — in fact , LaTeX is nothing but a huge set of finely tuned defaults — it ’s the assumption that you are and should be happy with that .
It ’s the difference between empowering you and crippling you .
Using an existing technique in a novel way , Cornell physicist Keith Schwab and colleagues at Cornell and Boston University have made the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) -- which can image individual atoms on a surface -- at least 100 times faster .
The simple adaptation , based on a method of measurement currently used in nano - electronics , could also give STMs significant new capabilities -- including the ability to sense temperatures in spots as small as a single atom , and to detect changes in position as tiny as 0.00000000000001 meters : a distance 30,000 times smaller than the diameter of an atom .
The STM uses quantum tunneling , or the ability of electrons to " tunnel " across a barrier , to detect changes in the distance between a needlelike probe and a conducting surface .
Researchers apply a tiny voltage to the sample and move the probe -- a simple platinum - iridium wire snipped to end in a point just one atom wide -- just a few angstroms ( 10ths of a nanometer ) over the sample 's surface .
By measuring changes in current as electrons tunnel between the sample and the probe , they can reconstruct a map of the surface topology down to the atomic level .
Since its invention in the 1980s , the STM has enabled major discoveries in fields from semiconductor technology to nano - electronics .
But while current can change in a nanosecond , measurements with the STM are painfully slow .
And the limiting factor is not in the signal itself :
It 's in the basic electronics involved in analyzing it .
A theoretical STM could collect data as fast as electrons can tunnel -- at a rate of one gigahertz , or 1 billion cycles per second of bandwidth .
But a typical STM is slowed down by the capacitance , or energy storage , in the cables that make up its readout circuitry -- to about one kilohertz ( 1,000 cycles per second ) or less .
Researchers have tried a variety of complex remedies .
But in the end , said Schwab , an associate professor of physics at Cornell , the solution was surprisingly simple .
By adding an external source of radio frequency ( RF ) waves and sending a wave into the STM through a simple network , the researchers showed that it 's possible to detect the resistance at the tunneling junction -- and hence the distance between the probe and sample surface -- based on the characteristics of the wave that reflects back to the source .
The technique , called reflectometry , uses the standard cables as paths for high - frequency waves , which are n't slowed down by the cables ' capacitance .
" There are six orders of magnitude between the fundamental limit in frequency and where people are operating , " said Schwab .
With the RF adaptation , speeds increase by a factor of between 100 and 1,000 .
" Our hope is that we can produce more or less video images , as opposed to a scan that takes forever . "
The setup also offers potential for atomic resolution thermometry -- precise measurements of temperature at any particular atom on a surface -- and for motion detection so sensitive it could measure movement of a distance 30,000 times smaller than the size of an atom .
" This STM will be used for a lot of good physics experiments , " said Schwab .
" Once you open up this new parameter , all this bandwidth , people will figure out ways to use it .
I firmly believe 10 years from now there will be a lot of RF - STMs around , and people will do all kinds of great experiments with them . "
The finding is described in the Nov. 1 issue of the journal Nature .

Biden : Bush administration flip - flops on perjury sentencing Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 4 , 2007 Print This Email This When President Bush decided this week that longtime vice presidential aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby would not face jail time for perjury , his primary justification was that Libby 's 30 - month sentence was " excessive . "
In commuting Libby 's sentence , Bush directly contradicted an opinion outlined in a friend - of - the - court brief filed last year by his administration arguing that a 33 - month sentence for perjury was " reasonable , " a Democratic presidential candidate said .
" The questions we should all be asking ourselves today are : Why is the President flip - flopping ? " asked Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , pointing out the previous case .
" Why does Scooter Libby get special treatment ? "
In the case , which was decided last month , the Supreme Court upheld the nearly three - year sentence handed down to Victor Rita , a 25 - year military veteran , who was convicted of perjery and obstruction of justice .
The court ruled that prison sentences falling within federal guidelines established in the mid-1980s can be presumed to be reasonable , as the Bush administration advocated in its brief .
Libby 's 30 months fell within the same guidelines , and an appeals court found the sentence to be reasonable and ordered the neoconservative war architect to prison , before Bush 's 11th - hour intervention ensured he would never spend a day behind bars .
The Justice Department brief , written by Solicitor General Paul D. Clement , argued in Rita 's case that because his crimes were " serious " and he " expressed no remorse at sentencing " the defendant could not show his sentence " is outside the range of reasonableness . "
The Supreme Court decision in Rita v. United States only applied to courts ' evaluations of prison sentences .
President Bush is not bound by the same standard of " reasonableness . "
He is free to pardon or commute the sentence of any federal inmate , although he has exercised that power less than any of his predecessors .
Libby was convicted of lying to investigators examining the exposure of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity by members of the Bush administration .
His was the only conviction handed down in the probe .
Bush also cited Libby 's " years of exceptional public service " in justifying his decision to commute the sentence .
Rita was convicted of perjury because of his role in an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , when he spoke to agents about buying gun-parts kits from the target of their investigation , according to a Medill News Service article .
During testimony before a grand jury , he gave answers that were " contrary to his literal actions " and was convicted of perjuy .
In his Supreme Court appeal , Rita 's lawyers argued his sentence was unfair because the appeals court , bound by sentencing guidelines , failed to take into account other aspects of the case , such as Rita 's military service .
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Bush 's commmutation of Libby 's sentence could throw a wrench into federal sentencing decisions nationwide because the sentence was consistent with those often handed down in perjury and obstruction cases .
 On what legal basis could he have reached that result ?  asked Frank O. Bowman III , an authority on federal sentencing who teaches law at the University of Missouri - Columbia , according to the Times .
 There is no legal basis . 
Short version : it was n't a " fake bomb " at all , it was a wearable tech jacket on the body of a friendly young technologist who would have been * way * better off wearing something else to the airport today .
Authorities in Massachussetts who 've been accused of overreacting to tech art misunderstandings before — remember the Mooninite Menace ? — are throwing the book at her .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – –
A 19 year old female M.I.T. student was arrested at gunpoint after entering Boston 's Logan International Airport with what authorities claim was " a fake bomb " strapped to her chest , according to wire reports .
The device is said to have been some kind of computer circuit board with Play - Doh and wires attached , strapped over her black hoodie .
Link to AP report on her arrest .
The young woman is identified as Star Simpson , shown in the image above left , and she is a sophomore from Hawaii .
Here is her MIT website , here 's her homepage , here 's one of her recent projects .
She has a user account on Instructables .
Snip from her vanity site :
In a sentence , I 'm an inventor , artist , engineer , and student , I love to build things and I love crazy ideas .
In a paragraph ; I 'm currently studying computers and how they work at MIT .
I play at a student - run machine shop called MITERS .
Before that , I lived for a long time in Hawaii , while traveling the world and saving the planet from evil villains with my delivered - just - in - time gadgets .
This being Boston , I 'll be interested to learn whether this was a legitimate threat or a misunderstanding / overreaction by authorities , combined with poor fashion judgement on the young lady 's part .
Here 's a happy - fun quote from the AP item :
She 's extremely lucky she followed the instructions or deadly force would have been used , " Pare told The Associated Press .
" And she 's lucky to be in a cell as opposed to the morgue . "
Image of the lovely and talented ( seriously ! )
Ms. Simpson on a better day , with torch and mirror , from this photoset of MIT tinkerers at the MITERS student - run machine shop , shot by George Lange .
Update : Law enforcement spokesperson at press conference being broadcast on CNN right now —
" She said it was a piece of art , and wanted to stand out on career day .
I 'm not sure why she had the Play Doh on her hands .
She could n't explain that ….
there were wires attached to a battery that actually lit up …
I 'm shocked and appalled that somebody would wear such a device to the airport .
We had someone with a submachine gun at the airport go right to the scene . "
Update 2 : Deja duh : Boston Globe referring to this incident as " Logan Hoax Arrest . "
And here 's a photo of that gun .
Update 3 : They 're showing the LED hoodie on CNN right now ( screengrab from a local TV report below ) .
Looks like the " improvised electronic device " consisted of a circuit board and a common battery that caused her sweatshirt , which had painted writing on it , to light up .
Authorities referred to the paint as " putty . "
The hoodie reads " Socket To Me / COURSE VI . "
A BB commenter familiar with MIT stuff says , " Course VI means she majors in Electrical Engineering / Computer Science . "
Sheesh !
Someone needs to not let these hyperintelligent hacker chirren out of the house wearing this kind of stuff when they 're headed to airports in Boston .
{ shakes head} .
Poor thing .
Update 4 : She 's being charged with " posession of a hoax device " ( again with the hoax devices ! ) and disorderly conduct .
But on the plus side , she 's not dead .
Update 5 : BB Discussions moderator Teresa Nielsen Hayden puts it in context .
And the winner of the comment thread is BB reader Rob Cockerham :
I can't believe NBC is promoting Bionic Woman like this .
What a terrible idea .
Update 6 : Christy from Instructables.com
( Simpson is a regular participant on the site ) says :
Star was an intern at Squid Labs this summer , and is an all - around awesome geek who loves to build things .
FYI , friends at MIT say she wears the hoodie on a regular basis - it 's just unfortunate that she had it on while trying to pick a friend up at the airport .
MIT students do n't really do mornings , or worry about what they 're wearing , so I can't imagine she 'd even think about her clothes before heading out to pick up a friend at the airport before 8 am .
When Star gets out we 'll have her do an Instructable on 1 ) how to get arrested at the airport without being shot , and 2 ) how to package your homemade electronics to look purchased .
Maybe BB and Instructables should start handing out some official - looking stickers and plastic covers to make breadboards look more commercial — it will keep our readers away from automatic weapons .
I just put up a forum post on Instructables asking for design suggestions .
If BB readers have any suggestions , just send them over and we 'll print them up asap !
Update 7 : Christy from Instructables.com says ( 1125 am PT ) ,
I talked to Star briefly — she 's out on bail , is just fine , and thinks the whole thing is crazy .
Of course , they 've impounded her sweatshirt , so she 's got to do something else for Career Day .
Update 8 : Bruce Schneier : " Definitely stupid police overreaction .
Refuse to be terrorized , people ! "
And Chris Anderson , who , apart from being Editor in Chief at Wired Magazine is also a total UAV nerd , says :
Sorry to be late chiming in with support for Star , but I can confirm that
she 's a world - class geek and otherwise cool person .
While she was at
SquidLabs this summer , she helped with our UAV testing .
Cracked one of the
imaging problems , too .
Really sorry to see the lapse of judgment that led to
this arrest , but I 'm sure she 's got a glorious career ahead of her
regardless .

Got only $ 20 to put away right now ?
It may not sound like much , but you can use it to buy shares in Ford Motor .
Or Bank of America .
Or Hertz .
And those are just a few of the thousands of options available for cash - strapped investors .
What if you can spare $ 100 -- or $ 1,000 ?
Your options are even broader .
We 're not here to tell you where to invest your money .
We wo n't lay out a handful of stocks on a " buy " list .
But what we can tell you is how you can invest your money -- the mechanics of investing small , large , and medium amounts of cash .
We can even help you choose a broker .
How to invest $ 20
Let 's start with $ 20 .
We 'll assume that you 've already paid off any high - interest debt and that you have some money stashed in a safe place ( like a savings or money market account ) that you can get to quickly in case of an emergency expense .
Now you find yourself with a little extra dough , and you want to begin investing for your future .
Is it even worth it to invest such a pittance ?
Heck yeah it is !
One of the best ways to invest small amounts of money cheaply is through Dividend Reinvestment Plans , commonly known as DRIPs .
With a DRIP , any cash dividends you receive from a company are automatically reinvested in more of that company 's stock .
This means you 're steadily building your position in that company , so your capital gains will increase exponentially over time .
On top of that , DRIPs -- along with their cousins , Direct Stock Purchase Plans ( DSPP ) -- allow you to bypass brokers ( and their commissions ) by purchasing stock directly from the companies or their agents .
Thousands of major corporations offer these types of stock plans -- many of them free , or with fees low enough to make it worthwhile to invest as little as $ 20 or $ 30 at a time .
DRIPs are ideal for those who are starting out with small amounts and want to make frequent purchases ( a powerful investing tactic known as dollar - cost averaging ) .
Once you 're in the plan , you can set up an automatic payment plan , and you do n't even have to buy a full share each time you make a contribution .
DRIPs may be one of the surest , steadiest ways to build wealth over your lifetime ( just make sure you keep good records for tax purposes ) .
For more details on Drips , see " What if I can only invest small amounts of money every month ? "
How to invest a couple of hundred bucks
So you 've weeded out all the nickels from your spare - change jar and have tallied up a few hundred bucks .
Instead of blowing it on snack food and Elvis memorabilia , consider investing it in an index fund .
An index fund that tracks the S&P 500 index , for example , will match your returns to those of an investment that has historically returned about 10 % per year .
Some index funds require an initial investment as low as $ 250 .
This low minimum is usually restricted to individual retirement accounts ( IRAs ) .
After your initial investment , you can add as much money as you like , as frequently as you like , with no additional costs or commissions .
You can purchase index funds directly from mutual fund companies , so there are no commissions to pay to a middleman .
If you have a few hundred dollars to start with , then this is a great , low - cost way to establish an instant , broadly diversified ( 500 companies ! ) stock portfolio .
How to invest $ 500
Once you 're up to $ 500 , your investment options open up a bit more .
You can still buy an index fund , and now you 'll have your pick of fund companies that require higher initial investments .
This freedom will enable you to shop around for a fund with the lowest expense ratio .
You should also seriously consider opening a discount brokerage account .
You 'll want to focus on the account option that best serves your needs ; some accounts require a minimum initial deposit , and some do n't .
That means you can open up an account with whatever investing money you have available and start researching , and perhaps purchasing , individual companies .
( Or , if you 're enamored of index investing , you can easily invest in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( NYSEMKT : SPY ) , a stock - like investment that mimics the performance of the S&P 500 . )
The key here is to keep your costs of investing ( including brokerage fees ) to less than 2 % of the transaction value .
So if you 're planning to add to your position in stocks a few times a month , then a DRIP or an index fund may still be the way to go .
How to invest $ 1,000 - plus
What can you do with a grand ?
Obviously , with $ 1,000 you can open up a discount brokerage account , but consider the rewards if you can scrape up an additional $ 1,000 a year to add to your original investment .
Say you have 30 years until retirement .
If you start with $ 1,000 and invest an additional $ 1,000 each year , and your money earns 10 % annually , then in 30 years you 'll have about $ 200,000 .
Keep at it for another 10 years , and your money will more than double to $ 532,000 .
That seems worth it to us .
And if you have earned income , you can set up a Roth IRA , and you wo n't even pay any taxes on your savings when you withdraw them in retirement .
Again , even at this level , the key is to keep fees from eating up your earnings .
So make sure the costs of investing ( including brokerage commissions , stamps to mail in checks , and books that help you learn to invest ) are less than 2 % of your account 's overall worth .
With small accounts , that can be a challenge , but with such low commissions being offered by discount brokers , it 's definitely doable .
If more proof were needed that the rich are different , it could be found on aSmallWorld.net , an invitation - only social networking site .

Why did the FCC give a failing grade to a controversial Microsoft prototype that sends high - speed Internet signals over unused television airwaves ?
It was broken .
At least , that 's the word from Microsoft .
As we reported earlier today , on July 31 the Federal Communications Commission released an 85 - page report saying that Microsoft's " white space " prototype was unable to detect unused TV spectrum and that it interfered with other wireless devices .
But after discussions with the commission , Redmond is now claiming that the device tested by the FCC was defective .
As if we did n't already know that .
" During meetings with FCC engineers last week , Microsoft determined that the prototype device tested by the Commission was working improperly and an internal component was broken .
This accounted for the FCC 's aberrant test results , " said Jack Krumholtz , Microsoft 's managing director for federal government affairs .
" We remain confident that the unused channels in the television spectrum band can successfully be used without harmful interference to incumbent licensees such as television and wireless microphone services . "
When contacted , the FCC declined to comment - that 's typically way it works with ongoing investigations like this one - but Chairman Kevin Martin is on record as saying the commission hopes to find a way of transmitting Internet service over " white spaces , " portions of television spectrum that go unused by local TV channels .
Just this afternoon , the commission 's office of engineering announced that it plans to discuss the matter with " interested parties " on Thursday .
Microsoft 's prototype is also backed by big - name tech companies like Dell , Google , Intel , and Philips .
( Yes , Microsoft and Google are working together . )
Meanwhile , the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) , the trade association that serves more than 8,300 local radio and television stations , was more than happy to toss us a comment .
Spokesman Dennis Wharton believes that Microsoft 's prototype - broken or not - deserves no airtime .
" The FCC performed rigorous tests on the Microsoft devices , " he said , " and we are confident that its finding that these devices cause interference to television reception is accurate . "
By definition , Redmond 's prototype would use local television spectrum that stations do not use , but the NAB still sees Microsoft as a gun-wielding egocentric : " Nearly a decade ago , broadcasters and government launched the historic public - private partnership that is bringing the next generation of television to American consumers .
Now that the [ digital TV ] transition is near completion , up steps Microsoft and its allies to jeopardize all that has been accomplished .
By continuing to press its self - serving agenda , Microsoft is playing Russian Roulette with America 's access to interference free TV reception . "
As you might have noticed from Google 's efforts to convince the FCC that it should give consumers open access to the 700 - MHz band , the portion of the wireless band no longer used by TV stations who 've made the switch to digital transmission , the big web players hope to establish a means of broadband access that 's outside the control of big telcos like AT&T and Verizon .
If approved by the FCC , mobile devices such as the Microsoft white - space prototype would enable consumers to connect directly to the net - without an OK from wireless carriers .
That 's pretty much what the commission has allowed with a portion of the 700 - MHz band , but white spaces represent a much larger chunk of bandwidth .
Evidently , Microsoft had submitted two white - space prototypes to the FCC for testing : the one that failed the FCC 's test , and a " spare " that was never used .
According to Microsoft , once they got the spare back into their own lab , it worked pretty well - but it seems that certain functions needed a little tweaking .
" Microsoft 's testing of the spare prototype device it had previously submitted to the FCC revealed that in the FCC 's laboratory , the spare device was able to detect digital television signals at the power level that we had stated , " Krumholtz said .
" And with some adjustments , this device detected wireless microphone signals as we had indicated that it would . "
The company also wants it known that one of its partners , Philips , submitted a second white - space prototype and that it worked just fine .
Of course , Microsoft failing a test is bigger news that Philips passing one . ®

According to Jill Simpson 's testimony , in January or February of 2005 , Karl Rove met with the head of Public Integrity at DOJ and got him to assign resources to the Don Siegelman case .
A And so , anyway , he was telling me all of the things that Alice had done as far as having messed up the deal .
And then I -- and that since she had messed it up , he was definitely running , you know what -- I mean -- and then he proceeds to tell me that Bill Canary and Bob Riley had had a conversation with Karl Rove again and that they had this time gone over and seen whoever was the head of the department of -- he called it PIS , which I do n't think that
is the correct acronym , but that 's what he called it .
And I had to say what is that and he said that is the Public Integrity Section . [ snip ] Q Okay .
And who -- when you say they had made a decision , who are you thinking of ?
A Whoever that head of that Public Integrity -- the PIS was as Rob referred to it .
And then whoever -- and Karl Rove . Q
And what -- well , from talking to Rob , this conversation you 're describing for me was in late January , early February 2005 ?
A
That is correct . [ snip ] Q Okay .
And did Rob give you the name of the person at -- I 'm just going to call it Public Integrity -- that he thought he understood Karl Rove had spoken to ?
A No , he said it was the head guy there and he said that that guy had agreed to allocate whatever resources , so evidently the guy had the power to allocate resources , you know .
Q To the Siegelman prosecution ?
A Yes .
And that he 'd allocate all resources necessary .
Set aside the Siegelman case for a second .
If Simpson 's testimony is truthful , it means Karl Rove had significant sway over the Public Integrity Section at DOJ in early 2005 .
The Abramoff investigation was in full swing .
As was the CIA Leak investigation .
Both of which Rove was personally implicated in .
At the time , Noel Hillman was head of PIN .
Hillman stepped down in January 2006 -- just weeks after Abramoff 's guilty plea on January 3 and a time when the White House was increasingly the focus of the Abramoff investigation -- to become a Federal judge .
At the time , the move was viewed with a great deal of suspicion .
The administration said that the appointment was routine and that it would not affect the investigation , but Democrats swiftly questioned the timing of the move and called for a special prosecutor . [ snip ]
The White House , which announced Mr. Bush 's selection of Mr. Hillman for the court in a routine e-mail message on Wednesday that included 15 other nominations to judgeships and federal jobs , dismissed the calls for a special prosecutor .
" It 's nothing but pure politics , " said Scott McClellan , the White House press secretary .
" The Justice Department is holding Mr. Abramoff to account , and the career Justice prosecutors are continuing to fully investigate the matter . "
And of course , from external appearances , the investigation veered away from most Congressmen , not to mention the White House , until Alberto Gonzales lost control of his DOJ this spring .
Simpson 's allegation is tremendously damning with regards to the Siegelman case .
But it is potentially even more damning with regards to a number of other investigations that were floating through PIN at the same time .
Plan to move Guantanamo detainees to Kansas gains support RAW STORY
Published : Monday August 20 , 2007
Print This Email
This A plan to drop Guantanamo detainees smack in the middle of Kansas is drawing broad support from Democrats and civil rights groups .
But not everyone is happy .
" Under the plan , several hundred foreign detainees could be transported from the U.S. detention facility in Cuba , a prison that has evoked worldwide outrage amid allegations of strong - arm interrogation tactics , to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks here , the Department of Defense 's only maximum - security prison on U.S. soil , " the registration - restricted Chicago Tribune reports .
" While many of the detainees have yet to be formally charged , those who could be moved to the military prison , in the center of a small base just outside Kansas City , stand accused of crimes ranging from helping plan the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , to working to establish Al Qaeda networks around the world , " the paper adds .
Local Republican Rep. Sam Graves ( R - MO ) , whose district sits adjacent to the prison , worries detainees could escape .
" The prison holds some of the world 's most dangerous terrorists from around the globe , " Graves told the Tribune .
" They have threatened Americans and in some instances they have killed Americans .
Having terrorists held so close to Americans would pose a significant risk if they were to escape or if the prison were to become a target for other terrorists . "
A civil rights lawyer who defended detainees said moving the prison to Kansas wo n't substantially change their conditions .
" Their daily life would n't change , " New York attorney Joshua Colangelo - Bryan remarked .
" They would still be held in absolute isolation .
The question is if their legal rights would change .
So far , the government has argued that the people in Guantanamo have not a single right in a single court , so simply changing the place they are held without changing their legal opportunities wo n't lead to much difference in their worlds . "
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which defense lawyers will argue detainees should have access to the federal court system .
They are currently classed as " enemy combatants , " a terminology the Bush Administration has applied to keep their cases from US courts , where those held would be granted more rights under US law .
Many of the detainees have been released without charges , and those who 've stood before military tribunals have faced hearsay evidence .

ED #65 : Intel Penryn Will Not Run On The Santa Rosa Platform
Here 's an odd piece of information we obtained on the upcoming 45nm Intel Penryn mobile processors .
According to our source , the Intel Penryn processors ( Core 2 Duo T9000 and T8000 series ) will NOT be able to run on the current Santa Rosa platform , which uses the Mobile Intel GM / PM965 chipset .
Intel 's original roadmap showed that the 45nm Intel Penryn processors will be used in what is known internally as the Santa Rosa refresh - essentially plugging the new 45nm Core 2 processors onto an Intel Mobile GM / PM965 motherboard .
However , our sources says that is not likely to happen for two reasons .
First of all , it is rumoured that the Intel GM / PM965 chipset does not conform to the new VRM ( Voltage Regulator Module ) specifications .
Intel has apparently decided as well that it does not make marketing sense to introduce a Santa Rosa refresh in Q1'08 when the next - generation Cantiga chipset will be released just 3 months later .
However , our source says that ODMs like Dell and HP can still deliver new notebooks based on the 45nm Intel Penryn mobile processors using the current Intel GM / PM965 chipsets .
They just need to make modify the VRM to meet the new specifications .
Intel , on the other hand , will be focusing on the Cantiga chipset which is slated for a Q2'08 launch .
The Cantiga will be the replacement for the current GM / PM965 chipset .
Paired with the 45nm Intel Penryn processors , it will allow notebook manufacturers to deliver a new Intel Centrino platform ( codenamed Montevina ) .

This article was written by Jay M. Pasachoff , Professor of Astronomy at Williams College , and originally appeared in mental_floss magazine .
Galileo may have been threatened with the rack during the Inquisition almost 400 years ago , but — relatively speaking — that was hardly terrifying .
Whether the Earth went around the Sun ( as Copernicus , Galileo and Newton thought ) or vice versa ( in the old model of Ptolemy or Aristotle ) , Galileo 's Universe was still a placid place .
But these days , astronomers are facing threats so bone chilling , they make the rack look like a simple walk on the moon .
Here are some of the things astronomers worry about , and some things you may want to start worrying about , too .
1 ) Asteroid Extinction
Most of us humans think we 're the kings and queens of the Earth , lording over our dominions with our big brains .
But so did the dinosaurs , up until about 65 million years ago when , one day , a small asteroid came their way , colliding with the Earth and creating a cloud of dust across the planet .
From the dust and the cooling temperatures that resulted , thousands of species died .
The dinosaurs joined in this mass extinction , and any day now , we could be in for a mass extinction of our own .
Evidence of future asteroid collisions with Earth can be found by analyzing past collisions like the one that ended the dinosaur age .
So what do we know about that collision so long ago ?
Evidence of the collision began emerging when California scientist Luis Alvarez and his son Walter discovered the element iridium in a layer of segment all around the planet .
The layer was known from radioactive dating to be 65 million years old , and , when coupled with the fact that asteroids are sometimes known to be rich in that metal , the idea of a collision became plausible .
Verification of the theory came when the actual crater created by the asteroid was located in the ocean off the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico .
Known as Chicxulub , the crater is now covered with sediment , but geologists and space mapping have traced out its structure , leading to the discovery of giant rings hundreds of miles across the Earth 's surface .
Based on this evidence , scientists estimated that the asteroid that hit Earth during the dinosaur age may have been about ten kilometers ( about six miles ) across .
And that 's bad news because asteroids or meteorites that size are thought to hit the Earth every 100 million years or so .
Thus , we may be due .
Several space projects are now scanning the skies to detect asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth .
The hope is that if there are any giant , apocalypse - capable asteroids heading for us , they may now be in an orbit around the Sun , and we will have many years advance notice to do something about it .
There are about 1,000 near - Earth asteroids greater than 1 km in diameter ( still a civilization - threatening size ) , and astronomers calculate that there is a one percent chance of a collision with one of them each thousand years .
So it may not be time to get to work on that fallout shelter you designed in the 1940s , but it 's not time to throw out the blueprints , either .
2) Here Comes the Sun " ¦ Seriously This Time
The Sun may seem hot on a summer 's day , but you ai n't seen nothing ' yet .
That 's right : The Sun will get even hotter in the future .
Today , the surface of the Sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius ( about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
The problem is , the Sun is only a middle - aged star right now , and stars ( unlike people ) get hotter with old age .
Scientists determine the intensity of the Sun 's heat by measuring its light in two different ways .
The first is to look at the Sun 's color :
The Sun gives off mostly yellow - green light , with lesser amounts of red light at longer wavelengths and lesser amounts of blue light at shorter wavelengths .
Hotter stars give off even more blue light relative to yellow - green , while cooler stars give off relatively more red light .
The second method is for astronomers to break down the Sun 's light into its color spectrum .
Astronomers use spectrographs to spread the color spectrum out , allowing them to see specific colors that are absent or relatively dark .
These darkened colors tell astronomers the Sun 's temperature .
But what will happen in the future ?
The Sun is now about halfway through its 10 billion - year lifetime .
In a few billion years the outer parts of the Sun will begin to swell , making the Earth hotter .
Eventually , the oceans will boil , making human survival , much less a dip in the sea , impossible .
( Of course , by then we may be able to get onto rockets and go farther out into the solar system or even to neighboring ones . )
After about 5 billion years , the Sun will swell so much that it will become a " red giant , "  with its surface extending beyond where Mercury 's orbit is today .
By then the Earth will be roasted , and nobody will be around to see the Sun give off its outer layers , which is too bad because it will actually be quite beautiful ; the layers will puff away to make a colorful planetary nebula like the famous Ring Nebula .
And nobody will be around on Earth when the remaining core of the Sun shrinks to become a superhot white dwarf .
Actually , even now some parts of the Sun are much hotter than 6,000 degrees .
The Sun 's center is about 15 million degrees , and the Sun 's outer layer — the solar corona that we see at total eclipses — is about 2 million degrees ( 4 million degrees Fahrenheit ) .
But that high temperature merely tells us that the particles ( electrons , protons , etc. ) in the corona are moving around very quickly .
Luckily , however , there are not enough of them to hold a dangerous amount of energy .
3 ) Exploding Stars
Our Sun may broil our home in a few billion years , but there are some other stars that could explode , or implode — to be exact — any day .
At the core of a star , fusion transforms hydrogen into helium and a bit of helium into carbon .
Sounds harmless enough , right ?
Normally , it is .
At the Sun 's core , for example , the pressure from the radiation coming out from the nuclear fusion balances gravity , and all is safe and good .
In a more massive star , however — one with five times the Sun 's mass or more — the inside becomes so hot that the core 's carbon fuses into heavier elements like oxygen and magnesium .
The creation of these heavier elements generates a great deal of energy , and , eventually , the elements turn into iron , when all hell breaks loose .
As fusion continues in the star 's core , iron takes in energy instead of giving off energy .
So once iron accumulates in the core , the energy is sucked out of the center of the star and the star collapses .
Within seconds , the outer layers fall in from millions of miles up , and the star becomes a supernova .
Astronomers believe that a supernova implodes in our galaxy every 100 years or so , but we have n't seen any since the great astronomers Tycho Brahe ( in 1572 ) and Johannes Kepler ( in 1604 ) saw and wrote about them .
This may be because most supernovae are believed to be on the far side of the galaxy , hidden from us by the dust in our galaxy 's center .
The nearest supernova we know of today recently formed in the Large Magellanic Cloud , one of Milky Way 's satellite galaxies that is closer to us on Earth than some parts of our own galaxy .
The supernova exploded in 1987 and reached a brightness sufficient enough to be seen with the naked eye .
It then faded , but , today , the matter ejected from its core is hitting matter ejected long ago , and it appears that the supernova is brightening again .
In fact , we may soon be able to see it without telescopes again .
So far , these supernovae have been safely far away .
But a supernova too close to us — as in anywhere in our part of the galaxy — could wipe us all out with its x-rays , gamma-rays and other particles .
And actually , the possibility is quite realistic .
Many scientists have had their telescopes focused on one object in particular that looks like a massive star , and , over the last 100 years or so , it has brightened and changed substantially .
Maybe it is a supernova on the verge of going off .
Or maybe it has already exploded , its radiation currently en route and capable of reaching us any day now !
4 ) Accelerating Universe
As the astronomer Edwin Hubble figured out in the 1920s , our Universe is constantly expanding .
Back then , Hubble measured changes in the sky by sitting out all night in the cold using a telescope to take photographs with exposures up to eight hours long .
His giant telescope focused its light onto a tiny piece of film that was coating a glass plate .
The light from the sky created a spectrum , which showed all the patterns of colors in the sky and shifts in those colors .
The evidence from his photographs showed him that the farther galaxies had their spectra shifted more , helping him to deduce , in a leap of genius , that the Universe was expanding uniformly .
Since Hubble 's early work , the expansion of the Universe has been a cornerstone of cosmology .
When NASA launched a space telescope in 1990 , they named it after him , since studying cosmology and the expansion of the Universe was a major part of its mission .
Now , NASA has named its successor ( to be launched in 2010 ) after James Webb , who was the Administrator of NASA .
( Whether or not it is a good thing that its naming has moved from scientists to bureaucrats is yet undetermined . )
In the last few years , telescopes have gotten bigger and more powerful .
And , by 1998 , a related phenomenon had been discovered , and it surprised everyone .
It turns out that the most distant galaxies were n't going away at the rate that astronomers had expected .
They were going away even faster , which made them look fainter than expected .
The phenomenon is known as the " accelerating universe . " 
Do you like your future hot and bright , or do you prefer it cold and dark ?
The accelerating Universe theory seems to tell us that the latter is what will happen .
Some had thought the Universe would eventually stop its expansion and start contracting , but it looks now as though the Universe will expand forever , with galaxies just getting farther and farther apart , disappearing from our view .
Eventually , the stars will die and reach their final stages as white dwarfs , neutron stars or black holes .
After 50 billion years or so , the Universe will be just a dying vestige of its current magnificence .
It 's a good thing that all of recorded history — say 5000 years — is only one ten - millionth of the time until 50 billion years have passed .
It will take a trillion times a 50 - year adult lifetime until we reach that distant stage of the Universe , so perhaps we should n't worry so much after all .

■ 平成十九年六月十五日白田秀彰演説記録
前口上
ThinkCに参加した人たちからは評価が高い白田氏の演説だけど、ギレン・ザビの演説級だと僕は思う。たくさんの人が知った方がいいと思うし、もっと評価されていいはずだ。一部で議事録もあがっているようだけど、現場の勢いはあんなものではなかったから僕の記録を公開することにした。それに今回のフォーラムは公開されないと聞いたから。
もしかしたら実際の発言とは多少異なっているかもしれない。そこのところは僕も危ぶんでいる。とはいえ、面白さとか迫力とかだったらある程度までちゃんと再現できてると思う。以下の記録を読んでくれて、白田氏の熱さが伝われば幸い。
演説記録
【第一発目 】
...「制度改正ができるものならやってみろ」ということでしたが...
そんなこと10年前からやってきたんですよ！
博士論文で、著作権制度が産業保護奨励政策としての独占にすぎないことを明らかにした( 1 ) 。
博士論文の内容をくだいて一般向けにした、わかりやすい解説も書いた( 2 ) 。
あちらこちらの講演で語った。
雑誌記事で一般に訴えた 。
オンライン記事でみなに訴えた( 3 ) 。
審議会に出て言いたいことを言ってきた。
ロージナ茶会という組織も作った──茶会はすでに解散してしまいましたが──。
パブリック・コメントも出し た( 4 ) 。
私一人でできることは、ずっとやってきたんだ！
それでも、誰もついてきてくれないから...
いまだに、こんな議論を続けなければならないんじゃないですか。
法律論では、なんにも先に進まないことは、もうわかってますよ。
...この会場の誰が、私を援けてくれるんですか？
誰が、私と一緒に著作権制度の議論に本気で取り組んでくれるんですか？
最近は、茶会のメンバーですら、私の書いた記事にコメントくれなくなった(苦笑。
そこら辺(運営側)の人たちも、最近さりげなーく私の発言を無視するようになった。
それでも、一人でも、一歩でも先に進まなければいけないから、
こうしてここで喋っているんですよ！
【第二発目 】
会場から 「白田の主張は偏ってるんじゃないか」というご指摘がありましたが...
そんなことは百も承知でやってんですよ！
日本の学界の主流である、ドイツやフランスの著作権理論がどんなものかは、よく知っています。
しかし私の博士論文では、イギリスの著作権制度がそれらに先行し、強い影響を与えたことを明らかにしている。私の研究では、産業保護策としての独占の付与が先んじ、その後、著作者の財産権だの、著作者の人格権だのといった主張がくっついてきたことを明らかにしている。
私はその研究に5年かけたんだ。貴重な若い時間を費やしたんだ。
だから、著作権制度が所有権や人格権を本質とするという主張については、賛成できない。さらに言えば、知的所有権のみならず所有権という概念それ自体があやふやであることもまた、岩波から出た論文集の中で指摘している( 5 ) 。
もちろん、こうした考えは学界では異端だろうし、支持者もいないだろうことは知っている。
しかし ... 世間の大勢が、著作権は 「 天才を保護する権利だ」とか「創作者の心情を保護する権利だ」などと言ってるからといって、自分が5年かけて確認したことを、「著作権制度は、本質的に産業保護を目的とした独占にすぎない」という自らの主張を、曲げることは学者としてできない。世間の大勢を慮って自説を曲げることを曲学阿世という。首をくくられても自説を叫ぶのが学者なんじゃないですか？
いいですか ... 社会のほとんどの人が 「著作権は天才の権利だ」と信じて、それを強化拡大しようとする側にいるとき、シーソーは、圧倒的に権利強化の側に重く傾く。そのとき、たとえ100mの空高くはじき飛ばされようと、誰かがシーソーの反対側に立たなければ均衡など維持できないではないですか。
ローレンス・レッシグは、憲法学者でありながら、なぜ著作権制度について問題意識をもち、闘っているのか！
彼の本、『コモンズ』には、こういう一節があった。
──連邦議員が、少数の利益や既得権ではなく、一般的な福利を尊重すると考えることが頭がおかしいのなら、連邦最高裁が、形式的な法律の適用ではなく、われわれの自由や幸福について配慮すると考えることが頭がおかしいのなら、いますぐキチガイを増やさなければならない──
というものだ。したがって、私は百も承知で偏った議論を展開している。それは、それが全体としての均衡を維持するのに必要だと考えているからだ。

跋
連邦最高裁 が 「自由や幸福について配慮すると考えることが頭がおかしい」という部分についてだけど、実際の記述は、『Free Culture』p . 313 にあった。引用すると以下のとおり。
でも、政府の役割が 「バランスを追求する」ことであるべきだというのがバカげていると言うのであれば、わたしはバカの側に分類してほしい。というのも、そうなったらこれがかなり深刻な問題になってきたということだからだ。もし政府がバランスを追求しようとせず、政府が単に最強のロビイストたちの道具でしかないということが誰の目にも明らかになっていて、政府に別の基準を要求するのがバカげていて、政府がウソではなく真実を語るよう求めるという発想がおめでたいのであれば、世界最強の民主主義だったはずのアメリカは、いったいどうなっちゃったというのだ。
政府高官が真実をしゃべると期待するのは頭がおかしいのかもしれない。政府の政策が、強力な利益団体のお手盛り以上の何かだと信じるのは頭がおかしいのかもしれない。歴史を通じてずっとアメリカの伝統であったもの――自由な文化――を守ろうと論じるのは頭がおかしいのかもしれない。
それが頭がおかしいのなら、キチガイをもっと増やさなきゃいけない。それもすぐに。

This is part of the reason that , when someone is interrupted , it takes 25 minutes to cycle back to the original task .
Once their work becomes buried beneath a screenful of interruptions , office workers appear to literally forget what task they were originally pursuing .
We do not like to think we are this flighty : we might expect that if we are , say , busily filling out some forms and are suddenly distracted by a phone call , we would quickly return to finish the job .
But we do n't .
Researchers find that 40 percent of the time , workers wander off in a new direction when an interruption ends , distracted by the technological equivalent of shiny objects .
The central danger of interruptions , Czerwinski realized , is not really the interruption at all .
It is the havoc they wreak with our short - term memory :
What the heck was I just doing ?
When Gloria Mark and Mary Czerwinski , working separately , looked at the desks of the people they were studying , they each noticed the same thing : Post - it notes .
Workers would scrawl hieroglyphic reminders of the tasks they were supposed to be working on ( " Test PB patch DAN's PC -- Waiting for AL , " was one that Mark found ) .
Then they would place them directly in their fields of vision , often in a halo around the edge of their computer screens .
The Post - it notes were , in essence , a jury - rigged memory device , intended to rescue users from those moments of mental wandering .
For Mark and Czerwinski , these piecemeal efforts at coping pointed to ways that our high - tech tools could be engineered to be less distracting .
When Czerwinski walked around the Microsoft campus , she noticed that many people had attached two or three monitors to their computers .
They placed their applications on different screens -- the e-mail far off on the right side , a Web browser on the left and their main work project right in the middle -- so that each application was " glanceable . "
When the ding on their e-mail program went off , they could quickly peek over at their in - boxes to see what had arrived .
The workers swore that this arrangement made them feel calmer .
But did more screen area actually help with cognition ?
To find out , Czerwinski's team conducted another experiment .
The researchers took 15 volunteers , sat each one in front of a regular - size 15 - inch monitor and had them complete a variety of tasks designed to challenge their powers of concentration -- like a Web search , some cutting and pasting and memorizing a seven - digit phone number .
Then the volunteers repeated these same tasks , this time using a computer with a massive 42 - inch screen , as big as a plasma TV .
The results ?
On the bigger screen , people completed the tasks at least 10 percent more quickly -- and some as much as 44 percent more quickly .
They were also more likely to remember the seven - digit number , which showed that the multitasking was clearly less taxing on their brains .
Some of the volunteers were so enthralled with the huge screen that they begged to take it home .
In two decades of research , Czerwinski had never seen a single tweak to a computer system so significantly improve a user 's productivity .
The clearer your screen , she found , the calmer your mind .
So her group began devising tools that maximized screen space by grouping documents and programs together -- making it possible to easily spy them out of the corner of your eye , ensuring that you would never forget them in the fog of your interruptions .
Another experiment created a tiny round window that floats on one side of the screen ; moving dots represent information you need to monitor , like the size of your in - box or an approaching meeting .
It looks precisely like the radar screen in a military cockpit .
In late 2003 , the technology writer Danny O'Brien decided he was fed up with not getting enough done at work .
So he sat down and made a list of 70 of the most " sickeningly overprolific " people he knew , most of whom were software engineers of one kind or another .
O'Brien wrote a questionnaire asking them to explain how , precisely , they managed such awesome output .
Over the next few weeks they e-mailed their replies , and one night O'Brien sat down at his dining - room table to look for clues .
He was hoping that the self - described geeks all shared some common tricks .
He was correct .
But their suggestions were surprisingly low - tech .
None of them used complex technology to manage their to - do lists : no Palm Pilots , no day - planner software .
Instead , they all preferred to find one extremely simple application and shove their entire lives into it .
Some of O'Brien 's correspondents said they opened up a single document in a word - processing program and used it as an extra brain , dumping in everything they needed to remember -- addresses , to - do lists , birthdays -- and then just searched through that file when they needed a piece of information .
Others used e-mail -- mailing themselves a reminder of every task , reasoning that their in - boxes were the one thing they were certain to look at all day long .
Twins normally share either half or all their genes
The journal Nature says the twins are identical on their mother 's side , but share only half their genes on their father 's side .
They are the result of two sperm cells fertilising a single egg , which then divided to form two embryos - and each sperm contributed genes to each child .
Each stage is unlikely , and scientists believe the twins are probably unique .
Whether these things are academic curiosities , or whether we 've overlooked something significant is hard to say
David Bonthron , University of Leeds
These twins were born in the US , but neither their identity or their exact location is being revealed .
Their case is also reported in the journal Human Genetics .
Normally , twins either develop from the same egg which later splits to form identical twins - who share all their genetic material , or from two separate eggs which are fertilised by two separate sperm .
This creates non-identical ( fraternal ) twins - who share on average 50 % of their genetic material .
Sometimes , two sperm can fertilise a single egg , but this is only thought to happen in about 1 % of human conceptions .
Most embryos created this way do not survive .
Hermaphrodite
These twins , who were conceived normally , only came to the attention of scientists because one was born with sexually ambiguous genitalia .
The child was discovered to be a hermaphrodite , and has both ovarian and testicular tissue , while the other child is anatomically male .
But genetic tests show both are " chimeras " , and have some male cells - which have an X and Y chromosome , and female cells - which have two X chromosomes .
The most likely explanation for how they were formed is that two sperm cells - one with an X chromosome and one with a Y chromosome - fused with a single egg .
The twins are now toddlers , and doctors say they are progressing well .
Another case ' unlikely '
Vivienne Souter , a geneticist at the Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix , Arizona who investigated the case , said : " Their similarity is somewhere between identical and fraternal twins .
" It makes me wonder whether the current classification of twins is an oversimplification . "
Charles Boklage , an expert on twinning who works at Eastern Carolina University in Greenville , North Carolina , said : " There 's value in understanding that this can happen , but it 's extremely unlikely that we 'll ever see another case . "
And David Bonthron , a geneticist at the University of Leeds , said : " The number of these cases is very small , but before they were reported , most people would have said this could never happen . "
He added : " Whether these things are academic curiosities , or whether we 've overlooked something significant is hard to say .
" A lot of what we know about fertilisation is deductive , because we can't observe these events in humans . "

In a series of segments on " Your World , " host Neil Cavuto made the case that Hillary Clinton 's proposed healthcare program would result in an economic downturn for the United States , even suggesting that Wall Street 's drop today had less to do with expected rate cuts from the Federal Serve than with Clinton 's proposed plan .
" I do n't buy that 47 million figure , " the conservative commentator said at one point during the broadcast , referring to the number of uninsured Americans , according to Clinton .
" That 's like when I say I lost 10 pounds , and that 's never the case . "

As of last Friday , Wikipedia started using Mono for indexing and searching the Wikipedia , it was tested first on one server and it is now being used on all three servers .
Wikipedia 's search backend uses Mono and dotLucense , the same search backend that is used by Beagle Desktop Search .
Previously , Wikipedia had been using GCJ and Lucene to do the searches but after some tuning , Mono became the new engine .
Mono 1.1.6 which was the originally tested configuration was slow , but version 1.1.7 introduced our simplified IO layer which improved IO performance significantly ( 2 x - 3 x ) and upcoming versions will an extra boost on IO , but most importantly the regular expression library ( which MediaWiki uses ) will also get a performance boost .
Mono : Debian and Ubuntu .
Mono is now on Debian / Unstable .
The details about this adoption are here .
Mark Shuttleworth announced today at his keynote in Guadec that Mono had been integrated into Ubuntu .
He is looking forward to integrate IronPython into the distribution as well .
Usability in Gnome
Calum , I think I mentioned that Sun did usability studies , but I should probably stressed that more .
I was refering mostly to the fact that we sometimes argue about usability , but do not have the data to back it up .
I will be eternally grateful to Sun 's work on Gnome usability testing and of course its code contributions .
But some hailed the move as a way of preventing a crisis without directly involving the government , and said it reduced the so - called moral hazard that comes when the government bails out those who made risky bets , thus encouraging more foolish bets in the future .
In this case , the Treasury encouraged the talks , but neither offered to put up money nor dictated the agreement .
“ I do n’t see this as a bailout , ” said James Paulsen , chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management .
“ There is no public money involved in this .
The government ’s role here is facilitating discussion among private players to take care of this themselves .
If the private players can find a way to help alleviate this , then why should n’t they ? ”
At issue is a borrowing crisis facing a group of institutions known as structured investment vehicles , or SIVs , that were little known even to many on Wall Street until the credit crisis erupted this year .
These vehicles essentially are private banks , albeit ones without the benefits of deposit insurance or the right to borrow from the Federal Reserve .
They lend long term , and borrow short term .
If they cannot borrow money , they are in trouble .
The vehicles , often started by banks like Citigroup , were financed by issuing commercial paper , a form of short - term credit , for 90 percent or more of the value of their securities .
The expectation was that the cushion of 10 percent or less would be enough so that the commercial paper could readily be sold at low interest rates , often to money market funds .
Because commercial paper usually matures within months , not years , it is necessary to sell new commercial paper as the old paper is paid off .
Now , however , it is practically impossible to sell such paper , and the SIVs are faced with the threat of having to sell many of their securities into a market with few buyers .
“ It is in nobody ’s interest to see a disorderly sale of assets by the SIVs , ” said Nazareth Festekjian , a Citigroup managing director who was involved in planning the conduit .
The proposal came about from discussions among the banks and the Treasury Department , in which one idea considered was for the banks to just purchase the commercial paper issued by the SIVs .
But that was rejected by some bankers , a person involved in the talks said , and the conduit idea was developed .
The new conduit will offer to buy many of the securities owned by SIVs , but at a cost to those vehicles .
First they will have to pay a fee for the right to sell anything to the conduit , and part of that fee will be passed on to the banks , increasing their profits .

NY Times op - ed : ' Why the Imus - Coulter disparity ? '
Ron Brynaert
Published : Saturday April 14 , 2007 Print This Email This " Why the Imus - Couter disparity ? " asks Robert Wright , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation who runs the Web site Bloggingheads.tv , in a guest column in Saturday 's New York Times .
A few days after radio host Don Imus was fired by CBS , Wright notes , " There has to be an Imus event every once in a while .
Ethnicity being the volatile thing it is , gratuitously inflammatory remarks have to be discouraged , so bounds of acceptable speech have to be clarified .
Clarity comes when , inevitably , someone oversteps and gets slapped down . "
However , Wright wonders , " Do African - Americans get more protection than Muslim Americans ? "
" In a speech last year before the Conservative Political Action Conference , Coulter used the word ' raghead , ' " Wright continues .
" This is a dual - use slur , applied to both Arabs and Muslims , but she was talking about an Iranian , so presumably she was focusing on the religious dimension ( consistent with her post - 9/11 advice that we ' invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity . ')
The word raghead -- whose only function is to denigrate -- seems as legitimately offensive to Muslims as Imus ' utterance was to blacks .
The difference is that Coulter did n't apologize . "
Compared to the treatment done to Imus , " Brace yourself for the seismic damage done to her career , " Wright continues .
" The leaders of CPAC reassessed their relationship with her and invited her back to speak this year , an occasion she used to trot out the word ' faggot , ' " writes Wright .
" And Coulter continued to be interviewed respectfully on CNN and ( again and again ) on Fox News -- treatment that presumably would n't be accorded a pundit who used the ' n - word ' without apology . "
Wright adds , " Why the Imus - Coulter disparity ?
Maybe part of it is that Coulter is n't as structurally susceptible to sanction as Imus .
She does n't have her own radio or TV show , so advertisers on CNN and Fox have two degrees of separation from bigotry .
Still , there are pressure points big enough for an Al Sharpton to find .
Coulter 's column appears in newspapers with major advertisers . "
Wright includes a " full disclosure " in his column , revealing the " history " between himself and his subject .
" Coulter once cited an Op - Ed essay I wrote for this newspaper about the Danish cartoon controversy as evidence that people like me had ' affection ' for terrorists , " Wright notes .
" Thus ended any claim I might have to evaluate her work objectively .
If you want a subject on which I report and you decide , today 's not your day . "
Wright has " battled " with Slate 's Mickey Kaus a number of times over whether or not Coulter should be " repudiated . "
On one Bloggingheads video , Kaus asked Wright why he was willing to " bend over backwards  rightly  to understand " the world views of terrorists but could n't do the same to " understand where she 's coming from " or her world view .
" Because it 's more baffling and pernicious , just kidding , of course , " Wright responded .
Before Imus was fired by CBS , Coulter weighed in on the affair on Fox News Channel 's Hannity & Colmes .
She said that it was n't that the shock jock used the phrase " nappy headed hos , " but that by picking on the Rutgers University women 's basketball team , he chose the wrong targets .
Coulter referred to the Scarlet Knights , who fell in the NCAA championship game to Tennessee , as " completely innocent and , by the way judging by their press conference yesterday , lovely girls who are not public figures . "
" They 're not trying to have a public platform , " Coulter continued .
" They 're not discussing issues .
They are not fair game . "
Coulter added that Imus " could have called me a ho ; he could have called me a flaxen - haired ho ; he could have called Al Sharpton a nappy - haired ho ; but you can't do that to someone who is not a public figure . "
Last year , Coulter caught fire after blasting the " Jersey Girls "  a group of four women who became activists after losing their husbands in the 9/11 attacks  as " self - obsessed " opportunists and " witches " in her book Godless , but refused to apologize even though her words attracted wide condemnation across the political boundaries .
" No , I wo n't apologize , " Coulter said last year .
" Yes , the 9/11 widows are witches and harpies . "
Excerpts from New York Times op - ed : # I 'm not making a moral argument .
If I were , I would get into homophobia and anti-Semitism and other varieties of bigotry .
This is a pragmatic argument about social cohesion .
By my lights , the two American fault lines most likely to become chasms in the long run are between blacks and whites and between Muslims and non-Muslims .
And if anything , I 'd say that the second fault line is the more treacherous .
America has already done things abroad that are helping to make the " clash of civilizations " thesis a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Let 's not make that kind of mistake at home .

Print This Email This Cable giant Comcast violated the law by broadcasting video news releases without identifying them as sponsored programming , the Federal Communications Commission announced today .
The ruling came in response to a complaint from Free Press and the Center for Media and Democracy , a media watchdog group focusing on VNRs .
" In this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture ( NAL ) , we find that Comcast Corporation ( Comcast ) , which operates an affiliated regional cable network , CN8 , is apparently liable for a forfeiture in the amount of four thousand dollars ( $ 4,000 ) for violating Section 76.1615 of the Commissions rules , " the FCC ruled ( word doc link ) .
The FCC ruling continued , " This rule generally requires cable operators engaged in origination cablecasting to make sponsorship identification announcements when presenting matter in return for money , service , or other valuable consideration .
We find that Comcast cablecast portions of a video news release ( VNR ) produced on behalf of  Nelsons Rescue Sleep  without also airing required sponsorship identification announcements . "
" We 're pleased to see the FCC is finally waking up to the issue of fake news , " said Craig Aaron , communications director of Free Press .
" But the fine levied against Comcast is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg .
Video news releases dressed up as real news were uncovered at more than 100 stations .
We hope the FCC will soon fine those stations and issue clear guidelines to end the epidemic of fake news once and for all . "
Rulings such at these by the FCC have become increasingly less frequent over the past seven years .
At the same time , the use of VNRs has become more wide spread .
General Motors , Intel , Pfizer and Capital One are among the companies who produced VNRs with the help of three PR firms , and " [ m ] ore than one - third of the time , stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety , " according to Free Press .
In April of 2006 , RAW STORY reported on a study by a group that monitors the media which revealed that , over a ten month span , 77 television stations from all across the nation aired video news releases without informing their viewers even once that the reports were actually sponsored content .
STORY AT THIS LINK .
Excerpts from the press release : # Comcast 's CN8 news channel -- which airs in 20 TV markets , including New York , Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. -- was caught by the Center for Media and Democracy airing at least four more VNRs without disclosure .
However , today 's announcement by the FCC contains no mention of those instances -- or the two broadcast stations caught airing the exact same VNR without disclosure .
" The Commission 's action against CN8 is precedent setting .
It rejects the PR industry 's argument that no disclosure is needed if the television station has not received direct payment to air a VNR , " said Diane Farsetta of the Center for Media and Democracy , who conducted the group 's extensive investigation on fake news .
" The Nelson 's Rescue Sleep VNR was remarkable for its shameless product promotion .
But the FCC must require disclosure in all cases when a VNR is used , whether it's for a new product or a government policy .
Viewers have a right to know who 's trying to persuade them . "
# THE ENTIRE PRESS RELEASE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK .
Further excerpts from FCC ruling : # Under Section 503 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the Act , any person who is determined by the Commission to have willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the Act or any rule , regulation , or order issued by the Commission shall be liable to the United States for a monetary forfeiture penalty .
To impose such a forfeiture penalty , the Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability , and the person against whom the notice has been issued must have an opportunity to show , in writing , why no such forfeiture penalty should be imposed .
The Commission will then issue a forfeiture if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has violated the Act or a Commission rule .
We conclude under this standard that Comcast is apparently liable for a forfeiture for its apparent willful violation of Section 76.1615 of the Commission 's rules .
Section 76.1615 ( a ) of the Commissions rules makes clear that when a cable television system operator engages in origination cablecasting , it must identify the sponsor of a material whenever that operator accepts money , service or other valuable consideration to air that material .
The phrase service or other valuable consideration ,  however , does not include service or property furnished without charge or at a nominal charge for use on , or in connection with a broadcast ,  unless such service or property is furnished in consideration for an identification in a broadcast of any person , product , service , trademark or brand name beyond an identification which is reasonably related to the use of such service or property on the broadcast .
Thus , while the proviso to the rule exempts service or property furnished without charge from the duty to announce the sponsor or source of such material , the exception to that proviso reinstates the duty when there is too much focus on a product or brand name in the programming .
CN8s cablecast featuring  Nelsons Rescue Sleep was part of a daily segment on  Art Fennell Reports  focusing on consumer issues .
On September 21 , 2006 , the consumer - issues segment concerned non-prescription sleep aids .
The segment featured only  Nelsons Rescue Sleep ,  a commercial , natural sleep - aid product , and included portions of a VNR produced by D.S. Simon Productions on behalf of  Nelsons Rescue Sleep . 
The VNR material used in this consumer - issues segment contains extensive images and mentions of the product and includes the statement that  If you are one of the estimated 70 million Americans who have trouble sleeping - Rescue Sleep may be what you re looking for .
We do not believe that this type of promotional material , furnished by a product manufacturer , can or should be considered within the scope of the proviso , which is directed to material that contains only fleeting or transient references to products or brand names .
We conclude that even though CN8 received this material at no charge , it falls within the exception specifically set forth in the rule and that a sponsorship announcement was thus required .
We therefore find that Comcast violated Section 76.1615 ( a ) of the Commissions rules by willfully airing the VNR material at issue without proper sponsorship identification .
The Commissions Forfeiture Policy Statement sets a base forfeiture amount of $ 4,000 for sponsorship identification violations .
After considering the record and all of the factors contained in Section 503 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( D ) of the Act , 47 U.S.C. § 503 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( D ) , and the Forfeiture Policy Statement , we believe a $ 4,000 forfeiture is appropriate in this case , which represents the base amount for the cablecast transmitted by CN8 on September 21 , 2006 .
Consider this : there are two rovers crawling around the surface of Mars .
Is n’t it strange that we do n’t have anything similar on the surface of the Moon .
I mean , come on , it ’s so close .
Well , researchers at Carnegie Mellon are working to fix this problem .
They ’ve been tasked by NASA to develop a prototype lunar rover .
One which can travel in the low lunar gravity , and hang on tight when it needs to drill down beneath the lunar soil .
The prototype lunar rover is called “ Scarab ” , and it ’s being built by the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University ’s School of Computer Science .
Even though it ’s being built to test out technologies designed for the surface of the Moon , this little rover will never make the trip .
But its advances will be incorporated into future technologies for real missions .
Traveling around the Moon is going to be hard .
Especially when you ’re searching for water inside the perpetually darkened craters at the lunar southern pole .
You ’ve got regions of perpetual darkness at the lunar poles , where temperatures plunge to hundreds of degrees below zero .
Instead of the traditional solar panels , Scarab will use a radioisotope source to generate energy .
It wo n’t get much power , though , probably less than the amount required to operate a 100 - watt light bulb .
This means that the rover will be operating in nearly complete darkness , relying on low - power , laser - based sensors .
And it wo n’t be fast , crawling forward at only 10 cm / second ( 4 inch / s ) .
To be efficient , the rover must be light , but at the same time , it ’ll need to have enough mass to let it operate as a drilling platform on the lunar surface .
Engineers have calculated tat it needs to weigh at least 250 kg ( 550 pounds ) .
The researchers at Carnegie Mellon have been working on the rover since March , developing the structure and programming its software .
They ’re planning to do a field experiment near the end of the year , where the rover will drive and drill in total darkness .
They ’ve also announced plans to enter the new Google Lunar X - Prize , offering $ 20 million to the first team to land a privately funded robotic rover on the Moon by 2012 .
You can learn more about the rover , and see some videos of it in action at the Lunar Rover Initiative website .

First let me clarify that everything about Hitler was freaky , not just these five facts .
I do n’t want anyone thinking I ’m saying he was otherwise normal .
But these particular facts are far less known in terms of common knowledge , and that ’s why I ’m sharing them with you today .
My current novel is set during WWII Germany and I have spent more time researching the subject than I ’d care to admit .
It became an obsession at one point .
One which finally ebbed a bit , thank God .
In the process I learned a number of bizarre things about Hitler the man – here are the five that I just ca n’t get my head around .
Hitler had only one testicle .
This one is interesting , considering most would say Hitler had fairly large gonads .
Guess it was all just a show to make up for what he was actually missing .
I had a difficult time figuring out how he only came to have 1 and it seems he may have been injured during WWI and had to have it removed .
Seems they amputated his conscience along with it .
Hitler dated , and got down with , his niece .
Yes , it ’s true .
Geli was the daughter of Hitler ’s half - sister .
She was 23 at the time she committed suicide .
Oh , wait .
That might have been murder .
But since the evidence pointed to Hitler , well , no charges were brought .
Private equity funds devoted to investing in the Middle East and North Africa grew to $ 5.2 billion in 2006 , from $ 316 million in 2004 , according to Zawya Private Equity Monitor .
Calpers , the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , among other pension funds , is planning to invest in Carlyle ’s Middle East fund and is also an investor in Ripplewood .
The pension fund opposed Governor Schwarzenegger ’s pledge .
To comply , the fund expects to sell nearly $ 2 billion in investments in 10 companies and has estimated it will cost $ 17 million in transaction fees .
“ We do n’t have political strains , ” said Patricia K. Macht , a spokeswoman for Calpers .
“ We are agnostic where specific investments are made . ”
Some in Washington are not so willing to put politics aside completely .
“ Public pension funds are public and should respond to democratic forces , ” said Representative Brad Sherman , Democrat of California .
While he is “ not for boycotting the entire Middle East , ” he does have concerns about investments in certain countries .
“ Syria would not make me happy , ” Mr. Sherman said .
“ We should be trying to change Saudi behavior . ”
While Syria or Iran may not be reflective of the rest of the Middle East , buyout chiefs still need to sell investors and politicians on the merits of a region that is politically fraught and , in some cases , still better known to some for terrorism than capitalism .
Image David M. Rubenstein , head of the Carlyle Group , defends his firms Middle East fund .
 People see that theres going to be a lot of economic activity here and a lot of value creation ,  he said .

“ I was on the phone with my mother last night and told her I was in Dubai , ” said Mr. Rubenstein , a white - haired 58 - year - old with large tortoise - shell - rim glasses , explaining the challenge he faces .
“ Of course , she asks , ‘ Is it safe ?
There ’s always bombs going off and wars , ’ ” he recounted , rolling his eyes for effect .
“ I told her Dubai is probably a lot safer than Florida . ”
In response to a growing torrent of complaints , state officials and lawmakers have lately begun to push back , if gingerly , against the industry , which they see as overreacting to the hurricane threat in the Northeast .
“ My concern is that this situation is being manipulated by the insurance companies in order for them to get higher rates , ” said State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle , who calls the cancellation of policies in his eastern Long Island district “ more than a problem — it is a crisis . ”
Mr. Dinallo , the commissioner , has focused his attention on the law :
It was a single line in the Liberty Mutual letter sent to the Grays that prompted him to issue his rebuke .
The line noted that one consideration in dropping their policy was that they did not have car insurance with the company .
That , Mr. Dinallo said , is illegal .
Predicating one policy on another , or so - called “ tie - in business , ” is a violation of state insurance law , he said .
Liberty Mutual said the tie - in was a secondary issue , but in response to Mr. Dinallo ’s warning , Liberty Mutual and the largest insurer in the state , Allstate , agreed to stop the practice .
Earlier this year , Richard Blumenthal , the Connecticut attorney general , also challenged insurers ’ tactics , subpoenaing records from nine insurance companies that were requiring homeowners to install storm shutters if they wanted to keep their policies .
“ The insurers are making record profits , ” Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview , “ and the dire predictions of disastrous hurricanes , fortunately , have been very wrong — fortunately for everyone , including the insurers . ”
Meanwhile , heated public hearings were held this year in the Rhode Island General Assembly about the lack of homeowners ’ insurance in coastal areas , which include most of the state .
In Massachusetts , New Jersey and New York , lawmakers and regulators this year proposed requiring all insurance companies doing business in the states to set aside billions of dollars to help defray losses from future catastrophic storms .
At a public hearing of the New York Senate Insurance Committee last Tuesday , Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr. said the retreat of major home insurers had hurt the housing market .
( Home insurance is required by all banks that make home loans . )
The Storm Worm
The Storm worm first appeared at the beginning of the year , hiding in e-mail attachments with the subject line : “ 230 dead as storm batters Europe . ”
Those who opened the attachment became infected , their computers joining an ever - growing botnet .
Although it ’s most commonly called a worm , Storm is really more : a worm , a Trojan horse and a bot all rolled into one .
It ’s also the most successful example we have of a new breed of worm , and I ’ve seen estimates that between 1 million and 50 million computers have been infected worldwide .
Old style worms — Sasser , Slammer , Nimda — were written by hackers looking for fame .
They spread as quickly as possible ( Slammer infected 75,000 computers in 10 minutes ) and garnered a lot of notice in the process .
The onslaught made it easier for security experts to detect the attack , but required a quick response by antivirus companies , sysadmins and users hoping to contain it .
Think of this type of worm as an infectious disease that shows immediate symptoms .
Worms like Storm are written by hackers looking for profit , and they ’re different .
These worms spread more subtly , without making noise .
Symptoms do n’t appear immediately , and an infected computer can sit dormant for a long time .
If it were a disease , it would be more like syphilis , whose symptoms may be mild or disappear altogether , but which will eventually come back years later and eat your brain .
Storm represents the future of malware .
Let ’s look at its behavior :
Storm is patient .
A worm that attacks all the time is much easier to detect ; a worm that attacks and then shuts off for a while hides much more easily .
Storm is designed like an ant colony , with separation of duties .
Only a small fraction of infected hosts spread the worm .
A much smaller fraction are C2 : command - and - control servers .
The rest stand by to receive orders .
By only allowing a small number of hosts to propagate the virus and act as command - and - control servers , Storm is resilient against attack .
Even if those hosts shut down , the network remains largely intact , and other hosts can take over those duties .
Storm does n’t cause any damage , or noticeable performance impact , to the hosts .
Like a parasite , it needs its host to be intact and healthy for its own survival .
This makes it harder to detect , because users and network administrators wo n’t notice any abnormal behavior most of the time .
Rather than having all hosts communicate to a central server or set of servers , Storm uses a peer - to - peer network for C2 .
This makes the Storm botnet much harder to disable .
The most common way to disable a botnet is to shut down the centralized control point .
Storm does n’t have a centralized control point , and thus ca n’t be shut down that way .
This technique has other advantages , too .
Companies that monitor net activity can detect traffic anomalies with a centralized C2 point , but distributed C2 does n’t show up as a spike .
Communications are much harder to detect .
One standard method of tracking root C2 servers is to put an infected host through a memory debugger and figure out where its orders are coming from .
This wo n’t work with Storm :
An infected host may only know about a small fraction of infected hosts — 25 - 30 at a time — and those hosts are an unknown number of hops away from the primary C2 servers .
And even if a C2 node is taken down , the system does n’t suffer .
Like a hydra with many heads , Storm ’s C2 structure is distributed .
Not only are the C2 servers distributed , but they also hide behind a constantly changing DNS technique called “ fast flux . ”
So even if a compromised host is isolated and debugged , and a C2 server identified through the cloud , by that time it may no longer be active .
Storm ’s payload — the code it uses to spread — morphs every 30 minutes or so , making typical AV ( antivirus ) and IDS techniques less effective .
Storm ’s delivery mechanism also changes regularly .
Storm started out as PDF spam , then its programmers started using e-cards and YouTube invites — anything to entice users to click on a phony link .
Storm also started posting blog - comment spam , again trying to trick viewers into clicking infected links .
While these sorts of things are pretty standard worm tactics , it does highlight how Storm is constantly shifting at all levels .
The Storm e-mail also changes all the time , leveraging social engineering techniques .
There are always new subject lines and new enticing text : “ A killer at 11 , he ’s free at 21 and … , ” “ football tracking program ” on NFL opening weekend , and major storm and hurricane warnings .
Storm ’s programmers are very good at preying on human nature .
Last month , Storm began attacking anti-spam sites focused on identifying it — spamhaus.org , 419eater and so on — and the personal website of Joe Stewart , who published an analysis of Storm .
I am reminded of a basic theory of war :
Take out your enemy ’s reconnaissance .
Or a basic theory of urban gangs and some governments :
Make sure others know not to mess with you .
Not that we really have any idea how to mess with Storm .
Storm has been around for almost a year , and the antivirus companies are pretty much powerless to do anything about it .
Inoculating infected machines individually is simply not going to work , and I ca n’t imagine forcing ISPs to quarantine infected hosts .
A quarantine would n’t work in any case : Storm ’s creators could easily design another worm — and we know that users can’t keep themselves from clicking on enticing attachments and links .
Redesigning the Microsoft Windows operating system would work , but that ’s ridiculous to even suggest .
Creating a counterworm would make a great piece of fiction , but it ’s a really bad idea in real life .
We simply do n’t know how to stop Storm , except to find the people controlling it and arrest them .
Unfortunately we have no idea who controls Storm , although there ’s some speculation that they ’re Russian .
The programmers are obviously very skilled , and they ’re continuing to work on their creation .
Oddly enough , Storm is n’t doing much , so far , except gathering strength .
Aside from continuing to infect other Windows machines and attacking particular sites that are attacking it , Storm has only been implicated in some pump - and - dump stock scams .
There are rumors that Storm is leased out to other criminal groups .
Other than that , nothing .
Personally , I ’m worried about what Storm ’s creators are planning for Phase II .

Aircraft Impact Simulation of the WTC tower for Investigation on True Cause of the Total Collapse
１．はじめに
2001年9月の米国同時多発テロは，NY世界貿易センタービルのツインタワー，WTC
1およびWTC 2が人々を飲み込んだまま倒壊するという，建築史上未曾有の悲劇を引き起こした．ツインタワーは双方ともほぼ自由落下速度に近い速度で地上まで完全崩壊しており，その崩壊要因については米国政府調査局のFEMA[1]
やNIST [ 2]が報告書としてまとめている．報告書[1]では，ジェット燃料が広範囲に広がり，これによって生じた火災がコア構造の耐力を衰退させ，結果的に全体崩壊を引き起こしたとしている．報告書[2]では詳細なモデルによる数値解析が行われ，大規模火災が生じなければ，あるいは耐火被覆に被害がなければ崩壊が生じなかった可能性もある，と結論付けている．しかし，果たして火災は建物全体を完全崩壊させてしまうほど広範囲に広がっていたのか，また，そもそも部材の保有耐力が限界に達するほど高温の火災だったのか，など様々な疑問が残っている．さらに不思議なことに，報告書[2]では，詳細な解析が行われているにも関わらず，航空機が衝突した際にタワーに生じる動的な応力変化については一切言及されていない．筆者の研究グループは，ツインタワーの崩壊に対し航空機の衝突そのもの（図1参照）が何らかの影響を与えたのではないかと考え，WTC
1およびWTC 2の全体モデルを構築し，航空機衝突シミュレーションを実施している．観測情報の多いWTC
2の解析を進めるうち，ツインタワーの真の崩壊要因とも考えられるような，新しい見解が出るに至ったのでここに報告する．
ところで ，WTC 1に一機目の航空機が突入した際，ロビー階の窓ガラスが多数割れ，地下駐車場に置いてあった車がいくつも大破したのを皆さんはご存知だろうか（航空機が衝突したのは95階付近だったのに，である…！）．またその際，激しい上下動を感じて椅子から振り落とされた，という証言者が存在する[3]．地上付近で何かしらの爆発が起きたとする目撃証言もあるため，爆薬を使った多段階テロだったのではないかという説，さらには，意図的に爆破解体が行われたのではないかという説[4]にまで発展している．しかし，これらの現象に対して他の説明はできないだろうか．場合によっては，ここで報告することが上記の現象を説明できるかもしれない．
２．数値解析手法
本研究では，大規模骨組構造の構造解析において最小限のコストで計算が可能である，ASI-Gauss法[5,6]を基に独自開発した有限要素解析コードを使用した．ASI-Gauss法は，部材の性状に合わせて有限要素内の数値積分点を順応的にシフトすることで，高精度な塑性崩壊荷重解が得られることが可能な順応型Shifted Integration法（ASI 法）[ 7 ]
をさらに改良した手法である．ASI-Gauss法では，2つの線形チモシェンコはり要素をサブセット要素として考え，そのガウス積分点に相当する位置に応力評価点を配置するように数値積分点をシフトすることで，ASI法に比べ弾性変位解の精度を向上させている．また，積分点のシフトと同時に断面力を解放することで破断を表現し，幾何学的な位置関係に基づいて要素間をギャップ要素で拘束し，接触を表現可能としている．解法の詳細については文献[5,6]などを参照されたい．
３．モデルと解析条件
3.1 モデルの概要
筆者らは，航空機の衝突が及ぼす衝撃力がタワーの構造強度に致命的なダメージを与えたのではないか，と考えた．衝撃力がタワー全体に及ぼす影響を調べるためには，全体モデルを構築する必要がある．そこで，調査報告書[1-3]の情報をもとに，可能な限り忠実に構造部材の選定および配置を行い，タワー全体と航空機を線形チモシェンコはり要素でモデル化した．図2 に，構築したWTC 2およびB767-200ER型航空機のモデル概観を示す．WTC
2モデルは総要素数604780，総節点数435117，航空機モデルは総要素数4322，総節点数2970である．WTC
2モデルについては，柱部材と外周はり部材の性状を層方向へ段階的に変化させ，H
型鋼 ，BOX 鋼，プレート鋼で構成した．図3に示すように，タワービルの断面形状は，外周部が風荷重を受け持ち，内側のコア構造と外周部を連結するダブルトラス材が床荷重を支え，これをコア構造に伝達する構造となっている．タワー全体に設計固定荷重2890
MNと許容積載荷重740 MN
の約40％を自重として作用させ，コア構造と外周構造におよそ6：4の割合[1]で負荷がかかるように設定した．
航空機モデルに用いた部材断面形状は箱型で，材料には超々ジュラルミンを用いた．エンジンについては，その重量を考慮するため密度を増加させた．タワー突入時の姿勢や速度に関しては様々な情報があるが，ここでは報告書[ 1]に基づいて総重量を142.5 t（うち燃料は30 t）とし，モデルの初期位置を機首が東に11.5°，鉛直下方向へ5°，機体軸が35°傾倒した状態とし，速度262 m/s で南面81 階に衝突するものと仮定した．
3.2 解析条件
WTC タワービルの柱の継手は主に板厚34mm のエンドプレート方式で，接合部には4～6
本のボルト接合が施されていた（図4）．この接合部は曲げ，せん断力に対して弱く，その耐力は，柱の曲げ塑性耐力の20％から30％程度である[1]．ダブルトラスなどのはり接合部についても，同様に簡易な接合方式が採られていた．日本の建物では部材と同等の強度が接合部に求められており，その感覚では，WTCはもともと強度的に脆弱であったと言える．現段階では以下のような破断判定式を解析に取り入れ，接合部の脆弱性を表現している[ 6 ] ．
ここで，κ x ，κ ｙ はx，y 軸回りの曲率，ε z は引張り軸ひずみ，κ fx ，κ f ｙ ，ε fz はそれぞれの破断臨界値である．動的加力下の破断臨界値については信頼できるデータが存在しないため，実際の解析では，衝突部の被害状況およびエンジンの動きを観測情報と比較することで，適切と思われる値を設定した．なお，接合部の力学特性を建物の崩壊解析に取り入れることは大変重要であり，実験および理論解析を含め，今後のこの分野の発展が望まれる．
この他，降伏応力に対するひずみ速度の影響をCowper-Symondsの式[8]で考慮し，解析のソルバーには共役傾斜法
( CG 法) ，非線形増分理論 にUpdated Lagrangian Formulation ( ULF ) ，時間積分に はNewmark のβ法 ( 数値減衰を目的にδ=5/6，β=4/9 に設定) を用い，時間増分を0.2 ms とした．HPC ( 1.4GHz Itanium ×2 , 8 GB RAM ) による計算時間は約2ヶ月であった．
４ ．WTC 2の航空機衝突シミュレーション
シミュレーション結果を図5および図6に示す．動画1，動画2をウェブサイト[9]で公開しているので，こちらもご覧いただきたい．左エンジンは内側のコア構造を直撃するため急激に減速するが，右エンジンはコア構造をかすめて北東の角へ貫通した．機体およびエンジンの衝突タイムラインを表1に，右エンジンの速度曲線を図7に，衝突面被害状況を図8に示す．建物を飛び出す瞬間の右エンジンの速度，被害状況ともに観測結果[ 1,2]と良好に一致した．
次に，航空機突入の瞬間における建物内の断面力変化を調べた．コア柱2本について，1階から110階まで10階おきの箇所に作用する軸力の推移を図9に示す．航空機の機首がコア柱に到達する（図の①）までは自重の作用で一定の圧縮軸力が発生しているが，それ以降は，柱の破断に起因する“うねり”が水平および鉛直方向へと伝播する．特に，衝突によって破断した柱（柱番号1001）の衝突階より上の箇所では軸力の作用が瞬時になくなり，ゼロ近辺で小さく振動する．衝突階より下の箇所では，左エンジンがコア構造に接触（図の③）した後に軸力が急速に引張り側に転じ，大振幅で振動を始める．自重による圧縮軸力の大きさを見ても分かるように，この引張り力の大きさは尋常ではない．しかも注目すべき点は，下層階になるほどその絶対値が大きいことである．上層階が切り離されたのみでは，ここまで大規模な除荷は起こらないはずである．またその結果，例えば1001番のコア柱には，60階付近で0.2 sの間に約25 cmもの上下動が生じていた．一体，何が起きたのだろうか．
大きな引張り力と変位が柱に生じた原因を探るため，ダブルトラス接合部の破断箇所が時間を追ってどう推移するか，調査した．結果を図10に示す．時間を追うごとに，81階付近から破断箇所が上階，下階へと伝播している様子が分かる．この伝播速度は，縦波が柱内を伝播する速度とほぼ一致した．衝撃波がタワー内を伝播し，時には屋上階やロビー階で別の柱に反射し，次々とダブルトラス接合部を破壊している状況が伺える．つまり，コア柱にはダブルトラスを介して床荷重がかかっていたが，航空機の衝突で一部のダブルトラスが破壊されたために，応力が再配分され，コア柱に中規模の除荷が生じた．その除荷による変形で他のダブルトラス接合部が破断し，コア柱がさらに除荷された．このようにダブルトラス接合部の破断とコア柱の除荷が連鎖反応的に起こり，数多くのコア柱に，圧縮されていたバネが解放されて跳ね上がるような，いわゆるスプリングバック現象が起きたのではないだろうか．仮にそうだとすると，設計段階で引張り力が作用することを想定していないコア柱の接合部は，どうなるか．想像するに難くはない．恐らく，エンドプレートで接合されていた柱の継手が強大な力で次々と引き裂かれたのではないだろうか．特に下層階になるほどその力は大きく，被害が大きかったに違いない．つまりWTC
2は，航空機が衝突した瞬間，すでにきっかけがあれば簡単に倒壊してしまうような
“ 積み木 ” 状態に達していた可能性があるのである．
５．最後 に
今回の解析で用いた接合部の力学特性には仮定や推論が多く，厳密な取り扱いをしたとは言えない．そこで現在，部材接合部自体の強度と破断臨界値を陽に取り入れた解析を進め，引き続き多角的な視点から航空機衝突の影響を調査している．
ニューヨークには地震がなく，自重と風荷重にのみ耐えられるよう設計されれば良く，WTCタワーは，通常の状態では全く支障のない強度を持っていた．しかし，航空機が突入するという，高層ビルが未だかつて経験したことのない過酷な状況にさらされた瞬間，人類が恐らく今まで想像すらできなかった現象がタワーに起きたのではないか．このような現象の解明を可能とする計算力学の威力に改めて感銘を覚えるとともに，グラウンド・ゼロ（図11）の悲劇が二度と繰り返されることのないよう，祈るのみである．

The web is an amazing educational resource .
The quantity of information available on any given topic is more than most people will ever need , and probably more than they can handle .
This vast amount of information is the web ’s greatest strength , but also creates major usability problems .
If you try to educate yourself online without a clear strategy , you ’ll quickly find yourself frustrated and misinformed .
Effective online education goes beyond finding answers .
It requires you to process numerous information sources , evaluate them based on credibility and relevance , and piece together a mosaic - like picture of the truth .
Everyone does this to some degree , whether they realize it or not .
The following is a strategic framework you can use to make the most of your online self education .
Choose a Subject Wisely
This part seems obvious , but I ’m inclined to believe that most people skip it completely and go straight to Google with the first search that comes to mind .
That solution works if what you need to know is simple and straight forward , but it creates problems if the topic is more complex and the level of education desired is more than skin deep .
Before you jump into the vast ocean of the web , take a few minutes to think about your main objectives :
What do you really want to know ?
How deep an understanding do you need ?
What is the ultimate application of this knowledge ?
By answering these simple questions , you ’ll give yourself a much better grasp of your educational purpose .
This is essential when evaluating sources and making the decision to move on or dig deeper .
It ’s also important to consider if your topic is one that can be effectively studied online .
For example , if the topic is modern and related to technology , chances are there is a wealth of reputable and comprehensive sources online .
On the other hand , if you need to learn about agriculture in the 17th century , you ’ll probably be better off at the public library .
Much of what you find online for historical topics will be incomplete and off - target .
Know your medium , and do n’t expect the web to be a resource for everything .
Learn the Vocabulary
The biggest challenge when getting started with a new subject is learning the vocabulary .
If you start out with little specialized knowledge , you ’ll run into terminology that ’s unfamiliar and confusing .
If you ca n’t understand what you ’re reading , it ’s a waste of time .
Make learning new vocabulary a top priority in the beginning .
One strategy I use is creating a glossary .
When you first start educating yourself on a new subject , make a list of every word or phrase that ’s new or has a specialized meaning you are n’t familiar with .
As you go along , fill in your list of definitions until you can read through a highly specialized article without missing anything .
One tool that ’s great for general vocabulary research is the Firefox Answers.com extension .
Once you have it installed , you can view the definition of any word by holding ALT and clicking on it .
Although this wo n’t help with specialized lingo , it ’s a great time saver when you run into a random word you do n’t know .
Another way to build your subject specific vocabulary is starting off at Wikipedia .
Although it ’s not ideal in terms of depth and reliability , the way key phrases and ideas are linked to their own Wikipedia entry makes it easy to spot the important concepts and learn about them immediately .
This is helpful for developing a solid grasp of the basics .
Start With the Pillar Sites
As you learn vocabulary and build general knowledge , it ’s important to start off in a place that ’s trustworthy and accessible to the general reader .
Instead of doing random searches and wandering from one random site to the next , try finding one or two pillar sites that you can depend on .
The benefit of restricting yourself in the beginning is that it allows you to build a foundation thats consistent and reliable .
Try to find sites that are known authorities , like trusted brands you ’ve used before or academic resources .
If you ca n’t find any , then start with Wikipedia and make sure to checkout the external links at the end of each entry .
If the sites you find have a basics or introductory section , be sure to read it and get a feel for the different subtopics within the main subject .
Once you have a solid foundation in the subject you can start to get a bit more adventurous .
Branch Out Cautiously
This is where it gets interesting .
You know the general concepts and the wheels in your head are really starting to turn .
Now you ’re ready to unleash the search engines .
When a question strikes you , do a search , but be discerning about the results you trust .
Look to see if the authority sites you ’ve used before turn up .
Look at the profile of each site when evaluating information .
Is it a blog , forum , or .edu site ?
How popular does it seem ?
When was the entry posted ?
Are there many comments ?
Questions like these will help you get a handle on how much you can trust information .
If a site looks good , dig deeper .
Browse the archives .
Do a site search .
Be sure to follow links whenever a source is cited because it might lead to the information you need .
Participate in a Community
Eventually you ’ll reach a point where the questions you have are so complicated and specific that you can’t find any decent answers through Google .
You need human help , and the best place to find it is an active community .
This is the real value of online education .
Now only can you read up on a subject , but chances are you can find an active group of people who are willing to answer your questions .
If you ’re reading something on a blog that raises a question , try asking the writer via the comments or ( especially is the post is old ) by email .
The vast majority on bloggers are happy to see someone is actively engaged in their content and will go out their way to help you .
Although this is n’t always possible on busier sites , you still might get some good responses from other readers in the comments .
You should also join the best forum you can find and become an active member .
For many subjects there are dedicated forums with thousands of active users .
Even if you ca n’t find a forum for exactly what you need , general communities like AskMetaFilter provide a great environmet for intelligent discussion .
Apply Your Knowledge
The true test of education is the ability to apply what you ’ve learned .
Once you feel confident that you know enough to instruct others , test yourself with demonstrations .
Start by answering questions on forums and blogs instead of just asking them .
Not only does this force you to clarify what you ’ve learned , it perpetuates the community of education that you benefited from .
If you have a website or blog , write an article .
Try explaining the basics in conversation or applying the ideas to your work .
Use what you ’ve learned to build something .
See what happens and keep experimenting .
Once you get past the basics , it ’s up to you to use the knowledge creatively .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad disavowed a Senate resolution calling for dividing Iraq into federal regions , a move Iraqi leaders condemned Sunday as a violation of Iraq 's sovereignty .
U.S. troops search a woman 's home northeast of Baghdad in Baquba , Iraq , on Sunday .
" As we have said in the past , attempts to partition or divide Iraq by intimidation , force or other means into three separate states would produce extraordinary suffering and bloodshed , " the embassy said in a written statement .
" The United States has made clear our strong opposition to such attempts . "
" Partition is not on the table , " the embassy statement read .
The resolution , which the Senate approved Thursday on a 75 - 23 vote , called for Washington to support " a political settlement among Iraq 's major factions based upon the provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions . "
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told CNN the resolution has caused " a great deal of confusion " in Baghdad .
And Iraqi political parties representing a majority of the country 's parliament blasted the proposal as " a threat to Iraq sovereignty and unity . "
The constitution Iraqi voters approved in 2005 calls for the creation of federal regions similar to the Kurdish territory in the country 's north .
But Iraq 's parliament has so far failed to enact legislation that would set up those districts , and the nonbinding resolution American lawmakers approved urged the Bush administration to step up that process .
The " fundamental " principle of the resolution is that Iraq will not be " governed from the center anytime soon , " said Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden on Thursday .
" And I am not prepared for my son and his generation to continue to shed their blood in an effort to do that . "
Biden is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democratic presidential candidate .
He has long advocated the division of Iraq into Sunni Arab , Shiite Arab and Kurdish territories that would be loyal to a central government in Baghdad .
His resolution was co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas , a Republican presidential hopeful .
" This is not a perfect solution by any means , " Brownback said .
" As an American , I look at it as a sub - par solution altogether , because I think they would be much better off if they could get along and form one country and operate it as one country . "
But that scenario , Brownback said , " does not reflect the realities on the ground . "
Zebari told CNN's " Late Edition " that the resolution " has created a backlash , but it needs to be explained more . "
" I think the resolution is in line with what the constitution -- the Iraqi Constitution -- has called for to establish a federal democratic Iraq in the future , " he said .
" No Iraqi is for dividing their country or for splitting it into three weak states , unable to survive , " he added .
The Shiite Muslim United Iraqi Alliance , the largest bloc in Iraq 's parliament , condemned regionalizing the nation .
Other parties against the move include the Sadr Bloc , led by anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr ; and the Iraqi Accord Front , the largest Sunni party .
" We call the Arab League to condemn the resolution , and we call [ on ] all Iraqis to demonstrate against the resolution , " the parties ' statement read .
Nassar al - Rubaie , a lawmaker from al - Sadr 's party , suggested parliament adopt the U.S. plan .
But , he added , " It will not be applied until the last American soldier leaves Iraq . "
But the U.S. Embassy said the Bush administration 's " firm policy " is to support " a stable , secure , and unified Iraq . "
Monthly death toll drops
The U.S. monthly death toll in Iraq has dropped to its lowest level in more than a year , although the figure is " still too high , " the military said Sunday .
September 's preliminary death toll is at least 62 , according to military reports , the lowest number since August 2006 when 65 American troops were killed in the war .
Military spokesman Rear Adm .
Mark
Fox said the lower toll resulted from a " combination of a number of factors " put in place by this year 's increase in U.S. forces in Iraq .
However , said Fox , there 's no feeling among the military that " we 've accomplished what we 're going to accomplish here .
We still have a lot of hard work to do . "
He said " casualty figures are still too high " and as a result , the military is " not in any way resting on any laurels " because " violence levels in Iraq are too high . "
The figures were supplied by the U.S. military in a September 30 news release .
As for Iraqi civilian deaths , authorities reported 296 bodies found dumped in Baghdad this month -- the lowest monthly total this year .
In August , there were 428 bodies found .
Authorities believe the dumped bodies are most often a result of fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims .
The U.S. troop increase was in part designed to reduce such sectarian violence , officials said .
Attacks across Iraq have dropped " to their lowest levels " since February 2006 when the bombing of Samarra 's Askariya Mosque sparked a national wave of fighting between followers of the two sects , according to Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno , commander of the Multi-National Corps .
The mosque , also known as the Golden Dome , is considered by Shiites as one of the sect 's holiest sites .
The attack caused the top of the mosque 's dome to collapse .
During the past year , civilian casualties in Baghdad dropped from an average of 32 per day to 12 , Odierno said on September 20 .
He said violence is down 50 percent in the capital but did not elaborate on how that figure was determined .

The princess had just graduated to a size seven when everything went to hell .
We headed for our favorite department store , ready to take that leap into the world of 716 .
Bye - bye , 46X , I thought to myself with a tug of sadness .
My baby was growing up .
And apparently into a prostitute .
" Where are the sevens ? " I asked the sixty - something clerk who wore her glasses on a chain just like me .
" You 're standing in 'em , " she said .
Oh no , I thought , looking around .
Oh no , no , no , no , no , no .
" There must be some mistake , " I said .
" These are , well , slutty - looking .
I 'm talking about clothes for a little girl in first grade . "
" That 's all we 've got . "
" But these look like things a hooker would wear ! "
She smiled sadly .
" You have no idea how many times I hear that every day .
Okay , breathe .
This is just some weird marketing experiment .
Right ?
I went into my second - favorite department store and was invited to peruse the awfulness that is Tweenland !
A better name would be Lil Skanks !
Sequins , fringe , neon glitter tank tops with big red lips on them , fishnet sleeves , scary dragon faces lunging from off - the - shoulder T - shirts .
Whither the adorable seersucker ?
The pastel floral short sets ?
The soft cotton dresses in little - girl colors like lavender , pale pink , periwinkle blue ?
This stuff practically screamed SYRINGE SOLD SEPARATELY .
I get it .
Now that my kid is practically of childbearing age ( is six the new seventeen ? )
I must choose from ripped - on - purpose jeans and T - shirts that scream things like GIRLS RULE AND BOYS DROOL !
where an embroidered flower with a buzzing bee should be .
When did this happen ?
Who decided that my six - year - old should dress like a Vegas showgirl ?
And one with an abundance of anger issues at that ?
And why are parents buying this junk fashioned from cheesy fabrics that surely leave your dryer 's lint filter full of glitter and fuzzy sequined balls ?
I hope you wo n't take this the wrong way  you , the mom on the cell phone flipping your check card to your kid so she can buy the jeans that say SPANK ME on them  but you 're going down , witch .
No , really .
I 'm taking you out , putting you on notice , slapping some sense into your sorry ass .
Just for old times ' sake , I wandered through the 4 - 6X section .
It was just an arm 's length away , but it was the difference between a Happy Meal at the playground and bulimia at the bar .
So far , these clothes had been left mercifully untouched by the wand of the skank fairy , whom I envision as looking a lot like Tara Reid .
Instead of being able to buy pretty things for my daughter , sweet somethings in ice cream colors , I must now shop at big , boxy unisex stores where you can still buy shorts that do n't say DELICIOUS on the bottom or T - shirts that are plain instead of , swear to God , a size 7 belly shirt with MADE YA LOOK on the front .
Look at what ?
There 's not supposed to be anything to look at on a seven - year - old .
Because they 're children .
Sweet Jesus , what I 'd do for a lousy ladybug collar on a smocked dress .
Instead , this season 's Easter look consisted of sequined and chiffon body - hugging sheaths .
I know that my daughter and I will fight about clothes in a few years , perhaps horribly , but , for now , there will be none of this Little Ladies of the Night look .
And while moms and daughters have always fought over clothes ( let 's face it , even Marcia Brady wore some shockingly short dresses , and those baby - doll pj's in front of stepbrother Greg were icky ) , the clothing wars were usually taking place between mom and teen , not mom and first - grader .
When you see a size 7 shirt that says SEXY !
or a mom and her little girl strolling through the mall in matching shorts with JUICY scrawled across the butt , you have to wonder what the hell is going on .
The saddest part about all this is that if you dress like you 're a twenty - two - year - old going out to a club after a tough day at work in the city , you do n't get to enjoy being a little kid .
Deliver me from an outraged third - grader who thinks she 's entitled to the entire line at Abercrombie & Fitch .
Put on a normal pair of jeans and go play kickball , you brat !
And tell yo mama I said so .
If you examine the offerings in the 7 - 16 department , you 'll quickly discover that it's no different from the stuff in the juniors ' department and beyond .
There is no distinction between a kid in second grade and one in twelfth grade and a college grad who 's started her first real job .
Never mind how essentially stupid a little fifty - pound kid looks wearing an off - the - shoulder top with FOOL FOR LOVE in glitter letters .
Hell , some of these kids can't even read cursive writing and they 're wearing this junk .
They adore it because it's what Gwen or Avril or Ashlee is wearing .
But you 're not on stage , I want to scream .
You 're on the monkey bars !
The big difference between my childhood and my daughter 's is that these days , the kid gets the final say .
What 's up with that ?
I can promise you that if I was eight years old and told my parents I needed eighty - dollars for sparkly jeans to rest on my hip bones and a midriff top that read TOO RICH FOR YOU , they'd have thought I had fallen off my bike and my brain had spilled out my ears .
If you want to get at the heart of the problem , which is the parents , of course , you need look no further than those " nanny to the rescue " shows on TV .
It 's the oddest thing :
In almost every show , the moms are spilling out of too - tight tank tops and Daisy Dukes .
They look like teenagers , and the kids run all over them .
When the sturdy , bespectacled Supernanny shows up at the jam - stained front door , it 's clear that a new sheriff is in town .
The kids see her as someone that they should probably listen to .
Hmmm .
Wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that she 's not wearing a tank that says SWEET THANG .
She means business , while Mama 's over there cowering in the kitchen corner , all hair extensions and implants talking ' bout " I can't do a thing with these young ' uns . "
These children should be thanking the TV gods that they did n't dispatch a tough - talking Southern bubba instead of the Supernanny .
Bubba does n't care about any Dr. Phil-ish reasons for misbehavior .
He 'd just arrange for " a date with Mr. Hickory Stick " and a dessert of Dial soap while saying things like , " I 'll learn you some respect , lil tater . "
Okay , that 's going too far , but you get the idea .
I always preferred the count - to - three method of discipline .
It was astonishingly effective .
You want to take back parental power ?
Try saying " Onnnne , " then " Twooooo . "
I never made it to " Threeeee , " because my preschooler shaped up , for which I am eternally grateful , because , let 's face it , if I ever got to three , I had nothing .
Nada .
Zip .
If you ask me , the Supernanny should put the parents , not the kids , in the naughty room and not let them out until Mom promises to buy some clothes that fit and Dad can stop being such a wimp .
( " Brandon calls his Mama names , and I just wanna cry ! " )
Grow a spine , you freak .
It 's time to " man up " !
They 're kids , not short grown - ups .
Remember ?

Mr. Craig had his defenders , including Republican Senators Michael D. Crapo , also of Idaho , and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , both of whom said Mr. Craig was within his rights to remain and try to clear his name .
“ Senator Craig is entitled to make his decision and I respect it , ” Mr. Specter said .
“ Disorderly conduct is not moral turpitude , and it is no basis for leaving the Senate . ”
Mr. Crapo , a friend and ally on state issues , said he strongly supported Mr. Craig .
“ I look forward to working with him in the Senate as he resolves his legal battles , ” Mr. Crapo said .
If Mr. Craig sticks to his plan , he could be unseated before his term expires only if he was expelled by his fellow senators .
Expulsion requires a two - thirds majority and has been used to remove just 15 senators since 1789 , according to the Senate Web site .
Fourteen of the 15 were expelled because they were sympathetic to the Confederacy during the Civil War .
After the news of Mr. Craig ’s plea was first disclosed on Aug. 27 , Senate Republicans leaned heavily on Mr. Craig to leave , concluding that his acknowledged offense disqualified him from remaining .
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , called it unforgivable and the party ousted Mr. Craig , a popular lawmaker at home before this episode , from his committee leadership slots .
Republicans were also eager to quickly dispose of a scandal in light of the acknowledgment by Senator David Vitter of Louisiana that he had been involved with an escort service under police investigation for prostitution , and the problems of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , the longest - serving Republican senator in history , who is under investigation in a federal corruption inquiry .
Mr. Craig announced on Sept. 1 that he intended to resign at the end of the month , touching off speculation about his successor .
On Thursday , Gov. C. L. Otter of Idaho let it be known that he had settled on a replacement if Mr. Craig stepped aside , but did not say who that would be .
President Bush and any of his aides that advocated or participated in torture will be the targets of legal action even after they leave office , President Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , New York , said .
“ After Bush is out of office , the Center ( CCR ) will pursue Bush and Cheney .
We are not going to let go of these people , ” said Ratner , whose organization coordinates the work of more than 600 lawyers nationally involved in defending the rights of prisoners held by the U.S. at Guantanamo , many of whom say they have been tortured .
The non-profit CCR is the leading civil rights litigating and advocacy organization in the nation .
“ We think ( those responsible for ) this systemic program of torture ( conducted by ) this country have got to be made accountable whether it takes us one year or five years or ten years .
And ( we ’re going ) to go after the key architects of this torture program and make it particularly hot for them , particularly to travel to Europe , ” Ratner said .
Ratner said former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and the authors of the so - called “ torture memos ” written by the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department could be targets .
“ What you ca n’t do as a lawyer is to advise people to find ways to escape criminality and violate the laws , ” Ratner said .
“ There ’s no issue to me .
These lawyers are deep deep into what we consider the torture conspiracy , ” Ratner said .
He also said Vice President Cheney is considered to be “ the architect of a lot of the torture programs ” and “ there ’s a lot of evidence George Bush had to sign off on executive orders that approved essentially the torture program , ( and ) extraordinary rendition . ”
“ We believe there is clear evidence the Bush administration went off the pages of law and implemented a torture program which essentially violated the Geneva Convention against torture and its own ( U.S. ) laws whether at Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib ( Iraq ) or Pakistan , ” Ratner told Dean Lawrence Velvel of Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , host of the program , “ What The Media Does n’t Tell You , ” aired globally over the World Radio Network .
Ratner said as long as the Justice Department was headed by Attorney General Gonzales and the military was headed by Donald Rumsfeld , both of whom were complicit in torture , CCR felt it had a better chance of success of initiating legal action in Germany and France based on the legal concept of “ universal jurisdiction . ”
This enables countries to prosecute those , such as pirates , thought to be guilty of heinous crimes , no matter where they committed their crimes or where they are arrested .
Ratner noted “ Rumsfeld was actually forced to flee France before we could get an arrest warrant served on him . ”
“ Aggressive war , ” Ratner said , “ is the penultimate crime because it is the crime from which all the other crimes such as mass killing or genocide flow .
“ He indicated this is the case in Iraq and termed the war “ clearly a violation of norms under the UN Charter . ”
Ratner went on to say one of the reasons Attorney General nominee Mukasey evaded giving senators his view on waterboarding during his confirmation hearing was that if he did so “ it would set up people in the CIA for prosecution ” under the Anti-Torture statute .
Both the Soviet Union under Stalin and the present Chinese communist regime resorted to waterboarding , Ratner noted , “ and we prosecuted WWII Japanese who used waterboarding against Filipino resistance fighters .
It ’s amazing to me we ’re having a debate on this in this country . ”
We have seen reports in the past where a single victim was attacked by multiple source IP addresses in an ssh bruteforce attempt but usually it has been a single or at most a few source IP addresses .
Today we had 4 separate reports of an increase in ssh bruteforce attacks .
Two of those reports stated that they were seeing lots of source hosts against a single victim .
The isc.sans.org port 22 graph supports this as there has been a large increase in the source hosts seen in ssh scans during this month .
If you can verify that this is a distributed , coordinated attack as some of us suspect that would be helpful .
The type of coordination I would expect in this case is different systems using different account / password pairs .
“ Almost every hour logcheck is emailing me about failed SSH logins .
In the past the failed logins usually came from just one host at a time .
fail2 ban on my server would take care of this and I would n't worry .
But now I 'm seeing multiple servers all trying within minutes of each other and they 'll only try a few times so fail2 ban is n't working very effectively .
It only appears to be for user " root " and " mysql " . ” ( David )
“ We 're seeing unusually high inbound SSH scanning across our networks .
The activity showed up on our radar 10 / 21 around 18:30 CDT ( 23:30 GMT ) .
Some of the reverse lookups on scanning hosts suggest that these systems are compromised themselves ( e.g. nagios.blah.tld or mail.blah.tld ) ; many reverse lookups do not suggest this ...
At first blush , it appears that the majority of these remote scanners are in Europe or Eastern Europe . ” ( Bert )
“ I see 2 or three ssh attempts in a day , and
suddenly I 'm seeing one about every 3 minutes start almost an hour ago .
( reported around 6 am MDT ) .
Anyone else seeing this stuff ?
Thanks .
“ ( James )
UPDATE Coordination appears to be verified :
" What was more interesting than the distributed of the scans was that each host appeared to scan a different part of the dictionary .
Normally we give them 11 tries and then iptables locks them out .
When I looked at last week 's log summary I was surprised to find several groups of 11 login name attempts which clearly began in different parts of the alphabet .
This looks like an attempt to bypass the limited number of probes from any one host which most good firewall programs impose . "

I searched for a blocklist that was specific to ssh bruteforce attempts and found this one : http://danger.rulez.sk/projects/bruteforceblocker/blist.php
I am not recommending this black list as I just learned about it and for most of us it would probably be easier to just allow ssh access from the CIDR blocks we expect .
Sumqayit in Azerbaijan gained the dubious distinction this week of being added to Blacksmith Institute 's top 10 list of the world 's most polluted sites .
Yet another heir to the toxic legacy of Soviet industry , the city of 275,000 souls bears heavy metal , oil and chemical contamination from its days as a center of chemical production .
As a result , local Azeris suffer cancer rates 22 to 51 percent higher than their countrymen and their children suffer from a host of genetic defects ranging from mental retardation to bone diseases .
" As much as 120,000 tons of harmful emissions were released on an annual basis , including mercury , " says Richard Fuller , founder of Blacksmith , an environmental health organization based in New York City .
" There are huge untreated dumps of industrial sludge . "
Fuller says the list includes " places that are highly polluted in the developing world , where children are dying in droves or living with chronic disease … areas of desolation and disgust at what man has wrought . "
Joining Sumqayit as the worst polluted :
Chernobyl , Ukraine —
The fallout from the world 's worst nuclear power accident continues to accumulate , affecting as many as 5.5 million people and leading to a sharp rise in thyroid cancer .
The incident has also blighted the economic prospects of surrounding areas and nations .
" Belarus is very agricultural , " says Stephan Robinson , a director at Green Cross Switzerland , an environmental group that collaborated on the report .
" Through Chernobyl , they lost access to world markets for their produce . "
Dzerzinsk , Russia —
A center of Cold War chemical manufacturing , the city 's 300,000 residents have one of the lowest life expectancies in the world thanks to waste injected directly into the ground .
" Average life expectancy is roughly 45 years , " Robinson says .
" Fifteen to 20 years less than the Russian average and about half a Westerner 's . "
Kabwe , Zambia —
The second largest city in this southern African country was home to one of the world 's largest lead smelters until 1987 .
As a result , the entire city is contaminated with the heavy metal , which can cause brain and nerve damage in children and fetuses .
" Measurements of children 's blood levels of lead average over 50 micrograms per deciliter and some were over 100 , " Fuller says .
" For every 10 points above 10 micrograms per deciliter [ ( the U.S. Centers for Disease Control standard for treatment ) ] that your blood level goes up , your IQ drops . "
La Oroya , Peru —
Although this is one of the smallest communities on the list ( population 35,000 ) it is also one of the most heavily polluted due to lead , copper and zinc mining by U.S. - based Doe Run mining company .
Linfen , China — a city in the heart of China 's coal region in Shanxi Province , its three million inhabitants choke on dust and drink arsenic that leaches from the fossil fuel .
In addition , " it is difficult to see , " Robinson says , " the air is heavily polluted . "
Norilsk , Russia —
This city above the Arctic Circle contains the world 's largest metal smelting complex and , therefore , some of the world 's worst smog .
" There is so much pollution going into the air from this place that there is no living piece of grass or shrub within 30 kilometers of the city , " Fuller says .
" Contamination [ with heavy metals ] has been found as much as 60 kilometers away . "
Sukinda , India —
Home to one of the world 's largest chromite mines — used to make steel stainless , among other things — and 2.6 million people , the waters of this valley contain carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds courtesy of 30 million tons of waste rock lining the Brahmani River .
" Hexavalent chromium is very toxic and very mobile , " notes David Hanrahan , Blacksmith 's London - based director of global programs .
Tianying , China —
The center of Chinese lead production , this town of 160,000 qualifies as one of the eight most polluted areas in the country , according to the Chinese government .
Lead concentrations in the air and soil are 8.5 to 10 times above national health standards and lead dusts local crops at levels 24 times higher than such health standards .
Vapi , India —
This town at the end of India 's industrial belt in the state of Gujarat houses the dumped remnant waste of more than 1,000 manufacturers , including petrochemicals , pesticides , pharmaceuticals and other chemicals .
" The companies treat wastewater and get most of the muck out , " Hanrahan says .
" But there 's nowhere to put the muck , so it ends up getting dumped . "
Blacksmith Institute compiled the list , which extends to 20 more sites in the " Dirty 30 , " by comparing the toxicity of the contamination , the likelihood of it getting into humans and the number of people affected .
Places were bumped up in rank if children were impacted .
No U.S. or European sites made the list thanks to a mop-up of lingering human health hazards over the past several decades , but that does not mean the developed world is not a contributor .
" The nickel we use in our cars or elsewhere is likely to have come from Norilsk , " Fuller notes .
" And some of the lead in our car batteries will have come from one of these places . "
Despite the massive pollution , it would be relatively easy and cheap to clean up the most dangerous hazards at these contaminated sites , Fuller argues .
Economic development has already led to construction of cleaner new plants in some places and small efforts and investments can net major gains , he says .
For example , it costs just $ 15,000 to save an estimated 350 lives by simply digging up radioactive contaminated soil from the Mayak plutonium facility that had been deposited on the shore of the Techa River in the Russian town of Muslyomova .
Similar cost - effective efforts are underway across the globe .
" For about $ 200 , the cost of a refrigerator , we are able to save someone 's life , " Fuller says , citing a recent Blacksmith analysis conducted with the help of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Hunter College in New York City as well as Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .
" Small amounts of money have gone an awfully long way to cleaning some of these up . "
But there are also many sites this survey likely overlooks ;
Fuller conservatively estimates that , at worst , they have captured only one third of the world 's most polluted areas because of spotty coverage in central Asia and Central and South America .
After all , Sumqayit made the list this year for the first time .
" We were quite surprised , " he admits , " to have new additions to the list that we 'd never heard of . "
Gym Rage : Spinning Out of Control Was an attack on a N.Y. man during his spin class the latest case of gym rage ?
Sept. 20 , 2007  --
For the millions of Americans looking for another reason to skip hitting the gym , they can add to their list of excuses one more — gym rage .
A New York City hedge - fund manager says he was assaulted by a fellow health - club member at a Manhattan gym this week because he was grunting too loudly during a spinning class .
Stuart Sugarman , 48 , says that he spent two weeks in the hospital with a damaged spinal cord after Christopher Carter , 44 , became so enraged by Sugarman 's " whooping " that he threw him from his exercise bike .
" [ Carter ] did n't like the volume at which my client was cheering and getting amped up , " Sugarman 's lawyer Samuel Davis told ABCNEWS.com .
" After making some rude expletive - laced comments that my client desist from cheering … he got off his bike and into a linebacker 's position .
Then he charged across the room , lifting my client off his bike and smashing his head and neck against a Sheetrock wall . "
Carter was charged with misdemeanor assault , which his lawyer Mike Farkas characterized as " imaginative at best … [ and ] a manipulation of the criminal justice system . "
Davis says his client suffered a concussion , a spinal cord contusion and a " massive herniated disk . "
Gyms have been the focus of a number of donnybrooks in recent months , leading some to dub the phenomenon behind health - club assaults gym rage .
Two English women ended up wrestling on the floor of their Birmingham aerobic studio in May after a fight broke out over the direction a fan would be pointed .
" We looked round and saw two women standing next to the fan , arguing over it , " a witness told the Birmingham Evening Mail .
" They were screaming and shouting , then the next thing we knew they were pushing and shoving each other . …
They ended up rolling on the floor , pulling each other 's hair and scratching each other 's faces , " she said .
In January , a Salt Lake City man said an off - duty cop " blocked his car with a police cruiser in a gym parking lot and tried to pull him out of his vehicle through the window " after a heated basketball game , the Salt Lake Tribune reported .
Each gym has its own culture and members are expected to know the etiquette unique to that club , said Jim Bell , president of the International Fitness Professionals Association .
" But the first rule in every gym , " Bell said , " is do n't hurt anyone else .
If someone in the gym is annoying you , the proper thing is to do is go through the chain of command .
It is better not to confront [ a ] member that 's annoying you , instead tell a trainer or go to management . "
Bell recommends picking a gym with a culture most befitting your workout style .
" Pick a gym culture you feel most comfortable with .
Traditionally hard - core gyms like Golds and World are pretty high intensity .
You would expect to hear grunting , groaning there . "
Despite the recent spate of media reports ,
Bell said fights in gym were rare .
" People who go to the gym are generally pretty tolerant of each other because they 're all there for the same reason . "
Mitch Abrams , a sports psychologist who specializes in anger management , agreed that fights in gyms were probably no more likely than fights anywhere else , but because " gyms are places of heightened physical activity , people may feel greater license to use physical means to resolve disputes . "
" There might be a slightly heightened likelihood that gym members might solve their problems using muscles , but that 's merely an explanation and not an excuse .
There is never a reason to put your hands on anyone . "
Abrams also said that conflicts are fueled in public places where a perceived slight takes on greater significance because there is an audience .
" Once someone has thrown down the gauntlet and the argument has an audience , it 's difficult to stop a fight . "
Senate caves to Bush on telecom immunity
Despite an intense lobbying effort from privacy groups , the Senate sealed an expected deal this week with President Bush to grant major telecommunications companies -- including Verizon , Comcast and AT&T -- immunity from prosecution for their role in the President 's warrantless eavesdropping program if they can " demonstrate to a court that they acted pursuant to a legal directive in helping the government with surveillance in the United States . "
The legislation finalizes the deal between Senate Democrats and the Administration over the terms of the National Security Agency 's domestic surveillance .
It was first reported in the Washington Post .
Earlier , Bush had pushed for immunity to be included in a six - month update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , but Democrats managed to strip that provision from the bill .
He said he'd refuse to sign a bill that does n't spare prosecution for the telecommunications industry .
News reports have fingered phone companies AT&T and Verizon as major players .
Both firms are entangled in several class action lawsuits for handling over millions of customer files .
Verizon recently admitted that it had honored requests for information at least 720 times without a court order .
Qwest , another telecommunications firm , allegedly stood up to the Administration and refused to participate , citing doubts about the program 's legality .
Republicans who support telecom immunity say that companies were doing the nation good .
" They deserve our thanks , they do n't deserve to be hit with a flurry of frivolous lawsuits , " House Judiciary Committee ranking Republican Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) told Dow Jones .
Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have argued in legal briefs that the companies broke the law by participating in an illegal program .
Antibiotic resistance of bacteria is not an example of evolution in action but rather variation within a bacterial kind .
It is also a testimony to the wonderful design God gave bacteria .
Bacteria are single - celled microorganisms , and most bacterial species are either spherical ( called cocci ) or rod-shaped ( called bacilli ) .
The 3D rendering on the left shows bacilli bacteria .
The extraordinary ability of certain bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics — which are otherwise useful in speeding recovery from some illnesses — has been a hot topic on the minds of doctors , hospital staff , reporters , and the general public for several years .
It is also heralded as a textbook example of evolution in action .
These bacteria are being studied by evolutionary scientists with the hope that they will reveal secrets as to how molecules - to - man evolution could have happened .
But are bacteria really evolving ?
Antibiotic - Resistant Bacteria
Antibiotics are natural substances secreted by bacteria and fungi to kill other bacteria that are competing for limited nutrients .
( The antibiotics used to treat people today are typically derivatives of these natural products . )
Scientists are dismayed to discover that some bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics through various alterations , or mutations , in their DNA .
Hospitals have become a breeding ground for antibiotic resistant bacteria .
These bacteria proliferate in an environment filled with sick people who have poor immune systems and where antibiotics have eliminated competing bacteria that are not resistant .
Bacteria that are resistant to modern antibiotics have even been found in the frozen bodies of people who died long before those antibiotics were discovered or synthesized .
1
History of Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotics were first discovered through a providential experiment by Alexander Fleming in 1928 .
His work eventually led to the large - scale production of penicillin from the mold Penicillium notatum in the 1940s .
As early as the late 1940s resistant strains of bacteria began to appear .
2
Currently , it is estimated that more than 70 % of the bacteria that cause hospital - acquired infections are resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used to treat them .
3
Antibiotic resistance continues to expand for a multitude of reasons , including over - prescription of antibiotics by physicians , non-completion of prescribed antibiotic treatments by patients , use of antibiotics in animals as growth enhancers ( primarily by the food industry ) , increased international travel , and poor hospital hygiene .
2
How Do Bacteria Become Resistant ?
Bacteria can gain resistance through two primary ways :
1 . By mutation , and
2 . By using a built - in design feature to swap DNA ( called horizontal gene transfer ) — bacteria share resistance genes .
An antibiotic kills a bacterial cell by simply disrupting a critical function .
This is achieved in the cell in much the same way that a saboteur can cause a massive jetliner to crash by simply cutting the hydraulic lines .
Antibiotic resistance of bacteria only leads to a loss of functional systems .
Evolution requires a gain of functional systems for bacteria to evolve into man .
The antibiotic binds to a protein so that the protein cannot function properly .
The normal protein is usually involved in copying the DNA , making proteins , or making the bacterial cell wall — all important functions for the bacteria to grow and reproduce .
If the bacteria have a mutation in the DNA which codes for one of those proteins , the antibiotic cannot bind to the altered protein ; and the mutant bacteria survive .
In the presence of antibiotics , the process of natural selection will occur , favoring the survival and reproduction of the mutant bacteria .
( The mutant bacteria are better able to survive in the presence of the antibiotic and will continue to cause illness in the patient . )
Although the mutant bacteria can survive well in the hospital environment , the change has come at a cost .
The altered protein is less efficient in performing its normal function , making the bacteria less fit in an environment without antibiotics .
Typically , the non-mutant bacteria are better able to compete for resources and reproduce faster than the mutant form .
Let ’s look at a famous example to help clarify this .
During the anthrax scare shortly after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks in the U.S. , Ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) was given to potential victims .
Cipro belongs to a family of antibiotics known as quinolones , which bind to a bacterial protein called gyrase , decreasing the ability of the bacteria to reproduce .
This allows the body ’s natural immune defenses to overtake the infectious bacteria as they are reproducing at a slower rate .
Quinolone - resistant bacteria have mutations in the genes encoding the gyrase protein .
The mutant bacteria survive because the Cipro cannot bind to the altered gyrase .
This comes at a cost as quinolone - resistant bacteria reproduce more slowly .4 , 5 , 6 Resistance to this family of antibiotics is becoming a major problem with one type of bacteria which causes food poisoning .
This bacteria increased its resistance to quinolones 10 - fold in just five years .
7
Bacteria can also become antibiotic resistant by gaining mutated DNA from other bacteria .
Unlike you and me , bacteria can swap DNA .
But this still is not an example of evolution in action .
No new DNA is generated ( a requirement for molecules - to - man evolution ) , it is just moved around .
It ’s like taking money from your left pocket and putting it into your right pocket — it does n’t make you wealthier .
This mechanism of exchanging DNA is necessary for bacteria to survive in extreme or rapidly changing environments like a hospital ( or like those found shortly after the Flood ) .
8
What Does It Really Prove ?
The mechanisms of mutation and natural selection aid bacteria populations in becoming resistant to antibiotics .
However , mutation and natural selection also result in bacteria with defective proteins that have lost their normal functions .
Evolution requires a gain of functional systems for bacteria to evolve into man — functioning arms , eyeballs , and a brain , to name a few .
Mutation and natural selection , thought to be the driving forces of evolution , only lead to a loss of functional systems .
Therefore , antibiotic resistance of bacteria is not an example of evolution in action but rather variation within a bacterial kind .
It is also a testimony to the wonderful design God gave bacteria , master adapters and survivors in a sin-cursed world .

Something I often hear from people that talk about Linux on the desktop is this : people want to be able to go to the store , buy hardware , and be confident that it will Just Work .
I would like to point out that things are rarely this simple on Windows .
And , in fact , things are often simpler on Linux these days .
Here ’s the example that prompted this post .
I have a computer that ’s about 4 years old .
It ’s my main desktop machine at home .
It was still fast enough for me , but has been developing all sorts of weird behaviors .
Certain USB ports stopped working altogether a few months ago .
Then it started hanging during POST whenever I ’d try to reboot — but would still boot OK about 80 % of the time after a power cycle .
Then it started randomly losing contact with my USB mouse until a reboot .
And the last straw was when the display started randomly going out .
I ’ve told everyone that my machine has cancer and is slowly dying .
The case is a pretty nice full tower — solid and sturdy .
I have an 160 GB IDE drive in it .
So I figured I will upgrade the motherboard , CPU , RAM , and add a 500 GB SATA drive since they ’re so cheap these days and I ’m running out of space .
I ’d also have to buy a new video card since my old one was AGP and the new motherboard only has PCI Express for video .
So about $ 700 later from Newegg ( I got a Core 2 Duo E6750 ) , the parts arrived .
I spent some time installing it all .
The motherboard had only one IDE channel , and I did n’t have any IDE cable long enough to connect both the IDE hard disk and the optical drive , so I popped in an old Maxtor / Promise PCI Ultra133 controller I had sitting around to use with the DVD burner .
Now , to recap , the hardware that the OS would see as new / different is : CPU , RAM , IDE controller , SATA controller , Promise IDE controller , integrated NIC , sound , video .
Then the magic smoke test .
I turned on the machine .
Grub appeared .
Linux started booting .
Even though I had switched from the default Debian “ supports everything ” kernel to a K7 kernel , it still booted .
And every single piece of hardware was supported immediately .
There was no “ add new hardware ” wizard that popped up , no “ I ’ve found new hardware ” boxes .
It just worked , silently , with no need to tell me anything or have me click on anything .
Only one piece required configuration : the NIC , thanks to some udev design flaws ( it got renamed from eth0 to eth1 by udev ) .
That took 20 seconds .
Debian saw the IDE HDD , the SATA drive , the Promise controller , the DVD burner , the video card , the sound , and it all worked automatically .
And Debian is not even a distro that occurs to a lot of people when they think of great hardware support .
Now let ’s turn to Windows .
The Windows Nightmare
I have a legal copy of Windows XP
Home that was preinstalled on the machine when I got it .
I resized its partition down to about 20 GB so that I could use 140 GB for Linux .
I use it rarely , primarily for gaming , and I ’ve bought about 3 games in the last 4 years .
I usually disconnect the network when I boot to Windows , though I do keep it current with updates .
I did some research on what Windows was going to do when I replace the hardware .
The general consensus from people on the ‘ net is that you ca n’t just replace a motherboard and expect everything to be happy .
There were generally three different approaches suggested : 1 ) do n’t even try , just reinstall ; 2 ) do a rescue install after you move over ; and 3 ) use sysprep .
The rescue install has to be done by booting from an XP install CD , then picking a rescue install option somewhere .
It will overwrite your installed Windows with the version from the CD .
That means that I ’d have to re-apply SP2 , though bits of it that did n’t get overwritten would still be on the hard disk , and who knows what would happen to the registry .
Option # 3 was to download sysprep ( must have the Genuine Disadvantage ActiveX to get the free download from MS ) .
Sysprep is designed to be used just prior to taking an image with ghost for replication .
It removes the hardware - specific config ( but not the drivers ) , as well as the product key , from the machine , but otherwise leaves it untouched .
On the next boot , you get the “ Welcome to XP ” wizard .
One other strike against # 2 is that Compaq “ helpfully ” did n’t ship any install CDs with the machine .
Under Windows , they did have a “ create rescue CD ” tool , which burned 7 CDs for me .
But they are full Compaq - specific CDs , not one of them an XP CD , * AND * they check on boot to see if you ’re using the same Compaq motherboard , and exit if not .
Highly useless .
So I went with sysprep .
Before my new hardware even arrived , I downloaded the Windows drivers for all of it .
I burned them to a CD , and installed as many as I could on the system in advance .
About half of them refused to install since the new hardware was n’t there yet .
I then took a raw image of the partition with dd , just in case .
Finally , right before I swapped the hardware , I ran sysprep and let it shut down the machine .
So after the new hardware was installed came the adventure .
Windows booted to the “ welcome to XP ” thingy .
The video , keyboard , mouse , and IDE HDD worked .
That ’s about it .
I went through the “ welcome to XP wizard ” .
But the network did n’t work yet , so I could n’t activate it .
So I popped my handy driver CD in the drive .
But what ’s this ?
Windows does n’t recognize the DVD drive because it does n’t have drivers for this Promise controller that came out in , what , 2001 ?
Sigh .
Downloaded the drivers with the imac , copy them to a CF card , plug the USB CF reader into Windows .
While I was doing that , about 6 “ found new hardware ” dialogs got queued up .
Not one of them could actually find a driver for my hardware , but that did n’t prevent Windows from making me click through them all .
So , install Promise driver from CF card , reboot .
Click through new hardware dialogs again .
Install network driver , reboot , click through dialogs .
Install sound driver .
Install Intel “ chipset ” driver , click through dialogs .
Reboot .
Install SATA driver .
Reboot .
So the hardware appears to all be working by this point , though I have a Creative volume control ( from the old hardware ) and a Realtek one in the tray .
Minor annoyance to deal with later .
Now I have to re-activate XP .
I dutifully key in the magic string from the sticker on my case .
Surprise surprise , the Internet - based activation fails because my hardware is different .
So I have to call the 800 number .
I have to read in 7 blocks of 6 digits , one block at a time .
Then I answer some questions : have I activated Windows before , have I changed hardware , was the old hardware defective ( yes , yes , and yes ) .
Then I get 7 blocks of 6 digits read to me .
Finally Windows is activated .
PHEW !
Why they could n’t ask those questions with the online tool is beyond me .
Anyhow .
Linux took me 20 seconds to get working .
Windows , about 2 hours , plus another 2 hours for prep and research .
I did zero prep for Linux .
I made one config change ( GUI users could have just configured their machine to use eth1 ) .
Other cool Linux HW features
Say you buy a new printer and want to get it set up .
On Windows , you insert the CD , let it install 200MB of print drivers plus ads plus crap plus add something to your taskbar plus who knows what else .
Probably reboot .
Then the printer might actually print .
On Debian , you plug in the printer to the USB port .
You type printconf .
5 seconds later , your printer works .
I have been unpleasantly surprised lately by just how difficult hardware support in Windows really is , especially since everyone keeps saying how good it is .
It ’s not good .
Debian ’s is better , in my opinion .

宇宙航空研究開発機構 （JAXA）および日本放送協会（NHK）は、平成19年10月18日（日本時間、以下同様）に高度約100kmの月周回観測軌道に投入した月周回衛星「かぐや（SELENE）」からハイビジョンカメラ（HDTV）による「地球の出」（注）の動画撮影に世界で初めて成功しました。
月面越しに地球が昇っていく「地球の出」は、アポロ計画で初めて撮影されました。暗黒の宇宙空間にただひとつ浮かぶ青い地球が印象的なこの画像のハイビジョン撮影に、今回、「かぐや（SELENE）」が世界で初めて成功しました。また、この画像は約38万km隔てた遠い宇宙から地球をハイビジョン撮影したもので、これも世界で初めてです。
撮影は、 「 かぐや （SELENE）」に搭載されたNHK開発の宇宙仕様のハイビジョンカメラ（HDTV）によって行われたものです。「かぐや（SELENE）」で撮影した動画画像をJAXA臼田宇宙空間観測所にて受信し、その後、NHKにおいてデータ処理を行いました。
なお、臼田宇宙空間観測所で受信したテレメトリデータにより、衛星の状態は正常であることを確認しています。
（注）今回、 「地球の出」という表現を使っていますが、これは月周回衛星「かぐや（SELENE）」やアポロ有人宇宙船のように月のまわりを回る衛星で見られる現象です。月面上に立つ人間からは地球は絶えずほぼ同じ位置に見え、地球が地平線から昇ってくるような「地球の出」を見ることはできません。

Airborne Laser Successfully Completes Low - Power Flight Testing
07 -NEWS-0044
31 August 2007
Lieutenant General Henry " Trey " Obering III , Missile Defense Agency director , announced today that the Airborne Laser ( ABL ) program has completed one of its most important milestones to - date .
Using all three of the aircraft 's laser systems to detect , track , and then engage a " non-cooperative " target aircraft with a low - power laser that is serving as a surrogate for the high - power laser that will be installed aboard the modified Boeing 747-400 aircraft later this year .
This is a critically important milestone , as the program has now successfully completed the low - power phase of testing and demonstrated ABL 's integrated battle management and beam control / fire control systems in flight by detecting , tracking , targeting and engaging an airborne target .
This most recent development milestone included a number of history - making firsts : lasing an external airborne target using all three ABL lasers -- the Tracking Illuminator Laser ( TILL ) to track the airborne target ; the Beacon Illuminator ( BILL ) to compensate for atmospheric distortion and the Surrogate High Energy Laser ( SHEL ) to engage the target , called " Big Crow , " a modified NC - 135 aircraft loaded with test instrumentation and equipped with a missile - shaped profile painted on the side of the aircraft to provide an aimpoint for the three lasers .
Cameras onboard Big Crow verified all laser beams hit their intended locations and data analysis has verified ABL 's performance is adequate to enter the program 's next phase .
This is the first time in history an airborne directed - energy platform has successfully engaged a non-cooperative airborne target at significant ranges .
The prototype ABL aircraft completed 48 flight test missions , firing its on - board lasers more than 200 times .
Completion of this phase of flight testing satisfies another of the key 2007 " knowledge points " that the Missile Defense Agency uses to measure program success .
With the completion of this " knowledge point , " efforts will now focus on the installation of the megawatt - class Chemical Oxygen - Iodine Laser ( COIL ) at Edwards Air Force Base in preparation for high - power testing scheduled to begin in late 2008 .
The high - power laser will have the ability to destroy a ballistic missile in its " boost phase " -- the first few minutes of flight -- when it is highly vulnerable to the directed energy beam ABL will deliver .
The ABL will be the first combat aircraft relying entirely upon a directed energy device as a weapon .
When available for operations , the ABL will be an integral part of a layered ballistic missile defense that will be capable of destroying a ballistic missile of any range , during any phase of its flight - boost , midcourse and terminal .

" A desk ( and a conference room ) are dangerous places to view ( manage ) the world . " - John Le Carre .
Once upon a time , 32 people from one manufacturing company had gathered in a conference room for an emergency meeting , because a product for a major customer had a serious manufacturing defect .
Many meetings had already taken place between the employees of the company , all without resolution .
By now , tension was high , and the customer was getting increasingly irritated with the delay .
Intense arguments were going on between all the people who had gathered for the occasion .
The record keeper was frantically trying to keep up with the heated discussions , and the timekeeper was desperately alerting the participants to stay focused on the agenda .
After patiently listening to the discussions , one new entrant to the scene interrupted and asked three questions :
1 . How many of you have visited the customer and seen the problem first hand ?
2 . How many of you are representing the manufacturing area where the problem is occurring ?
3 . Of the rest of you , how many have ever seen the exposed glass lid ( the defect in question ) ?
He then excused the rest of the people from the room ( including the record keeper and time keeper ) .
There were only 7 people left in the room out of the original 32 .
Less than an hour later , decisions were made , and the problem was effectively resolved .
( Footnote :
That new entrant went on to become a very successful CEO )
Reflection :
In his acceptance speech for 1995 American Film Institute ’s Life Achievement Award , Steven Spielberg said , " One can not create the great work of art unless he / she has felt / experienced it in some way . "
Such is also true when creating a good design , excellent product or useful software or solving manufacturing and customer issues .
Sequel :
After hearing the above quote , " A desk …. dangerous place to view …. " , one zealous manager decided to take immediate action .
Instead of the normal practice of having phone meetings with representatives of overseas companies from conference rooms in the USA , he flew all the way down to Japan for a “ first hand investigation ” .
He summoned the manufacturers to join him in the hotel conference room for meetings and had dialogues across Japanese desks instead of US desks .
( But he failed to go to the actual manufacturing facilities . )
This week the lab staff is heading off to Austin , Texas , our former stomping grounds and site of the other Maker Faire this year !
As we noted earlier , we ’ll be doing a demonstration of how to build an excellent Bat Costume out of an umbrella and a hoodie .
However , our primary project there will be our booth : High - Tech Pumpkins , where we will show up to a dozen ( fingers crossed ) halloween - themed projects , TSA willing .
( Thank FSM it ’s Austin , not Boston . )
While we get everything together this week , our publishing schedule will be a little wonky .
However , halloween is just around the corner , so it ’s time to dust off a few projects from our halloween archives !

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Chiquita Brands International faces a $ 7.86 billion lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of nearly 400 Colombian families who say the company should be held responsible for the " torture and murder " of their loved ones .
With a map of alleged victims , Jonathan Reiter makes his case Wednesday at a New York news conference .
Attorney Jonathan Reiter said his clients are seeking " damages for terrorism , war crimes ... and wrongful death . "
The plaintiffs are asking for $ 10 million in compensatory damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit .
Earlier this year , Chiquita , as part of a plea agreement , admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia , or AUC .
AUC was named a terrorist organization by the United States in 2002 , making it a crime to give them money .
The lawsuit alleges Chiquita 's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group .
" They conspired with the AUC , aided and abetted them in a far - reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing , distribution and sale , " Reiter said .
The attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm " for pennies " and were killed by AUC in 2001 , and other murder victims had been directed to " sell their bananas only to Chiquita . "
The families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country , he said .
" The principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists , when you put guns into the hands of terrorists , then you are legally responsible for the atrocities , the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit , " Reiter said .
Responding to the allegations Wednesday afternoon , the company said , " Chiquita Brands International categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys .
We reiterate that Chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families . "
Chiquita 's director of communications , Michael Mitchell , went on to say , " Our company had been forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce .
It is absolutely untrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose . "
Mitchell said the company will fight the allegations .
" Chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in Colombia .
We will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in the United States . "
In the March plea agreement , Chiquita Brands International agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine for the payments made by the company 's former banana - producing subsidiary in Colombia .
During a government investigation , the company admitted to making payments to AUC even after outside counsel told the company those payments were illegal and should stop immediately .

This custom made toy by artist / sculptor Doktor A is a wondrous tribute to the classic arcade game , Pac - Man .
The one - of - a - kind sculptural toy is entitled “ The Secret History of Video Games : Pac Gentleman ” .
It almost reads like a steampunk version of the 1980s dot - muncher , what with its crank - driven game play and wooden and metallic accents .
The good Doktor explains the Pac Gentleman game as follows :
“ When this game was first released in 1880 it was so hugely popular in taverns and inns that the bank of England was forced to mint more threepenny bits to keep up with demand .
The game was created by messrs Nam & Nam and Co. as a novelty pastime for the masses .
Outdoing the previous top public house game of Shove Ha’penny . “
Brilliant .
Doktor A ’s work is being shown as part of the Spit & Polish toy show at Cardboard Spaceship in Santa Cruz , CA .
The show runs from now through November 31 ( whoops , that ’s 30th ) , 2007 .

Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .
Find out more .
ETags , ETags , ETags
I ’ve been hoping to avoid this , but ETags seem to be popping up more and more often recently .
For whatever reason , people latch onto them as a litmus test for RESTfulness , as the defining factor of HTTP ’s caching model , and much more .
So , let me counter : they ’re not all that .
In fact , there are a number of pitfalls you need to be wary of if you use them .
First , depending on how they ’re generated , you might find different boxes in a farm producing different ETags , with unfavourable results for caching .
Or , you might find that your implementation does n’t really understand HTTP very well , so it gives the same ETag to two different representations of the same resource , causing downstream caches to bend over backwards to accommodate your broken server .
It can happen to the best of us .
If you ’re trying to be a good guy and both compressing your content and hashing it to calculate the ETag , beware ; the gzip file format has a timestamp in it that means the ETag will change every time you re-compress it .
Oops .
Even if you get the whole ETag thing right , there ’s no guarantee that a cache will use it ; although recent versions of Squid understand and use ETags , lots of older implementations do n’t .
Another mistake is to think that ETags are only used for caching .
If you hand out ETags and your resource supports methods like PUT or DELETE , you ’d better be ready to properly handle conditional headers like If - Match on requests ; otherwise , they ’ll end up doing the wrong thing .
I ’m heartened somewhat that the APP spec alludes to this in passing , but I do wonder how many people have got this wrong ( thanks to Lisa for bringing this up in discussion ) .
Then there ’s the whole ETag - on - write issue .
Finally , there ’s the whole mess of weak ETags ; although they ’re potentially very powerful , they ’re also very misunderstood .
All of this is not to say that ETags are useless ; far from it .
However , I do get confused and concerned when people seem to focus on just one feature of HTTP to the exclusion of other , just as ( or more ) appropriate ones .
Dare I say “ cargo cult ” ?
While ETags are a fine validation mechanism , Last - Modified is also perfectly fine in many situations .
Even better , avoid the round trip altogether and give your response some freshness information with Cache - Control : max -age .
Now that I ’ve had my rant , there are some good things about ETags .
If you need a strong validator ( i.e. , your response might change more than once a second ) , they ca n’t be beat , and if you do n’t like how Last - Modified is used as input to freshness heuristics , it ’s a fine alternative , as long as you keep the caveats above in mind .
Of course , if you need to do optimistic concurrency , they ’re a great option .
IIRC Yves has done some very cool things with weak ETags in Jigsaw , so that small changes do n’t upset caches .
Finally , Tim Bray also has some very intelligent things to say about them , pointing out that if you ’re clever , you can use an ETag to avoid a bunch of work on the server side during validation .
Unfortunately , I do n’t see too many people doing this yet .
We all make mistakes and , if you believe medical scholar John Ioannidis , scientists make more than their fair share .
By his calculations , most published research findings are wrong .
Dr. Ioannidis is an epidemiologist who studies research methods at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece and Tufts University in Medford , Mass .
In a series of influential analytical reports , he has documented how , in thousands of peer - reviewed research papers published every year , there may be so much less than meets the eye .
These flawed findings , for the most part , stem not from fraud or formal misconduct , but from more mundane misbehavior : miscalculation , poor study design or self - serving data analysis .
" There is an increasing concern that in modern research , false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims , " Dr. Ioannidis said .
" A new claim about a research finding is more likely to be false than true . "
The hotter the field of research the more likely its published findings should be viewed skeptically , he determined .
Take the discovery that the risk of disease may vary between men and women , depending on their genes .
Studies have prominently reported such sex differences for hypertension , schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis , as well as lung cancer and heart attacks .
In research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association , Dr. Ioannidis and his colleagues analyzed 432 published research claims concerning gender and genes .
Neurodegeneration is often thought of as irreversible :
Once neurons are damaged ( or dead ) , one expects the decrease in function to be permanent .
Granted , there is evidence that neuronal stem cells persist in adult brains , raising the possibility that functional could be reversed as the brain regenerates — but as the rate of damage accumulates with aging , such replenishment will inevitably fall behind .
Hence , we tend to think of declining mental function as a one - way trip .
Recent findings , however , suggest that functional losses in the brain can indeed be reversed .
The work of Bruce Ames and co-workers , for example , has demonstrated that potent anti-oxidants can return youthful plasticity to aging brains , at least in rats .
( Bruce has a favorite joke about these results that I ’ve quoted before and will quote again :
He told his son , “ We ’ve come up with a way to turn old rats into young rats ! ”
His son replied , “ Let me know when you ’re able to turn old people into young rats . ” )
Further evidence of the reversibility of mental aging in the Rodentia comes from this recent paper by Martins de Lima et al . .
The authors demonstrate that iron chelators can restore mental capacity in aged rats .
( Iron is known to accumulate in the aging brain , and is thought to generate cytotoxic compounds termed reactive oxygen species or ROS . )
Reversion of age - related recognition memory impairment by iron chelation in rats
It is now generally accepted that iron accumulates in the brain during the ageing process .
Increasing evidence demonstrate that iron accumulation in selective regions of the brain may generate free radicals , thereby possessing implications for the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders .
In a previous study we have reported that aged rats present recognition memory deficits .
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of desferoxamine ( DFO ) , an iron chelator agent , on age - induced memory impairment .
Aged Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of saline or DFO ( 300 mg / kg ) for 2 weeks .
The animals were submitted to a novel object recognition task 24 h after the last injection .
DFO - treated rats showed normal recognition memory while the saline group showed long - term recognition memory deficits .
The results show that DFO is able to reverse age - induced recognition memory deficits .
We also demonstrated that DFO reduced the oxidative damage to proteins in cortex and hippocampus .
Thus , the present findings provide the first evidence that iron chelators might prevent age - related memory dysfunction .
According to the results of this study , functional loss in the brain is not ( entirely ) a simple steady state balance between accelerating cell morbidity and diminishing regenerative capacity .
Instead , it appears that accumulated iron is be causing ongoing damage ( perhaps via ROS , perhaps by some mechanism ) and that this damage is not irreversible per se :
As soon as the iron is removed , the brain begins to regain its youthful capabilities .
The implications for human neurological aging are tremendous :
While not everyone develops a specific age - related neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer ’s or Parkinson ’s , most people suffer from a slow decrease in mental sharpness as we age .
If the results in this paper hold true for primates ( that is , if iron is a cause of broad - spectrum functional loss in normal human aging ) , and assuming that compounds like desferoxamine do n’t have awful side effects ( the obvious one being anemia ) , then iron chelation therapy ( perhaps along with the elimination of other toxic metals ) could become an important part of the anti-aging pharmacopoiea .
Currently , I 'm attending a conference here in Brisbane , Australia .
I just arrived in the hotel and found out with horror about their Internet access prices .
As you can imagine , I 've gone to a conference about software , and this is actually the conference hotel where I am staying .
So obviously , during this week there will be a lot of people here with computers , checking e-mail , going online , etc .
Well , the hotel , or at least their Internet provider , are about to make one heck of a load of money off us poor buggers .
Check out those prices : AU$ 0.55 per minute ?
Up to AU$ 27.50 per day ?
And a ' generous ' data cap of 50 MBytes ( !!! ) per day , and AU$ 0.10 for every additional megabyte ?
Heck , I 'm normally using some 200 – 300 MBytes per day during a normal work day , so this is going to be incredibly restrictive .
I can't even make a Skype call , do a decent e-mail session and check the news without breaking through this limit .
I do n't do a lot of travel to Australia , so I am asking those of you in the know :
Are these prices normal over here ?
Would I likely find other ( good ) hotels in Brisbane ( or anywhere else in Australia , for that matter ) with less blatant rip - off prices ?
In general , what is the most outrageous broadband access pricing you have discovered on your travels ?
I do most of my travelling to the US , and the hotels I stay in there usually give you free , uncapped Internet access .
And even during my last stay in Europe I got the same good deal ( it was n't always like that in Europe , so maybe I was just lucky ? ) ...
Of course , nowhere on the hotel 's web site does it mention those charges .
They only say that Internet access in the hotel rooms is available .
How nice !
Then you get here and you find out the true cost .
That 's one lesson I have to learn :
Call them and ask specifically about Internet access prices before making the booking .
I hope the conference venue provides free WiFi downstairs tomorrow ...

Following a six - year trial , Attorney Israel Perry was convicted on Wednesday of stealing hundreds of millions of Deutsche marks from Holocaust survivors who were represented by the Association for Implementing the Social Security Covenant ( AISSC ) , which he headed .
Tel Aviv District court judges convicted Perry of aggravated fraud , embezzlement , obstruction of justice and violation of insurance laws .
In 1973 Israel and West Germany signed a compensation agreement under which eligible Israel citizens would be permitted to join the West Germany 's Social Security Authority 's pension plan .
To sign up a one - time payment was required to cover monthly premiums .
In 1983 , three years after the agreement went into effect , Perry established the AISSC and presented himself as the survivors ' representative in the reparation negotiations with the West German government .
Some 30,000 Israelis registered .
However , according to the court 's ruling , Perry did not inform his clients that the terms of the loans he had arranged for them , through companies under his control , led to excessive repayments , part of which he pocketed .
The survivors took out the loans for immediate use under the assumption that they could pay them back after receiving the reparations that were due to them .
" This is a case of systematic , well - planned fraud based the complexity of the agreements , " the judges said in their ruling .
To put it simply : Yes and No .
Yes , it can be fun and is a great way to learn how to play .

Baccarat is a simple game that has been around for a long time , but it was n’t always a popular choice for average casino players .
Even now , many of the high rollers play baccarat and a lot of people still associate the game with big bucks .
However , the game is gaining popularity with your average players as they begin to see how exciting it is and understand they can fit it into their bankroll .
If you are n’t yet familiar with the game of baccarat , you may find it becomes one of your new favorites if you decide to give it a try .
Finding the best place to play online baccarat
Baccarat has become an extremely easy game to play online .
Most of the casinos make sure they offer it to their players .
Another thing worth noting about baccarat is many of the online casinos even offer live dealer baccarat for their players to enjoy .
Choose a casino with a good reputation , excellent software , secure banking , good support , and generous bonuses and promotions in order to get the full enjoyment from the games .
Playing online baccarat
Baccarat is a card table game which is considered to be a card comparing game , similar to blackjack in this way .
However , when you play baccarat you do want to understand that it does n’t have an element of skill to it the way blackjack and many other games do .
When you play baccarat , you will be competing against the dealer and trying to get a higher hand value .
However , when you play baccarat you do n’t necessarily need to wager on your own hand .
You also have the option to wager on the dealers hand .
The highest hand value you can get in this game is 9 and this is considered a natural hand if it is made with just 2 cards .
In baccarat , the cards between 2 and 9 will retain their face value , the two being worth 2 points , the 3 being worth 3 points , and so on .
The face cards are all worth 0 and the aces are worth a single point .
It may seem difficult to understand that the highest value a hand can have is 9 if that is also the highest value of a single card .
However , the value of a hand is calculated by taking the right number of the total sum .
For example , if you have two 7’s , then your hand value is 4 .
7+7=14 and taking the number on the right leaves you with 4 .
You wo n’t need to worry about calculating the hand values .
In a land based casino the dealer does this and the software takes care of it in the online games .
When it comes to learning the various rules of the game , you will see that the online casinos have made it quite simple .
If you want to familiarize yourself with the game before risking your money , then consider playing in some of the free baccarat games for a while and transitioning to the real money games once you feel comfortable .
Mr Masri is seeking damages in the United States
A justice ministry official reportedly confirmed an article in the German weekly Der Spiegel that said the US had refused the extradition request .
A Munich court had ordered arrest warrants for 13 people in January .
The citizen , Khaled al - Masri , says he was abducted in Macedonia in 2003 and flown to Afghanistan for interrogation .
A spokeswoman for the justice ministry in Berlin told the Associated Press news agency Germany had decided against passing on to US authorities the extradition demand of the prosecutors in Munich .
US courts have barred his suit based on the US government 's assertion of state secrecy concerns
Andrew Ames ,
US justice department
Der Spiegel reported that Berlin had decided not to proceed in order to " avoid an open conflict with the American authorities " .
US justice department spokesman Andrew Ames told AP it did " not discuss whether it has or has not received an extradition request from a given country or our communication with any country with respect to such requests " .
" Mr Masri has pursued litigation for civil damages here in the US and this litigation is ongoing , " he said .
" To date , US courts have barred his suit based on the US government 's assertion of state secrecy concerns . "
' Traumatised '
Mr Masri says he was kidnapped in Macedonia in 2003 , flown to a secret jail in Afghanistan and tortured there .
He says he was detained for five months before being released in Albania after the Americans realised they had got the wrong man .
Mr Masri , who is Lebanese - born , said his case was an example of the US practice of flying foreign terror suspects to third countries without judicial process for interrogation or detention .
He told the BBC in February : " I 'm suffering from stress - this experience has left me traumatised . "
He was arrested in May 2007 on suspicion of setting fire to a shop in Bavaria .
His German lawyer , Manfred Gnjidic , said Mr Masri had acted out of desperation after arguing with staff at the shop in Neu - Ulm .

This one hurts , because o.a.g. really likes to shop at Target .
This info was forwarded by an associate : “ Planned Parenthood Federation of America is protesting a policy by retailer Target that allows pharmacists at 1,150 of its more than 1,300 stores to send customers elsewhere to obtain the emergency contraceptive Plan B , which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse , the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports .
The policy allows pharmacists to refuse to dispense EC if it is against their religious beliefs but requires them to fill prescriptions for all other medications .
Target spokesperson Lena Michaud said that if a pharmacist refuses to fill a prescription for EC , they are expected to see if another pharmacist in the store is available to fill it .
If not , they are required to call a different pharmacy to confirm that it provides EC and has it in stock so that the customer can get her prescription filled .
According to Target officials , incidents in which a pharmacist refuses to fill a prescription for EC seldom occur . ”

A massive class - action lawsuit filed in June 2001 accuses Wal - Mart of consistently paying women lower wages than men and failing to promote them to managerial positions as often .
According to the filing , since1996 , women at Wal - Mart have earned less than men holding the same jobs in nearly every job category .
Other incidents of gender discrimination :
Over objections from a woman executive , senior management regularly referred to female store employees as �little Janie Qs� and �girls �
Female managers were required to go to Hooters sports bars as well as strip clubs for meetings and office outings
The most senior human resources executive at Wal - Mart says that Hooters is an appropriate place to have company meetings
A female assistant manager in Utah was told by her store manager that retail is �tough� and not �appropriate� for women
Another manager in Texas told a female employee that women have to be �bitches� to survive Wal - Mart management , while a Sam�s Club manager in California told another woman that she should �doll - up� to get promoted
Managers have repeatedly told women employees that men �need to be paid more than women because they have families to support �
A female personnel manager in Florida was told by her manager that men were paid more than women because �men are here to make a career and women aren�t .
Retail is for housewives who just need to earn extra money . �
A male manager in South Carolina told a female employee that � God made Adam first , so women would always be second to men �
A female manager in Arizona was told she got paid less than a less qualified male because she �didn�t have the right equipment .�
Nearly 750,000 women work as �sales associates� in Wal - Mart stores .
On average these women earn $ 6.10 per hour , or $ 12,688 per year if they work full - time .
This wage puts many of their families below the poverty level � half would qualify for food stamps .

To me as a man , it is also very romantic to fall into this other plane of life with my loved one next to me .
Yet , sometimes I am misunderstood .
It is a well known fact that men get sleepy after sex .
And this can sometimes annoy their partners .
At the very moment a woman is in need of affection , a delicate show of love , a reassurance of togetherness , trust , and safety , the expected provider of all these femininely human needs turns his back and falls asleep .
The woman who was just blissfully pleased , her eyes still closed , trying to remember and relive the moment , her body still in a crazy fluid traffic , reaches her arm to her partner expressing the need for cuddling , is suddenly awakened by a wild snore coming from this human being sleeping with her in the same bed .
It does not matter if they have been together for ten years or thirty years .
At that moment of bewilderment the woman may still think that this man is a total stranger .
A stranger to woman kind .
Someone who does not know anything about feelings .
A brute .
A wild man .
, rather it is a genetic and biological necessity for man to sleep after sex .
After orgasm , both men and women release chemical bodily fluids like oxytocin , gamma amino butyric acid , endorphins , and prolactin .
The hormone oxytocin helps the establishment of maternal behavior , stimulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction at birth , and stimulation of milk ejection .
Oxytocin also stimulates the brain so that the body feels a bond and a feeling to be close to his or her partner .
Gamma amino butyric acid and endorphins have a calming effect , a relaxed feeling which tickles the brain to signal for a serene sleep .
And here comes the most important verdict , the prolactin .
Prolactin is produced in the pituitary gland and it is a stimulant for milk production .
Both women and men have certain levels of prolactin in their bodies .
However , after orgasm , the body releases a higher dose of prolactin , possibly to relieve sexual arousal and take our mind off sex .
The prolactin levels are naturally higher during sleep .
In fact , animals injected with prolactin become quickly tired and immediately go to sleep in a corner of their cages lined up on the wall of a university laboratory .
Prolactin seems to be the answer , scientists say .
And I believe in science .
Yet , there is one other hypothesis that I have personally developed and would like to share with you .
In the beginning there was hunting .
Men must go out to hunt to feed the women and the kids waiting in the cave .
It was a daily routine for him .
He must reproduce , get some sleep , and go out hunting again .
If he did not feel the need for some rest , he would not sleep , could not rest and it would be a bad hunting day .
In those times , a bad hunting day means starvation .
There also those practical reasons that we cannot deny .
Most of the time sex is staged horizontally , lying on a bed , at night , or under dim lights which are all good reasons to fall asleep .
So the desire to fall asleep after sex is in our hormones and our brains - not in our hearts .

Children are to be tracked in school via radio chips sewn into their uniforms .
The manufacturer is marketing the Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) surveillance system nationwide , following a trial with 19 pupils at Hungerhill School in Doncaster this year .
The chip is embroidered into school uniforms using conductive ' smart threads ' .
A teacher can then scan these to view the pupil 's identity , photo , whether they misbehaved in lessons and their school attendence record .
Hungerhill headteacher Graham Wakeling said the pilot was " not intrusive to the pupil in the slightest " because tracking would not go beyond the school 's gates .
However , the chip has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups .
David Clouter , from LeaveThemKidsAlone , a campaign group , was appalled by the idea .
" To put this in a school badge is complete and utter surveillance of the children .
Tagging is what we do to criminals we let out of prison early , " he said .
The chips were developed by Danrbro Ltd , which was set up by Andy Stewart , an ICT teacher at Hungerhill School , and a school uniform company .
Schools could fit scanners to doors or give teachers hand - held scanners to identify pupils entering or exiting rooms .
Darnbro siad their product can " trace a pupil 's every step during the school day " and that the system can be set up to limit access to doors , such as shutting the main doors of a school to pupils during classtime .
Mr Stewart , 36 , said the system would cost about £ 2000 for a small primary school and up to £ 14,000 for an average - sized secondary , according to the Times Educational Supplement .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families supports the use of electronic registration to improve safety and security and reduce truancy .
From the end of 1980s a strange phenomena is happening in some Russian forests .

They appear in the dense forest , in the places you ca n’t get on the car or truck to bring any device to drill the ground .
There is no any soil that should be taken from such deep holes is found .
On this pictures people go down to one of such holes but it just finishes with nothing .
There are no any reasonable ideas on how these holes appear and what they are being used for .
The detail and expression in Andy Huang ’s Dollface animation is done amazingly .

Microsoft says it has worked hard to meet the commission 's demands
The software giant will appeal against the fine which follows a long - running dispute between it and EU regulators .
The move follows a landmark EU ruling in 2004 , which ordered the US firm to provide rivals with information about its Windows operating system .
EU regulators also warned Microsoft it could face new fines of 3 m euros a day .
Content and clarity
The daily fines will come into force from 31 July if Microsoft fails to supply " complete and accurate " technical information to rival developers , the EU said .
Hopefully we will bring this chapter to a close in the next couple of weeks
Brad Smith , Microsoft general counsel
Microsoft 's general counsel , Brad Smith , insisted the company had met the commission 's demands , and said it would appeal the decision .
" This is not about compliance , this is about clarity , " Mr Smith explained during a conference call .
Mr Smith said Microsoft would argue that the commission 's original demand was too vague , and that the company had since done everything it could to comply with the ruling and provide all the information that was required .
Microsoft expected to deliver the final bundle of information for use by rival software firms on 18 July , he said , well ahead of the EC 's deadline of July 24 .
" Hopefully we will bring this chapter to a close in the next couple of weeks , " Mr Smith said , adding that while Microsoft was not happy about the fine , the company had seen signs of progress in resolving the dispute .
Unbundling
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she had " no alternative but to levy penalty payments " against Microsoft , adding that " no company is above the law " .
" I regret that , more than two years after the decision ...
Microsoft has still not put an end to its illegal conduct , " Ms Kroes said .
Brussels had warned Microsoft in December that it would face fines of 2 m euros a day if the firm failed to meet the commission 's demands .
Under the 2004 ruling , Microsoft was told to provide rival firms with more information about its software , in order to enable them to write programs that could run more smoothly on Microsoft 's widely - used Windows operating system .
The judgment also called for Microsoft to debundle its Windows Media Player from its Windows operating system , and slapped the software firm with a record fine of 497m euros .
Bruce Schneier : Privatizing the Police Puts Us at Greater Risk
Abuses of power and brutality are likelier among private security guards
In Raleigh , N.C. , employees of Capitol Special Police patrol apartment buildings , a bowling alley and nightclubs , stopping suspicious people , searching their cars and making arrests .
Sounds like a good thing , but Capitol Special Police is n’t a police force at all — it ’s a for - profit security company hired by private property owners .
This is n’t unique .
Private security guards outnumber real police more than 5 - 1 , and increasingly act like them .
They wear uniforms , carry weapons and drive lighted patrol cars on private properties like banks and apartment complexes and in public areas like bus stations and national monuments .
Sometimes they operate as ordinary citizens and can only make citizen ’s arrests , but in more and more states they ’re being granted official police powers .
This trend should greatly concern citizens .
Law enforcement should be a government function , and privatizing it puts us all at risk .
Most obviously , there ’s the problem of agenda .
Public police forces are charged with protecting the citizens of the cities and towns over which they have jurisdiction .
Of course , there are instances of policemen overstepping their bounds , but these are exceptions , and the police officers and departments are ultimately responsible to the public .
Private police officers are different .
They do n’t work for us ; they work for corporations .
They ’re focused on the priorities of their employers or the companies that hire them .
They ’re less concerned with due process , public safety and civil rights .
Also , many of the laws that protect us from police abuse do not apply to the private sector .
Constitutional safeguards that regulate police conduct , interrogation and evidence collection do not apply to private individuals .
Information that is illegal for the government to collect about you can be collected by commercial data brokers , then purchased by the police .
We ’ve all seen policemen “ reading people their rights ” on television cop shows .
If you ’re detained by a private security guard , you do n’t have nearly as many rights .
For example , a federal law known as Section 1983 allows you to sue for civil rights violations by the police but not by private citizens .
The Freedom of Information
Act allows us to learn what government law enforcement is doing , but the law does n’t apply to private individuals and companies .
In fact , most of your civil right protections apply only to real police .
Training and regulation is another problem .
Private security guards often receive minimal training , if any .
They do n’t graduate from police academies .
And while some states regulate these guard companies , others have no regulations at all : anyone can put on a uniform and play policeman .
Abuses of power , brutality , and illegal behavior are much more common among private security guards than real police .
A horrific example of this happened in South Carolina in 1995 .
Ricky Coleman , an unlicensed and untrained Best Buy security guard with a violent criminal record , choked a fraud suspect to death while another security guard held him down .
This trend is larger than police .
More and more of our nation ’s prisons are being run by for - profit corporations .
The IRS has started outsourcing some back - tax collection to debt - collection companies that will take a percentage of the money recovered as their fee .
And there are about 20,000 private police and military personnel in Iraq , working for the Defense Department .
Throughout most of history , specific people were charged by those in power to keep the peace , collect taxes and wage wars .
Corruption and incompetence were the norm , and justice was scarce .
It is for this very reason that , since the 1600s , European governments have been built around a professional civil service to both enforce the laws and protect rights .
Private security guards turn this bedrock principle of modern government on its head .
Whether it ’s FedEx policemen in Tennessee who can request search warrants and make arrests ; a privately funded surveillance helicopter in Jackson , Miss. , that can bypass constitutional restrictions on aerial spying ; or employees of Capitol Special Police in North Carolina who are lobbying to expand their jurisdiction beyond the specific properties they protect — privately funded policemen are not protecting us or working in our best interests .

Soldier Who Sued Army Facing Threats
By Jason Leopold
t r u t h o u t | Report
Friday 21 September 2007
An Army specialist stationed in Iraq said he has been repeatedly threatened by other US soldiers after word spread that he sued the secretary of defense and an Army major this week for allegedly retaliating against the soldier when he convened a meeting of atheists , according to the founder of a military watchdog organization that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the soldier and has been in close contact with him since then .
Jeremy Hall , 22 , who is on active duty at Combat Operations Base Speicher , Iraq , sent an urgent email message to Mikey Weinstein , founder and president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , whose organization is a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Pentagon .
The email said a fellow soldier has threatened to " beat his ass , " called him an " atheist ass pirate " and " a faggot " and enlisted a " lynch mob " of other soldiers to intimidate Hall because of the allegations
Hall made against the military in a lawsuit Weinstein 's foundation and Hall filed Monday in US District Court in Kansas City .
Weinstein said he has been in contact with supporters of his foundation who have reported the posting of messages on military and civilian - based blogs , such as military.com , apparently threatening Hall with " fragging , " a term used by the military in which an unpopular soldier could be killed by intentional friendly fire during combat .
" Mikey , I hope I am not a victim of a hate crime while I sleep tonight , " Hall wrote in an email to Weinstein Thursday evening .
" I do not want to die for my country this way .
[ The soldier ] is threatening to beat my ass and all sorts of things .
I may be harmed or worse .
I am afraid for my safety .
I can't sleep , man ....
I just lay in my bunk for two hours and I could n't sleep . "
Messages left for several Pentagon spokespeople Thursday evening - on cell phones and at the Defense Department - were not returned .
Weinstein said late Thursday evening that he has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the blog postings threatening Hall with " fragging . "
But Weinstein said he takes the threat of violence against Hall seriously and has already reached out to senior officials in the Pentagon as well as senior Army operations officials to ensure Hall 's safety .
Weinstein is a former White House attorney under Ronald Reagan , was general counsel to H. Ross Perot , and was formerly an Air Force judge advocate general ( JAG ) .
Weinstein said he demanded " that the Secretaries of Defense and the US Army take absolute immediate action to do two things : provide for the comprehensive personal safety of our co-plaintiff Army Specialist Jeremy Hall , and immediately investigate all US Army personnel who may have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice by threatening the personal safety and indeed the life of Specialist Hall .
If one hair on Hall 's head is touched there will be hell to pay . "
Hall 's lawsuit alleges that his First Amendment rights were violated beginning last Thanksgiving when , because of his atheist beliefs , he declined to participate in a Christian prayer ceremony commemorating the holiday .
" Immediately after plaintiff made it known he would decline to join hands and pray , he was confronted , in the presence of other military personnel , by the senior ranking ... staff sergeant , who asked plaintiff why he did not want to pray , whereupon plaintiff explained because he is an atheist , " says the lawsuit , a copy of which was provided to Truthout .
" The staff sergeant asked plaintiff what an atheist is and plaintiff responded it meant that he ( plaintiff ) did not believe in God .
This response caused the staff sergeant to tell plaintiff that he would have to sit elsewhere for the Thanksgiving dinner .
Nonetheless , plaintiff sat at the table in silence and finished his meal . "
Moreover , the complaint alleges that on August 7 , when Hall received permission by an Army chaplain to organize a meeting of other soldiers who shared his atheist beliefs , his supervisor , Army Major Paul Welborne , broke up the gathering and threatened to retaliate against the soldier by charging him with violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
The complaint also alleges that Welborne vowed to block Hall 's reenlistment in the Army if the atheist group continued to meet - a violation of Hall 's First Amendment rights under the Constitution .
Welborne is named as a defendant in the lawsuit .
" During the course of the meeting , defendant Welborne confronted the attendees , disrupted the meeting and interfered with plaintiff Hall 's and the other attendees ' rights to discuss topics of their interests , " the lawsuit alleges .
The complaint charges that Hall , who is based at Fort Riley , Kansas , has been forced to " submit to a religious test as a qualification to his post as a soldier in the United States Army , " a violation of Article VI , Clause 3 of the Constitution .
The Military Religious Freedom Foundation said Defense Secretary Robert Gates is named as a defendant in the lawsuit because he has allowed the military to engage in " a pattern and practice of constitutionally impermissible promotions of religious beliefs within the Department of Defense and the United States military . "
The lawsuit seeks an injunction against Welborne from further engaging in behavior " that has the effect of establishing compulsory religious practices " and asks that Gates prevent Welborne from interfering with Hall 's free speech rights .
" This landmark federal litigation is just the first of a galaxy of new lawsuits that will be expeditiously filed against the Pentagon in a concentrated effort to preserve the precious religious liberties guaranteed by our beautiful United States Constitution , " Weinstein said Monday .
" Today , we are boldly stabbing back against an unconstitutional heart of darkness , a contagion of fundamentalist religious supremacy and triumphalism noxiously dominating the command and control of the technologically most lethal organization ever created by humankind : our honorable and noble United States armed forces . "

Schools Minister Jim Knight says " learning must take precedence "
It says efforts must be made to accommodate religious clothing , but stresses the importance of teachers and pupils being able to make eye contact .
It comes after a girl failed in a legal bid to overturn her school 's niqab ban .
Islamic groups have been divided in their response - some " shocked " and others welcoming the guidance .
Headteachers ' leaders have applauded the decision , saying that it would provide " clarity " and " reassurance " for schools .
It 's not right that schools should have to be arguing this out case by case
Head teacher
Veil court case school
Why Muslims wear the veil
Do we need to see a face ?
The issue of religious dress has become an increasingly complicated one for schools in recent years , with a handful of high profile court cases over the right to wear a full veil .
A court victory by a Buckinghamshire school ( which can not be named for legal reasons ) has prompted the updated guidance .
The school argued the veil made communication between teachers and pupils difficult and thus hampered learning .
Teachers needed to be able to tell if a pupil was enthusiastic , paying attention or even distressed but full - face veils prevented this , it said .
This position was upheld by the High Court - which refused to grant a judicial review - and is expected to form a key part of the guidance .
' Consult parents '
The guidance says schools need to be able to identify individual pupils in order to maintain good order and spot intruders .
The guidance has divided opinion within the Muslim community
" If a pupil 's face is obscured for any reason the teacher may not be able to judge their engagement with learning or secure their participation in discussions and practical activities , " it adds .
Schools minister Jim Knight said : " Schools should consult parents and the wider community when setting uniform policy .
" And while they should make every effort to accommodate social , religious or medical requirements of individual pupils , the needs of safety , security and effective learning in the school must always take precedence . "
The head teacher of the Buckinghamshire school , who also cannot be named , said it would be very useful to have some clear guidance from the Department for Education and Skills ( DfES ) .
" It 's not right that schools should have to be arguing this out case by case , " she told the BBC News website .
" Obviously there 's a trade - off between schools retaining autonomy over school uniform decisions , on the other hand we will have some very clear guidance from the DfES within which to work . "
' Dismayed '
There were divided responses from the Muslim community .
The chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission , Massoud Shadjareh , said he was " dismayed " by the DfES guidance .
Many schools allow Muslim girls to wear head scarves
" Successive ministers dealing with education issues have failed to give proper guidance when requested by human rights campaigners about schools ' obligations regarding religious dress , including the head scarf .
" To now proceed to issue guidance against Muslim communities is simply shocking , " he said .
But the Muslim Council of Britain 's education spokesman , Tahir Alam , said that the new guidance did not " alter the position very much " and said " the vast majority of schools are able to solve these issues locally " .
Dr Tag Hargey of the Muslim Education Centre welcomed the guidance .
" When you conceal the face , that actually not only dehumanises the person involved , but also creates a chasm , a gap , a bridge of non-understanding between communities and I think the sooner we can get rid of this veil , this face veiling , this face masking in Muslim societies across Britain , so much the better . "
' Equality issue '
Ayshah Ishmael , a teacher at a Muslim girls ' school in Preston who wears the niqab away from the classroom , told the BBC wearing the veil promoted equality .
She said : " You 're judged for who you are and not what you are , so I think there are two arguments to the whole equality issue . "
The DfES said it was not ordering or advising head teachers to ban the veil , simply confirming that they have the ability to do so if they wish , so long as they carry out proper consultation .
Association of School and College Leaders ' general secretary Dr John Dunford said he was pleased the government is supporting school leaders in upholding school uniforms .
" Repeated and blatant breaches of uniform policy undermine the school ethos , " he added .

Coverage of the iPhone in the Bits blog .
Times Topics : iPhone
Today , I had meetings with Steve Jobs and then Phil Schiller , Apple ’s director of worldwide marketing .
I basically played with the iPhone the entire hour .
Here are some of the things you ca n’t tell without actually handling and using the iPhone :
* It feels amazing in your hand .
Not like an iPod , not like a Treo — but something new .
It ’s so thin , and the rounded stainless - steel edges are so smooth , you can excuse its larger - than - Treo façade .
When you ’re on a call , it ’s so cool how the screen turns off to save power , thanks to its proximity sensor .
* You operate the iPhone with your fingertips .
Apart from buttons that appear on the touch screen , the only physical buttons are volume up / down , ringer on / off , sleep / wake and a Home button .
Apple went through numerous iterations of the glass surface , trying to find one that ’s not too slick or too rough , or that shows grease and fingerprints too much .
You still get finger streaks , but they ’re relatively subtle and a quick wipe on your sleeve takes care of them .
* During my one test call , the sound quality was loud and clear .
Of course , your mileage ( and your Cingular signal ) will vary .
* Typing is difficult .
The letter keys are just pictures on the glass screen , so of course there ’s no tactile feedback .
Software helps a lot .
You can afford to make a lot of typos as you muddle through a word , because the software analyzes which keys you * might * have meant and figures out the word you wanted .
Its best guess appears just under what you ’ve typed ; if it ’s correct , you tap the Space bar to accept it and continue .
I typed a couple of e-mail messages with lots of typos but eventually 100 percent accuracy , thanks to this auto - correct feature .
( My testing did n’t involve proper names , however . )
Bottom line : Heavy BlackBerry addicts may not want to jump ship just yet .
* The phone wo n’t be available until June , so some of its software is n’t finished yet .
As I tapped my way into obscure corners of the phone , Mr. Jobs pointed out a couple of spots where only a placeholder graphic was available .
* Both in the onstage demo and during my hands - on hour , the Web speed was OK — not great , but OK .
But all of this used the phone ’s built - in Wi-Fi , not Cingular ’s notoriously slow Edge network .
I could n’t help wondering how bad the speed will be when you ’re connecting over the cellular airwaves .
( Here again , though , I was playing with a prototype whose software will undergo a lot of fine - tuning between now and June . )
* I tried out the camera .
It was really cool to frame a shot using the HUGE 3.5 - inch screen ; it ’s rare to find that big a screen on any camera .
The refresh rate felt typical of a camera - phone to me , but Mr. Jobs said that it would be much smoother by the time the phone is done .
* The Web browsing experience is incredible .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Amid an uproar over the huge demand for seats to pop idol Hannah Montana ’s tour , a U.S. federal judge on Monday barred the use of automated software to make mass ticket purchases from the leading box - office service Ticketmaster .

U.S. District Court Judge Audrey Collins issued a preliminary injunction against Pittsburgh - based software maker RMG Technologies , whose computer programs , Ticketmaster says , have enabled scalpers to gain rapid , repeated access to its online retail system .
The court order stems from a lawsuit brought against RMG by Ticketmaster , a unit of IAC / InterActiveCorp , in April , before tickets for the 54 - date Hannah Montana concert tour went on sale .
But abuse of the popular ticket retailing system by brokers and resellers has grown “ more and more brazen ” since then , said Joe Freeman , a lawyer for Ticketmaster .
Ticketmaster says RMG software enables digital scalpers to breach its Internet box - office system and electronically cut in line ahead of regular human customers to scoop up large numbers of tickets that can then be resold at highly inflated prices .
“ They ’re cheating consumers out of a fair shot at these tickets , and we ’re not going to stand for it anymore , ” Freeman said .
The practice has come under investigation by the attorneys general of at least three states -- Missouri , Arkansas and Pennsylvania -- who are looking into whether ticket resellers are violating state consumer protection laws .
State authorities were reacting in large part to a public outcry over crushing demand for seats to the upcoming Hannah Montana tour -- and soaring markups of those seats as they showed up for sale in the secondary ticket market on Web sites like Ticketliquidator.com , StubHub.com and Gotickets.com .
Hannah Montana is the TV alter ego of 14 - year - old Miley Cyrus , daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus .
She plays a teenager living a double life as a young rock star on the hit Disney Channel cable show .
Her TV character has released two top - selling albums during the past year .
Her “ Best of Both Worlds Tour , ” which opens October 18 in St. Louis , has become the hottest show of the year , with average ticket prices rising to $ 237 earlier this month , exceeding the going rate for adult acts such as the Police , Bruce Springsteen and Van Halen .
Scalpers and brokers were reported to be seeking as much as $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 for a Hannah Montana ticket .
The starting face value of those tickets for two Los Angeles - area shows ranged from $ 26 to $ 66 a seat , according to Ticketmaster .
Neither RMG executives nor its attorneys were immediately available for comment on the judge ’s ruling .
But a spokesman for San Francisco - based StubHub , a unit of online auctioneer eBay Inc. , has said that insatiable demand , not unscrupulous behavior , was driving up prices on the resale market .
Judge Collins ’ order bars RMG from “ creating , trafficking in , facilitating the use of or using computer programs or other automatic devices to circumvent ” the copy protection system on Ticketmaster ’s Web site .
It also prohibits RMG from using information gained from the Ticketmaster site to create computer programs designed to evade its copy protection and regulation systems .

Facebook SIMSBURY , Conn . 
At 79 , Patricia Berberich is certainly old enough to have heard of Rosie the Riveter , but when it came to placing a face with the name , she admits her mind was blank .
So , when the woman dining with her one evening this spring at the McLean retirement home mentioned having been the model for artist Norman Rockwell 's World War II - era heroine , Berberich politely excused herself to do a little research .
" My instinct was to get right to the Internet and look it up , " she said .
" Then I sent off to ( the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge , Mass . ) to get a poster so she could sign it . "
Berberich was hardly the first to make that request of Rosie , whose real name is Mary Doyle Keefe .
Since posing for Rockwell in 1942 , she has signed countless posters and autographs .
The painting , for which Keefe posed twice and was paid $ 10 , came to embody the can - do attitude of American women whose work helped win the war .
It is arguably among the most recognizable images of World War II and transformed Keefe from a small - town switchboard operator into an American icon .
Keefe thinks of herself as an accidental celebrity and still gets a thrill out of telling her story of posing for Rockwell when she was a red - haired 19 - year - old .
She went on to graduate from college , work as a dental hygienist , marry and raise four children .
Now 85 and living in an apartment at the McLean Home , Keefe said the buzz surrounding her being Rosie began spreading soon after she moved there from New Hampshire two years ago to be closer to a daughter who lives in Granby .
" I got a kick out of it , " said Berberich , a neighbor at McLean who dines with Keefe regularly .
" I remember my classmates going off to war after graduation . "
" It 's quite an honor to be asked by Norman Rockwell to pose for a picture , " added Marion Strindberg , another neighbor at the home .
" It 's generally known , but she just told a small group of us .
She is very quiet about it .
Word went around slowly . "
Asked to recount the serendipitous events that led to her fateful encounter with Rockwell , Keefe recites a well - worn script she committed to memory long ago .
She was living with her family in Arlington , Vt. , at the time , not far from where Rockwell lived with his family and had a studio .
" The telephone office was in my mom 's house , and he would come in to pay his bill , " Keefe recalled .
" He knew who I was and asked if I would sit for a picture .
Gene Pelham , his photographer who moved from New York , would take a picture and Norman Rockwell would cut out what he wanted .
You did n't sit there while he was painting the whole thing , which was good . "
For the first sitting , Keefe wore a white blouse beneath her overalls and a pair of saddle shoes .
The look , however , was n't quite right , she said , so Rockwell had her pose a second time wearing a blue blouse and penny loafers Keefe said she has received endless ribbing about the now famous image of a brawny working woman breaking for lunch with a ham sandwich in hand , pneumatic riveter on her lap and copy of Hitler 's Mein Kampf underfoot .
Her body looked nothing like that in real life , said Keefe , especially the muscular arms .
Rockwell sent her a written apology .
" The kidding you took was all my fault , because I really thought you were the most beautiful woman I had ever seen , " Rockwell wrote in the 1967 letter .
Rosie first appeared in 1943 on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post and , later , on war bond posters .
Keefe said she did n't think of herself as special .
Lots of townspeople posed for Rockwell during the 10 years he lived in Arlington , she said , including her uncle , who was in all four of the well - known Rockwell images popularly known as the " Four Freedoms " .
Keefe 's oldest son , Bill Keefe , recalls family trips to Arlington as a boy when his mother would walk down the street saying this or that person " was in such and such a painting by Rockwell . "
" It was always a topic of conversation , " he said .
" It 's part of the Keefe family legacy .
We never had a problem coming up with a unique school project or something for show and tell . "
But perhaps his proudest memory is of the Rockwell exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , about 10 years ago , to which his parents were invited and given a private tour .
And in 2002 , Mary Keefe and her late husband , Bob , were invited to New York by Sotheby 's for an auction at which the Rosie the Riveter painting fetched $ 4.9 million , the world record for Rockwell 's work at that time .
There , and at dozens of other events , Mary Keefe has gladly signed posters and given brief talks about her experience .
She also has been a guest on national television , appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Good Morning America during the 50th anniversary of D - Day .
At McLean , she keeps a lower profile , but even there can't escape attention .
To promote a Nov. 5 flu shot clinic for employees , Denise Yorio , a registered nurse and staff infection control practitioner , put up posters bearing Rosie 's image and asked Keefe to autograph pictures .
Nurses dressed up in " Rosie get - ups , " she said , and rolled up their sleeves .
" We made it a big social event , " Yorio said .
" We 've never done so many in such a short time . "

In my last post on security , I promised a tale , and I ought to deliver on that before it becomes nothing more than a good intention .
Some time ago , so long ago that it no longer matters , I bought a piece of network stereo equipment .
It was one of these little boxes that lets you play MP3s , etc. through your stereo .
I got it because it was a cute little system running Linux , had a MIPS processor , a web site for developers , extension and enhancement tools in Java , and so on .
I used it for a couple of months , and played with the Java - based remote control application for it and then decided to do some more serious work on it .
I rolled my eyes that it only had telnet to get to it , but telnetted to it and was met with :
#
which I just stared at for a moment .
It did n’t even register for a good twenty or thirty seconds before I had the wit to type
ls
and was met with something akin to :
bin dev home mnt proc tmp boot etc lib usr sbin
and that did n’t even register with me until I finally then typed
pwd
and was met with
/
and I made a loud two - word exclamation , of which the former was “ oh ” and the latter is left as an exercise for you , Gentle Reader , but there are two obvious candidates .
Yup , for the last couple of months , sitting bear - ass nekkid on the Internet was a Linux box with open telnet and a root shell .
No username , no password , just a root shell .
I said the other obvious candidate word .
I also considered ( again ) getting a firewall .
My network does n’t have a firewall .
Part of it is that I like the road feel of the packets whizzing by .
Part of it is that by the time I open up enough ports to do useful things , I ’m just closing down the ones that do n’t have services on them anyway .
Part of it is also that of the three times I ’ve had serious security problems on my network , one of them was because my IDS box got rooted , and one was because the firewall got rooted .
For me , adding a firewall adds complexity , and that lowers security .
( That last time was when I was traveling with my SO who wanted to send me an email from an utterly ancient netnews program that knows nothing of SMTP - AUTH .
Never reconfigure your email infrastructure from five thousand miles away while jetlagged .
A couple of days later , you will ask yourself , “ I wonder why the SMTP server logs have gotten so big . ”
Fortunately for me , I caught it before the blacklists did . )
I yanked the music box off the network and connected to it directly ( one cable , just it and me ) .
Looking through the thing , I did n’t see what anyone who was now using it for anything .
I checked the IDS logs and there was nothing that leapt out at me to as suspicious traffic .
That seemed odd , because how could it not have been owned ?
I thought about it for a bit , and thought about it more as I reflashed the critter .
Then I laughed , because I realized that the tools that probe for vulnerable boxes are not going to be looking for # .
It was then too late to tell , but I allowed myself to think that maybe the box had n’t been compromised , as the evidence suggested .
With the machine rebuilt , I connected to it directly with telnet and started probing around for putting a password ( like / etc / passwd ) .
There was none .
There was no SSH , either .
I fulminated on the developer fora about this security stupidity .
I found the instructions on how to build the right cross-compiled Linux setup to build binaries for it , and it was filled full of warnings about how to make sure you did this , set that compiler switch , and if you did n’t , things would n’t work , and you get to reflash the box .
This was n’t how I was wanting to spend my Saturday , so I turned the box off , and went to do something else .
As I did , I thought about the situation .
I became increasingly amused that ( apparently ) the box had n’t been compromised .
I convinced myself that this is because the bad guys would n’t recognize the box as vulnerable .
As I grumbled and thought more about how to lock down the box and then something occurred to me — anyone who wants to own the box has to go to the same trouble to make it be a productive member of their botnet community as I do to do the opposite , but they ’re at a disadvantage because they also have to protect it from me .
Since it ’s easier to find some unpatched Windows box than it is to set up a MIPS cross - compile sandbox , even if they can tell that has an open root shell , it ’s not economically viable .
Think of it as Mutual Assured Annoyance , Economic - Based Intrusion Prevention , Security Through Stupidity , or proving old adage , “ In the land of the blind lion , the one - eyed zebra does n’t have to run very fast . ”
A couple of weeks later , I solved the whole problem when a new product was introduced that did exactly what I wanted ( to be able to play music on my laptop on my stereo ) at half the price and no icky telnet .
The poor little music box now sits face - down , forlorn , and dust - covered on a shelf .
Oct. 25 , 2007  -- Environmental and public health experts overwhelmingly denounced editing by the White House of a federal health agency head 's testimony to Congress Tuesday .
Significant deletions were made from the testimony , concerning global warming and the potential impact on human health .
The original , unedited testimony presented to Congress by Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and obtained by ABC News was 14 pages long , but the White House Office of Management and Budget edited the final version down to a mere six pages .
Scientists and public health organizations called the move " frustrating , " " terrible " and " appalling . "
The edits essentially deleted all sections that referred to climate change as a public health concern -- including the risks of increased food - borne and waterborne diseases , worsening extreme weather events , worsening air pollution and the effect of heat stress on humans .
" Dr. Gerberding is the lead of the premiere public health agency in the U.S. , " said Kim Knowlton , a science fellow on global warming and health at the National Resources Defense Council in New York .
" It 's shocking that she was not allowed to say in a public discussion some of these vital details .
" One has to wonder why was this is so threatening to the White House . "
In response to the controversy that followed , White House press secretary Dana Perino stated that the White House Office of Management and Budget redacted the majority of the information on the basis that the science in the testimony did not match the science reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
However , a review of the latest report on climate change issued by the IPCC -- the organization that shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore two weeks ago for efforts to educate the public about climate change -- shows that it contains an entire chapter about the human health impacts .
The IPCC report describes in detail how climate change would lead to effects such as heat waves , cold spells , extreme weather events and weather disasters , air pollution , increased infectious diseases , and increased waterborne and vector - borne infectious diseases .
These same effects , listed point - by - point in Gerberding 's original CDC testimony , were among the casualties in the edited version .
" The science that Dr. Gerberding was trying to bring forward was based on the IPCC report , " Knowlton said .
" It 's quite stunning that only weeks after that group received the Nobel prize for their work that the White House is deleting scientific statements based on that work .
What was cut was the section with the details -- the most detailed sections on the health impact of global warming , including descriptions of the links that are coming out of the IPCC report . "
There was overwhelming agreement in the scientific community that the information was in no way alarmist or controversial .
" This is really standard information available to anyone on the issue , " said Dale Jamieson , director of environmental studies at New York University .
" What was removed was an uncontroversial report of what is currently known and believed about the fact of climate change , its health effects and its likely impacts on the United States . "
" All of these [ topics ] are routinely mentioned in public health coursework across the nation , " agreed Dr. Alan Ducatman , a professor of community medicine at the West Virginia University School of Medicine .
" Each ?
can be found in the pages of leading journals , such as Science and Nature .
If anything , they understate the problem . "
Censoring the Science
The problem , according to the unedited version of the testimony , is that climate change is likely to have a significant impact on health -- and not only due to heat waves and disease epidemics .
The CDC report highlighted other issues addressed in the IPCC report , including how extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes will cause deaths , large - scale population displacement and contamination of drinking water .
Other concerns included how increases in temperatures encourage the formation of ground level ozone , the primary ingredient of smog which can cause permanent lung damage and aggravate chronic lung diseases , such as asthma .
Also , climate change is predicted to alter agriculture , leading to the scarcity of some foods and increases in prices , a concern for the poor in America .
Following the deletion of these details , the remaining parts of the testimony discussed the CDC 's preparedness measures -- but seemed to omit what it was they were preparing for .
" The redacted version just is a very strange document .
It becomes a kind of recitation of what the CDC does in general , " Jamieson said .
" It becomes strangely decontextualized once you take out all the [ relevant ] material . "
" We talk of the politicization of science , " said Dr. Linda Rosenstock , dean of the UCLA School of Public Health .
" In the politicization of this topic -- the science was n't changed , it was deleted . "
Could Edits Hurt Disaster Response ?
Public health experts also expressed their fear over the potential impacts of ignoring the deleted sections of the testimony .
" If communities -- states and counties -- are n't given the information and the resources ?
if there is n't planning to be prepared for these global warming related disasters , then our governments wo n't be able to help us , " said Knowlton .
Jamieson agreed .
" By not informing the public or emphasizing preparedness , you set yourself up for a Katrina - like failure , but on a global scale . "
Significant concerns were also raised that damaging the credibility of the CDC could threaten Americans ' welfare in the long run .
" We know from previous health threats , for example anthrax , 9/11 , and concerns about pandemic influenza , that having a credible and believable voice from our highest officials is the best way to inform the public and get a reasonable response , " said Rosenstock .
" If we have antics -- and I mean the word antics -- where we undermine the credibility of the most credible public health official , then we hurt our ability to respond to health threats . "
Knowlton also felt that if information is not forthcoming from public officials , Americans may need to educate themselves .
" People really need to be reading and learning , " she said .
" Even if the White House does n't want them to . "
WASHINGTON – In a startling admission , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said today that American officials had bungled the Maher Arar case but she did n't apologize or offer to remove him from the U.S. no -fly list .
Fielding questions on Capitol Hill , Rice carefully conceded that U.S. officials had mishandled the case and said they did n't properly communicate with Canada before Arar , a Canadian citizen , was sent to Syria where he was tortured as a suspected terrorist in 2002 .
" We do not think that this case was handled as it should have been , " Rice said .
" We do absolutely not wish to transfer anyone to any place in which they might be tortured . "
Rice pledged to improve the way the U.S. government deals with Canada .
" Our communication with the Canadian government about this was by no means perfect ; in fact , it was quite imperfect , " Rice told the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives .
" We have told the Canadian government that we did not think this was handled particularly well in terms of our own relationship and that we will try to do better in the future . "
In Canada , Arar and Prime Minister Stephen Harper welcomed the remarks , calling them " encouraging . "
Rice 's comments came as a surprise because the U.S. administration had long resisted public admissions of shortcomings in the Arar affair .
But she offered no explanation for why Arar was sent to Syria by U.S. officials – whom Arar is suing – and did n't acknowledge that he was mistreated there .
Rice also suggested Arar will continue to be considered a security threat by the United States .
" We and the Canadians do not have exactly the same understanding of what is possible in the future for Mr. Arar in terms of travel and the like . "
Asked by Democrat William Delahunt whether U.S. authorities relied on diplomatic assurances from Syria that Arar would n't be tortured , Rice said she had forgotten some of the details but would provide a " full accounting " later .
Syria is routinely cited by the State Department in annual reports as employing 38 torture techniques during interrogations .
" You 're aware of the fact that he was tortured for a year ? " asked Delahunt .
" I am aware of claims that were made , congressman , " replied Rice .
Arar , a telecommunications engineer , was arrested during a stopover in New York on his way home to Canada .
U.S. authorities sent him to Syria after the RCMP said he was a suspected Islamic extremist .
A commission of inquiry in Canada last year said the Mounties followed up with their U.S. counterparts by admitting they had no proof Arar was aligned with terrorists .
Justice Dennis O'Connor said the Americans did n't keep Canadians in the loop or tell them Arar was going to be deported .
The commission cleared Arar of any links to terrorism and Ottawa gave him a $ 10.5 million in compensation .
Harper has called for a similar apology from American officials and wants Arar to be allowed to travel to the United States .
" We are encouraged by the comments issued by ( Rice ) regarding the Arar case , " Harper told the Commons on Wednesday .
" We have raised this issue on many occasions with the Americans and we hope that the U.S. government will act to fully address this matter . "
For his part , Arar also called it an " encouraging step . "
" I fully support the very important work of the congressional committees which are trying to get to the bottom of the extraordinary rendition program . "
But Montreal Liberal MP Irwin Cotler , a former justice minister , said Rice 's comments are too little , too late .
" For the Americans to say they 're acting improperly is an understatement .
They in fact breached both international law and their own domestic law in sending Maher Arar to Syria , " he said in Ottawa .
" There 's no way you can keep somebody on a no - fly list when the person was not only an innocent person but was the innocent victim of the actions of three governments . "
Rice 's comments are " by no means adequate , " said NDP Leader Jack Layton , calling it " outrageous " that Arar still can't travel to the United States with his family .
" Obviously our government has n't done its job .
Thank goodness we have some members of Congress who have been standing up for Maher Arar . "

U.S. officials have promised to collaborate with Canada on any future terrorism cases involving Canadians .
David Wilkins , the U.S. ambassador to Canada , pointed out that in January 2004 , the two governments exchanged letters pledging they would " notify each other when a citizen of one country is subject to involuntary removal from the other country to a third country . "
The U.S. government has always maintained that Arar was merely deported , not rendered to a third country to be tortured .
American officials have said they have their own reasons for keeping Arar out of the United States .
But U.S. legislators and Canadian officials , including Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day , who have seen all the intelligence on Arar say that 's nonsense .
A report last week suggested the United States still considers Arar a security threat based on an allegation that he was seen in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s by a man who led training at a terrorist camp – a charge Arar has denied .
Arar's U.S. lawyer , Maria LaHood , said Rice 's comments are a step in the right direction .
" It 's certainly not an apology , but it is something , " she said in an interview from New York .
" She 's admitting some wrongdoing , some mishandling . "
LaHood said it 's unlikely there will be a direct impact on Arar 's lawsuit against U.S. officials .
The suit has been blocked so far by government lawyers .
Arguments are scheduled for Nov. 9 in New York at a U.S. Court of Appeals .
The case was dismissed by a lower court that agreed with the government 's position that there 's a great need for secrecy for national security reasons and to maintain good relations with Canada .
" How can it be that squelching justice can improve our relations with Canada ? " asked LaHood .
" `I 'm hopeful the congressional pressure will keep up ... and this will continue to unravel the U.S. position . "
Republicans joined with Democrats last week to apologize to Arar at a congressional committee hearing where he appeared by video link from Ottawa .
New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler , who has seen the secret dossier on Arar , said there 's nothing to justify " this campaign of vilification against you or to deny you entry into this country . "
" This was a kidnapping , " he told the hearing , called to put pressure on U.S. officials to end the practice of rendition .
Arar was the first to challenge the policy and has become the most visible victim of the program in which terror suspects are transferred to third countries without court approval .

Ubuntu Xorg maintainer Bryce Harrington recently demonstrated the BulletProof - X feature that is planned for inclusion in Ubuntu 7.10 .
BulletProof - X provides a failsafe mode which will ensure that users never have to manually configure their graphics hardware settings from the command line .
If Xorg fails to start , the failsafe mode will initiate with minimalistic settings , low resolution , and a limited number of colors .
The failsafe mode also automatically runs Ubuntu 's new GTK - based display configuration utility so that users can easily test various display settings and choose a configuration that will work properly with their hardware .
The display configuration utility provides a simple mouse - driven interface that is very intuitive .
The configuration utility even has limited multihead suport , but unfortunately does n't support more than two screens yet .
One of the most impressive new features in Ubuntu 's BulletProof - X implementation is support for reading monitor settings from a Windows driver CD .
" Unfortunately , it does n't work to select just any of the generic monitors , so users may find they need to trial - and - error a solution .
Fortunately , there is a cool new feature — Add Model which allows users to add a new monitor by using the Windows driver CD that comes with their monitor , " Harrington writes .
" This uses a script to parse the Windows *.inf file to get the hsync , vsync , edid , dpms , and other info to update the database locally . "
BulletProof - X represents a big step forward for graphics hardware support on the Linux platform , but there are still some gaps .
Poor support for more elaborate multihead configurations , for instance , is one particular area where Linux still lags behind Windows and Mac OS X .
Despite the fact that the hardware support gap between Linux and proprietary platforms has n't entirely been closed yet , the effort that developers have invested in features like BulletProof - X deliver tangible usability improvements that contribute to a more positive user experience .
Bullet Proof - X and recent improvements to XRandR now resolve the vast majority of issues that once detracted from the quality of Linux graphics hardware support .
Although the feature works as demonstrated by Harrington , the code has n't landed in Ubuntu quite yet .
" There 's still some rough edges , " Harrington writes , " but this feature is nearly ready to go and I 'm expecting it to be in Gutsy [ Ubuntu 7.10 ] relatively soon . "
Those who wish to assist can provide feedback in the Xorg tester thread in the Ubuntu forums .
Nancy Grace Suffers Childbirth Complications
, talk show anchor for " Headline News " has been hospitalized for the treatment of blood clots in her lungs .
The former prosecutor was attending church on Sunday when she began to have difficulty breathing and was immediately taken to an undisclosed hospital .
Twin babies were born to the TV personality early this month .
Doctors induced labor because Grace , 48 , had developed pulmonary edema - fluid in the lungs .
The boy and girl were born two months prematurely and are expected to remain in the hospital for an extended period of time .
The talk show host is currently receiving treatment and is expected to be released from the hospital at the end of the week .
Prior to hosting Nancy Grace Headline News , she was the host of Court TV's Closing Arguments .
Claim : Photographs show thieving birds stealing quarters from a car wash .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2002 ]
Bill owns a company that manufactures and installs car wash systems .
Magic Wand Car Wash Systems just in case you want to buy one .
Bill ’s company installed a car wash system in Frederick , Md. for a gentleman .
Bill owns a company that manufactures and installs car wash systems .
Magic Wand Car Wash Systems just in case you want to buy one .
Bill ’s company installed a car wash system in Frederick , Md. for a gentleman .
Now understand that these are a complete system including the money changer and money taking machines .
The problem started when the new owner complained to Bill that he was losing significant amounts of money form his coin machines each week .
He went as far as to accuse Bill ’s employees of having a key to the boxes and ripping him off .
Bill just could n’t believe that his people would do that .
So they setup a trap for the thief .
Well they caught the thief in the act !
Scroll down to see the thief .
The bird had to go down in the machine and back up to get to the money !
That ’s three quarters he has in his mouth !
Another amazing thing Bill told us is that it was not one bird there were several working together .
Once they identified the thief , they found over $ 4000 in quarters on the roof of the car wash and more under a nearby tree .
Origins : Many readers spotted this item about avian coin thieves on the Utah Birds web site .
The Utah birds folks were e-mailed the story and found it interesting enough to put it up on their site , but they initially did n’t know anything more about it .
All the information that could be gleaned from this message — that a car wash in Frederick , Maryland , installed by someone named Bill had supposedly been losing thousands of quarters to coin - stealing birds — was n’t much to go on .
A newsperson from 98 Rock FM radio in Baltimore was kind enough to supply us with the missing details .
The car wash pictured above is actually in Fredericksburg , Virginia , not Frederick , Maryland .
Bill Dougherty at Magic Wand Inc. , the car wash outfit that installs and maintains these machines , confirmed that birds had indeed been making off with hundreds of quarters per day .
As described above , after Mr. Dougherty discovered the Fredericksburg car wash machine was coming up several hundred dollars short per week , he initially suspected his employees of using pass keys to loot the machine .
When he set undertook a surveillance mission with a camera in hand to catch the thieves in action he did indeed manage to snap pictures of the perpetrators in the act , but they were n’t quite what he expected .
Not only were the “ thieves ” who were stealing the quarters of the avian variety ; they were working in tandem to do so : one bird would go up inside the machine to jimmy coins loose , and the other birds would grab them and fly off with them .
Starlings , the birds pictured here , are often attracted to bright , shiny objects and will collect them for nesting or mate - attraction purposes whenever the opportunity presents itself .
Most likely one or more starlings was attracted by the glint of overlooked quarters in the change cup and made off with them ; other starlings saw where the quarters were coming from and imitated the behavior , learning in the process how to work as teams to retrieve coins from inside the machine itself .
The claim that an accumulated $ 4,000 in change was retrieved from the roof of the car wash is an embellishment .
The car wash operator did not report finding any such rooftop stash , although his discovering a few hundred quarters on the ground around the machine some mornings was not uncommon .

In an article this past June , I looked at the disconnect between what some politicians say about automobiles , fuel mileage and the environment , and what they drive .
Exhibit A : presidential hopeful Barak Obama .
Mr. Obama famously berated the Detroit Economic Club about Motown ’s opposition to tighter fuel economy standards– with a Chrysler 300C stashed in his garage .
The instant the media exposed this hypocrisy , Obama traded his Hemi-powered luxobarge for the PC pol ’s pal : a Ford Escape Hybrid .
That got me wondering what our other national leaders might have parked in their garages …
As TTAC ’s resident numbers wonk , I was looking forward to tabulating a list of cars that our members of Congress drive .
I ’d then cross-reference it by party affiliation and auto industry involvement .
Just for fun , I ’d track down their voting record on issues like fuel economy and emission standards and see how they match up .
( Yeah , I know .
I need to get a life . )
So I wrote a letter to every U.S. Senator , thinking I ’d write the members of the House of Representatives at a later date .
I respectfully introduced myself and this website , and explained my request .
“ I ’m working on an article on the personal transportation choices of our national leaders [ which ] will reveal the automotive taste and style of our most important congressmen and women . ”
I asked for the make , model and year of the vehicle or vehicles they drive for work , and which cars they own personally ( registered both in their own or their spouse ’s name ) .
I also asked for their approximate yearly mileage .
After printing 99 letters ( this was right after Senator Thomas of Wyoming passed away ) , licking 99 envelopes and affixing 99 stamps , I dropped the missives in a mailbox and waited .
And waited .
And waited .
A little over three weeks later , I received an email from the “ Office of Senator Saxby Chambliss . ”
Thank you for contacting me regarding your website .
It is good to hear from you .
I am flattered that you have chosen to include me in your article on the personal transportation choices of national leaders .
However , because of my public status , I am unable to answer personal questions such as these .
I wish you the best of luck with your article and your website , and if I can ever be of assistance in the future , please do not hesitate to let me know .
I suspect the fact that I ’m a Georgia resident– eligible to vote for Senator Chambliss the next time he ’s up for reelection– inspired the politician to become the sole exception to Senatorial automotive omerata .
I repeat : no other United States Senator deigned to respond to my simple request for information .
Could it be , as Sen. Chambliss ’ email implies , that the Senators ’ personal transportation is a matter of national security ?
I can understand a Senator not wanting to identify his / her specific family car because of security concerns , but I did n’t ask for anything that would uniquely identify their vehicle , such as a license plate number or color .
Likewise , knowing what kind of car a U.S. Senator leases ( or the GSA provides ) for “ official business ” does n’t exactly sound like NSA - quality information .
In fact , the U.S. Government Printing Office prepares reports on the subject : " Statement of Disbursements of the House " and " Report of the Secretary of the Senate . ”
They list expenditures – including transportation expenses such as automobile leases– for all members of Congress .
However , these reports are n’t posted on line .
And the most recent version of the Senate report in the GPO bookstore dates back to 2003 .
So even though it ’s published twice a year , the information is n’t easily accessible to the public .
So what ’s with the veil of secrecy over our political employees ’ transportation choices ?
My guess : they do n’t want to be “ Obama’d . ”
Given the recent media fascination with fuel conservation , carbon footprints , alternative fuels and the trade deficit , our elected representatives can’t risk the general public finding out that they or their families drive SUVs , gas - guzzling luxobarges or ( gasp ! ) a car produced by a foreign - owned automaker .
It would n’t be the first time a member of Congress was caught with their pants down ( so to speak ) doing something contradictory to what they ’ve said on the record .
Fool them once ?
Anyway , it beggars belief that the men and women who are seeking to guide the automotive destiny for tens of millions of Americans , who will write the laws that will control the fate of one of our most important industries , would shrug off any idea of personal accountability .
I ’ve decided not to write the members of the House ; I do n’t want spend $ 170 on postage to be ignored again .
If any of you know what your federal reps drive , please post it in a comment below .
In the meantime I ’ll keep digging .

HPD lab reeling as man exonerated after 14 years Mix - up on DNA deals HPD lab another blow
Man exonerated 14 years after rape conviction
Ronald Gene Taylor Ronald Gene Taylor Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close HPD lab reeling as man exonerated after 14 years 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Few people listened when Ronald Gene Taylor declared himself innocent of a rape charge 14 years ago .
But the Harris County District Attorney 's Office finally agreed with him Wednesday , acknowledging that the scandal - plagued Houston Police Department crime lab was responsible for sending yet another wrong person to prison .
Incarcerated since being picked out of a lineup in June 1993 , Taylor was exonerated by new DNA testing this summer that showed another man was guilty of the crime .
Harris County District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal said he was sickened when he got the news late last week of the wrongful conviction .
" I feel awful , " Rosenthal said .
" Nobody wants to have an innocent person wrongfully convicted and sent to prison .
It 's a very regrettable thing . "
The exoneration of the 47 - year - old Taylor is another blow to the tattered reputation of the Houston Police Department crime lab , which has been rocked by scandal in recent years over the reliability of its testing and quality controls .
Rosenthal said he will work quickly toward Taylor 's release and pardon .
A hearing before state District Judge Denise Collins is scheduled for Oct. 12 .
Collins could release him on a personal recognizance bond at that time .
Lived near crime scene
The testing was done at the request of the Innocence Project , a New York - based legal clinic that assists prisoners in getting DNA evidence reviewed .
It has worked on the case since 1998 , when it was contacted by Taylor 's stepfather , who was pressing his son's claim of innocence .
The HPD crime lab originally reported that a bed sheet it tested did not contain semen , a conclusion that led an appeals judge to deny a request for additional testing .
Absent conclusive forensic evidence , Taylor 's conviction was based on an eyewitness identification by the victim and the fact that he lived nearby .
New tests on the sheet , done this summer by ReliaGene Technologies , yielded the DNA profile not of Taylor but another convicted sex offender serving time in Texas prisons .
The statute of limitations for prosecuting that case has expired , Rosenthal said .
Rosenthal said the victim's bad ID was understandable .
" The two men are remarkably similar in appearance , " he said .
" One can see how a mistake in identification can be made . "
Fleeting glimpse , in dark
According to Taylor 's lawyers , the victim never got a good look at her attacker .
She felt some of his features and saw him briefly as he was fleeing her apartment .
That glimpse came in a dark room lit only by a nearby street light .
She viewed the lineup in the presence of one police officer without witnesses or attorneys for the defendant , Taylor 's lawyers claim .
While watching the video , the victim suddenly recalled that the perpetrator had a tooth missing — not part of her initial description — and she identified Taylor , who had been placed in the lineup because a neighbor interviewed by police recalled seeing him in the area the night of the assault .
The Innocence Project has been critical of convictions based primarily on eyewitness identification by strangers .
Bolstered by numerous studies that show the fallibility of such IDs , it has called for major changes in the ways police departments present lineups to crime victims .
Taylor , the eldest of five children who were raised near Huntsville , had moved to Houston about six months before the May 1993 attack in which he was accused , according to his mother , Dorothy Henderson .
" We had concerns from the beginning that this was a case of mistaken identification , " said Shelton Sparks , the attorney who handled Taylor 's appeal .
" But we did not pursue DNA testing because we did not believe there was any evidence to be tested based on the ( HPD analyst's ) testimony at trial . "
Family did n't give up
As Taylor served his sentence in a prison in Tennessee Colony , his family worked to prove he had been wrongly convicted .
They got lucky when the Innocence Project agreed to take on the case .
" He always said that he was innocent , and I kept the faith that one day it would come through that it was not him , " Henderson said .
" We have suffered so much , but soon , now , when I can hug him and know that he is free , we will have peace . "
Henderson plans to attend next week 's court hearing , after which she hopes to take him home to Huntsville " for a home - cooked meal . "
Assistant District Attorney Jack Roady said he will work with Innocence Project lawyers to agree on findings of fact to present to Collins .
If she signs off on them , Taylor 's habeas corpus petition will be presented to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for final action .
Assuming Taylor is granted a pardon based on innocence , he would be eligible for compensation from the state at a rate of $ 50,000 per year of incarceration , for a total of $ 600,000 or more .
Taylor 's is the third conviction to crumble since scrutiny of work from the Houston crime lab began late in 2002 after news reports and an audit exposed poorly trained personnel and inaccurate work in the DNA division .
Two other men were released from prison after new DNA tests discredited HPD 's analyses .
Josiah Sutton was released from prison in March 2003 when DNA tests challenged the HPD work that helped secure his conviction in a 1998 rape .
Sutton received a pardon on the basis of innocence and the state has compensated him with more than $ 118,000 for the time he served .
George Rodriguez served more than 17 years in prison in the 1987 rape of a 14 - year - old girl before new forensic evidence discredited the HPD crime lab work on his case and led prosecutors to dismiss the case against him .
Since HPD 's crime lab problems first came to light , errors have been found in several types of analyses , including those of firearms and of controlled substances , casting doubt on thousands of convictions and unsettling the local justice system .
Faulty evidence in the cases against Rodriguez and Taylor included serology , the science of typing body fluids that was a precursor to DNA testing .
Independent investigators who studied the crime lab over 26 months and issued a final report in June have called the work of the HPD serology division among the most troubling and problematic work from the crime lab .
Their scientists identified about 180 cases in which HPD serology work had " major issues " and called for a review of those cases to determine whether the forensic evidence played an essential role in securing convictions .
Taylor 's case was not among those highlighted in the report .
The serologist who handled Taylor 's case worked in the lab from 1993 until 1996 .
Call for systematic review
The investigative team recommended the appointment of an independent " special master " to review those cases .
Local officials rejected the proposal .
Instead , HPD and the district attorney 's office have begun their own reviews of those cases .
Barry Scheck , a founder of the Innocence Project , said Taylor 's case should highlight the need for a systematic review .
" The Ronald Taylor case ought to be a galvanizing example of what has to be done to correct the historical injustices that have occurred because of the Houston crime lab , " Scheck said .
Scheck , other lawyers and local elected officials have begun working on a proposal to form a panel of lawyers to review these cases .
Rosenthal was receptive to the idea of such a panel , Scheck said , and the lawyers have contacted the presiding judge over Harris County 's courts , state District Judge Debbie Mantooth Stricklin , about how to proceed with the proposal .
" There has got to be an expeditious way to go through these cases and determine whether more testing is possible and appropriate , " Scheck said .
" That sort of vetting requires expertise , competence and an infrastructure to do that . "

For decades Burma ’s ruling military junta has governed through terror , determined to meet dissent with intimidation , detention and murder .
It is because of the military ’s particular cruelty that the story of the Buddhist monks of Burma is so compelling .
The last time the Burmese people stood up to their vicious government , thousands were killed .
Perhaps remembering this tragedy , the monks of Burma asked others not to join them when they began marching and praying in protest .
But the momentum of their movement could not be denied , and as the number of marching monks exploded from dozens to thousands in a matter of days , Buddhist nuns joined in , quickly followed by thousands of other Burmese who had come to watch .
The military was slow to react at first but , true to its nature , has now returned to violence as a means of putting down peaceful dissent .
We may never know the true number of murdered civilians , or the fate of many monks and others who have been abducted .
We do know that , despite arrests , tear gas , the closing of monasteries and flying bullets , the protest continues , at least for now .
We salute the courage of the monks of Burma , who , knowing all too well the cost , defied their brutal government to lead this saffron revolution .

Here on Earth we think of the poles as cold places , but on Neptune , it ’s just the opposite .
New images of the planet ’s southern pole show that it ’s actually 10 - degrees warmer than the rest of Neptune .
Now do n’t pack your bathing suit just yet , Neptune ’s average temperature is still - 200 degrees Celsius ( - 328 F ) ; so it ’s still really , really cold .
The images were gathered using the European Southern Observatory ’s Very Large Telescope ( now that ’s how you name a telescope ) .
The observatory uses a special mid-infrared camera / spectrometer to reveal the different temperatures across planet .
Obviously Neptune is different from the Earth , but consider this .
The planet is located 30 times farther away from the Sun than the Earth .
This means only 1/900th the sunlight reaches Neptune than what we get here on Earth .
Still , it ’s enough sunlight to warm up the southern pole , which is currently tilted towards the Sun .
It ’s been receiving the warmth from the Sun for about 40 years now , and the ongoing input of solar energy continuously heats up the polar region to the point that it ’s warmer than any other part of Neptune by about 10 degrees Celsius .
This heating also whips up the planets winds into some of the strongest in the Solar System .
On Neptune , winds can travel more than 2,000 km / hour , faster than any other planet – you definitely do n’t want to bring your swimsuit .
The temperatures in the region are high enough that methane gas , normally frozen out of the upper atmosphere , can actually leak out through the region .
And this helps explain why scientists have seen abundances of this molecule in the atmosphere .

“ I HAVE not failed .
I have just found 10,000 ways that wo n't work . ”
So said Thomas Edison , the prolific inventor , speaking of his laborious attempts to perfect the incandescent light bulb .
Although 10,000 trial - and - error attempts might sound a little over the top , an emerging technique for developing inventions knocks even Edison 's exhaustive approach into a cocked hat .
Evolutionary design , as it is known , allows a computer to run through tens of millions of variations on an invention until it hits on the best solution to a problem .
As its name suggests , evolutionary design borrows its ideas from biology .
It takes a basic blueprint and mutates it in a bid to improve it without human input .
As in biology , most mutations are worse than the original .
But a few are better , and these are used to create the next generation .
Evolutionary design uses a computer program called an evolutionary algorithm , which takes the initial parameters of the design ( things such as lengths , areas , volumes , currents and voltages ) and treats each like one gene in an organism .
Collectively , these genes comprise the product 's genome .
By randomly mutating these genes and then breeding them with other , similarly mutated genomes , new offspring designs are created .
These are subjected to simulated use by a second program .
If a particular offspring is shown not to be up to the task , it is discarded .
If it is promising , it is selectively bred with other fit offspring to see if the results , when subject to further mutation , can do even better .
The idea of evolutionary algorithms is not new .
Until recently , however , their use has been confined to projects such as refining the aerodynamic profiles of car bodies , aircraft fuselages and wings .
That is because only large firms have been able to afford the supercomputers needed to mutate and crossbreed large virtual genomes — and then simulate the behaviour of their offspring — for perhaps 20 m generations before the perfect design emerges .
What has changed , in this as in so much else , is the availability and cheapness of computing power .
According to John Koza of Stanford University , who is one of the pioneers of the field , evolutionary designs that would have taken many months to run on PCs are now feasible in days .
The result is that the range of applications to which the principles of evolutionary design are being applied is growing fast .
Among those revealed at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference held in London this summer were long - life USB memory sticks , superfast racing - yacht keels , ultra - high - bandwidth optical fibres , high performance Wi-Fi antennae ( evolved to avoid patent fees ) , cochlear implants that can optimise themselves to individual patients and a cancer - biopsy analyser that was evolved to match a human pathologist 's tumour - spotting skills .
How can evolution help improve a USB stick ?
It turns out that the storage transistors in these flash - memory devices are prone to being gummed up with electrostatic charge that they cannot dissipate .
That prevents them being erased , limiting the stick 's useful life .
A team at the University of Limerick in Ireland therefore evolved new signal - timing patterns that minimise the build - up of the disabling charge .
The result : USB sticks that last up to 30 times longer than their predecessors .
At the University of Sydney , in Australia , Steve Manos let an evolutionary algorithm come up with novel patterns in a type of optical fibre that has air holes shot through its length .
Normally , these holes are arranged in a hexagonal pattern , but the algorithm generated a bizarre flower - like pattern of holes that no human would have thought of trying .
It doubled the fibre 's bandwidth .
Meanwhile , Pierrick Legrand of the University of Bordeaux has used the method to optimise individual devices to the user .
The devices in question are cochlear implants , which help those hard of hearing to hear better .
One of the hardest tasks facing those who fit these devices is working out the precise choreography of the voltages and timings that need to be applied to the 20 or so electrodes embedded in the auditory nerve , in order to make them work properly .
The signals required vary from patient to patient and some people go many years before an audiologist gets it right .
Dr Legrand , however , has developed an evolution - based system that works on the fly .
It co-evolves several channels at a time , allowing a patient to tell his doctor how each pattern of electrode stimulation is faring .
Dr Legrand says that one patient , who had experienced a decade of trouble with his implant , had it fixed in a couple of days by the evolutionary method .
Perhaps the most cunning use of an evolutionary algorithm , though , is by Dr Koza himself .
His team at Stanford developed a Wi -Fi antenna for a client who did not want to pay a patent - licence fee to Cisco Systems .
The team fed the algorithm as much data as they could from the Cisco patent and told the software to design around it .
It succeeded in doing so .
The result is a design that does not infringe Cisco 's patent — and is more efficient to boot .
A century and a half after Darwin suggested natural selection as the mechanism of evolution , engineers have proved him right once again .

Taking your first steps .
Riding a bike .
Your first kiss .
The first time you have sex .
All standard rites of passage for anyone growing up in much of the world .
But what if you never took your first step ?
What if you could n't ride a bike ?
What if the disability you were born with distanced you socially ?
What if there never was a first time ?
Disabled people are so sheltered and protected , in an institutionalised forcefield
Asta Philpot
Asta Philpot , 25 , is a confident , extroverted person , similar to many other British men in their 20s .
But he was born with arthogryposis , a condition that severely limits the movement in his limbs .
" Are you having a nice night ? " is a line Asta is used to hearing , delivered by women in pubs and clubs throughout his adult life .
There often seems to be a patronising undertone .
Flirting is n't easy when you can't move .
Last year , he chose to lose his virginity in a licensed Spanish brothel .
This year he took two other disabled men on a bus trip to the same brothel , filmed by BBC's One Life .
" When I was younger I had a friend and we always used to talk about relationships .
He had muscular dystrophy and passed away without having a sexual experience .
Why should people struggle for that experience ? " , Asta says .
Skewed view
This is the decade when discrimination against disabled people is finally being tackled in the UK , but while the law can open up a workplace or install a ramp , it is never easy to change what is in people 's minds .
And there are many people who would shy away from a relationship with a disabled person .
" I 've been out to pubs and clubs , you see people with each other .
Then they go off home .
But people look at disabled people as not being able to have a relationship . "
Asta Philpot believes visiting brothels is acceptable
Society has a difficulty with disabled people and sex , Asta suggests .
Television , and particularly the film industry , does n't like to present people in wheelchairs in romantic scenarios .
As objects of pity , or as exemplars of an inspirational fight against adversity maybe .
But when was the last time you saw a disabled person playing the run -of - the - mill romantic lead ?
To Asta , the situation is stark .
Sexual experiences are a vital part of life .
They are hard to come by .
And visiting a brothel is the right course of action , he thinks .
" I feel more confident with girls .
I 'm totally for it .
Not one regret .
Disabled people are so sheltered and protected , in an institutionalised forcefield . "
He believes in legalised prostitution , a view that many across society will not share but that appears to have currency within the " disabled community " .
Moral issue
A survey for the Disability Now website in 2005 suggested that 75 % of disabled people believed in the legalisation of prostitution , with 62.5 % of men and 19.2 % of women saying they would use trained sex workers .
It 's a situation that exists in the Netherlands where a voluntary group provides just such a service for disabled people .
Most clients pay for it themselves but some local authorities subsidise the service .
There is also a group within the UK attempting to put disabled people in touch with suitable prostitutes , but there are those for whom visiting a brothel is morally wrong .
Anna Bowden , of Eaves , a group that helps vulnerable women , including those who have been trafficked into prostitution , recognises that disabled people face " a very difficult situation " .
Many disabled people feel socially excluded
" Obviously I do n't think the answer is perpetuating a form of violence against women .
We reject the view that men have a right to sex . "
But the notion that visiting a prostitute is intrinsically wrong is not shared by all .
Cari Mitchell , of the English Collective of Prostitutes , make no distinction between disabled and non-disabled .
" Prostitution is consenting sex between adults .
There 's nothing uniquely degrading about prostitution except that it is criminalised , " she says .
" Men with disabilities going to a brothel is no different to any other men .
They have the same needs as anybody else and should be entitled to the same access to paying for sex ... as anybody else . "
But counselling psychologist Simon Parritt , the author of the 2005 Disability Now survey , says it is difficult to see brothels as the answer .
" I think everybody has the right to a sexual identity , " he says .
" I do n't think everybody has the right to sex with another person .
That involves somebody else 's rights . "
Sexual exclusion
And in the eyes of some , he says , the Netherlands approach risks " ghettoising " , with disabled people regarded " as something so different they need some kind of specialised charity sex " .
But it is clear that many disabled people in the UK face sexual exclusion .
" The process of learning from experience is limited .
When you get to 15 - 16 you may go out clubbing .
The gap between you and your peer group becomes particularly big .
Sexual and relationship skills get left behind , " Mr Parritt says .
And he has first - hand experience of people 's attitudes .
Some years ago he placed identical personal ads , one mentioning that he was disabled , one not mentioning .
The advert that mentioned his disability drew the better quality of responses but they were vastly fewer in number than the advert that did not mention his disability .
" People end up in their mid 20s and later not having had any kind of sexual experience .
The right kind of experience gives you confidence . "
Confidence is one of the things Asta was seeking .
He thinks he has found it .
Asta Philpot 's story is told in One Life : For One Night Only at 2240 BST on BBC One on Wednesday 24 October .
Although I am not disabled and have no physical or mental problems , I am a young adult who has never had a sexual relationship .
I find social interaction difficult , and there is no way I would ever be able to " pick up " a girl in a bar or club ; I simply do n't have the confidence .
Despite this - and it is frustrating and depressing to think that I may die a virgin - I would never , ever visit a prostitute .
It is a form of gross exploitation of women that is morally wrong and debases the whole idea of sex .
This is n't , in the end , about disability .
Disabled people are not the only people who are unlikely to form normal sexual and romantic relationships .
But those of us with this problem should deal with it , just as other people in society have to deal with their own problems .
I have no respect for anyone who visits prostitutes .
Thomas , Oxford , UK
We live in a very anti disabled society from top to bottom .
My brother has hydrochephalis and despite applying for jobs every week always gets turned down because of his disability .
He is also ( as far as I know ) a virgin but he still goes out every weekend to have fun and hopefully meet someone .
It makes my heart break but what can I do ?
Part of his problem is a lack of confidence , after all he is not that that disabled compared to many , he can walk , feed himself etc .
A job would be a good start for him to give him confidence and Jon Major did bring in a system where small companies were set up to employ disabled people .
Tony
Blair shut these places and it seems whenever there is a cut to be made in services the disabled are the first to be targeted , nobody cares .

I agree completely with George , UK .
I 'm 22 years old but being an adult with ADD ( particularly a woman ) has made relationships impossible - ADD is not just a kid 's thing , or even just a learning disability .
ADD tends to affect me very much in social situations - I find it very hard to relate to my work colleagues and did n't have a true friend until I was 19 - I 'm so easily distracted I find it hard to read people - which impedes the old flirting !
I did n't even realise I was gay until I was 20 !
I do n't drink ( alcohol and ADD - never a good mix ) so that makes socialising ( especially on the gay scene ) difficult because people tend to hold it against you .
Needless to say , sweet 22 and never been kissed , never mind the other .
I do n't blame Asta at all - if it gives him the confidence , brilliant .

Many disabled people have difficulty with having relationships , in particular those with Asperser Syndrome and autism .
I am 29 and I have never had sex with a woman in my life - embarrassing , is n't it ?
It absolutely infuriates me when I hear about young people less than half my age losing their virginity and being sexually active .
It is not as if people like myself are two - timing someone , is it ?
I remember reading about the fact that most disabled people are often regarded as asexual .
Why is visiting a brothel often regarded as disgusting ?
So , because of my disability , society does not want me to be the same as other people ?
That is unfair .
George , UK
As someone who has grown up with a chronic illness I lost my virginity in a massage parlour because it was not possible to find a woman at a young age to accept the health problems I had .
It was a good experience and we both treated each other with respect .
Since then I have had girlfriends some of whom have been fine despite any sexual problems because of my health , whilst others made me feel completely worthless sexually and some very cruel , saying things like " can I have a lover ? " .
Now somewhat older I have been in a stable relationship for the past 6 years and we are sexually compatible .
During my periods of rejection exploring my sexuality with " prostitutes " has been on the whole a good experience .
The moral issues are far more complicated than simple statements of right and wrong made here ... many of these women are very sensitive and respectful and relate to people with life problems and I have always treated them that way and while I would not condone trafficking , that is a separate issue to " paying " for sex and the morality of prostitution .
Dr Robert , London
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this matter .
I speak as a person with MS , and fully understand the difficulties that might arise with the need for sex within a disabled life .
I have had a satisfactory relationship , I am lucky - but now unlucky since it has ceased .
I therefore feel that I have some understanding of how an individual may feel when relationship / sex is not forthcoming and can see how the services of a brothel would answer that need .
However , it is not just sex , for many there is an enormous emotional link formed between the two consenting partners during the sex act .
So I would say be careful before propelling ones self - or anyone else , into a sexual relationship even at brothel level , without thinking how any bond between the partners can be handled or dealt with .
Importantly consider allowing disabled folk - male or female , the opportunity to satisfy their needs in this respect .
So what am I saying - yes allow brothel visits but be prepared for any emotional side effects .
Anthony Jones , Carmarthenshire
This is a decision for the individual and not for someone like myself who cannot for a moment imagine what it is like to be disabled to have an opinion .
This life is harder enough for everyone without a moralistic society dictating what people should and should n't do .
If it is consenting sex ( whether paid for in an ' illegal ' way or socially acceptable way ) then that is for the parties involved .
Ian Gray , Haywards Heath
If prostitution were to be legalised and regulated then it would remove a great deal of the stigmatisation and threat of violence against sexworkers , both men and women .
People with disabilities should be entitled to engage in and enjoy the same pleasures as everyone else in society and the answer should be legalisation of prostitution and not partial decriminalisation or state funded provision of sexworkers purely for the disabled .
Robbie , Glasgow
Erm ... no one should be going to brothels .
What the hell is he thinking ?
Look , I can't pick up girls in a nightclub or bar .
You have to do and be certain things in order to do that , things that demean men as much as women .
And yes , being disabled is one of the things you 're not allowed to be if you want meaningless interaction with girls in bars .
That 's not going to change , I 'm afraid .
I agree that there is a widespread attitude of patronisation and an assumption you 'll be single , and it sucks .
I feel for anyone in this predicament .
But brothels are patently not the answer to this .
You 'll just look pathetic and desperate .
You think that a sex worker is going to think of you in any other way than as another loser punter ?
Jamie , Norwich
The last sentence of this article seems the saddest conceivable commentary on the whole situation .
Of what possible value is the kind of " confidence " that can be bought in this way ?
Paying for sex seems to be the ultimate degradation .
And I say this as someone who has spent large periods of his life celibate .
Ian Kemmish , Biggleswade
I do n't think anyone has the ' right ' to have intercourse with anyone else because it does n't make sense ( ' rights ' being a legal construct an ' all ) but I do think that prostitution should be legalized as it's a business arrangement between consenting adults .
It would provide a great opportunity for a person to experience a sexual relationship which might otherwise be denied them .
That goes for the disabled as well as the lonely , shy or downright busy females and males amongst us .
Lou , New York , USA
I am amazed that the question ( is it ok for disabled people to visit brothels ? ) is even raised .
Of course it is .
It is a bit like asking whether it is ok for them to go shopping .
Surely , they do not need such patronising .
Alan Hainsworth , Worcester , UK
I understand his plight , but since when was it society 's fault that someone can't get sex ?
A disabled person may not ever had landed the starring role in a romantic comedy , but neither do ugly people , hugely fat people etc .
The reason women / men are not immediately attracted to disabled people is because we instinctively look for " healthy " genes .
Therefore we are less likely to want to procreate with someone who has to use a wheelchair , particularly if the reason for that wheelchair seems to down to a genetic disease .
It 's not deliberate discrimination , it just IS .
E Morris , St Albans , UK
" There is also a group within the UK attempting to put disabled people in touch with suitable prostitutes ... "
Instead of this approach would it not be better to put disabled people in touch with other opposite sex disabled people ?
Rob Lawson , Manchester
Why should anyone be excluded to anything others have just because of a ' disability ' ?
If anyone else went to a prostitute , no one would say anything yet as soon as someone in a wheelchair visits such a place it 's frowned on .
We are all human and in reality the only thing that is different between us is our DNA .
Colin B , London , UK
This article on disabled people visiting brothels seems to start , not from the reasonable assumption that it is harder for disabled people to have sexual experiences , but from the erroneous assumption that all able - bodied men can easily get sex , and that disabled people need special looking after .
I think considering prioritising the needs of disabled people in matters which are as intimate as this is a very odd idea .
I do n't see any reason why , if sex with a prostitute really is ' sex between consenting adults ' , disabled people should not go along and use this service as able - bodied people do .
But no one has the ' right ' to have sex and there are plenty of lonely , able - bodied men around who also have a very difficult time achieving sexual closeness without the excuse of being in a wheelchair .
Think how much more galling and rejecting all this is for them !
As for disabled people not being run -of - the - mill films - do you ever see anyone who is not the Hollywood norm in both appearance and personality in run -of - the - mill films ?
Alpha Beta , London
Society highlights all the people who " get lucky " , which gives us all an unrealistic picture .
Frankly , I think a lot of able - bodied people are actually not sexually active on a regular ongoing basis , but most of us do have at least a brief period in our lives when we are sexually accepted by another person / persons .
I 've been personally inactive now for about seven years with no apparent change on the horizon , but at least I have memories of a great five years in Denmark in the 70s .
I wonder how it feels to have never been sexually desired by anyone ever ?
P James , Leeds , England
I am able bodied , but my father had muscular dystrophy .
He married my mother in the late 1950s .
They were very poor and lived in a caravan to start with .
It was a hard life , but they rose to the challenge and produced us four healthy children .
We all love to dance - my brother is a professional ballet dancer .
It must have given my father great joy to have produced the four of us in the face of the prejudices of the time and in spite of his physical problems .
I remember comments being made when we were young , and people staring when we were out , but for me , I just assumed that everyone 's father was on wheels !
Sex is a normal need for us all and I believe that brothels are one answer , but that it is far more important to change what goes on in peoples ' heads and their attitudes towards the disabled .
My father died at the age of 46 .
I believe that he lived longer because of having a family of his own .
Jo Carter , Folkestone
Whilst I agree that everyone has a right to sexual experience , everyone has a right to choose .
This article implies that there is something wrong with the choices that people make .
Now if someone who was disabled showed me that they could provide me with an interesting sexual experience , and provide me with stimulating companionship as well , I would n't hesitate to go out with them .
However , I will not deny that I see many disabilities as an obstacle to a long term relationship and as an obstacle to a physical relationship .
As a woman , I want to take part in a mutual sexual relationship .
If I have to do everything , I am doing nothing more than providing a service , which this article implies that these men want .
I want a mutual physical and sexual relationship and I find that someone asserting his right to a sexual experience both off - putting and offensive .
Emily , United Kingdom
It is not ok for anyone to visit a brothel , regardless of their physical abilities .
Prostitution is one severe example of our societies continued subjugation of women .
Without wishing to deny the importance of agency in a women 's decision to become a prostitute , surely an individuals belief that their subjugation is their choice is the ultimate form of subjugation .
As with most free market situations , it is the persistence of demand that ensures the persistence of supply .
In that sense it is the customers of prostitutes who facilitate the opportunity for women to put themselves in physically and mentally dangerous situations .
It is society 's continued inability to emancipate women and offer them alternative opportunities that perpetuates some women seeing prostitution as an acceptable option .
The approach must therefore be two - fold : a proximate one of punishing those seeking the services of prostitutes , and a structural one of ensuring that opportunities exist for vulnerable woman which enable them to avoid putting themselves at physical and mental risk through prostitution .
Nathaniel Hobbs , London , UK
You admit to making a documentary about the above mentioned unfortunate individual who felt he needed to pay for sex .
BBC 's participation in this documentary is really a way of publicly offering your support to the immoral deed and trying to get the public to do so too .
To think that my licence money is spent in such a way makes me sick .
No , you definitely wo n't have the courage to publish this .
Caitriona , Manchester
I think that the problem is largely one of self esteem .
As our modern , secular society is obsessed with sex , disabled people feel ' non people ' unless they share in the general licentiousness .
Therefore , sex is a way of making feel the disabled person ' normal ' .
The problem is that sex with a prostitute offers nothing emotional or human - it is purely a sex act and nothing more .
In many ways , this activity , after the novelty wears off , becomes a hobby , like collecting coins .
This is a shame , because what disabled people should be aiming for is relationships , not meaningless sexual encounters .
The ideal scenario is for disabled people of both sexes to meet and socialise more easily , so that proper relationships can be formed , rather than to have to resort to paid sex .
Mark L , Reading , U.K .
Oh good grief is what I say .
What is this big thing about ' brothels ' .
People continuously squeak about them , try and hide them under the paperwork and / or deny their existence .
There is nothing wrong with sex - it is a normal human function , disabled people have as much right as an able bodied person to enjoy sex so stop wittering - accept it and move on .
Geesh , there are so many more important things to worry about !
Susan Du Becker , Breda , Netherlands
The focus is always on disabled people .
As a full - time carer for a disabled person , I would continue , and argue that it is most definitely OK for the carers to also visit brothels .
Not only been a full time carer , but aged 23 and staying at home alone all day , one has no other interaction .
We always seem to be forgotten .
There is no discrimination between disabled and non-disabled persons , but how about me when I want a job ?
I have already been discriminated against as I do not have enough team working experiences over the last 2 years , yet I have a first class degree , have been a member of the TA and have had many different roles ... though not within the last 2 years , as I 've been too busy being a carer and saving the social security payments .
Anon
Small minded able - bodied people are to blame for this situation , pigeon holing disabled people .
Shame on them .
Steve , Leeds
Why can't people understand that being disabled does not mean you are devoid of emotions and needs .
Sarah , Epsom , Surrey
" Why should people struggle for that experience ? " ;
Asta , I think the question is why should people be subjected to such things as prostitution .
It is a very self centred thing to say .
A Hutton , Leics .
UK
' I do n't think anybody has the right to have sex with another person ' .... Quite right , but you should have the right to sell / buy sex in a safe healthy environment if you choose to .
Whether the prostitute or the punter is disabled is completely irrelevant .
Kate , London
Of course it 's OK .
' We ' seem to expend effort everywhere to ensure accessibility for all , and then suddenly become squeamish when that accessibility might include conceding someone with a disability might have sexual feelings .
The argument about the morality of prostitution is a red herring as it does n't apply any more or less to a disabled person than anyone else .
Make the question " Why is n't it OK ...? " and , aside from a morality question that applies to all , there 's no good reason at all .
Alastair Alexander , Watford , UK
This is a ridiculous article .
Firstly , its not a human right to have sex before you are 30 .
There are plenty of non-disabled people who did n't lose their virginity before 20 or 25 or whatever .
Secondly , if its ok for disabled people to go to a brothel then it should be ok for anyone .
To suggest that they should be given a special dispensation because they are so unattractive is just insulting .
Rob , London
WHITE CHICKS …. Former Bob Dole press secretary Douglas MacKinnon writes a column in the Chicago Tribune about a subject that came up in conversation just last night in the Drum living room :
Note to the news media ?
with an emphasis on the cable networks : Enough is enough .
Your continual focus on , and reporting of , missing , young , attractive white women not only demeans your profession but is a televised slap in the face to minority mothers and parents the nation over who search for their own missing children with little or no assistance or notice from anyone .
…. I have a number of friends at the cable networks ( or at least I did ) , and I have spoken to some about this very subject .
While all professed disgust with the underreporting of missing minority women and young adults , most were very uneasy with the thought of shining a spotlight on their own management to ascertain an answer .
“ Besides , ” one of them told me , “ you ’ve already figured it out .
We showcase missing , young , white , attractive women because our research shows we get more viewers .
It ’s about beating the competition and ad dollars . ”
I drove to work one day last week in a prototype car that is either a harbinger of a far more fuel - efficient future , or another in a long line of technological insurgencies that will fail in the end to crack the auto industry 's century - old status quo .
The car was a Toyota Prius modified , by the addition of a 72.5 kilogram ( 160 pound ) lithium - ion battery pack , into a so - called plug - in hybrid capable of operating for as many as 40 miles almost entirely on electric power alone .
The battery pack is a product of Massachusetts - based ...
I first came up with this scenario at last fall ’s Ajax Experience conference in Boston , which was n’t too long after the first RailsConf .
Between these two conferences and noting the unusually high concentration of Macs at both , and perhaps from having many , many drinks with Brent Ashley , Pete Forde , Brendan Eich and Douglas Crockford , this idea popped into my head and it goes like this …
The Time Machine
Imagine that you could get your hands on a time machine , perhaps like the one Uncle Rico bought in the movie Napoleon Dynamite ….
… but with a couple of crucial differences , namely :
This one actually works
Its “ destination ” setting is stuck and it can send you to only one specific time , a time around the end of the dot - com bubble : December 31st , 2000 .
.
The machine will send you back so that you have five minutes to tell your past self about things that will happen in the future .
Once your five minutes are up , you will be returned to the present .
What Would You Tell Your Past Self ?
Let ’s suppose that once you ’ve told your past self to avoid doing those things that you now regret , s/he asks “ Hey , Future Self , what interesting changes happened — er , I mean , are going to happen — in the tech world ? ”
Now let ’s suppose you told your past self these three things :
1 . The Mac is going to steal developer mindshare from Windows , and you ’ll also see a lot of “ I deploy on Linux , but develop on a Mac ” people .
You ’re going to see more and more “ alpha geeks ” using it as their development machine of choice .
You will see developer conferences where Macs outnumber Windows machines by 10 to 1 or even more .
And a popular application framework — at least in terms of mindshare and influence , if not in raw numbers — is going to be developed by a team that prefers working on the Mac .
2. Ruby is going to be one of the top 10 programming languages .
You know Ruby , that obscure little programming language that the guys who wrote The Pragmatic Programmer keep raving about ?
The one with documentation that ’s difficult to find , and even if you find it , it ’s in Japanese ?
It ’s going to be hot , with people writing all sorts of books on it and buying them too , and its popularity will be largely due to the fact that a hot new web development framework is going to get built on it .
3. JavaScript is going to be one of the most important programming languages .
People will discover that it had hidden powers and expressive capabilities that put it more on par with Lisp than with Java .
It will form part of the basis of a new approach to building web applications , drive the user interfaces of some of the world ’s most popular applications and be the basis for a number of new application platforms .
How Would Your Past Self Respond ?
If you were to make these three statements about the development world in 2007 to your past self , would s/he believe you ?
I ’m not sure my December 31 , 2000 self would .
I can imagine my past self dismissing me with “ Future weed must be pretty potent stuff ! ”
A developer of that era would probably sooner place bets on Java , rich client apps running on Windows and maybe PHP .
That developer would probably think that the rise of the Mac , Ruby and JavaScript were interesting notions , but highly unlikely .
Perhaps even ridiculous .
Maybe even stupid .
And Now , the Twist …
There ’s a mantra in the Agile Programming world : “ Do the simplest thing that could possibly work ” .
It encourages developers to implement solutions that follow that mantra , to write their code with the notion that getting the job done in the simplest way possible is the preferred way of doing things .
Imagine switching the word “ simplest ” in the mantra to “ stupidest ” .
With that in mind , let ’s turn our little time travel thought experiment upside down .
Suppose your future self from December 31 , 2013 came to visit you and tell you about the programming world from his or her era .
Now try to imagine what sort of things s/he ’d tell you that you might think are downright stupid .
Keep in mind the way your December 31 , 2000 self might have thought of present - day tech .
Think of present - day stuff that ’s considered too “ out there ” or “ obscure ” : Erlang , perhaps ?
OCaml ?
Haskell ?
Some Lisp or Smalltalk derivative ?
LOLcode ?
Mobile phones as the next laptops ?
Tabletop computers everywhere ?
ePaper ?
Let your imagination run wild , and make a list of what you come up with .
From that list , pick one or two items that pique your interest and follow them .
I figure it ’s a no-lose situation .
If they do n’t become the future of computing , the actual exercise of working with them will still be valuable .
However , if one of those ridiculous ideas becomes the next big thing , you ’re going to be ahead of the curve — you might even be considered a guru or visionary !

Consultation on Registrar Accreditation Agreement Amendments
Latest
The ICANN Board of Directors unanimously approved the revisions to the RAA at its meeting on 21 May 2009 .
The newly revised RAA has been posted at http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/ra-agreement-21may09-en.htm.
This new form of the RAA will apply to all new registrars , registrars that renew after the approval date , and all registrars that voluntarily adopt the new contract prior to their renewal date .
At the ICANN meeting in Mexico City , the various GNSO constituencies worked diligently to arrive at a supportive motion to advance the RAA amendment package and provide for additional follow - up efforts that will be pursued over the coming months .
This motion was adopted unanimously and the amendment package was advanced to the Board for final approval .
For a transcript of the discussion in the GNSO meeting on 4 March 2009 see http://mex.icann.org/files/meetings/mexico2009/transcript-gnso-council-04mar09-en.txt.
A copy of the motion adopted during this public meeting is available at http://gnso.icann.org/resolutions/#200903.
In addition to approving the set of amendments , the GNSO also committed to :
Within 30 days of Board approval of the set of amendments , representatives from the GNSO community and the ALAC shall be identified to participate in drafting a registrant rights charter .
Within 30 days of Board approval of the set of amendments , the GNSO Council will form a Drafting Team to discuss further amendments to the RAA and to identify those on which further action may be desirable .
The ICANN Board of Directors agreed with the substance of the amendments at its public meeting on 6 March 2009 and directed staff to hold a final public comment period prior to its vote .
The public comment period was open from 6 March 2009 through 6 April 2009 .
View the summary of these comments at http://forum.icann.org/lists/raa-consultation/.
Background
The Registrar Accreditation Agreement ( RAA ) is the contract that governs the relationship between ICANN and its accredited registrars ( a directory of accredited registrars can be found at http://www.internic.net/regist.html).
As the market has developed and the number of ICANN accredited registrars and domain name registrations have grown significantly , it has become clear that certain amendments should be made to this important agreement .
The amendments are intended to provide clarity and certainty regarding the duties of registrars and the rights of registrants .
This page has been created to describe the process , plans and actions for developing and implementing these amendments .
Also included are links to relevant documents that have been developed and public comment fora that have been established .
In March 2007 , Dr. Paul Twomey , President and CEO of ICANN called for a comprehensive review of the RAA and the Accreditation process .
The results of that review included a workshop at ICANN ’s meeting in San Juan , Puerto Rico and to Board resolutions describing an approach for arriving at and implementing amendments .
In accordance with that resolution , ICANN has solicited public input for possible changes to the RAA and the accreditation process .
ICANN has drafted proposed amendments in accordance with that input , information received at workshops and public fora to date , and consultations with the gTLD Registrar Constituency .
A set of proposed amendments has now been published for additional comment before they are submitted as advice to the Board for action .

Funny where an idea will take you .
Ten years ago , Luna the dog -- part pit bull and part Labrador retriever -- was gnawing on a piece of bamboo growing behind Craig Calfee ’s bicycle shop outside Santa Cruz .
On Sunday , Calfee was due to arrive in the West African nation of Ghana , intent on making bamboo bikes for the desperately poor .
Chew toy to bicycle .
Whimsy to good deed .
Santa Cruz to Ghana .
Not that this story is anywhere near finished .
It ’s still anybody ’s guess whether something will come of this project .
Advertisement
Which brings us back to Luna , may she rest in peace .
Luna was adept at crushing wooden sticks with her powerful jaws .
Give her a piece of wood , and she ’d chew it to splinters in no time .
But the best she could manage with the hard , round stalks of bamboo was a tooth mark or two .
And that got Calfee to wondering :
If bamboo was strong enough to withstand Luna , why could n’t it be a bicycle frame ?
Since then , Calfee has gone from building clunker bamboo bikes to fashioning sleek , pricey racing machines that turn heads in even the snobbiest pace lines .
He ’s built 91 bamboo bicycles , enough for their reputation to spread across the country .
And , perhaps as important , enough for Calfee to have faith in his unusual contraptions .
Advertisement
Craig Calfee is no ordinary bicycle shop owner .
He ’s considered one of the country ’s elite bike builders , someone who creates machines for the likes of Greg LeMond , the first American to win the Tour de France .
He fashions the lightest of bike frames from carbon fiber .
His shop is outside Santa Cruz , a community known for its laid - back style .
His only link to the Third World is a long - ago trip to Africa .
Yet somehow , more by accident than design , Calfee and his bamboo bikes may provide a means for rudimentary transport in the emerging world .
In a sense , Calfee is part of a bamboo craze sweeping the United States .
Bamboo is suddenly chic , now that it ’s being made into everything from baby - soft T - shirts to baseball bats .
Gone are the days when it was the stuff of cheap , ugly curtains and tacky lawn furniture .
Bamboo has arrived .
“ The uses are almost endless , ” said Dan Keesey , president of Gardena - based EcoDesignz , which sells everything from bamboo clothing to furniture .
“ You can eat off it , wear it and sit on it . ”
Advertisement
And sleep on it , eat with it , walk on it and fish with it , to name but a few other uses .
In Calfee ’s case , you can also ride it .
He still has that first bike he made a decade ago .
He uses it to run errands around town but does n’t bring it to the shop much because a customer might get the wrong idea .
The bike has a big split in the wood -- which he ’s repaired -- and its mustache handlebars are n’t exactly state - of - the - art .
“ A little rough ” is how Calfee describes it -- an experiment that worked well enough to tool around town .
But the novelty was infectious , albeit on a small scale .
Advertisement
“ I built a few more for friends , ” he said .
“ I was just playing around with it , not taking it seriously .
But people started asking about them , so I decided to start offering them to the public . ”
He made one for an ex-girlfriend in Tucson and another for a customer in San Francisco .
He ’d get e-mails from people looking to make an environmental statement .
And word spread among hard - core riders that the bamboo bike cushioned road shock over long distances .
Among the believers was Ken Runyan of Emmett , Idaho , who owns a hardware and bike shop and saw Calfee ’s bamboo creation at a Las Vegas trade show .
He ordered one to sell ( the frames go for $ 2,700 ) , but ended up keeping it for himself .
He found he liked it better than his other bikes .
“ It ’s a great bike , ” said Runyan , 63 , who rode it in Hawaii ’s Ironman triathlon last year .
“ The bike continually gets double takes and questions .
People look at it and ask if it ’s really made of bamboo . ”

And , of course , there are the obligatory jokes : Keep it out of the rain so it does n’t sprout ; use it for firewood if you get lost ; you ’ll never lack for a toothpick .
But Runyan said he also noticed his times were faster on long rides .
And when he cracked the top tube of his frame , all he needed was Super Glue to patch it up .
“ It ’s still kind of a gimmick bike , ” he said .
“ But I would n’t have any qualms about selling it to anybody . ”
So word spread through Runyan and others that the bamboo bike was for real .
Calfee started thinking about his unusual form of transportation .
The plant itself -- a member of the grass family -- was common throughout Asia and Africa .
And bicycles , he knew , meant transportation , which often translates to jobs in the Third World .

In somebody more energetic , Calfee ’s musings could have led to philanthropic solicitations .
But Calfee ’s a bike guy from Santa Cruz .
So instead he put a small item on his website , calfeedesign.com , saying that a bamboo bike could have some value in developing nations , if someone took up the cause .
But that someone was not going to be him .
“ I just had a feeling there were a ton of hoops I ’d have to jump through , ” he said .
“ I figured if anyone was interested , they ’d call me . ”
What he hoped for was a grant writer or sugar daddy to get the project going .
The blurb linked to a Calfee - written paper outlining the virtues of bamboo bikes , including the availability of materials , the lack of need for electric tools , and increased mobility and access to jobs and markets .
Included was a picture of a bamboo bike frame whose pieces are lashed together with hemp fiber .
Calfee figured that sooner or later , someone with cash or connections would see the site .

Five or six people saw the website item and did call , but nothing happened .
Then Calfee received an e-mail from David Ho , a hard - core cyclist from New York who was thinking about buying one of Calfee ’s custom carbon fiber bikes .
While he was on Calfee ’s website , Ho clicked on the bamboo bike link .
“ He had some ideas jotted down about how bamboo bikes could be used in these settings and what the advantages might be , ” Ho said .
It happened that Ho worked for the Earth Institute of Columbia University , a nonprofit organization that focuses on sustainable development and the world ’s poor .

The two men discussed both carbon fiber bikes and bamboo bikes .
Ho sent Calfee a copy of “ The End of Poverty , ” written by the institute ’s director , Jeffrey Sachs , who is often cited as one of the major thinkers on Third World economies .
Calfee said he had “ vaguely ” heard of Sachs but liked the ideas in the book .
Ho started drumming up support within the institute for the project .
The institute eventually financed this week ’s trip to Ghana for about $ 25,000 .
Calfee ,
Ho and one other representative from the institute will be in the country for 10 days .
They ’ll be living cheap to stretch their dollars , a good portion of which will be eaten up by airplane fares .
Ho thinks the short time should be enough to at least cover the basics , including talking to bamboo suppliers and lining up bicycle fanciers .
They want to find people interested in making the bike frames , as well as sources for epoxy , resin and sisal -- a fiber used for making rope , sacking and insulation .
The bottom line , Calfee said , is to be able to make a frame without using power tools .

Said Ho : “ The other part of our visit is to look in rural areas for what they are using for transportation and how to improve it . ”
In particular , Ho said , he wants to focus on the special needs of women , because they often tend to crops , do the chores , control the money and need transportation .
One group Calfee and Ho used for advice in preparing for the trip is the Village Bicycle Project , based in the unlikely locale of Moscow , Idaho .
The project has sent more than 18,000 bicycles to Ghana over the last seven years , and provided tools and repair classes throughout the country .
David Peckham , the project director , has ridden bamboo bikes and describes them as “ lovely . ”
But he also said there are pitfalls , even in Ghana , where the official language is English and bicycles are common .
“ I ca n’t say whether or not this is going to work , ” Peckham said .
“ As far as I know , they are going for 10 days .
I think this is a terribly short amount of time to get something done .
Also , they do n’t seem to grasp how slow everything goes and how hard it is to get something done . ”

Among other difficulties they could encounter , Peckham said , is that although bicycles come into the country duty - free , there is a tax on parts , which could raise the price of assembly .
Calfee says he’s no Pollyanna and realizes there will be pitfalls , including the ones Peckham cited .
But he also thinks success in Ghana could mean success in other places .
And they ’ve got to start somewhere .
“ It ’s very much in the beginning stages , ” he said .
“ We might fail miserably .
But it might just take . ”
All because of Luna and her bamboo chew toy .

Imagine this scenario .
You 've just received the latest Hollywood blockbuster in the mail from the DVD rental service of your choice .
You 've popped the popcorn , poured a tall glass of your favorite beverage , and settled back to watch the film on your flatscreen TV. 15 minutes or so into the movie — right as the action is building to a crescendo — the movie fades to a commercial .
For the next minute , you 're forced to watch the commercial as the fast - forward button has suddenly stopped working .
The unhappy experience is repeated two or three more times before the movie ends .
The only way to avoid the interruption is to pay another buck or two to the company you rented from .
That 's the scenario envisioned in a patent application filed by IBM ( and dug up by Zatz Not Funny ! ) .
When DVDs are inserted for playback , the disc would check to see if the viewer had purchased the ad - free version or the ( presumably ) lower - priced version with unskippable commercials .
If it 's the latter , the disc player would phone home to an online service to download commercials or play ads embedded on the discs themselves .
From the standpoint of motion picture studios , the patent looks like pure genius .
It would give them another source of cash in an era where DVD sales are down and traditional sources of revenue are under pressure .
It could also become a way to get back - catalog , niche movies onto DVD , as embedded , unskippable commercials could shore up the business case for cracking open the vault .
Budget - minded consumers might not mind discs with ads , either .
That $ 3.99 new release rental might be just $ 1.99 or even free if you 're willing to sit through a few minutes of ads ( another way in which the home theater experience can be more like going to the cinema ) .
While it might be difficult to implement the patent in current DVD players , the HD DVD spec requires players to have an Ethernet port for online connectivity .
While the connectivity is intended for things like software and firmware updates as well as interactive content , there 's no reason why it could n't be used to download car commercials in 1080p .
The debut of network " catch up " services like that of ABC which allow TV fans to watch full episodes of their favorite series online with embedded , unskippable commercials proves that consumers are willing to watch ads in an unfamiliar venue if it means free content .
That said , I think I 'll pass on the $ 9.99 Lord of the Rings Presented by McDonald 's box set , should it become available .

The year was 1957 .
The power of the atom had been unleashed upon the world .
Technology ⁠ — along with just about everything else⁠ — was booming .
Safe , plentiful nuclear energy promised to be too cheap to meter , and radioactive waste seemed only a minor concern .
It was an age of optimism and naiveté ; a time of action without consequences .
Though man was the master of the Earth , only once had he managed to explore beyond the confines of the atmosphere , in the form of a beachball - sized spacecraft called Sputnik .
Werner von Braun ’s rocket men had drawn up plans for spacecraft that would launch humans into orbit , but even then it was clear that inefficient chemical rockets would allow only a few to enter space ; the rest of mankind would be mere spectators .
Fresh from their success with the atomic bomb , a small team of Manhattan Project physicists gathered to try and change all that .
Working in secret within the brand new Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA , now called DARPA ) , they designed and tested an enormously ambitious nuclear spaceship concept that would have made everything the Soviets and NASA were doing seem like hobby rockets in comparison .
The codename was Project Orion .
Project Orion was intended to harness nuclear energy in its rawest form : by detonating a series of nuclear bombs in rapid succession to propel enormous spaceships from the Earth into the heavens .
The largest of the Orions was to be seven million tons⁠ — more than 7,000 times more massive than the Space Shuttle⁠ — and powerful enough to launch a small city .
Provided sufficient numbers of bombs , an Orion spaceship theoretically could have reached 1/10th the speed of light , enabling interstellar travel .
The motto of Project Orion was “ Mars in 1965 , Saturn in 1970 . ”
When General Atomics ( GA ) pitched the idea behind Project Orion to ARPA in 1958 , the concept of a nuclear - propelled spaceship was nothing new .
Pulp science - fiction invoked a vague “ atomic drive ” as early as the mid-1930s .
Yet until the Manhattan Project , atomic energy was the stuff of the future .
That all changed in late August 1945 when the United States opened the nuclear Pandora ’s box , and the entire world stood aghast .
As the dust was still settling over Hiroshima and Nagasaki , scientists and engineers almost immediately began working to harness nuclear energy for non-destructive purposes .
Atoms for Peace exported civilian nuclear reactors across the world , and few companies stood to gain as much from increased use of nuclear technology as GA .
The California - based company positioned itself as one of the gatekeepers of the Atomic Age , and in the process they snapped up many of the brilliant Manhattan Project minds .
Two of those men⁠ — physicists Stanislaw Ulam and Freeman Dyson⁠ — came to GA with an Earth - shaking idea .
Intoxicated by the heady aroma of a new Age , GA hired Ulam and Dyson to study their idea for the nuclear spaceship .
On its face , the very idea of nuclear explosions being harnessed for useful purposes seemed ridiculous .
Many GA employees had seen the awesome specter of mushroom clouds first - hand , and the entire world had witnessed the destruction wreaked upon Japan .
But Ulam and Dyson reasoned that properly shaped nuclear explosions could yield most of their energy to the propulsion of a spacecraft while leaving the ship and its occupants intact .
The fundamental design of a Project Orion spacecraft consisted of four parts : a payload of nuclear bombs , propellant , a pusher plate , and a spaceship .
During launch from the Earth ’s surface , the nuclear bombs would be rapidly detonated behind the Orion craft at pre-calculated distances .
A disk of propellant material attached to each bomb would be vaporized to a plasma by the explosion .
This plasma would expand into a cigar shape while being propelled at astounding velocities toward a heavy metal plate at the base of the ship .
That pusher plate , attached to enormous hydraulic shock absorbers , would absorb the momentum of the plasma and propel the Orion spaceship forward .
Time - lapse image sequence running from bottom to top of the flight of " Hot Rod "
Project Orion was fueled by the raw intellectual prowess and unerring faith in technology held by some of the world ’s most brilliant people .
Its budget was tiny compared to that of the defense conglomerate General Dynamics in which it existed .
Nevertheless , within a year the Orion team had completed calculations that indicated the project was feasible .
In the next few months , a series of scale - model experiments called “ putt- putts ” were conducted with the high - powered chemical explosive C4 .
The first few designs were destroyed , but in November 1959 a putt - putt called Hot Rod flew to an altitude of 100 meters .
The flight was surprisingly stable , and the craft nearly unscathed , lending strong evidence to the feasibility of the entire project .
A full - size Orion vehicle would have had a mass of 4,000 tons , ⁠— about 40 times that of the Space Shuttle⁠ — and would include a “ pusher plate ” about 1 - meter thick at the center .
This solid mass of metal served to reflect the Orion craft away from the nuclear explosions , while at the same time protecting the passengers from the neutron radiation .
The enormous shock absorbers between the pusher plate and the crew module would then distribute the 10,000 G’s of each nuclear blast to something much more comfortable for Orion ’s passengers .
In fact , an Orion launch would probably be much more comfortable than a conventional chemical rocket because of the sheer mass of the vehicle .
Consider the launch of a hypothetical 4,000 ton Orion spaceship propelled by four - kiloton bombs .
The need for protective eye wear would immediately become evident as the enormous ship would become engulfed in a fireball more intensely bright than the surface of the sun .
A rapid series of blossoming explosions would push the first expanding ball of plasma skyward , though the ship would be completely invisible against the blinding glare .
Within one minute , the chain of blasts would start to become visibly separate as a new flash of light would appear every few thousand feet .
This pace would continue , gradually slowing until Orion reached orbit several minutes later .
The final flash would then expand into the cap of a hundred - mile - long string of enormous , fiery pearls that would seem to ooze out of the ground into the atmosphere and arch gracefully into space .
For observers at a safe distance , the entire launch would be completely silent .
But when the pressure wave reached them a few seconds after the Orion completed its launch , the long series of thundering explosions would have sounded like the coming of the Apocalypse .
Perhaps , then , it is small surprise that the launch of the Orion was the greatest technical hurdle to its success .
A single Orion launch would have left a trail of fallout across a tremendous swath of the land or sea , the radiation from its bombs would have charged the ionosphere and the Van Allen belts around the Earth , and its series of electromagnetic pulses would have destroyed all electronics within hundreds of miles of the launch site with the larger designs .
It became clear to the GA physicists that solving these problems was crucial for the viability of the Project .
While they worked feverishly at overcoming the technical challenges , political forces were moving against the Project .
The young NASA had the ear of the President , and parts of the agency fiercely opposed Project Orion .
Werner von Braun , the German head of NASA ’s manned space rocket effort was supportive of the Project and visited GA several times to confer with managers and physicists .
Collaborations involving smaller Orions launched atop modified Saturn V vehicles were proposed by both parties .
In early 1963 , it seemed that NASA might support Orion , but the agency ’s administration never came around to the idea and Project Orion was soon orphaned .
Rendering of an Orion launch by Rhys Taylor
After years of steadily declining budgets , 1965 brought the end of Project Orion .
A powerful quartet of forces had aligned against it including the Defense Department , NASA , supporters of Nuclear Test Ban and Outer Space treaties , and much of the scientific establishment .
While opposition from agencies and individuals may have been the immediate cause of its cancellation , the ultimate cause of its demise was probably the inability for most people to grasp how such a vehicle could ever be made safe .
In addition , it was clear that every launch of an Orion would have had a massive impact on the environment .
Though Project Orion is long dead , the idea of a pulse - detonation nuclear spaceship is still alive .
To some , the idea of discarding our flimsy aluminum / carbon rockets in favor of such battleship - sized behemoths is deeply romantic .
More pragmatic supporters suggest a version of Orion assembled in orbit , thus avoiding most of the environmental dangers .
Some have also suggested using massive , unmanned Orion craft mounted to the surface of an asteroid to push it away from collision course with Earth .
One thing is certain : Orion and its nuclear - pulsed propulsion is one of the only technologies capable of reaching the speeds necessary for real - live humans to explore the outer solar system .
Moreover , if mankind wishes to penetrate the frontier of interstellar space , this mothballed Atomic - Age technology may be our best chance .

Here are 3 top tips from Paul Hurdsfield to make sure you

When my son was 18 months old , my best friend from high school came through town on his way to California .
He ’s a respected physician and my most trusted medical counselor .
We went back to my office and looked over my stash .
“ Dude , ” he said .
“ You ’ve got to stop smoking this shit . ”
“ I know , ” I said .
“ With the kid around … ”
“ You need to buy a vaporizer . ”
“ Oh . ”
“ You get really high , and you do n’t mess up your lungs .
Also , there ’s no odor .
It ’s awesome . ”
My 35th birthday was approaching , and I needed to get myself a present .
So I went vaporizer shopping online .
I found a website for a sleek , gorgeous ceramic contraption called The Silver Surfer .
New terms entered my stoner lexicon : “ heat source , ” “ mouthpiece , ” “ whip , ” “ wand . ”
It would be the greatest present I ’d ever give myself .
No more apple bongs for me .
I had to consume my THC wisely .
I was a dad now .
*****
I ’m a man of few vices .
Alcohol does n’t appeal to me , except in very limited quantities .
I do n’t play a lot of cards or smoke cigars , and I ’m really not that into porn .
My naughtiness all goes into the herb , and it ’s as low - level as naughtiness gets .
Before my son was born , my hobby went like this :
When I had weed in the house , I ’d do it a lot , and when I did n’t , I would n’t do it at all .
I could go two months without it , or go two months with daily use .
Usually , it moved in cycles .
It never really occurred to me to give it up just because I ’d become a parent .
It did n’t even occur to me that anyone would expect me to give it up .
If anything , parenthood meant that marijuana became a larger part of my life .
Whereas before the boy ’s arrival I ’d often leave the house after 9 PM for a party , or a bar , or a movie , now my social life had contracted .
By the kid ’s bedtime , I ’m often exhausted , and even if I ’m not , babysitters run $ 10 an hour these days .
A hit off the Silver Surfer and a night of Turner Classic Movies has become , for me , an acceptable middle ground .
Then the morning comes , and I have responsibilities .
I do n’t Silver Surf when I have to drive Elijah somewhere , I do n’t do it when I ’m going to be alone with him for any extended period of time , and I ’m very rarely baked before sundown .
Since all that put together comprises 97 percent of my parenting time , there ’s very little crossover with the weed .
Occasionally , I ’ll be stoned at the wrong moment , which will lead me to misjudge children ’s entertainment , like the time I told my wife , “ Dude , 64 Zoo Lane is so trippy . ”
But as far as I ’m concerned , weed , in very limited quantities , just improves the parenting experience .
Everyone knows that TV is better when you ’re high .
Anyone who says it ’s impossible to be a stoner and a parent has either never been a stoner , or never been a parent .
The dominant attitude among stoner dads — and moms — goes like this : Consuming pot is something , like watching college football or masturbating , that you used to do all the time , but now will do only if it ’s convenient and appropriate to the moment .
Still , there ’s a kind of secret , unspoken society .
I ’ve been to many backyard family barbecues where another dad and I will discover that pot is a shared habit .
The discussion will quickly veer into the familiar .
We discuss our favorite varietals .
We recount great pot -smoking moments of our past .
Someone tells a story about a dude he knows who ’s got a medical marijuana prescription .
Then things invariably wind down the same way :
Dad :
So do you have any ?
Me : No .
Do you ?
Dad : Nah .
I had some a few weeks ago .
Me : So did I .
Give me a call if you ever get some .
Dad : Cool .
Me : Cool .
Pot - smoking parents did n’t use to be controversial .
My parents never consumed anything stronger than box wine ; my dad was the only soldier in Vietnam , other than maybe John McCain , who did n’t do drugs .
But even if my parents had stashed a half - ounce of Maui Wowie in the underwear drawer , I ca n’t imagine it would have been a big deal around the house .
The country was loose about weed then .
No one gave it much of a thought .
When I was a kid , a Time magazine cover like the one on Dec. 9 , 1996 , would never have been possible .
An aging Michael Doonesbury sits on his daughter ’s bed , while Garry Trudeau ’s talking joint character stands in the background .
The text reads , “ You tried pot when you were young .
Maybe you even inhaled .
So now what do you say to your kids ? ”
Even though I was n’t to be a dad for six years , and had n’t even met my wife yet , I knew then that the culture had turned .
Parenting , rather than just being a natural , if challenging , byproduct of biology , had somehow become a sacred act .
And smoking pot was a violation of its sanctity .
Well , I never bought into that , and I ’m not alone .
Society is right to demand that parents treat their kids with respect and love , and provide them with food , clothing and shelter .
But sainthood should n’t be a requirement .
In a perfect world , or at least a better one , smoking pot would not carry any cultural meaning at all .
My casual little habit does n’t prevent me from fulfilling my parental duties , and no matter what DARE and the DEA might say , it has little or nothing to do with the crack epidemic or the spread of crystal meth .
I think that weed should be legal , and I ’m not going to lie about that to my kid if he asks me .
Someday I ’ll have an intelligent conversation with him about the pros and cons of legalization , and about the politics of prohibition .
But he ’s not ready for such a conversation yet .
In the meantime , I ’m downplaying my marijuana use .
There ’s a little water closet off my office that I use as a peccadillo repository of sorts .
The other day , Elijah used my bathroom because the other one was occupied .
He spotted the Silver Surfer on the floor .
“ What ’s that , daddy ? ” he asked .
“ Nothing , ” I said .
“ Just something daddy uses to help him with his breath . ”
“ Good , ” he said .
“ Your breath stinks sometimes . ”
“ Yeah , well , so does yours . ”
GAO : Lack of coordination may have ' compromised ' US anti-terror efforts abroad Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email
This A government oversight report has found a lack of coordination among US law enforcement agencies that in at least one case may have " compromised " efforts abroad to fight international terrorism .
The report found more money is being spent fighting the war on drugs than the war on terror .
The Government Accountability Office found that agencies tasked with combating terrorism had largely failed to implement formal policies that would guide and measure their progress against terror groups abroad .
The GAO found that America 's law enforcement community shifted its focus to fighting terrorism in the wake of domestic terror attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , but little has emerged to guide and measure that shift in focus .
" While the national strategies have articulated this change in direction and emphasis , " the report says , " they have not provided specific roles , objectives , resources or mechanisms for determining success . "
GAO investigators visited four US embassies abroad , although the countries visited were not disclosed for national security reasons .
Embassy personnel told the GAO that " despite counterterrorism being the embassy 's highest priority , they received little to no guidance " on how to pursue those goals .
" For example , " the report notes , " in one country we visited , the lack of clear roles and responsibilities between two U.S. LEAs [ law enforcement agencies ] may have compromised several joint operations intended to identify and disrupt potential terrorist activities , according to U.S. and foreign nation LEAs involved in these efforts . "
In the countries GAO visited , the US government was dedicating more money to " combat illegal drugs and criminals than to combat terrorism , " according to the report .
Between 2002 and 2006 , the report found the State Department spent more than $ 220 million on anti-drug efforts while spending less than $ 35 million on anti-terrorism assistance in one country visited .
The 73 - page report from GAO was requested by Rep. Chris Shays , R - Conn. , who is the ranking member of a House subcommittee in charge of oversight of national security and foreign policy .
A call to Shays office seeking comment was not immediately returned Tuesday morning .
The report recommends the National Counterterrorism Center and National Security Council articulate a clearer strategy for cooperation among US and foreign law enforcement agencies and establish a protocol to measure progress in fighting terrorism .
US efforts are not having intended effects in fighting terrorism abroad , and the lack of communication and coordination among agencies is sowing confusion in the global terror - fight , CNN homeland security correspondent Jeanne Meserve observed this morning .
" The report concludes that host governments are confused , " Meserve says , and they " do n't know which one [ agency ] to turn to when they 're dealing with a specific terrorist threat . "

EDITOR'S NOTE : Please be advised that the video accompanying this story of Claire Markwardt 's fall might be unsettling for some viewers .
It has been almost two weeks since Claire Markwardt 's horrific fall in the final stretch of the Ohio state high school cross country championship , and yet , the Berkshire High School senior has seen the video only once .
Only once has she logged on to YouTube and watched herself fall to the ground as first her left tibia and then her fibula snap in half .
Only once has she watched herself crawl the final 45 feet to the finish line , ensuring that she would complete the final race of her high school career .
And even that one time , she had to stop the video at the point where a race official picks her up and carries her to a doctor .
" There 's a scene in ' Harry Potter ' where Harry breaks his arm and it's really jiggly , " Markwardt said by phone this week .
" When [ the official ] picked me up , that 's what I remember thinking my leg felt like .
It felt like it was swinging around a lot .
And I did n't want to see that , so I stopped watching . "
What Markwardt saw in the video might not be visible to the rest of us .
She saw a teenage girl who , a year earlier , watched the state meet from the stands and made a personal commitment to run in that race in her senior year .
She saw a girl who fulfilled that commitment , and then , with a badly broken leg 45 feet from the finish line , had a choice : Finish , or do n't finish .
To her , it was a no - brainer .
What the rest of the world sees in the video , though , is a high - school hero .
Thanks to YouTube and Internet blogs such as The Big Lead , the rest of the world sees courage , determination and an off - the - charts tolerance for pain .
Strangers who have watched it have filled Markwardt 's MySpace and Facebook pages with congratulations , well - wishes and thank - yous .
The encouragement has helped Markwardt , with two surgeries behind her and six months of physical therapy ahead , believe her ordeal has been a good thing .
" Honestly , I think it 's a positive in my life , " she said .
" Obviously , I do n't enjoy having a broken leg , but I 've gotten so much amazing feedback out of it .
And I 've learned a lot about myself .
I did n't think I could ever do something like that .
But apparently , I could . "
Claire Markwardt of Berkshire High School in Ohio runs in a race earlier this season when she set her personal best of 20 minutes , 06 seconds .
Julie Cole
Ask Markwardt to tell you her memories from the meet , and the first thing she mentions is how perfect the entire day was supposed to be .
She was to run the biggest race of her life in the morning .
As soon as it finished , she was to drive with her dad from Columbus to Warren , where she would be the maid of honor in her big sister Anna 's wedding that night .
At the 1 - and 2 - mile markers , Markwardt was on a personal - best pace .
Then , as she entered the stadium at Columbus ' Scioto Downs , with about 400 meters to go , she heard her left leg crack .
The leg had been sore on and off for the previous two weeks , prompting Berkshire coach Julie Cole to limit Markwardt in practice .
When she heard the crack , Markwardt thought it was a muscle pull or tear .
She thought she could gut it out to the finish line .
" There was a runner from one of our rival schools right in front of me , " she said .
" I kept staring at the back of her jersey and pushing myself to catch her . "
But some 200 meters later , Markwardt heard the leg crack again .
And again .
Then there was a louder crack , and her entire leg gave out .
She fell to the ground as onlookers winced at the sound and the sight of what happened .
One of Markwardt 's teammates , unaware of what had happened , encouraged her to get up .
She tried , using her right leg .
But as soon as she shifted weight to the left , the loudest crack yet came .
And her leg gave out again .
" At that point , I knew what had happened .
I knew my leg was broken pretty badly .
And I knew I could n't get up again .
So I started crawling , " she said .
She said she thought not of her coach , nor her parents , nor anyone else who had encouraged her to never give up , to see things to the finish .
Instead , she thought of the countless stories she had heard about runners who collapsed before a race 's end and somehow found the courage to cross that last line .
Even if her leg had given out at the 400 - meter mark , she said , it would n't have mattered .
She was going to finish .
" They may not have let me , and it might not have been pretty , but I would have tried , " she said .
" I had come so far .
Our team had come so far .
All season , we had been working for state , and now we were there .
I was almost done , and there was no way I was going to let the team down . "
So , she finished the race in a time of 20:24.07 , only 18 seconds slower than her personal best ( 20:06 ) , despite crawling for the last 45 feet .
The finish was good for 67th place , helping her school to a fourth - place finish in the Ohio High School Athletic Association Division III championship .
" When I saw her crawling , I wanted to cry , " said Richard Markwardt , Claire 's father .
" I was just so incredibly proud -- as proud as any father could be . "
After the race , there were no tears , no screams of horror .
Instead , Markwardt sat patiently on a training table while doctors put a splint on her leg and then transferred her to a Columbus hospital .
She had broken her tibia in multiple places , her fibula in just one .
She needed surgery , in which a rod and a series of screws were placed in her leg to help piece it together .
Doctors told her they believed her original soreness was a stress fracture made worse by running in the state meet .
They said she likely suffered a partial crack of her tibia at first , but when she pressed on , she shattered the bone in multiple places .
And when she stood up to try to finish the race , doctors told her , that 's when they believe she broke her fibula .
Markwardt crawls to the finish of the state meet .
" I had come so far .
Our team had come so far .
. . .
I was almost done , and there was no way I was going to let the team down . "
Julie Cole
Although her maid - of - honor dress and a hairstylist awaited her , she did n't make it to her sister 's wedding .
She shed her first tears when she apologized to her sister on a cell phone from the hospital .
Anna , of course , told her how unnecessary her apology was .
So did her father , who , after signing the hospital paperwork and making sure Claire was in good hands , raced to Warren to give away his middle daughter .
Several representatives from the school stayed with Claire until her parents , after attending the wedding and greeting guests at the reception , drove back to Columbus and walked into Claire 's hospital room at 2:30 in the morning .
" The entire day was just an incredible emotional roller coaster -- one that I hope I never have to experience again , " Richard Markwardt said .
Claire 's recovery wo n't be easy .
Following the first surgery , on Nov. 3 , doctors realized her left foot was turned outward further than it should have been .
So on Nov. 13 -- 10 days after the accident -- she went back into the hospital for a day so doctors could straighten and slightly lengthen the rod in her leg .
Doctors tell her to expect to spend six to eight weeks on crutches .
It will be three months until she will be able to walk normally and six months before she will be able to run again .
She plans to study industrial design or architecture at a college near her home in Burton , Ohio , next fall .
She 's unsure if she will try to run competitively in college .
For all she 's gone through and all that lies ahead , Markwardt said she has broken down only twice : once on the hospital phone call to her sister , and once when she told coach Cole that she will miss the spring track season .
This Wednesday , when doctors asked her to rate her pre-surgery anxiety before the second procedure on her leg , she said , " Two . "
" She 's always had a certain degree of maturity that 's just unusual for kids her age , " Richard Markwardt said .
" Someone once told me she has an old soul .
And they 're right .
There 's this unique sense of wisdom and resolve .
And that 's helped her get through this . "
In fact , it might be that the person who has struggled the most with the emotional aftermath of Claire 's injury is Cole , Berkshire 's cross country coach .
" It 's been difficult , " Cole said .
" I felt kind of guilty .
This is what I do .
I 'm a coach .
You try to get the kids to work hard and sacrifice for each other .
That 's what we try to instill -- to go after it .
But if I push kids to go to that extreme , is that a good thing ?
Is that right ? "
Markwardt already has told her coach that she had nothing to do with the injury .
Nor , she said , did her parents or anyone else .
Markwardt alone made the decision to press on after she heard her leg crack 200 meters before the finish line and after she crumbled to the ground 45 feet from the finish .
Nearly two weeks later , she said she would n't do things any differently , even if she could .
Now , she 's focused on her next hurdle -- returning to school .
Doctors have cleared her to start classes Monday .
Her mom wants her to do so in a wheelchair .
Markwardt , the competitor , wo n't have it .
" I have n't used the wheelchair since I was in the hospital that day , " Markwardt said .
" I 'm fine on crutches .
I 'm not going to school in a wheelchair .
I 'm fighting that wheelchair off . "

There are a variety of medications that can be used to treat depression .
These antidepressants all work to take away or reduce the symptoms of depression .
Usually you will start taking the medicine at a low dose .
The dose will be gradually increased until you start to see an improvement ( unless significant side effects emerge ) .
Your mental health professional chooses which antidepressant medicine to give you based on your symptoms , the presence of other medical conditions , what other medicines you are taking , cost of the prescribed treatments , and potential side effects .
If you have had depression before , your doctor will usually prescribe the same medicine you responded to in the past .
If you have a family history of depression , medicines that have been effective in treating your family member (s ) might be one factor to consider in choosing an appropriate medication for you .
How Long Will I Have to Take Antidepressants ?
In order to be effective and prevent depression from recurring , antidepressant medicines are generally prescribed for six month to one year for people who are being treated for first - time depression .
Usually , these drugs must be taken regularly for at least one to two months before their full benefit takes effect .
You are usually monitored closely during this time to detect the development of side effects and to determine the effectiveness of treatment .
When you and your doctor determine that you are better and have remained well without a relapse for at least several months , your doctor may gradually taper you off your medicines .
Once you and your doctor have determined it is safe for you to stop taking your medicine altogether , you should continue to be monitored during periodic follow - up appointments ( about every three months ) to detect any signs of depression recurrence .
You should never discontinue any medication without talking to your doctor about it first .
Most antidepressants are gradually tapered off when a decision is made to stop them .
If you abruptly stop taking some antidepressants , you could develop physical symptoms such as nausea , dizziness , headache , flu - like symptoms , or stomach upset ( called a " discontinuation syndrome " ) .
While symptoms from abrupt discontinuation generally pose no medical hazard , they can be uncomfortable and resolve once a medicine has been restarted .
Long - term treatment with depression medicine may be recommended to prevent further episodes of depression in people who have already suffered from two or more episodes of major depression .
Viktor Zubkov worked with Mr Putin in St Petersburg in the 1990s
Viktor Zubkov , head of the federal financial monitoring service , is a relative unknown in Russian politics .
The change marks a major political shake - up ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections .
The lower house of the Russian parliament , the Duma , is set to vote on Mr Zubkov 's nomination on Friday .
Mr Fradkov offered to resign earlier Wednesday , citing " approaching significant political events " , said Itar - Tass news agency .
Mr Putin asked Mr Fradkov to stay on as acting prime minister until his replacement is confirmed .
" We all have to think together how to build a structure of power so that it better corresponds to the pre-election period and prepares the country for the period after the presidential election in March , " Mr Putin said in accepting Mr Fradkov 's resignation .
Strong platform
Elections to the Duma are to be held in December .
VIKTOR ZUBKOV 1941 : Born in Arbat village , Sverdlovsk region 1965 : Graduates from Leningrad Agricultural Institute in economics 1967 - 1985 : Works on collective farms in Leningrad regions 1985 - 1991 : Works in regional administration 1991 - 1993 : Works with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg city administration 1993 - 2000 : Works for federal tax service and tax ministry From 2001 : Head of financial monitoring service
Profile : Viktor Zubkov
Whoever becomes the new prime minister gains a strong platform from which to campaign to replace Mr Putin , correspondents say .
Russian media had been speculating that First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov - long considered a frontrunner for the presidency - could have been about to be made prime minister .
Mr Ivanov worked under Mr Putin in the FSB , the internal intelligence agency , in the 1990s and the two men are believed to be close .
Power struggle ?
Mr Zubkov 's links with Mr Putin go back to the early 1990s , when he was the future president 's deputy on the St Petersburg city external relations committee .
But few in Russia believe that Mr Zubkov is now in the running for the presidency , says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow .
Instead , says our correspondent , many analysts believe he has been appointed to ensure a smooth transition between Mr Putin and his successor , whoever that might be .
Mr Ivanov is one of President Putin 's closest allies
Dmitry Medvedev , the other first deputy prime minister , has also been seen as a possible presidential candidate .
The choice of Mr Zubkov suggests a behind - the - scenes power struggle between " clans " within the Kremlin that are differentiated mainly by their degree of hostility toward the West , says the BBC 's Russia analyst Steven Eke .
White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the choice of leaders was a matter for the people of Russia to decide and that the US " looks forward to continuing its good relations with the Russian government " .
Mr. Humphreys ’s aim was not just academic : he was trying to illustrate to the public and the police that straight men would not be harassed in these bathrooms .
His findings would seem to suggest the implausibility not only of Senator Craig ’s denial — that it was all a misunderstanding — but also of the policeman ’s assertion that he was a passive participant .
If the code was being followed , it is likely that both men would have to have been acting consciously for the signals to continue .
Mr. Humphreys broke down these transactions into phases , which are remarkably similar to the description of Senator Craig ’s behavior given by the police .
First is the approach : Mr. Craig allegedly peeks into the stall .
Then comes positioning : he takes the stall next to the policeman .
Signaling : Senator Craig allegedly taps his foot and touches it to the officer ’s shoe , which was positioned close to the divider , then slides his hand along the bottom of the stall .
There are more phases in Mr. Humphreys ’s full lexicon — maneuvering , contracting , foreplay and payoff — but Mr. Craig was arrested after the officer presumed he had “ signaled . ”
Clearly , whatever Mr. Craig ’s intentions , the police entrapped him .
If the police officer had n’t met his stare , answered that tap or done something overt , there would be no news story .
On this point , Mr. Humphreys was adamant and explicit : “ On the basis of extensive and systematic observation , I doubt the veracity of any person ( detective or otherwise ) who claims to have been ‘ molested ’ in such a setting without first having ‘ given his consent . ’ ”
As for those who feel that a family man and a conservative senator would be unlikely to engage in such acts , Mr. Humphreys ’s research says otherwise .
As a former Episcopal priest and closeted gay man himself , he was surprised when he interviewed his subjects to learn that most of them were married ; their houses were just a little bit nicer than most , their yards better kept .
They were well educated , worked longer hours , tended to be active in the church and the community but , unexpectedly , were usually politically and socially conservative , and quite vocal about it .
In other words , not only did these men have nice families , they had nice families who seemed to believe what the fathers loudly preached about the sanctity of marriage .
Mr. Humphreys called this paradox “ the breastplate of righteousness . ”
The more a man had to lose by having a secret life , the more he acquired the trappings of respectability : “ His armor has a particularly shiny quality , a refulgence , which tends to blind the audience to certain of his practices .
To others in his everyday world , he is not only normal but righteous — an exemplar of good behavior and right thinking . ”

We also have 12 bhaktas [ devotees ] that are reading and chanting regularly .
Our programs are spreading .
Now I host a mantra meditation class once a week , and also Mondays and Fridays I have a small program of bhajans [ devotional songs ] and prasadam [ vegetarian food , offered to Krishna ] .
We are also distributing cookies on 3 different base camps thanks to Rathna Bushana Prabhu with an average of 1000 cookies out a week .
Recently I reached out to the Indians that work here and am having a weekly program with them as well .
I am giving a presentation on the Lord 's lifting of Gorvadhana Hill on Sat , 10 Nov to about 200-300 Indian - body contract workers .
My diet is ok .. mostly I am eating raw and dry fruits , dahl with only turmeric , cumin , and small amounts of salt , very simple food ( maybe because I can not get anything else ) .
I also am following chaturmasya this year strictly , and for the Kartika I have increased the number of rounds I am chanting and my reading as my vrata .
And have never missed a round of japa since arriving here .
Bhakti Shastri is moving along and am now in the 6th chapter ... so much nectar .
The Ratha Yatra was all set to go , but Krishna had another plan .
So now the hard date is Jan , which is great , because all the Indians want to be involved .
But like in all areas of the material world .... there are bad times .
One of my soldiers died in my arms .
That hit hard , because he did service for my Lords .
But I was told he said " Krishna " before he left , so that gives some solace .
Also I have been hit with a lot of IEDs , took a round , lost some hearing and some more , and I am only 5 months in .
Also Krishna gave me the strength to lead my team through a mass casualty event , where after suicide attacks in the North , we had to treat over 60 men , women and children .
The real material world .
Nothing more sobering than having to put some little child 's brain matter back in their head while still trying to focus on speaking Krishna Katha to the dying child .
Some died , but l always carry Sri Ugraji [ the form of Lord Krishna who appeared as Narasingha Deva ] with me , and His smile was seen by them before they left their bodies .
So powerful this movement , this process .
Krishna is helping me here and showing me how special this life is .
Here is my report , submitted at your lotus feet .
I pray that Krishna helps me out of this situation , and I can help others outside the military come to Srila Prabhupada 's feet .
Your servant Partha - sarathi dasa
Controversy
On two or three forums , I happened across comments from persons who criticized Partha - sarathi's reports from Iraq as bad for the image of the Hare Krishna movement –questioning the apparent paradox that is Partha - sarathi Prabhu 's identity as a devotee and simultaneously a soldier on his fourth tour in Iraq .
Much of the criticisms turned on the topic of nonviolence vs violence , voicing concern that the Hare Krishna movement is seen by the public as a movement of peace so what will the public make of a devotee on active duty in Iraq , offering cookies in one hand and toting a gun in the other .
Partha - sarathi Prabhu speaks for himself below , but I would like to add that it is our job to present Krishna consciousness as it is to everyone –individuals and the public at large , and that means dispelling myths and misconceptions as well .
There is no peace in this world , and there will not be unless and until Krishna consciousness takes hold in the hearts of the people of all nations .
Prabhupada did not bring Krishna consciousness out from India to start a " peace movement " ; he spoke that even if there were no war , the planet would not have peace , and besides that , he pointed out that sometimes there is necessity for war .
Bhagavad - gita was spoken on the battlefield , minutes before the onset of the world 's most horrific war that ended in the deaths of 640 million in just 18 days .
That is not to say that the Iraq war is justified or has the blessings of Krishna .
But a devotee reaches out to his fellow men wherever he finds himself , no matter what situation he might be in , and that is just what Partha - sarathi Prabhu is doing .
I would like to ask who else is doing anything good for the US soldiers in Baghdad or back in the US ?
We may be against the war , but so are many of the troops in Iraq right now .
In any case , they do not have a choice ; they get their orders and go .
We have been reading about their plight on coming back - stories abound of neglect , mental afflictions , homelessness , suicides .
So all glories to Partha - sarathi Prabhu , who is a lifeline for his men in many ways and a fearless sankirtan soldier of Srila Prabhupada .

It looks like those hoping to port their collection of iPod games over to their shiny new iPod nano or iPod classic are going to be out of luck , unless they fork over the cash for new " reformatted " versions of the games .
Unfortunately , according to iLounge , only three iPod games have been updated for the latest - gen players , including EA 's Tetris and Sudoku , and Namco's Ms. Pac - Man .
On the upside , those three games have all received some changes of various degrees , including most notably an all new control scheme on Tetris that 'll let you use the click wheel for block rotation .
While there 's no word on a timeline for upgraded versions of the remaining 15 games , the three that have been reformatted are apparently available for download now for $ 4.99 apiece . [ Image courtesy of iLounge

BROOKLIN , Canada , Nov 12 , 2007 ( IPS )
Coral reefs face certain extinction in a few decades unless there are unprecedented reductions in carbon emissions , leading Australian scientists warn .
Corals around the world may be nothing but rubble before a child born today turns 30 years old , and almost certainly before they ’re 50 .
The reason ?
Rising carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels in the atmosphere are turning the oceans acidic far faster than previously observed .
“ It is n’t just the coral reefs which are affected .
A large part of the plankton in the Southern Ocean , the coccolithophorids , are also affected , ” said Malcolm McCulloch , an environmental research scientist at the Australian National University in Canberra .
“ These ( coccolithophorids ) drive ocean productivity and are the base of the food web which supports krill , whales , tuna and our fisheries , ” McCulloch said in a statement .
Plankton also play a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the deep ocean .
Major declines in plankton mean atmospheric CO2 levels would rise far faster than the present forecasts and oceans would become even more acidic .
Recent research is showing that the ocean has become about one - third of a pH unit more acid over the past 50 years .
This is roughly triple previous measurements .
“ This is still early days for the research , and the trend is not uniform , but it certainly looks as if marine acidity is building up , ” said McCulloch .
The oceans and the atmosphere are intimately connected — the quintessential yin and yang .
Changes in the atmosphere affect the oceans and vice - versa .
Pump extra CO2 into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and some of that extra CO2 combines with carbonate ions in seawater , forming carbonic acid .
The fact that CO2 is making the oceans more acid was established just three years ago .
Scientists are still scrambling to determine the overall impacts .
“ The effect of an acidifying ocean is that precious carbonate ions are removed , ” says Ove Hoegh - Guldberg , a scientist at the Centre for Marine Studies at the University of Queensland , Australia .
“ These ions are critical to the calcium carbonate production ( calcification ) of a range of marine organisms , including reef - building corals , ” Hoegh - Guldberg told IPS .
Hoegh - Guldberg , McCulloch and more than 50 marine scientists attending a recent forum hosted by Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies have released a formal call to action , calling on “ all societies and governments to immediately and substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions ” .
“ Ocean acidification due to increased atmospheric CO2 is accelerating … Reducing CO2 emissions is the only way to prevent further damage to coral reefs , ” they warn .
As carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere , the concentration of carbonate ions declines , with the result that corals can no longer build reefs .
The oceans have already absorbed nearly half of the fossil - fuel CO2 emitted into the atmosphere since pre-industrial times , causing a significant reduction in seawater pH .
“ And with no reef framework , the habitat for an estimated million species is destroyed , ” Hoegh - Guldberg said .

Disclosure is needed .
More and more people are waking up to the fact that we are not alone in the universe .
Personally , I think a lot of problems on this planet could be solved if we just recognized that there is other ( more ) intelligent life out there .
For one thing , the knowledge of extra- terrestrial life would lead us to some feelings of embarrassment about the stupid shit we 're doing to our planet and each other .
I 'm thinking of war , environmental degradation , political arrogance and conspicuous consumption , amongst many other problems .
I mean , it 's humiliating enough that the Bush / Cheney cabal is bleeding liberty away ( somebody make a photoshopped pic of Bush waterboarding Lady Liberty please ) , but if we knew aliens were watching the whole thing unfold maybe we 'd say , " You know , maybe we should ask the aliens for help .
Maybe they know what to do about the dichotomy between security and liberty . "
Maybe that 's why they 're being kept underwraps .
Maybe the powers that be do n't like the message they bring .
It 's important to remember that not all high - ranking officials want to be a party to this coverup , though .
One such group is putting their reputations on the line to call for disclosure and a real investigation .
An international panel of two dozen former pilots and government officials called on the U.S. government on Monday to reopen its generation - old UFO investigation as a matter of safety and security given continuing reports about flying discs , glowing spheres and other strange sightings .
" Especially after the attacks of 9/11 , it is no longer satisfactory to ignore radar returns ... which cannot be associated with performances of existing aircraft and helicopters , " they said in a statement released at a news conference .
The panelists from seven countries , including former senior military officers , said they had each seen a UFO or conducted an official investigation into UFO phenomena .
The subject of UFOs grabbed the spotlight in the U.S. presidential race last month when [ Dennis ] Kucinich , a member of Congress from Ohio , said during a televised debate with other Democratic candidates that he had seen one .
Former presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter are both reported to have claimed UFO sightings .
tell
want to be discovered
nuclear - powered stealth blimps !
I 'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies .
It was bigger than anything that I 've ever seen .
It remains a great mystery .
Other people saw it , responsible people .
I do n't know why people would ridicule it .
It was enormous and inexplicable .
Who knows where it came from ?
A lot of people saw it , and I saw it too .
It was dramatic .
And it could n't have been flares because it was too symmetrical .
It had a geometric outline , a constant shape .
Believing alien life exists does not necessarily require seeing , and it certainly does n't require faith .
It 's just a matter of deduction , probability , and simple reasoning .
Think for a moment of the things you accept as true without the benefit of having seen them with your own eyes .
You very likely accept the fact that not all life on Earth has been discovered .
Although you have no tangible proof of that , you have an intuitive understanding of mathematical probability and an idea of what the limitations on exploration are .
You probably accept as true that there are more stars in the Universe than there are grains of sand on Earth , but in reality , no one 's ever really counted them .
We see far off galaxies , most too far for our satellites to define , and we just assume they 're composed of hundreds of billions of stars , just like our Milky Way is ( never counted those either ) .
It 's a sound assumption , for sure .
But an assumption nonetheless .
What I 'm trying to convince you of is that mathematical probability can be just as strong a proof as observation , which is itself limited by perception .
Now , what do we know about life that might help us get a better grasp on the alien question ?
Well , for starters , we know there 's life on Earth .
We 're not exactly sure how it came about , but most of us are convinced it was n't by way of magic .
We believe it had much , if not everything to do with the composition and solar proximity of our planet .
We know that each Earthly life - form adapts to its respective environment , and we suspect they evolve in order to better compete with their rivals .
We know our world has at times been uninhabited , inhabited , uninhabited , and inhabited again .
We know there are great extinctions and new births .
And we know , eventually , our planet will die .
There is not one single aspect of our planet , that makes life as we know it possible -- i.e. vulcanism , atmosphere , water , carbon , etc. -- that we have not yet detected on another planet .
I 'm talking about the basic ingredients , not the recipe .
So we have to ask ourselves two questions :
Are these the only ingredients to life ? , and , is our particular recipe for life the only one capable of rising in a solar oven ?
If we presume both to be the case , we must then ask a third question :
In a Universe of at least 100 billion galaxies ( each with some 200 billion stars ) , and tens of trillions of planets ; what are the likely odds of a recipe similar to ours repeating itself ?
For that matter , what are the odds of Venus ' recipe repeating itself ?
What are the odds for that of Jupiter , or that of Mars ?
How about Mercury ?
Is Neptune a one per galaxy anomaly ?
Are all planets in the Universe unique ?
If you 're like me , you 're likely to conclude that the odds of our " recipe " type repeating itself are just as good as those of any other planet .
But , whether or not alien life has come upon Earth can be debated .
I 'm personally convinced that it has .
But I do n't believe that that topic can be seriously broached without more people first coming to terms with the all - too - probable existence of life outside our own world .
The former governor says the incident remains unsolved , and deserves an official investigation .
The U.S. government has never acknowledged that something was in the sky that night .
Former Phoenix city councilwoman Frances Barwood , now living in the Prescott area , was the only elected official to launch a public investigation in 1997 , but she said people stonewalled her at every turn .
Barwood spoke with more than 700 witnesses .
" The government never interviewed even one , " she says .
Everybody in this group probably already knows that we 've made contact .
It 's just less nutjob -y to call for an investigation .
As for me , I 've never seen a UFO , never met an alien , and never had anything shoved up my ass .
I can just .
You know what I mean ?
Probably not , so let me explain : I can tell not only that ETs exists , but that the government knows about them and has in fact made contact with them , simply by monitoring the government 's behavior .
It 's simple : the U.S. government has approached UFO investigation in a secretive , yet lackadaisical manner .
The secretive part makes sense , since , under the respective political milieus of the last 60 years , the UFOs could be ( and most likely were , from the U.S. government 's perspective ) threats from our Communist or Terrorist adversaries .
So it makes perfect sense to be reticent about speaking to the public on the matter .
However , the lazy , half - assed attitude the government took towards actually investigating these phenomenon belies their obsession with secrecy .
In fact , many UFO sighters have noted that the government was more concerned with shutting them up than actually finding out what happened .
This leaves us with two possibilities .
One is the ET theory , the other is the " secret project theory . "
This theory states that the government has been behind the UFOs from the beginning .
This theory has strong supporting circumstantial evidence since the government has been known to work on secret projects ( from the Manhatten Project to the stealth bomber ) and the military had to explore any option to get a leg up on the Soviets .
However , this theory has several holes .
One , the technology is far beyond what we have even today .
And this technology would have to have been available in 1947 .
Another problem with the secret project theory is that the UFOs seem to .
What else can explain The Phoenix Lights ?
Why would the government make vastly more dull coverup work for themselves when they could test the secret craft over deserted land instead of a major metropolitan area , home to 1.5 million people ?
It just does n't make sense unless you start using conspiratorial contortions far more convoluted than the idea that there 's life out there .
I heard a good one today : Somebody suggested the Phoenix Lights were a secret government project involvingOh , I should note that former Arizona governor Fife Symington is a member of the group agitating for disclosure I mentioned earlier .
He had this to say about the event : I do .
Ridicule is a very effective weapon if your aim is to affect a coverup .
Heck , ridicule is probably your best bet , besides threats .
If you organize an effective campaign of ridicule then the victim spends more time trying to defend his reputation than talking about what he saw , and then it has the dual purpose of preemptively ridiculing all other similar claims by association .
It must be stated clearly : Ridicule is not a logical argument .
It is an ad hominem attack and is thus a fallacious argument .
Attack arguments , not people .
Now , anybody who disagrees with my assessment is free to say so , but simply ridiculing me is not an effective argument .
It might be effective in that it makes people agree with you ( for fear of being ridiculed if they do n't ) , but it does nothing to bolster your argument .
In fact , it makes you look like you do n't know what you 're talking about .
I wish I did n't need to make the above statement , but I 've been on the internet far too long to believe otherwise .
Anyway , I want to address the idea that the alien life is highly improbable .
For one thing , so is our very existence , but here we are .
For another , there are billions upon billions of stars out there .
We 're finding extrasolar planets at an amazing rate .
It 's not unfair to say the universe is probably swarming with planets , many of them habitable by carbon - based lifeforms .
But we must already remember that there 's no guarantee that extra-terrestrial life would be anything like us .
I think the whole question is summed up nicely by this excellent comment on digg ( yes , I 'm surprised too ) : Indeed , the possibility of life outside our world is more than just a possibility .
I would go so far as to say it 's probable .
But some people seem oddly reluctant to acknowledge the logic above .
Remember when I said that the U.S. government has taken a lazy approach to investigating the UFO phenomenon ?
That pretty much says it all .

Pregnant women already have plenty to worry about .
But now some doctors are pointing to another potential problem : tattoos .
The issue is whether it 's safe to stick a needle through a tattoo in the lower back for an epidural -- an injection of painkilling medicine that can ease the discomfort of labor .
There has been an explosion in recent years in women 's lower - back tattoos -- often ornate designs that take up a lot of surface area near the vertebrae where epidural needles are typically inserted .
In 2002 , a pair of Canadian anesthesiologists published a report that questioned whether administering an epidural through such a tattoo could be risky .
The doctors speculated that complications like inflammation or nerve damage may arise if the needle pulled a bit of dyed skin along with it , and then deposited it into the nerve - rich region outside the spinal column .
The small study of three women -- which concluded that there was n't enough evidence to determine if the practice is safe or not -- set off a mini-wave of panic among expectant moms .
After the report was picked up by Canadian television , women began sharing their concerns on pregnancy Web sites and chat rooms .
In July , a story on the topic appeared in Pregnancy magazine , further fueling anxiety and sending many women to their practitioners for advice .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Major U.S. telephone carriers refused to answer questions from the Democratic - led Congress about their possible participation in President George W. Bush ’s warrantless domestic spying program , according to documents released by lawmakers on Monday .

At issue are reports that surfaced last year that some big telephone companies allowed the U.S. government access to millions of telephone records for Bush ’s anti-terror efforts following the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States .
Officials from AT&T , Verizon Communications and Qwest Communications International told the House Energy and Commerce Committee they could not discuss specifics about their companies ’ roles in any such effort .
The phone companies said it would be illegal for them to discuss the kind of program lawmakers were asking about without permission from the Bush administration .
AT&T “ essentially finds itself caught in the middle of an oversight dispute between the Congress and the executive relating to government surveillance activities , ” AT&T General Counsel Wayne Watts said in a letter to the committee .
“ Unfortunately , under current circumstances , we are unable to respond with specificity to your inquiries , ” Watts added in the letter to the panel headed by Rep. John Dingell , a Michigan Democrat .
Bush has demanded retroactive immunity from liability for telecommunication firms that participated in warrantless surveillance as part of any new bill to revise the laws governing the tracking of suspected enemy targets .
House Democratic leaders have refused , saying that the administration must first explain what these firms did before they will even consider granting immunity .
The phone companies ’ responses to Dingell were sent to the committee on Friday .
The companies said they had policies in place to protect customers ’ privacy , but also said federal law authorized them to help the government investigate criminals and terrorists .
Verizon said phone companies had been targeted in a number of class action lawsuits filed after the government program was revealed in news reports .
“ In the context of this litigation , we have been informed by the Department of Justice that we cannot confirm or deny Verizon ’s role ( if any ) in the alleged programs , ” said Verizon executive Randal Milch .
Democrats vowed to push the administration for answers .
“ I look forward to meeting with representatives of the administration in short order , and I am hopeful that they will be forthcoming with the information Congress needs to properly evaluate this program , ” Dingell said .
Also on Monday , House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers said he had sent a letter to administration officials asking for details about “ potentially unlawful surveillance activities before 9 - 11 ” and allegations that the government had retaliated against Qwest earlier for refusing to participate in the surveillance program .
Former Qwest chief executive Joseph Nacchio refused the government ’s request up until he left the company in 2002 , his lawyer has said .
In his request to the phone companies earlier this month , Dingell asked them to describe how government requests for customer information are made and how the records are disclosed .
He also asked if the government tried to install equipment on phone networks to intercept Internet traffic or presented a subpoena ordering the companies to install or permit such equipment .
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act requires the government to obtain orders from a secret FISA court to conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States .
After the September 11 attacks , Bush authorized the interception without warrants of communications between people in the United States and others overseas if one had suspected ties to terrorists .
Critics charge that program violated the FISA law , but Bush argued he had wartime powers to do so .
In January , Bush put the program under the supervision of the FISA court .
Terms of the oversight have not been made public .
In August Congress , under pressure from Bush , expanded the power of federal authorities to conduct warrantless surveillance in the tracking of enemy targets .
Democrats want to tighten that law with additional oversight by Congress and the secret court created by FISA .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Vaccines have cut deaths from the diseases they prevent by 99 percent , U.S. government researchers reported on Tuesday .

They looked at the rates of both disease and deaths for 13 illnesses prevented by vaccines , most given in infancy and childhood , and found they have worked as intended .
“ The number of cases of most vaccine - preventable diseases is at an all - time low ; hospitalizations and deaths from vaccine - preventable diseases have also shown striking decreases , ” the researchers wrote in their report , published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
“ These achievements are largely due to reaching and maintaining high vaccine coverage levels from infancy throughout childhood by successful implementation of the infant and childhood immunization program . ”
Sandra Roush of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and colleagues examined the illness and death rates for 13 vaccine - preventable diseases -- diphtheria , pertussis ( whooping cough ) , tetanus , polio , measles , mumps , rubella , invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) , acute hepatitis B , hepatitis A , varicella ( chickenpox ) , Streptococcus pneumoniae and smallpox .
Smallpox was eradicated globally in 1979 thanks to vaccination and now the immunization is not routinely given to the general public .
“ Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of biomedical science and public health , ” Roush and her team wrote .
The U.S. statistics showed striking reductions in both disease and death .
For example , between 1936 and 1945 , more than 21,000 people on average became infected with diphtheria and 1,800 died on average every year .
There were no cases or deaths in 2006 .
Between 1953 and 1962 , more than 500,000 people caught measles every year and 440 died of it .
There were 55 cases in 2006 .
The decline in cases of mumps was 95.9 percent after mandatory vaccination .
Tetanus cases fell by 92.9 percent , and whooping cough cases declined by 92.2 percent .
Deaths from tetanus and whooping cough fell by 99 percent .
U.S. children must show they have current vaccinations to attend most schools , or parents must declare they have a recognized philosophical or religious objection to vaccination .
Some parents have expressed fears about the safety of vaccines and in some communities groups have refused vaccination .
The researchers said this has been shown to endanger both those who do not get vaccinated , and people they come into contact with .
The study did not include influenza because the vaccine must be reformulated and administered every year .
Court docs : Wal - Mart plotted strategy in ' Tax Shelter Room ' Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday October 23 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Accounting firm urged caution in ' post - Enron environment '
When the Wal - Mart corporation sent out a 2001 plea to heavy - hitting accounting houses requesting some bright ideas about how the retail giant might be able to pay less in state taxes , Ernst & Young LLP was eager to pitch in .
But after being challenged by North Carolina 's attorney general , the big - time firm 's secret tax - slashing strategies have come to light in an array of revealing materials filed in court .
" Big companies hardly ever discuss how outside accountants , lawyers and investment bankers help them cut their tax bills , " reports Jesse Drucker of the Wall Street Journal , who writes that the court filings offer " a rare window into accountants ' role in generating tax - reduction ideas at one major company . "
Drucker says that after their hiring , Ernst & Young " swung into action .
Senior tax experts at the big accounting firm swapped ideas via email and in a series of meetings .
At least one gathering , according to an internal Ernst & Young calendar , took place in Wal - Mart 's headquarters in the ' Tax Shelter Room . ' "
Among the revelations in the documents , according to the Journal , is evidence that Wal - Mart aggressively capitalized on its move a decade ago to transfer ownership of the company 's stores to real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) , subsidiaries that are exempt from federal tax provided that 90 % of income is paid out in shareholder dividends .
In California , Wal - Mart followed the firm 's advice to claim tax deductions on shareholder dividends that were technically never paid .
Exploiting a loophole in California law that does n't require dividend recipients to list that money as taxable income , Wal - Mart 's REITs would simply take a hefty tax deduction for paying dividends to another subsidiary , which in turn would opt not to report the earnings .
The practice resulted in a dramatic savings on tax bills in the state .
California 's Franchise Tax Board , the state 's income - tax agency , has since put the strategy on its list of " Abusive Tax Shelters , " the paper reports .
The current North Carolina case also involves real estate trusts .
" In Texas , " continues the Journal , " Ernst & Young helped Wal - Mart set up a somewhat more common tax - cutting vehicle .
Under Texas law at the time , a limited partner from out of state was exempt from Texas 's corporate franchise tax .
As a result , scores of companies , including Wal - Mart , reorganized their Texas operations into limited partnerships . "
State lawmakers closed that loophole earlier this year .
Other strategies were floated as well by the firm , including " a 37 - page proposal laying out a smorgasbord of 27 potential tax strategies , most tailored to a particular state 's tax code . "
One of those ideas was even accompanied by a warning : " Note that in a ' post - Enron ' environment and amidst the focus on ' tax haven ' operations , this strategy is expected to get more scrutiny by the IRS , as well as some states , " the note read , according to the paper .
Regarding the so - called " Tax Shelter Room , " Wal - Mart 's former vice president for tax policy , David Bullington , said in a deposition to North Carolina officials that the name was actually just " a bit of a pun " referencing the use of the conference room in staging safety drills .

Virtually everyone on the Amazon Web Services team has occasion to interact with our developer customers from time to time .
This rich source of product feedback gives us a lot of insight into ways that we can do an even better job of meeting their needs as we grow and enhance each of our web services .
Some of the developers building applications with Amazon S3 have been asking us about an SLA , or Service Level Agreement .
An SLA defines the minimum acceptable level of performance from a service along with some sort of penalty for not meeting expectations .
A typical SLA actually defines a performance or reliability boundary which is somewhat lower than what the system is actually designed , built , and expected to deliver .
We know that many of our customers , including a multitude of teams within Amazon , are using S3 in mission - critical ways and need a formal commitment from us in order to make commitments to their own users and customers .
After talking to many developers to make sure that we fully and precisely understood what the term “ SLA ” meant to them , we were able to start defining one that was appropriate for S3 .
I am very happy to announce that , effective October 1 , 2007 , The Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement is in effect .
This SLA has been in the works for a while and we take the commitments made in this document quite seriously .
We knew that S3 had to meet the very high performance and reliability goals set by our internal clients .
We strongly believed that meeting this level of operational excellence would be good enough for our external users as well .
Before we published our SLA , we wanted to get a better sense of how our external developers were making use of S3 .
With well over 5 billion objects under management , we now understand the usage patterns and properties needed to make an informed commitment .
You can read the entire document to see how this will work .
Basically , we commit to 99.9 % uptime , measured on a monthly basis .
If an S3 call fails ( by returning a ServiceUnavailable or InternalError result ) this counts against the uptime .
If the resulting uptime is less than 99 % , you can apply for a service credit of 25 % of your total S3 charges for the month .
If the uptime is 99 % but less than 99.9 % , you can apply for a service credit of 10 % of your S3 charges .
We ’re committed to providing a highly available service which meets the needs of current and future customers .
This new SLA is our way of formalizing that commitment , letting you know what the minimum expected level of performance will be .
As is the norm with agreements like this , there ’s some fine print and you should definitely read it yourself to learn more .

It is one of the great spectacles of the natural world and the largest mass movement of land animals on the planet .
This extraordinary picture , taken by award - winning wildlife photographer Steve Bloom , shows just a fraction of the 1.5 million majestic wildebeest which cross the Mara River in Kenya every year .
They are joined on this incredible journey by 500,000 gazelle and 200,000 zebra .
Scroll down for more ...
Many barely visible through a dramatic cloud of desert dust , they stampede across the plains of the Serengeti National Park , six million wildebeest hooves churning up the verdant grassland until it resembles a World War I battlefield .
They are travelling South to reach the new grasslands of the Serengeti , leaving behind the now parched woodland of the Masai Mara National Park .
Once they arrive in February , they will spend the wet season here on their breeding ground .
Come next June they will undertake the journey north once more , to the now rejuvenated forests of Masai Mara .
It is one of nature 's most remarkable cycles , replenishing the vegetation of Northern Africa .
A 500 km round trip , it is undoubtedly one of the natural world 's most astonishing phenomena .
This is a path fraught with dangers .
The waters of the Mara River are teeming with hungry crocodiles and the strong currents can claim as many as 3,000 wildebeests each year .
Add to this the lions , hyenas , leopards and jackals lying in wait on dry land , and the jostling mass of herbivores seems like a banquet in waiting .
They are particularly vulnerable at night , when individual stragglers can be picked out , and the younger and weaker members of the herd are easily dragged down .
Overall , about 250,000 wildebeest die during each trip .
Although the wildebeest of the Serengeti are thought to have followed a migratory path since ancient times , it is only in recent years that this circular migration was necessary .
In the 19th century the population was ravaged by disease and declined to less than 200,000 .
However , after veterinary intervention in the early 1960s their numbers once more began to swell , reaching a staggering 1.4 million in a matter of years .
Forced to search for new supplies of grass and water to nourish their growing herd , the current migration route was established .
It is a demanding cycle of life and death .
Of the 400,000 calves born in the Serengeti every year , only one in three will return from their first and most challenging migration .
Steve Bloom , who took the picture , has travelled the world capturing some of the animal world 's breathtaking sights with his camera .
But the sheer majestic beauty of the wildebeest migration is surely the one which brings us closest to nature .
さて 、Vim導入メモを書いてから、早いものでもう一ヶ月経ってしまいました。
ようやく使い方にもそこそこ慣れてきたので、今回はVim導入の一番の目的でもあったRails開発についてまとめてみたいと思います。
Rails開発に役立 つVimスクリプト(必須)
Vim / Ruby
これはVimでRubyを扱う際の最も基本的な拡張機能と思います。
.rb( ruby ) と.rhtml(eruby )のファイルでシンタックスハイライトが有効になるほか、オムニ補完(<C-X><C-O>で表示される自動補完)も使えるようになります。
omni補完 - モデル内 で 「 has 」と入力して補完したところ
オムニ補完を実行する<C-X><C-O>は入力が面倒なので、予めキーマップを変更しておくのがお勧め。
" <C - Space > でomni補完 imap < C - Space > < C-x ><C-o >
Vim / Ruby自体はKaoriya版のバイナリに同梱されているので、環境にRubyがインストールされていればそのまま使えます。
また、グローバル変数のオプションを設定することで上の画像のようにRailsのメソッド名にも対応してくれます。
" Rubyのオムニ補完を設 定 ( ft- ruby - omni ) let g:rubycomplete_buffer_loading = 1 let g:rubycomplete_classes_in_global = 1 let g:rubycomplete_rails = 1
( ＊2007-08-27追記：buffer_loadingとclasses_in_globalのオプションを書いていなかったので追加)
参考情報
rails.vim
Rails開発の中心となるのはこちら。
かなり盛りだくさんな機能が備わっていますが、詳しくはドキュメントを読んでいただくとしてここでは主なものだけ紹介します。
Railsコマンドの実行
通常コマンドプロンプトから実行するRailsコマンドを、Vimの中から実行できるようになります。
よく使うコマンドはこんな感じ。
: Rails {directory} →railsプロジェクトを作成 : Rake {target} →db:migrateな ど、rakeを実行 : Rgenerate {options} → controller , modelなどを作成 : Rserver {options} →サーバを起 動
オプションはコマンドラインの場合と同じように指定できます。
ファイル間の移 動
Rails開発において他のIDEと比べたとき、Vimを使う一番のメリットになりそうなのがこのファイル間の移動機能。
まず、カーソル下のファイルへ移動する「gf」コマンドがrailsの文脈を考慮して動作してくれます。
gfの使用例はこんな感じ。(*はカーソルのポジションを表す)
Boo*k.find(:all )
コントローラにてモデル名を選択→gf app/models/book.rb
該当モデルファイルが開く
また、開いているファイルに応じて「[f 」 と 「 ] f」を使って別ファイルへジャンプすることができます。
[ fで 「 もうひとつ の ( 代替 ) 」ファイルへ移 動
] fで 「関連する」ファイルへ移動
例えば 「 ] f」コマンドだけでコントローラファイルとビューの相互移動ができるといった具合。
詳しいファイルごとの対応についてはヘルプドキュメントやチートシート(参考情報のところにリンクを載せておきます)で確認してください。
略語補完( 単語の補完 )
入力モード時、特定の短縮名を入力後に<c-]>を入力することで文脈に応じてキーワードが展開されます。
ビューのform_tagを書いているとき:a<c-]>と入力すると「:action =>」に変換、という感じ。
短縮名は 「 : Rabbrev」で現在のファイルタイプに応じた一覧が表示されます。
rails.vimの設定
rails.vimにはいくつかのオプション設定が存在します。
私の現在の設定は以下の通り。
" rails.vimの設定(rails.vim ) let g:rails_level = 4 let g:rails_devalut_database = ' mysql '
参考情報
Rails開発に役立つvimスクリプト( あると便利 )
project.vim
この拡張スクリプトを使うと、「 : Project」で画面左にプロジェクトごとのディレクトリツリーを表示できるようになります。
project.vim
通常project.vim単体では表示するプロジェクトの定義を手動(ウィザード)で行う必要がありますが、Rails.vimにはproject.vimとの連係機能があり「:Rproject」コマンドだけで自動的に現在開いているRailsプロジェクトをディレクトリツリーへ追加できます。
また細かいことですが、このproject.vimで表示したディレクトリツリーは、右のコードを表示しているウィンドウで「<C-W>o」としても消えずに残ってくれるのがありがたいところです。
参考情報
matchit.vim
matchit.vimは、対応する括弧へ移動する「%」コマンドを拡張してくれます。
vim/rubyが導入されている場合、これによって「module」「class」「def」に対応する「end」にジャンプできるようになります。
surround.vim
標準では囲い込みの全 体( a) と中身( i)しか指定できないテキストオブジェクトの機能を、外側(s)の指定にも使えるようにしてくれます。
具体的には、vで範囲選択したあと「s ” 」とすることで、文字を ” で囲むことなどが可能になります。( 同じく 「ds ” 」なら外側の囲い込みを削除)
rails.vimが導入されている場合、この機能がERBタグに対応するよう拡張され、ビュー内で「=」で囲むよう指定すると自動的に「< %= %>」として処理されます。
例えば「yss=」とすれば、カレント行を「< %=」と 「%>」で囲むことができます。
参考情報
surround.vimの使い方については、以下のページが参考になります。
snippetsEmu.vim
TextMateライクなスニペット機能を提供してくれるものです。
def < Tab>と入力するとendが自動補完され、カーソルはメソッド名の入力位置に移動します。
参考情報
snippetsEmu.vimの使い方については、以下のページが参考になります。
NERD_commenter.vim
コメント処理のため のVimスクリプトはいくつか存在するようですが、現在はこれが最強っぽいです。
, c<Space>などのコマンドで、ファイルタイプに応じたコメントアウトを行うことができます。
コメントのトグルを使いやすいようマッピングし直しておくと便利。
" < Leader>xでコメントをトグル( NERD_commenter.vim ) map < Leader>x , c< space > " 未対応ファイルタイプのエラーメッセージを表示しない let NERDShutUp=1
参考情報
vimrcの設定
その他RubyとRails開発のために設定しているvimrcの設定を載せておきます。
以 下のautocomandの設定は、スマートな書き方をよく知らないのでちょっと汚いですがとりあえずこれで問題なく動いています。
" タブ幅をリセット au BufNewFile , BufRead * set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 " .rhtmlと.rbと.ymlでタブ幅を変更 au BufNewFile , BufRead *.rhtml set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 au BufNewFile , BufRead *.rb set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 au BufNewFile , BufRead *.yml set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 " Rails関連ファイルで文字コードをUFT - 8に設定 au User Rails * set fenc=utf - 8
参考情報
リファレンスの参 照
RadRailsにはRailsリファレンスのインクリメンタル検索機能がありますが、Vimでは現在残念ながらこれに相当する機能がありません。
しかし、以下のサイトでリファレンスをHTMLヘルプ化されたものが公開されているので、これを別途使えばキーワードによる検索が可能です。
開発時に はVimと併せて開いておくとよいでしょう。
HTMLヘルプ
ちなみに 、Ruby自体のリファレンスはVimから検索するためのスクリプトが存在するようです。(私はまだ使ってみていません)
まとめ
以上、VimでのRails開発について直接役立ちそうなものを書き出してみました。
もっとも 、Vimにはここで紹介しきれなかった便利な機能や拡張スクリプトがまだまだ存在します。
実際の開発作業ではそれらも組み合わせて使うことになるでしょう。
Vimは使い方に慣れるまでには時間がかかりますが、高いカスタマイズ性や気の利いた拡張機能は大きな魅力です。
是非このような優れたツールを使いこなして効率的にコーディングを進めてゆきたいものです。

So the president has asked you to do something that he claims is crucial to the national security of the United States .
He assures you that the action is legal .
Can you go ahead and do it , secure in the knowledge that a presidential imprimatur will keep you from getting dragged into court sometime in the future ?
Probably not , no .
At the very least , run the scenario by an outside lawyer .
That 's the lesson a careful observer might draw from a pair of controversies swirling through Washington in recent weeks .
The question of potential liability for past actions is central to the Bush administration 's push to grant immunity to telecommunications firms that aided the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretap program .
It also threaded through Attorney General Michael Mukasey 's hedged judgment as to the legality of waterboarding .
Overall , the issue has worried many administration officials for years , according to Jack Goldsmith , who headed the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel from 2003 to 2004 .
On one hand , these officials face unrelenting pressure to prevent more terrorist attacks on the United States .
On the other , they are supposed to stay within the lines of US law , including privacy and civil rights statutes .
" That some court or judge or prosecutor or investigator down the road would interpret these criminal laws differently than the administration did and hold them criminally liable was a central , prevalent concern in the administration , " Mr. Goldsmith , now a professor at Harvard Law School , told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Oct. 2 .
The question of legal immunity for telecommunications companies that helped the government eavesdrop on Americans without court orders is likely to be a hot topic in the Senate this week .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to decide if it wants to include such retroactive protection in the new electronic surveillance legislation , which is wending its way through Congress .
Telecoms face lawsuits
Telecommunications companies face more than 30 lawsuits alleging that the firms violated customers ' rights by cooperating with the government 's surveillance effort .
Immunity , if granted by lawmakers , would make such suits moot .
The Bush administration says it will veto the surveillance bill if the immunity provision is not included .
It 's only fair , supporters say , to protect an industry that answered a presidential call after 9/11 .
" If the local fire company asked for your help putting out a neighbor 's blaze , you would not force the firefighters to justify their request .
You would just help , right ?
That 's what the phone companies did when the Bush administration asked them in secret for help with wiretaps to target Al Qaeda communications into and out of the country , " wrote Lee Hamilton , a former House member and cochairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States , also known as the 9/11 Commission , in an opinion piece on the subject .
Critics say immunity simply would provide an incentive for corporations to break the law in the future , by giving them the impression that they might count on obtaining an after - the - fact free pass .
Immunity would let the administration , as well as telecom firms , off the hook , according to Senate Judiciary panel chairman Patrick Leahy ( D ) of Vermont .
" Immunity is designed to shield this administration from any accountability for conducting surveillance outside the law , " said Senator Leahy in an Oct. 31 statement .
" It could make it impossible for Americans whose privacy has been violated illegally to seek meaningful redress . "
Meanwhile , by refusing during his Senate confirmation hearings to directly equate waterboarding with illegal torture , Mr. Mukasey may have been trying to lessen the possibility that any Central Intelligence Agency interrogators who used the harsh technique against terror suspects will face criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits in the future .
Such interrogators may have been depending on the past assurances of higher - ups that their conduct was within the bounds of US and international law .
If Mukasey had contradicted those assurances , it might have been tantamount to admitting that the US had engaged in war crimes , say legal experts .
In a written response to Senate questions , Mukasey said he would not want to make any " uninformed statement " that might place professional interrogators in the field " in personal legal jeopardy . "
Future liability for interrogators ?
It 's conceivable that interrogators might eventually have to face civil litigation filed by detainees , says Carl Tobias , a law professor at the University of Richmond .
But any criminal case would have to be brought by the administration itself – an unlikely proposition , at best .
That calculus might change under a Democratic president .
But even a Democratic administration would be unlikely to single out a low - level official , says Mr. Tobias .
" The greater concern would be that someone in the White House who authorized waterboarding might be subject to some sort of investigation . "
In waterboarding , the one being interrogated is strapped to an inclined bench .
Cloth is placed over his mouth , and water is poured onto it , to the point where the liquid overcomes the gag reflex and begins to fill the throat and lungs .
The Bush administration has never publicly confirmed use of the technique .
According to news reports , the CIA in recent years has employed it three times – most successfully in the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad , a high - ranking Al Qaeda official captured in Pakistan in 2003 .
The fact that immunity is such a live issue also points out the pitfalls of relying on presidential assurances of legality for potentially problematic activities , say legal experts .
The immunity debate shows that the Bush administration " is in partial retreat " from its past assertions that the Constitution grants presidents broad wartime powers that can't be fettered by statute , says Daniel Marcus , former general counsel of the 9/11 Commission .
In his book " The Terror Presidency , " Goldsmith describes an administration in which officials knew they were pushing legal limits , and were preoccupied with concern about their own legal futures .
Goldsmith predicts that the US will see cycles , with the CIA and other agencies periodically pulling back for fear of retroactive discipline – until terrorists attack again , and US security personnel are pressured anew to go up to the legal edge .
Brand G. got his start in the game industry working at MicroProse , famous for classics such as Civilization , the X - COM series , Masters of Orion , Pirates , and Dark Earth ( one of my personal favorites ) .
MicroProse was also known for its military simulation games , such as Gunship , Pacific Air War , M - 1 Tank Platoon , and Falcon 4.0 .
Brand was brought on to work on such a simulation , European Air War .
European Air War was doomed .
It was four years in development and not even close to being ready to ship .
In Brand 's first month at MicroProse , the whole programming team on European Air War quit , sensing that their project was on the verge of cancellation .
Not only that , but everyone had grown tired enduring the stress of the weekly " why - should n't - we - cancel - this - project " meetings with the executives .
In these meetings , they'd have to choose their words carefully when answering the executives ' tough questions about the budget as well as major bugs in the system such as ...
Why are the planes flying backwards sometimes ?
Well , uhh , a little known thing about Nazi technology developed in World War I ...
Well , uhh , a little known thing about Nazi technology developed in World War I ...
Why do the wings come off the plane whenever you fire the guns ?
Uhh , err ...
Uhh , err ...
Why does the plane bounce up and out of the earth 's atmosphere when you crash into the ground ?
Umm , in high - speed collisions like that it's not totally unreasonable that a plane 's velocity torque rotary girder viscosity ...
These meetings were tough .
It almost seemed as though the execs were only keeping the project alive for the sadistic pleasure they took in watching the developers squirm .
And among the bugs mentioned above , there were mountains more .
For instance , planes could n't take off or land .
At all .
Well , you could try to land , but that would cause the bug where the plane would bounce off the ground and into outer space .
So to address the issue , all missions started out mid-flight and would n't require ( or even allow ) you to land .
Another fun bug caused the enemy AI to do your work for you .
A rogue enemy plane would suddenly reject his mother country and start shooting down his own teammates .
That is , until his wings fell off the plane since he was firing his guns .
Then he 'd kamikaze his plane into the ground , which would launch the plane into outer space that the MicroProse executives probably did n't find nearly as funny as I do .
Brand would stress out about defending the game at the weekly meetings , but that did n't mean that he thought concerns about European Air War 's progress were unfounded .
Facing a mountain of bugs and a project ready for the chopping block , he was relieved when another developer was added to the team , effectively halving the abuse Brand would have to deal with on a weekly basis .
We 'll call the new developer " Tim . "
Tim knew what he was getting into when he came aboard the project .
He knew about the bugs , about the budget , and about the impending cancellation of the whole thing .
And with the major issues , you 'd figure he'd start with any one of them .
Maybe the one with the wings falling off whenever guns were fired .
Especially considering the game is called " European Air War . "
If the wings ( " air " ) and guns ( " war " ) come off the plane , the game title should just be reduced to " European , " or perhaps " European Wingless Plane Amidst Nazi Battle Simulator . "
You could start up a game and watch Nazis shoot eachothers ' planes down until yours crashed .
With all of the bugs he could get started on , he decided it was necessary to add a new feature instead .
He developed a camera system that would focus on anything " cool " happening near the player .
For instance , one plane shakes another with a delicate evasive maneuver .
Or it'd mount to a bomb right as a B - 17's bay was opening , following its descent onto the earth .
Or it'd follow a plane being shot down , ablaze and spiraling toward the ground , engines sputtering .
The " Cool Cam " was cool .
But it did n't change the fact that the game was almost completely broken .
Brand wanted to confront
Tim about bug priority and all of the code he was toiling away to debug , but held his tongue .
No one could save the project at this point anyway .
At the next week 's meeting with management , the air felt heavy .
With each passing week the execs were seeing money hemorrhaged into a dying project that they'd had a full team on for four years .
Tim started up the game and played carefully to avoid the obvious bugs .
Getting a double whammy of tough questions ( " How overbudget is this project ? " and " Why should n't we cancel this right now ? " ) ,
Tim made sure his plane was level and flying evenly and let go of the joystick and hit the cool cam button .
Brand sat there silently , watching the monitor .
Tim turned toward the execs , about to stumble through an answer they probably would n't accept .
The room was silent , save for the steady hum of the plane 's engines coming out of the computer speakers .
Suddenly , the camera zoomed in on an explosion , following a flaming plane barreling toward the earth , then the focus moved slightly to another plane quickly evading the flaming shell .
Tim took the controls again when the execs lobbed another tough question about bugs they 'd made no progress in fixing .
Again ,
Tim leveled the plane and hit the cool cam button .
And again , he did n't have to answer because everyone was fixated on the screen .
Tim's " cool cam " saved European Air War .
It went from a money - leaking embarrassment to a top - tier release for MicroProse .
The weekly meetings got easier , more developers were brought on , and the team managed to put together one hell of a game .
It reviewed well after its 1998 release and is still a popular game for history buffs .
And it probably would n't have been released if not for a programmer that knew what the project needed most ; the cool cam .

“ It ’s a perfect storm for real estate agents , ” said Glenn Kelman , chief executive of
Redfin
, an online brokerage in Seattle .
“ Not only have unprecedented numbers flocked to the profession , but at the same time you have the mortgage meltdown , the housing bubble bursting , and online competitors attacking the commission structure . ”
Traditional real estate agents , who depend entirely on commissions , “ are beset on all sides , ” Mr. Kelman said .
The number of people taking the real estate sales exam in California soared from a little more than 2,000 a month in the late 1990s to a peak of nearly 20,000 in April 2005 , according to the California Department of Real Estate .
But by July 2007 , the number had dropped to 8,000 ( see chart above ) .
Similar patterns are seen in other states .

Burning the Law in a Riot of Treason
By William Rivers Pitt
t r u t h o u t | Columnist
As nightfall does not come at once , neither does oppression .
In both instances , there ’s a twilight where everything remains seemingly unchanged , and it is in such twilight that we must be aware of change in the air , however slight , lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness .
– Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas
The departure of Alberto Gonzales from the Attorney General ’s Office brings America to a place of definitions , and hanging in the balance is the very idea of the nation itself .
The basic concepts and fundamental principles of our republic now stand as the only legitimate considerations going forward , for they have been tested almost to annihilation already , and will not endure much longer if we continue on this path .
It is the mythology within the Declaration of Independence we speak of , the fiction that tells us we are endowed with rights , and that those rights are unalienable .
This falsehood has been vividly exposed in the last several years , and it has been a harsh lesson indeed .
All the rights we hold dear and believe to be our greatest strength are , in fact , only words on old paper with neither force nor power .
The next line – “ That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ” – is the muscle behind the myth , the core that has endured a withering assault .
Matters are so much worse than our national political dialogue lets on .
The resignation of Gonzales has unleashed a torrent of hard words and harsh criticisms aimed at the deplorable nature of his tenure , but the truth of it continues to elude mention .
They call Gonzales an incompetent , a crony , a loyalist , a disgrace , leaving off the one word necessary to fully explain who he is , and what he was engaged in before he stepped down .
Alberto Gonzales is a traitor .
That is the only word to explain it .
He is not the only one ; there are many more traitors like him in the Bush administration , criminals joined in an act of treason so vast and comprehensive that it beggars comparison .
Nothing quite like this has ever before been attempted in America , and if they are allowed to succeed , there will be nothing of what defines America left to be seen .
Gonzales and his Bush administration collaborators have committed their treason against the rule of law itself , a crime so absolute that it is technically not illegal .
There is no code , ordinance or law specifically forbidding the total ruination of all our rights and protections ; the act is neither felony nor misdemeanor , because nobody ever considered the black - letter necessity of making it illegal to destroy the rule of law .
But there is no America without that rule of law – no rights , no protections , no Constitution ; there is nothing , and if you destroy the rule of law , you destroy the idea that is America itself .
The only word for a crime like that is treason , and those who would dare commit it are traitors .
Gonzales and his Bush administration collaborators have done more than dare .
They have been pursuing it , with deliberation and intent , throughout each moment of their tenure .
Their treason is not in the actual crimes they have committed , but in the way they have chosen to avoid accountability for them .
Their treason is not their refusal to obey the Freedom of Information Act , but in their insistence that they are above the application of that law .
Their treason is not in their refusal to obey subpoenas from Congress , but in their claim that they are above the laws behind those subpoenas .
Their treason is not that they fired United States attorneys and then refused to come clean about it , but that they decimated the impartiality of the Department of Justice and turned the rule of law into another partisan weapon .
Their treason is not the NSA surveillance of Americans , but their steadfast refusal to submit to the governing laws and the requirement of oversight .
When George W. Bush asserted a claim of Executive Privilege that made him and his administration immune to all laws and oversight , that was an act of treason because it shattered the rule of law .
When Dick Cheney asserted that the Office of the Vice President was not part of the Executive Branch , because he did not want to obey the laws requiring him to hand over official documents to the Archives , that was an act of treason because it shattered the rule of law .
When Alberto Gonzales chose to surrender the independence of the Department of Justice so he could protect those assertions , that was an act of treason because it shattered the rule of law .
Americans have only the rights they are able to protect and defend .
Our rights are nothing more than ideas ; only theory and argument on parchment all too easily burned to ashes .
The power of those rights is only found in our collective submission to the rule of law , and submission to that rule of law is all that stands between our freedoms and the conflagration of tyranny .
Without the rule of law , there is no America .
That is the treason of Alberto Gonzales , and the treason of the Bush administration entire .
They have attacked and undercut the rule of law by refusing to submit to it , and in doing so have brought us to the edge of appalling infamy .
Theirs is a crime without peer , and we will be fortunate beyond measure if we are able to recover from it .
The fact that Alberto Gonzales has left is meaningless in the main , because the treason he participated in continues in his absence .
If the damage is to be repaired , he must be replaced by someone who will submit to the main imperative , someone who will submit to the rule of law , someone with real independence and unbending respect for the idea that is America .
Gonzales must not be replaced by another crony or yes - man , because Americans have only those rights we can protect and defend , and another traitor in that lofty post is no protection at all .
Gonzales was more than a poor steward of this trust .
He was a traitor among traitors .
If the rule of law is to stand , the treason he helped commit must be ended , and a patriot must take his place .
( Original Article )
Following on the heals of the House of Representatives , the Senate has approved , by a narrow margin , an Iraq War spending bill that sets a deadline of roughly one year from today by which American forces must be out of Iraq :
WASHINGTON — The Democratic - controlled Senate ignored a veto threat and voted Thursday for a bill requiring President Bush to start withdrawing combat troops from Iraq within four months , dealing a sharp rebuke to a wartime commander in chief .
In a mostly party line 51 - 47 vote , the Senate signed off on a bill providing $ 122 billion to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It also orders Bush to begin withdrawing troops within 120 days of passage while setting a nonbinding goal of ending combat operations by March 31 , 2008 .
As with the House vote the margin in the Senate is far short of what would be needed to override a Presidential veto , and it is unlikely that any of the 46 Republicans plus Joe Lieberman who voted against the bill would cross over and vote to override and expected veto .
The bill is dead in the water .
I generally support the idea that the United States needs to start thinking about an exit strategy in Iraq , and that we need to do so sooner rather than later .
I also think that the war itself , and the way it ’s been handled since virtually day one , have been a colossal series of mistakes .
But the way the Senate has gone about doing this is totally unconstitutional .
First of all , Congress simply does n’t have the authority to order the President to follow a specific military strategy .
They authorized the use of military force and the President is Commander in Chief .
As CiC , he has the authority to decide military strategy .
Not only that , he is the head of a co-equal branch of government and is not subservient to Congress .
There really is only one way for Congress to exercise authority over America ’s policy in Iraq .
They would have to exercise the power of the purse and vote to defund the war .
By all indications , the Democrats on the Hill have neither the political courage nor the support among their own members for such a move .
Additionally , polling seems to indicate that while the public wants American troops to come home , they would not support cutting off funding to those troops as long as they are there .
Both practically and politically , the opponents of the war are in a very difficult position unless they can convince the President to change his mind .
Given what we ’ve seen from George W. Bush over the past seven years , that seems highly unlikely .

British Army tests ‘ invisible ’ tank , ala James Bond style
by yogesh
Quite reminding you of Q or David Copperfield , the Ministry of Defense has unveiled a new technology that can make tanks invisible .
They carried out secret trials recently and have stated that the invisible tank would be ready for service by 2012 .
The technology involves using cameras and projectors to beam images of the surrounding landscape onto a tank .
As a result , anyone looking in the direction of the vehicle only sees what is beyond it and not the tank itself .
According to a soldier present at the trial , “ This technology is incredible .
If I had n’t been present I would n’t have believed it .
I looked across the fields and just saw grass and trees – but in reality I was staring down the barrel of a tank gun . ”
The Ministry is also working on a military jacket that works on the same principle .
MoD ’s Professor Sir John Pendry , of Imperial College London , has developed this latest technology .
How the ‘ invisible ’ tanks perform in actual conditions is quite speculative .
The only drawback seems to be the reliability of the cameras and projectors .
According to Sir John Pendry “ The next stage is to make the tank invisible without them – which is intricate and complicated , but possible . ”

At one time I was just scraping by selling my own classified advertising software for desktop publishers .
One user was XTRA , Canada ’s largest newspaper for the Gay community .
Naturally , their database of customers and ads was sensitive .
But I needed to take it home from time to time to debug things .
So I wrote a “ scramble ” routine that shuffled names around , changed all the phone numbers to 555 - xxxx , changed the credit card numbers randomly , and so forth .
When I needed to take the database off - site , I would log out , duplicate the database , log back in , and run the scramble routine on the dup .
The menu item for this routine was called “ Fruit Salad , ” and it only appeared when I logged in .
One day I was at their office debugging something , and their manager saw the menu item .
“ What ’s that ? ”
He asked .
I was embarrassed , it suddenly occurred to me that my little joke was inappropriate and insensitive .
“ Uh , nothing … ” I stalled , and while I tried to make up a good explanation , he grabbed the mouse and selected it .
On the live database .

Beware folks !
If you ever have to visit a Police Station in Pakistan , make sure your car is not blocking the gate otherwise true to their motto which is : police ka hai farz , madad aap ki ( it is our duty to help you ) they might take swift action and help you in long term parking there by deflating your vehicle tyres .
The notice below is from a Police Station in Pakistan .
There is , of course , much that can be read into this .
The most obvious candidate might be the police action now going on in the Lal Masjid .
Of course , we at ATP could use it as yet another notice to our more shararti friends ( see earlier post here ) .
Owais may well choose to replace the picture in the comments section with this one for a while .
There is , more sinisterly , the dark and shameful side of police action that we have also tried to show ( here and here ) .
But , for now , let me chalk this up as one more piece in my ongoing fascination with Pakistani cops ( here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and more ) .

Hoping to finally put the debate surrounding the technology powering the Wii to rest , graphics technology outlet Beyond3D and Newsweek 's N'Gai Croal have done some extensive work at a physical hardware level to determine that , in no uncertain terms , the Wii is in actuality only about 50 percent more powerful than the original GameCube .
The long article breaks down the Wii into its component parts in simple terms and provides some comparative analysis of where the Wii sits in relation to the other competing consoles and its predecessor .
Until this point , the article claims , the Wii has been " a total anomaly in the history of consoles , " as no specific information was given aside from codenames .
Of note , " Broadway , the Wii's CPU , is a derivative of the PowerPC 750 CL clocked at 729 Mhz , " and that the " Hollywood " GPU has " no notable increases in programmability " over the Gamecube 's " Flipper " GPU .
The end result ?
" The Wii has the processing power of one - and - a - half GameCubes with no noteworthy increases in functionality . "
While the analysis from Beyond3D hopes to spur conversation about just how pivotal the controller is to the gameplay experience in general , it 's hard to look past the effort that went into confirming what many of us had already suspected and accepted .
This , of course , does n't change the fact that art direction will forever and always be just as if not more important as raw power .
Khaled al - Masri says he has been traumatised by his experiences
Khaled al - Masri had been appealing against the decision of lower courts not to hear his case against the CIA on national security grounds .
Mr Masri says he was abducted in Macedonia in 2003 and flown to Afghanistan for interrogation .
His case has highlighted the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " programme .
The Supreme Court 's decision " terminated " Mr Masri 's lawsuit and was issued without comment , The Associated Press news agency notes .
Correspondents say the decision will be seen as an endorsement of the Bush administration 's argument that state secrets would be revealed if the case were allowed to proceed .
' Traumatised '
In his lawsuit , Mr Masri was seeking damages of $ 75,000 ( £ 37,000 ) .
The 44 - year - old alleges he was tortured during five months in detention , four months of which were spent in a prison in Kabul , Afghanistan , nicknamed the " salt pit " .
On his flight to Afghanistan , he says , he was stripped , beaten , shackled , made to wear " diapers " , drugged and chained to the floor of the plane .
By his account , he was finally released in Albania after the Americans realised they had got the wrong man .
He told the BBC in February he had been " traumatised " by his experiences .
Last month , Germany reportedly dropped a request to the US to extradite 13 suspected CIA agents accused of abducting him .

Should fireplace fires be banned ?
Under the auspices of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District , " public hearings " are being held to determine the fate of the family hearth .
Those of us who live in rural areas have a pretty good idea what the outcome is going to be .
Still , in the interest of basic fairness , we'd at least like the decision - makers to employ the rudiments of the scientific method , rather than riding the winds of energy dependence and global warming hysteria , before coming to a final decision .
The scientific method follows a rigid methodology .
Ask a question .
Do background research .
Construct a hypothesis .
Test the hypothesis .
And then , communicate the results .
So what is the question ?
Are the fires in our homes bad because they add to global warming ?
Release carbon dioxide into the air ?
Pollute the atmosphere with soot and particulate matter ?
All of the above ?
Where is the research ?
The Chronicle reported that " government studies " indicate that 33 percent of all " particulate matter " comes from your fireplace and mine .
With all the industry and all the cars in the Bay Area , does anyone actually believe that ?
Should n't we be given more quantitative information such has , " How many fireplaces are there in the nine counties ?
How many are used each night ?
How many hours is each fireplace used ?
How much " particulate matter " is expelled from each fire ?
How many parts per million are in the air ?
How much dissipates into the atmosphere ? "
Is this decision truly about air quality or global warming ?
Interestingly , one loses on the issues of global warming because the odd paradox is , the more there is cloud cover or " smoke " in the air , the cooler the Earth will be .
It is well documented how the Earth 's temperature cooled after the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa .
From that standpoint , one ought to encourage fires which produce the maximum amount of smoke .
Of course , that position is politically absurd .
Those of us in rural communities feel bullied by this sort of nanny state legislation .
We 'd like to believe that a man 's home is indeed his castle .
Most of us live in small towns or the country for a reason .
We do n't like cities .
We do n't like traffic .
We do n't like noise .
We do n't like the dirty air .
Our air is clean , and we take umbrage when someone says our fires are polluting their air .
If the ban goes into effect , what is the cost to society ?
What is the benefit ?
We need to weigh these carefully .
Then there is this question :
Why do we burn ?
We stoke our hearths for two reasons .
First , many rural people burn wood because they can't afford to heat their old houses with electricity .
Many more feel that burning wood does less damage to the planet than increasing their carbon footprint by using so much electricity .
Banning fires would hurt the elderly who live on fixed incomes and the poor in general .
It would be an added tax on the rest of us and increase dependence on petroleum .
Second , for many of us , a fire crackling in the fireplace is about a different kind of energy - psychic energy .
After a day 's work , is there anything nicer than coming home and having a class of Napa Valley Cabernet in front of a roaring fire ?
Rainy Sundays find us stretched out on the couch , newspapers scattered , 49ers on the TV , and a fire roaring in the fireplace .
On wintry school nights , our children used to come down into the living room to do their homework in front of the fire as my wife and I read .
During the energy crisis in California , our family closed the parlor doors and gathered in one tiny room around the fire .
it was a scene out of a Jane Austin novel .
Five of us read , played chess , did homework and paid bills , in a chilly room heated only by our tiny hearth .
Never was our family closer .
The fire was more than a source of heat .
It was a mystical , magical magnet of love , warmth and togetherness .
We worry that the real issue here is n't about health , global warming or energy savings , but about control .
Were it not about control , the dialogue would be about baffles and filters to eliminate soot , not about outright bans .
Home fires are not about " particulate matter . "
They are about warmth , love , quality of life - and for many an economic necessity .
How cold are those who would take that from us , their neighbors ?
She wore Prada , not Chanel , and was clearly not cut out for the role of France 's first lady .
But beyond the obvious , kind explanation for Cecilia Sarkozy 's divorce lies a more intriguing question : why , in a land of such apparently relaxed sexual mores , was it important for President Nicolas Sarkozy ( as well as for his also now separated Socialist rival , Segolene Royal ) to appear to be in relationships as they raced towards last May 's presidential election ?
' The answer , ' said writer Christine Clerc , 'lies in the fact that , contrary to what everyone outside France thinks , our republic is a monarchical system .
The French first lady is better compared to Princess Diana than to some other President 's or Prime Minister 's wife , ' said the author of Tigres et Tigresses , a history of French presidential couples .
' Her role , correctly played , is to be a compassionate bystander . '
Liberation columnist Laurent Joffrin said that , while Sarkozy had not had the courage to campaign for the presidency as a divorced man , last week 's announcement proved him to be in step with the times : ' He is part of the " me " generation , not the " one " generation in which one 's family life took second place to the nation 's wellbeing . '
Last year 59 per cent of first - born children came into the world out of wedlock , putting French disenchantment with marriage second only to that of the liberal Swedes .
Only 268,000 people got married in France in 2006 - the lowest figure since 1990 .
There is now more than one divorce for every two marriages .
The 152,000 divorces last year marked an increase of 40,000 on 2002 .
Five times more French people got divorced last year than in 1963 .
But the French are still getting together , albeit with fewer legal obligations than traditional town hall or church weddings imply .
The Pacs ( pacte civil de solidarite ) - the partnership contract introduced in 1999 mainly with gays and lesbians in mind - is now more popular with heterosexuals than homosexuals .
Ninety per cent of the 154,000
Pacs contracts signed last year - providing for joint taxation but conferring little legal security - were entered into by heterosexual couples .
Even though Pacs partnerships can be ended simply by sending a recorded delivery letter to a judge , only one in seven of the contracts ends in ' divorce ' .
Clerc says the Sarkozy divorce proves little else other than the fact that France 's political class lags behind its people .
' There was a huge debate among politicians about introducing the Pacs , but when it came into law the people did not bat an eyelid , ' she said .
Her book charts the moral dilemmas of a succession of French Presidents , including Francois Mitterrand , who was estranged from his wife , Danielle , well before he was elected in 1981 and was living partly with Anne Pingeot , with whom he had a daughter , Mazarine .
Mitterrand was obsessed with keeping Mazarine 's existence secret , to the extent of ordering phone taps on people who might reveal it .
The media played the secrecy game for 13 years .
The first French politician to break the divorce taboo was Michel Rocard , who only recently remarried when he took up the job of Prime Minister in 1988 .
When Rocard 's second marriage was on the rocks , Mitterrand advised him against getting divorced if he ever wanted to run for the Elysee Palace .
Similarly , it is often said that Jacques Chirac cut off an extramarital affair in the 1970s after advice from within his party that it was likely to threaten his chances of becoming President .
But there are also startling examples of modernity in the French political class .
The straitlaced interior minister , Michele Alliot - Marie , has spent 23 unmarried years with Patrick Ollier , a member of the National Assembly .
Had Royal been elected President , she would have entered the Elysee as the unmarried mother of four ' love children ' .
She spent 25 years with the father of her children , Socialist first secretary Francois Hollande , before separating from him in June this year .
Sarkozy clearly approached the announcement of his divorce with great unease , choosing Thursday 's national strike as the day for issuing the 15 - word communique .
' Clearly , ' said Clerc , 'it is still , on balance , better for a President - or candidate - to present his or her relationship as an image of stability , reliability and faithfulness .
' On the other hand , we saw Cecilia fail to turn up for lunch with George Bush .
We saw her cut short her visit to the G8 summit in Berlin .
I think the French would rather have a divorced President than a first lady who cancels appointments . '
I used YouTube ’s APIs to help make this graph .
It shows thumbnails of all the videos that match the tag “ joke ” which were submitted
over the past year .
There are about 7800 of them .
I ca n’t show all the thumbnails because they are just too many of them .
I used ‘ joke ’ as a kind of random sample .
The thumbnails create a kind of heat signature which shows the increase in activity in YouTube in the last few months .
Vertically , the thumbnails are positioned by the hour of the day they were uploaded , and horizontally by the day of the year .
Here ’s a similar graph showing videos that match the tag “ wedding ” :
The bright spot in November are a number of similar looking videos all from the same wedding :

Finally , here is a graph showing the more popular tag , “ cat ” , which has over 33,300 videos .

大体の状況は把握したので、早速Webアプリの問題点を「見える化」する7つ道具を利用し、トラブル切り分けフローに従い、調査を開始した。
フローに従って作業を進めようとしたところ、JavaVMに設定されたヒープ領域がデフォルト値であることに気が付いた。さすがに、これではメモリ不足が起きてしまうとにらんだが、事象の再現も兼ねて、デフォルト値のまま問題となっている業務処理に対して、多数のリクエストを投げてみた。すると予想どおり、あっさりOutOfMemoryErrorでアプリケーションが落ちてしまった。
そこで、ヒープ領域を1GByteに変更し、再度同じ負荷を掛けてみると、今度は十数分たってからOutOfMemoryErrorが発生した。GCログ（図2）を確認してみると、GCが発生しても、ヒープ領域のメモリ使用量（青線）が右肩上がりに増大しており、メモリが開放されていないことが分かった。
そこで、GC対象外となっているオブジェクトを探すため、HPROFを利用してオブジェクトプロファイリングを実施してみることにした（HPROFについて詳しく知りたい読者は、「HPROF プロファイラエージェント」をご参照ください）。

オブジェクトプロファイリングした結果を確認してみると、Userオブジェクトは、オブジェクトに割り当てられたメモリ量(alloc'ed bytes／objs )と生存しているメモリ量（live bytes／objs）が一致しており、Userオブジェクトに対して、まったくGCが働いていないことが分かった。
そこで、問題となっている業務のソースコードを確認してみると、DBから取得したデータをHttpSessionにUserオブジェクトとして格納していた。セッションタイムアウトになる前であったため、GCがまったく働いていなかったのであろう。
このオブジェクトのスコープについて担当者に確認をしてみると、sessionスコープで扱う必要がないものであったため、requestスコープで取り扱うように修正し、その効果を確認した。
ソースコードを修正し、結果の確認
ソースコードを修正し、再測定したところ、OutOfMemoryErrorが発生しなくなり、一件落着となった。GCログは図3、オブジェクトプロファイリングはリスト2のように測定された。

オブジェクトに割り当てられたメモリ量（alloc'ed bytes/objs）と生存しているメモリ量（live bytes/objs）を見る限り、Userオブジェクトに対してGCが働いており、メモリリークが解消されている。
担当者に確認してみると、単体テスト時にOutOfMemoryErrorが発生しなかったのは、テスト実施時にDBに投入されていたデータ数が少なかったからのようである。検索結果のデータ数の見積もりをしていなかったため、テスト時のデータ量が少なく、問題が出ていなかったようだ。
今回の場合、DBから取得したデータをそのままsessionスコープで保持していたため、取得したデータ数が少ないと、問題は顕在化しにくい。

NASA Extends Operations for Its Long - Lived Mars Rovers
As it finished its second Martian year on Mars , NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit was beginning to examine a group of angular rocks given informal names corresponding to peaks in the Colorado Rockies .

View full Sprit image and caption from this release
View full Opportunity image and caption from this release WASHINGTON - NASA is extending , for a fifth time , the activities of the Mars Exploration Rovers , Spirit and Opportunity .
The decision keeps the trailblazing mobile robotic pioneers active on opposite sides of Mars , possibly through 2009 .
This extended mission and the associated science are dependent upon the continued productivity and operability of the rovers .
" We are extremely happy to be able to further the exploration of Mars .
The rovers are amazing machines , and they continue to produce amazing scientific results operating far beyond their design life , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The twin rovers landed on Mars in January 2004 , 45 months ago , on missions originally planned to last 90 days .
In September , Opportunity began descending into Victoria Crater in Mars ' Meridiani Planum region .
At approximately 800 meters wide ( half a mile ) and 70 meters deep ( 230 feet ) , it is the largest crater the rover has visited .
Spirit climbed onto a volcanic plateau in a range of hills that were on the distant horizon from its landing site .
" After more than three - and - a - half years , Spirit and Opportunity are showing some signs of aging , but they are in good health and capable of conducting great science , " said John Callas , rover project manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
The rovers each carry a suite of sophisticated instruments to examine the geology of Mars for information about past environmental conditions .
Opportunity has returned dramatic evidence that its area of Mars stayed wet for an extended period of time long ago , with conditions that could have been suitable for sustaining microbial life .
Spirit has found evidence in the region it is exploring that water in some form has altered the mineral composition of some soils and rocks .
To date , Spirit has driven 7.26 kilometers ( 4.51 miles ) and has returned more than 102,000 images .
Opportunity has driven 11.57 kilometers ( 7.19 miles ) and has returned more than 94,000 images .
Among the rovers ' many other accomplishments :
- Opportunity has analyzed a series of exposed rock layers recording how environmental conditions changed during the times when the layers were deposited and later modified .
Wind - blown dunes came and went .
The water table fluctuated .
- Spirit has recorded dust devils forming and moving .
The images were made into movie clips , providing new insight into the interaction of Mars ' atmosphere and surface .
- Both rovers have found metallic meteorites on Mars .
Opportunity discovered one rock with a composition similar to a meteorite that reached Earth from Mars .

NASA Headquarters , Washington , D.C. NEWS RELEASE : 2007 - 120
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Iraq has failed to meet 11 of the 18 benchmarks the U.S. Congress set when it approved a war - spending bill in May , the Government Accountability Office reported Tuesday .
President Bush will give his progress report on Iraq next week , based on information from Gen. David Petraeus .
Iraq has met three of the benchmarks and " partially met " four , the GAO said , but the congressional agency was pessimistic on the overall progress of the Iraqi government .
" Overall , key legislation has not been passed , violence remains high , and it is unclear whether the Iraqi government will spend $ 10 billion in reconstruction funds , " according to testimony from David M. Walker , comptroller general , to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
But it did offer grounds for hope .
" These results do not diminish the courageous efforts of coalition forces and progress that has been made in several areas , including Anbar province , " Walker said in comments released Tuesday .
Walker also said a goal of reducing sectarian violence was unmet .
" While the Baghdad security plan was intended to reduce sectarian violence , it is unclear whether violence has been reduced , " Walker said in prepared testimony .
" Measuring such violence may be difficult since the perpetrators ' intents are not clearly known .
Other measures , such as the number of enemy - initiated attacks , show that violence has remained high through July 2007 . "
Goals listed as met in the GAO report include :
• Ensuring the rights of minority political parties in the Iraqi legislature are protected .
• Establishing joint security stations in Baghdad neighborhoods .
• Setting up committees to support the Baghdad security plan .
The GAO indicated there were partial successes for enacting legislation to form semiautonomous regions , creating three Iraqi brigades to support Baghdad operations , ensuring the Iraqi government will not provide a sanctuary for outlaws and spending of $ 10 billion in reconstruction aid .
The $ 10 billion in Iraqi revenues , Walker said , had been allocated , but it appeared " unlikely " that it would be spent on necessary projects .
A Defense Department official said that the Pentagon argued that more progress has been made on sectarian violence and that it should get a partially met grade , but the GAO marked that goal as unmet .
The report also said the State Department argued some of the benchmarks related to a constitutional committee , legislation dealing with oil revenue , the creation of election commissions and the creation of Iraqi brigades were partially met .
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Walker said he made changes to a draft version of the report sought by the Pentagon based on new classified information provided by his staff and denied the changes were made due to administration pressure .
Walker said he had decided to make the changes before Defense Department officials had contacted the GAO .
Top U.S. officials , including President Bush , have said they are disappointed by the Iraqi government 's slow rate of progress toward a political resolution of the country 's insurgent and sectarian warfare .
The benchmarks were created by lawmakers as part of a $ 120 billion war - spending bill passed in May , which asked the GAO -- the investigative arm of Congress -- to give a definitive answer as to whether each benchmark was met or not , instead of reporting partial progress .
Read the rankings of the benchmarks »
White House spokesman Tony Snow said Thursday that it was " no secret " that the Iraqis would not meet many of the standards set by Congress , but he added that " what is significant is that there is progress toward a great number of them . "
" The real question that people have is , ' What 's going on in Iraq ?
Are we making progress ?
Militarily , is the surge having an impact ? ' "
Snow said .
" The answer 's yes .
There 's just no question about it . "
White House spokesman Tony Fratto reiterated the White House 's position that people should wait until the testimony of Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus -- as well as the president 's report -- in two weeks , saying that " will be more useful ... for a more thorough picture of the current status in Iraq and recommendations for the future . "
The GAO submitted the draft to the State and Defense departments for their review before publication .
A senior defense official said some of the benchmarks involve multipart questions and have been partially met .
The Democratic leaders of Congress , who have pushed unsuccessfully for an end to the war since taking control in January , said the GAO report is fresh evidence the president needs to begin extracting the United States from the now - unpopular conflict .
Congress also will hear in the coming days a report from an independent commission led by retired Marine Gen.
James Jones , the former top U.S. commander in Europe , about the progress of Iraq 's security forces .
Next week , the Bush administration will release its own report assessing progress on the 18 benchmarks defined in the war spending bill .
That report will be based on information provided by Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , and Crocker , who will testify next week before several congressional committees about the White House assessment .
Bush has urged Americans to reserve judgment on whether the troop increase -- known as the surge -- is working until hearing their evaluation , since they 're on the ground in Iraq .

New Scientist must hire someone to trawl through the arXiv in the hopes of getting the science news one step ahead of everyone else .
Unfortunately , their record for distinguishing good science from bad science is not all that good , so I was pretty skeptical when I was pointed to an article on a new theory of everything™ .
This paper is actually a very impressive piece of work , though it is thoroughly overhyped and completely un-understandable to anyone who does n't regularly do particle physics and group theory .
The author , A. Garrett Lisi , has proposed a back - to - the - future approach to uniting quantum mechanics and gravity .
Throughout the 20th century ( and late 19th century ) it was discovered that the electric force , the magnetic force , the weak force ( responsible for radioactivity ) , and the strong force ( responsible for holding the nucleus together ) could all be described by a single theory .
The different forces , their properties and associated particles could all be obtained from different symmetry operations ( think rotations and reflections ) of an algebraic system .
This very successful approach has withstood the test of time , with absolutely every experimental test falling within error bars of the calculated results .
However , gravity stands apart as the force which does not get included in this set and its inclusion ( or a totally new theory ) would constitute a theory of everything .
Much of the early work focused on exploring higher symmetry algebraic systems that might include gravity .
Several were found , but none actually survived contact with reality .
This approach has largely fallen out of favor because any object with sufficient symmetry operations can be made to unite gravity with everything else while still not agree with reality as we measure it .
Lisi has revived this approach by looking at the shadows cast by an extremely complicated symmetry group ( called E8 ) .
Unsurprisingly , if you choose ( by hand ) the right starting methodology and ignore a few possible problems with units , a selection of symmetry operations will result in symmetry subgroups that correspond to those from particle physics as we know it , something that might be the symmetry operations of gravity , and some other stuff .
There are a couple of reasons to be skeptical of Lisi 's work .
First , he has a problem with units at the very start of the paper , which could cascade through the whole work .
It is not yet clear that this problem is fatal , but at this point we just do n't know .
He has found that the chosen symmetry operations correspond to the symmetry groups of particles — not that surprising , considering the number of symmetry operations he has at his disposal — but at this point , he can't calculate the properties of predicted particles ( really , these are just degrees of freedom in the symmetry class ) , because that requires what look to be extraordinarily difficult calculations .
If the unit problem is serious , this will get worse , meaning no predictions at all .
In the Observatory thread on this topic , posters have pointed to a blog article that puts Lisi firmly in the crank category , which I initially agreed with but I have since been persuaded that I was being too hasty .
I still think he is probably wrong ( because of his early problem with units ) and that his predicted particles are not predictions at all since he can't actually tell us where to look for them .
In fact nothing beyond their symmetry group is predicted by Lisi at this point .
If he can answer the question over units early in the paper , find a way to put masses on his predicted particles , and show that the predicted half - life of the proton is sufficiently long , then his theory will start to look like a winner .
Personally , I dislike New Scientist 's arXiv trawling ways ; by putting Lisi into the role of the anti-establishment hero ( he 's a surfer not a scientist ... ) and publicizing his work before peer review , they ( along other media reporting , including our own ) may well have compromised Lisi 's chance at getting a fair shot a peer review .
Many thanks to Geon and his post in the Observatory .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market could spiral out of control into a global financial crisis , economist Mark Zandi said Thursday .
With a " high level of angst " in the financial markets about who will take the losses from more than $ 1 trillion in risky mortgages , we could be just one hedge - fund collapse away from a global liquidity crisis , said Zandi , chief economist for Moody 's Economy.com .
A global meltdown is not likely , but the risks are growing , Zandi emphasized in a conference call with reporters following the release of a new study on subprime debt that concludes that the housing crisis could be deeper and last longer than investors now believe .
Read the latest data on home sales .
And it could spread .
" Mounting mortgage delinquencies and defaults now pose the most serious threat to the global financial system and economy , " Zandi said in his report .
" If there is a fault line in the global financial system , it runs through the U.S. housing and mortgage markets , " he said .
Zandi's comments came as U.S. financial markets reeled from a growing credit crunch , centered not in the subprime arena , but in the leveraged corporate debt market .
On Thursday , Tyco became the latest multinational company to pull a deal because the buyers have fled .
U.S. stock markets plunged Thursday , while U.S. Treasurys benefited from a flight to quality .
See Market Snapshot .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , an old Wall Street hand himself , tried to reassure markets with a mid-afternoon televised pep talk .
Lenders and borrowers should exercise more " discipline , " he said , and he repeated his view that any problems in the subprime market would be " largely contained . "
But Zandi and others say the problems are only beginning .
In a note to clients on Wednesday , Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said the housing correction could be less than half over , if history is any guide .
" The dramatic deterioration in the mortgage market suggests at least the possibility that the credit crunch in the mortgage finance industry could become as bad as in the bad old days of the 1970s and 1980s , " Hatzius wrote .
Zandi used another historical comparison : the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s .
" Unlike the financial crisis of a decade ago , however , global capital would likely flow away from U.S. markets , not to them , as the genesis for the crisis lies within the U.S. financial system . "
After Bear Stearns was forced to write off the value of two large hedge funds that had invested heavily in securities backed by subprime debt , it could take just one more " Bear - like event " for the financial system to freeze up ,
" If there 's another major hedge fund that does stumble , that could elicit a crisis of confidence and a global shock , " Zandi said .
The potential " is quite high , " he said .
He gave it a one - in - five chance .
Zandi said global financial conditions have been supported by strong growth and substantial liquidity , supercharged by " unprecedented risk tolerance . "
But that 's changing .
Global liquidity is drying up , with central banks tightening .
And risk is being re-priced .
" The credit window is now closed , " wrote strategist Barry Ritholtz in his blog .
As for the U.S. housing market , Zandi expects a lot more pain , but not a recession .
Here are some highlights of his forecast , based on a study using anonymous data collected by consumer credit agency Equifax :
Watching Maher Arar 's Congressional testimony last week -- via satellite from Canada , because the Bush administration still refuses to allow him entry to this country despite being acquitted of all terror charges -- made me sick to my stomach .
Putting aside what the administration has done to this wholly innocent man -- which is deplorable and cringe - inducing enough in and of itself -- for Rep.
Dana Rohrbacher the ends justify the means .
He has the audacity to defend the rendition and dismiss the subsequent torture of a family man who was guilty of nothing but having a similar name with a suspected terrorist and being in the wrong place at the wrong time as a " mistake . "
Absolutely shameful .

Dear Menopausal Sister :
If you ’re a woman between your late 40s and mid-60 s … if you ’re already being tormented by hot flashes and night sweats …
If uncontrollable mood swings are making your life a living hell … if those mood swings are robbing you of a good relationship with your family and friends …
If , lately , your libido has been decreasing … if you feel like you ’re being cheated out of a good , relaxing night ’s sleep … and if like most women entering menopause , you ’re worried about bone loss and sudden weight gain then this amazing health breakthrough , “ secretly ” used by over 2000 health professionals in their practices , can help relieve the major pains related to your being in the menopause phase of your life .
In fact , if you really want relief from hot flashes and night sweats , you ’ll be really interested in the following story .
For several years , C. Davis , from Fayetteville , Tennessee , was tormented by severe hot flashes , and night sweats that were keeping her from the sleep she desperately needed .
She had to get off of hormone medication prescribed by her doctor because she was afraid of the side - effects , mainly cancer .
And yet , she could n’t find a good natural alternative to the medication she had to give up .
No wonder her life was going downhill very fast .
For instance , she would take a shower and dry off , then a few minutes later she would be soaking wet
Her night sweats were robbing her of sleep .
She would wake up soaking wet all the time .
But one day , her life totally changed , when her own research brought her in contact with an amazing health breakthrough .
Here are a Few of the Delightful Changes that this Amazing Health Breakthrough Helped Bring to Her Life .
C. Davis reports that she still has a few warm ups during the day , but they subside quickly .
C. Davis reports there is a 90 % improvement in her night sweats .
She can now sleep most nights all night .
C. Davis reports equally that she ’s happier … she feels much better … and she ’s even lost a few pounds because she ’s able to walk and exercise more frequently .
And most importantly , in this critical time in her life , when many women start giving up on their beauty , she ’s regained new interest in herself … she cares about herself again , her looks , her life .
When I tell my other friends about C. Davis ’ story , they usually ask me , “ What is this amazing health breakthrough ?
Why does it help so much ? ”
And to answer their questions , here ’s what I say …
Announcing Hot Flash Freedom , A Unique , Natural Health Breakthrough , That Supports Both Sex and Stress Hormones , Helps Relieve Hot Flashes and Night Sweats
Here Are The Ingredients In Hot Flash Freedom And How They Help You Fight The Symptoms Of Menopause Alpha Lipoic Acid : Can free bound ( unusable ) hormones so the body can better utilize them .
Can also cause and increase in the intensity of orgasm in women .
Botanical Extracts : Helps normalize and strengthen sexual , physical , and mental function .
DHEA : Anti-aging effect , helps buffer stress , and may also help to control weight .
Muira Puama : Can help the body adapt to stress and support fatigue and the central nervous system .
Practitioners are commonly using it for impotence , depression , menstrual cramps and PMS , nerve pain , and central nervous system disorders .
Pregnenolone : Helps stress conditions , fatigue and promotes a greater sense of well being .
Progesterone ( Bio-identical ) : They improve memory and cognitive ability .
Progesterone is thermogenic , raising the core temperature .
It reduces spasms and relaxes and smoothes muscle tone .
Here ’s why Hot Flash Freedom works so well for women going through menopause :
As you enter menopause , your body decreases its production of female sex hormones .
One of the female sex hormones that is most decreased is estrogen .
Thus , as you enter menopause , your body becomes deficient in estrogen .
As a result of this decrease , you have hormone imbalance .
And it is this hormone imbalance that leads to the many stressful and painful symptoms of menopause .
But it gets more complicated …
Not only is there a decrease in normal balance of sex hormones , but stress hormones also get into the picture .
The stress hormones cause an erosion of the sex hormones , and they amplify the problems tied to the natural decrease in sex hormones , caused by menopause .
And this is where the same amazing health breakthrough , used by C. Davis and recommended by over 2000 physicians nationwide , can help you .
This amazing health breakthrough is called Hot Flash Freedom .
It was specifically formulated to help support both sex and stress hormones .
… And Hot Flash Freedom is totally natural .
It is made of bio-identical ingredients .
These bio-identical ingredients are safe for you to use because your body can process them as if they were produced by your body itself .
Hot Flash Freedom uses a patented technology to deliver its ingredients straight into your blood stream , just by applying the cream to your skin .
This allows for total absorption of the key ingredients .
This new technology makes Hot Flash Freedom totally different ( and more advanced ) than any other formula on the market .
As I said , the ingredients are totally natural .
They ’re bio-identical , and they wo n’t pile up in the fatty tissue of your skin to increase water retention and weight gain .
How This Advanced Formula Is Safer and More Effective
Than The Typical Progesterone Cream
Progesterone creams can help get some relief from hot flashes and night sweats .
However , there are two major problems with progesterone creams .
Hot Flash Freedom Is Easy To Use
For best results , apply 1 / 4 tsp once or twice daily upon rising and at bedtime to soft areas of the skin ( upper chest , inner wrist or upper arm ) .
Rub cream thoroughly into skin and alternate application area every other day .
Results may vary depending on severity .
Non-Menstruating : You may start using Hot Flash Freedom™ anytime .
Use daily .
Menstruating : You may start using Hot Flash Freedom™ anytime after day 7 of your cycle .
Discontinue use during the 6 days of your menses .
Stress plays an important role in hormonal imbalance and yet , to our knowledge , no progesterone cream tries to help balance the stress hormones .
Most progesterone creams neglect stress hormones .
And this is where Hot Flash Freedom brings you superior results .
Ingredients such as DHEA help fight the stress hormones at the cellular level .
Because Hot Flash Freedom supports the balance of Stress Hormones , Hot Flash Freedom not only reduces those stress hormones , but also helps to balance out your sex hormones as well .
And here ’s the second major problem with most creams .
It has to do with safety .
Most of the creams are topical .
Most of these creams use an inexpensive oil cosmetic base .
The oil is absorbed into the fat cells , and months after you stop using these topical creams , their oils can still be found in body tissues .
And you do n’t want that .
In contrast , Hot Flash Freedom is not topical , it is “ transdermal ” .
It uses a unique , patented technology .
This technology guarantees that the ingredients are delivered directly into your blood stream , without the use of that lingering oil base .
Thus , Hot Flash freedom offers you greater safety and greater absorption of ingredients than most creams on the market .
Why This Amazing Health Breakthrough Is Safer and More Effective Than Hormone Replacement Therapy
What A Post - Menopausal Woman Says : “ Ten days later I realized that I was actually sleeping all night long without waking up 3 to 4 times with night sweats . ”
I am a postmenopausal gal of 62 who has night sweats that could keep a watermelon patch happy !
While visiting family in Kentucky recently , I was given a jar of Hot Flash Freedom to try .
And I gotta tell you . . .
I was very skeptical !
Ten days later , I realized that I was actually sleeping all night long without waking up 3 to 4 times with night sweats .
And all it took was twice daily applying a small amount of Hot Flash Freedom cream to a soft part of my body ( inner arms , sides , etc. ) .
Now my jar sits right beside my toothbrush . . . but I ’m so pleased with the results that I do n’t need to be reminded .
Thank you for giving me back a good night ’s sleep !

Yes , hormone replacement therapy will help you fight hot flashes and night sweats .
But at what cost ?
You see , the side - effects of hormone replacement therapy are numerous .
For instance , hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of thrombosis ( a dangerous health issue in which blood clots block arteries ) , heart attacks , and gall bladder disease .
Worst of all , hormone replacement therapy may increase the risks of breast cancer and endometrial cancer .
The use of only estrogen promotes the growth of cells that make up the lining of the uterus .
As this growth continues , it can turn into abnormal growth of the endometrium and this can lead to early malignant endometrial cancer .
It would be wrong to expose ourselves to such deadly diseases while trying to control hot flashes , night sweats , and other symptoms associated with our entering menopause and in this regard , Hot Flash Freedom offers you two superior advantages .
The first advantage is this : Because Hot Flash Freedom helps support both sex and stress hormones , it offers more help than the typical hormone replacement therapy .
And here ’s the second superior advantage :
Thanks to the science behind Hot Flash Freedom , the ingredients are safely delivered in sufficient amounts to help fight the major symptoms of menopause because the ingredients are bio-identical , and the body is able to use them easily .
There is no doubt about it : Hot Flash Freedom is safer than hormone replacement therapy .
Compared To The Many Health Benefits This Amazing Health Breakthrough Will Bring To Your Life , Its Price Is A Real Bargain .
Here ’s
Why …
Would you invest $ 1.33 a day in yourself to avoid having to suffer from hot flashes ?
Do you think it would be a bargain , if for $ 1.33 a day , you could go back to being able to sleep fully without waking up soaking wet ?

” I went from two per day to nearly none . ”
I am a 46 year old woman and for the past 18 months have been enduring increasing hot flashes , accompanied by headaches and feeling like I going to faint at the peak .
Then brief periods of extreme exhaustion on it lessens .
My doctor hesitated to give me a viable treatment due to my enzyme levels showing me to only be pre-menopausal .
I wish someone would have explained that to my body !
I was given Hot Flash Freedom after having a severe hot flash episode and although I thought there was no way a natural topical cream could help , I also knew that could n’t hurt .
A rash is the worse that can happen I thought , so why not ?
I did not realize until I had a mild episode that I really had not had an episode in 9 days .
I went from two per day to nearly none .
I never want to be a living inferno again .

I have been using Hot Flash Freedom progesterone cream for approximately 6 months .
This cream has “ saved my life ” .
The results of using Hot Flash Freedom have been dramatic for me .
I had a partial hysterectomy September 2004 .
Immediately following this surgery , I developed terrible ocular migraine headaches and constipation .
My doctors could do nothing to help me – and progesterone supplementation was never mentioned to me .
Through research of my own , and internet web sites , I found your company and began using Hot Flash Freedom .
The headaches ceased almost immediately .
I has also suffered from “ tingling and numbness ” of scalp and side of face .
This was extremely annoying and would sometimes accompany the headaches .
Since using Hot Flash Freedom that problem is also a thing of the past – thank goodness .

Britain ’s biggest teachers ’ union has accused the Ministry of Defence of breaking the law over a lesson plan drawn up to teach pupils about the Iraq war .
The National Union of Teachers claims it breaches the 1996 Education Act , which aims to ensure all political issues are treated in a balanced way .
Teachers will threaten to boycott military involvement in schools at the union ’s annual conference next weekend , claiming the lesson plan is a “ propaganda ” exercise and makes no mention of any civilian casualties as a result of the war .
They believe the instructions , designed for use during classroom discussions in general studies or personal , social and health education ( PSE ) lessons , are arguably an attempt to rewrite the history of the Iraq invasion just as the world prepares to mark its fifth anniversary .
Steve Sinnott , the general secretary of the NUT , said : “ This is n’t an attack on the military – nothing of the sort .
I know they ’ve done valuable work in establishing peace in some countries .
It is an attack on practices that we cannot condone in schools .
It is a question of whether you present fair and balanced views or put forward prejudice and propaganda to youngsters . ”
At the heart of the union ’s concern is a lesson plan commissioned by an organisation called Kids Connections for the Ministry of Defence aimed at stimulating classroom debate about the Iraq war .

WASHINGTON , Aug 28 ( IPS ) - Israeli officials warned the George W. Bush administration that an invasion of Iraq would be destabilising to the region and urged the United States to instead target Iran as the primary enemy , according to former administration official Lawrence Wilkerson .
Wilkerson , then a member of the State Department 's Policy Planning Staff and later chief of staff for Secretary of State Colin Powell , recalled in an interview with IPS that the Israelis reacted immediately to indications that the Bush administration was thinking of war against Iraq .
After the Israeli government picked up the first signs of that intention , Wilkerson says , " The Israelis were telling us Iraq is not the enemy -- Iran is the enemy . "
Wilkerson describes the Israeli message to the Bush administration in early 2002 as being , " If you are going to destabilise the balance of power , do it against the main enemy . "
The warning against an invasion of Iraq was " pervasive " in Israeli communications with the administration , Wilkerson recalls .
It was conveyed to the administration by a wide range of Israeli sources , including political figures , intelligence and private citizens .
Wilkerson notes that the main point of their communications was not that the United States should immediately attack Iran , but that " it should not be distracted by Iraq and Saddam Hussein " from a focus on the threat from Iran .
The Israeli advice against using military force against Iraq was apparently triggered by reports reaching Israeli officials in December 2001 that the Bush administration was beginning serious planning for an attack on Iraq .
Journalist Bob Woodward revealed in " Plan of Attack " that on Dec. 1 , 2001 , Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld had ordered the Central Command chief Gen. Tommy Franks to come up with the first formal briefing on a new war plan for Iraq on Dec.
4 .
That started a period of intense discussions of war planning between Rumsfeld and Franks .
Soon after Israeli officials got wind of that planning , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon asked for a meeting with Bush primarily to discuss U.S. intentions to invade Iraq .
In the weeks preceding Sharon 's meeting with Bush on Feb. 7 , 2002 , a procession of Israeli officials conveyed the message to the Bush administration that Iran represented a greater threat , according to a Washington Post report on the eve of the meeting .
Israeli Defence Minister Fouad Ben-Eliezer , who was visiting Washington with Sharon , revealed the essence of the strategic differences between Tel Aviv and Washington over military force .
He was quoted by the Post as saying , " Today , everybody is busy with Iraq .
Iraq is a problem ...
But you should understand , if you ask me , today Iran is more dangerous than Iraq . "
Sharon never revealed publicly what he said to Bush in the Feb. 7 meeting .
But Yossi Alpher , a former adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Barak , wrote in an article in the Forward last January that Sharon advised Bush not to occupy Iraq , according to a knowledgeable source .
Alpher wrote that Sharon also assured Bush that Israel would not " push one way or another " regarding his plan to take down Saddam Hussein .
Alpher noted that Washington did not want public support by Israel and in fact requested that Israel refrain from openly supporting the invasion in order to avoid an automatic negative reaction from Iraq 's Arab neighbours .
After that meeting , the Sharon government generally remained silent on the issue of an invasion of Iraq .
A notable exception , however , was a statement on Aug. 16 , 2002 by Ranaan Gissin , an aide to Sharon .
Ranaan declared , " Any postponement of an attack on Iraq at this stage will serve no purpose .
It will only give [ Hussein ] more of an opportunity to accelerate his programme of weapons of mass destruction . "
As late as October 2002 , however , there were still signs of continuing Israeli grumbling about the Bush administration 's obsession with taking over Iraq .
Both the Israeli Defence Forces ' chief of staff and its chief of military intelligence made public statements that month implicitly dismissing the Bush administration 's position that Saddam Hussein 's alleged quest for nuclear weapons made him the main threat .
Both officials suggested that Israel 's military advantage over Iraq had continued to increase over the decade since the Gulf War as Iraq had grown weaker .
The Israeli chief of military intelligence , Maj. Gen. Aharon Farkash , said Iraq had not deployed any missiles that could strike Israel directly and challenged the Bush administration 's argument that Iraq could obtain nuclear weapons within a relatively short time .
He gave an interview to Israeli television in which he said army intelligence had concluded that Iraq could not have nuclear weapons in less than four years .
He insisted that Iran was as much of a nuclear threat as Iraq .
Israeli strategists generally believed that taking down the Hussein regime could further upset an Iran - Iraq power balance that had already tilted in favour of Iran after the U.S. defeat of Hussein 's army in the 1991 Gulf War .
By 1996 , however , neoconservatives with ties to the Likud Party were beginning to argue for a more aggressive joint U.S. - Israeli strategy aimed at a " rollback " of all of Israel 's enemies in the region , including Iran , but beginning by taking down Hussein and putting a pro-Israeli regime in power there .
That was the thrust of the 1996 report of a task force led by Richard Perle for the right - wing Israeli think tank , the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies and aimed at the Likud Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
But most strategists in the Israeli government and the Likud Party -- including Sharon himself -- did not share that viewpoint .
Despite agreement between neoconservatives and Israeli officials on many issues , the dominant Israeli strategic judgment on the issue of invading Iraq diverged from that of U.S. neoconservatives because of differing political - military interests .
Israel was more concerned with the relative military threat posed by Iran and Iraq , whereas neoconservatives in the Bush administration were focused on regime change in Iraq as a low - cost way of leveraging more ambitious changes in the region .
From the neoconservative perspective , the very military weakness of Hussein 's Iraq made it the logical target for the use of U.S. military power .

His latest book , " Perils of Dominance : Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam " , was published in June 2005 .
LOWELL , Massachusetts ( Reuters ) - Mary Burns has the kind of Democratic pedigree that dominates Massachusetts politics .
Her family and friends vote Democratic , and she lives in a district that has not elected a Republican in 35 years .
Democratic presidential candidates ( L - R ) Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , former Senator John Edwards ( D - NC ) , Representative Dennis Kucinich , ( D - OH ) , and Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) pose for photographers before their debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire September 26 , 2007 .

But on October 17 , she joined other disgruntled Democrats , voting for a Republican in a special congressional election .
Her candidate , Jim Ogonowski , who campaigned as an anti-immigration crusader , lost to Democrat Niki Tsongas by only 45 percent to 51 percent , a much closer margin than expected in a district Democrats saw as safely theirs .
Now political strategists across the country are trying to figure out what Ogonowski ’s strong showing means for the nation as a whole and how worried Democrats should be about next year ’s elections for president and Congress .
Despite President George W. Bush ’s low poll standing , the unpopularity of the Iraq war and the formidable money advantage Democrats have established over their Republican rivals , last week ’s vote warned Democrats not to get overconfident .
“ There ’s a lot they still have to be nervous about , ” said Julian Zelizer , a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University .
“ The shakiness of this particular victory in Massachusetts is the kind of thing that sends a message to the national leadership as they start to think about the next cycle . ”
Democrats should remember that the Iraq war will not be the only issue in 2008 and that the party ’s stance on immigration in particular -- most favor allowing illegal immigrants a path to legal status -- could be an Achilles heel , he added .
Ogonowski , a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and brother of an American Airlines pilot killed in the September 11 attacks , was never expected to threaten Tsongas , widow of Sen .
Paul Tsongas , in a district her late husband once represented .
Former President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi campaigned with Tsongas .
For some voters , their presence reinforced her image as a Washington insider .
Ogonowski downplayed his Republican ties and instead vowed to fix a “ broken Congress ” and fight illegal immigration .
While Tsongas tried to make the election a referendum on Bush and the war , Ogonowski issued fliers that overlapped images of Tsongas and Bush with the words “ Niki Tsongas / George Bush Immigration Plan : Amnesty to 12 million illegal immigrants . ”
‘ ONE OF US ’
“ He was like one of us , ” Burns said of Ogonowski .
“ He was n’t from a political background or a political family .
He was just looking for changes in Washington like we all are .
I have a lot of Democratic friends who voted for him because he understood their concerns , ” the 46 - year - old advertising executive added .
Some Republicans also drew confidence from Saturday ’s election of Republican U.S. Rep. Bobby Jindal as governor of Louisiana .
The incumbent Democratic governor , Kathleen Babineaux Blanco , still blamed for post - Hurricane Katrina incompetence , decided not to seek re-election .
“ Jindal walked away with that race , ” said Democratic pollster Dave Beattie , who is not affiliated with a campaign .
“ There ’s a real anti-incumbent , anti-Washington mood out there , ” he said .
“ Democrats cannot take for granted that just because voters are upset with the Republican administration it does n’t mean they think Democrats are much better right now . ”
Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said overconfidence was a risk for both parties .
He recalled that many Republicans never imagined they could lose control of both houses of Congress last year .
“ While there is no question that the current political environment nationally looks to benefit Democrats , it is over a year before anybody will actually go and vote .
A year is an eternity in politics , ” he said .
“ Think back a year ago .
A year ago there were still a number of Republicans who were convinced that we were n’t going to lose the House or the Senate .
So many things can change over the course of year , ” said Fabrizio , who is not affiliated with a campaign in 2008 .

Defeating homosexuality with computers
R. J. Santorum , F. Phelps , P. Robertson
Abstract
God grants every man and woman free will , therefore homosexuality is a choice .
This choice exposes tens of millions of Americans every year to sin and pestilence .
We have developed an experimental technique using advanced computers , flashing Christian graphics , and prayerful contemplation that may cure homosexuality .
This procedure , called De-sodomizing , involves playing a pleasing musical note every time a crucifix appears on the computer screen .
When a graphic image of homosexual acts appears on the screen the computer will play an unpleasant buzzing tone .
This process coupled with prayerful ministrations will break the cycle of sin in their homosexual cortex .
We will also use advanced heterosexual math .
Proposal ACCEPTED -
We must proceed with every effort to break the hold of the gays on God 's country !
Bibliogical fossil dating of dinosaurs
L. Glans and D. Porridge
Abstract
Scientifically unsound methods of dating fossils and preserved remains provide an inaccurate picture of the world around us .
Therefore the development of a new method of fossil dating based on careful readings of the Bible and Christian measurements is critical .
We propose to experiment with various interpretations of the Old Testament on the fossilized remains of several dinosaurs .
Our goal is to achieve Sixth Day dating accuracy of plus or minus one half hour .
Proposal REJECTED - Fossils , like starlight , were created to test our Faith in the Biblical reality of Creation .
No dating methods , no matter how Christian , can be trusted .
Applications of gopher wood framing in aeronautical design
A. Noah and T. Args
Abstract
The aviation industry has a constant need for lightweight and strong materials to use in the framing and construction of 21st century aircraft .
We will examine the possibility of using gopher wood , as extrapolated from Genesis , in the construction of next - generation transport and attack aircraft .
Known to be excellent in the event of Floods , a computer model of this Biblical material will be tested against various secular materials like aluminum and titanium as well as pagan materials including orichalcum , samite and carbon fiber .
When gopher wood proves superior to these godless materials we will recreate the substance through experimentation coupled with rigorous scientific readings of Genesis .
Proposal ACCEPTED - Great positive attitude on this one !
We love a researcher with the foresight to know the results before we spend money .
Cross -kind breeding and the satanic reality of genetic tampering
A. Prigg
Abstract
God precluded evolution by creating man and animals so that they can only breed with their own kind .
Based on L. Hostraum 's 1994 research on the failed breeding of horses to lobsters ( Lies of Science & Medicine , p. 78 ) we will attempt to use genetic machines to cross-combine essences of the horse and the lobster .
We will then compare the resulting offspring to Biblical descriptions of demons and devils to prove that genetic science is indistinguishable from demonology .
Following the experiment the demon creature will be struck down with a sword and then burned while a choir sings the praises of Christ .
Proposal REJECTED - Genetic machines ?
Sounds a little too expensive .
It appears that Sun's Jonathan Schwartz may have known what he was talking about when he claimed that ZFS support was coming to Mac OS X at WWDC .
WWDC came and went , however , with no ZFS announcement from Apple .
Instead , Apple 's Brian Croll flat out said ZFS is not happening .
He later clarified that ZFS for Leopard was present but " read - only " -- meaning that Leopard was unable to write data to ZFS volumes .
Now , according to published reports on the internet , Apple has actually seeded developers with a ZFS Read / Write Beta for Leopard .
The new ZFS Read / Write beta enables full read / write capabilities to Apple 's Mac OS X ( Leopard ) .

Oct. 8 , 2007  --
A mentally retarded man charged with robbery and murder 14 years ago , but ruled incompetent to stand trial and held at a state mental health hospital ever since , was ordered freed Monday after a judge dismissed the case against him .
Floyd Brown , a 43 - year - old Anson County man with an IQ of 50 , was charged in the robbery and beating death of 80 - year - old Katherine Lynch in 1993 .
He was found at the time to be incompetent to stand trial and ordered held at Dorothea Dix Hospital , because prosecutors who believed him dangerous refused to drop the case against him .
" Somehow , it is possible for him to be held until he dies , " said Durham County Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson .
" To me , it does n't seem right . "
It was not immediately clear when Brown would be released .
His relatives said it always was clear he did n't commit the crime .
" The system we looked to to protect him just failed .
Anybody who looked could see he did n't do it , but nobody cared , " said Brown 's sister , Frances Staton .
" The 14 years are gone .
I can't bring them back .
The main thing now is , he 's free . "
Authorities in Anson County have said Brown confessed to using a walking stick to beat Lynch in her home , just down the street in Wadesboro from the house he shared with his mother .
In the confession , Brown said he struck Lynch five times after she refused his request for a dollar , telling Brown she did n't have any money to give him .
But his attorneys challenged the validity of the confession , calling a pair of expert witnesses Monday who said the flowing narrative language of the typewritten document that Brown signed did n't match his halting speech .
" His speech is marked by being very repetitive , " said Dr. Mark Hazelrig , a forensic psychologist at Dorothea Dix .
The defense also attacked other elements of the prosecution 's case , pointing out that the detectives who investigated Lynch 's murder later pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges in unrelated cases .
Brown 's attorney argued new evidence suggests that the description of the suspect does n't match Brown , and Lynch 's actual time of death was several hours before police claim Brown killed her .
Dave Cloutier , an expert in evidence and a retired state Department of Justice instructor , testified Monday that much of the evidence had been lost , including the walking stick .
He also said there was no evidence that Brown had ever been inside Lynch 's house .
" Floyd Lee Brown would not be in Dorothea Dix if it were not for a bogus confession and evidence that has vanished from the Anson County Sheriff 's Office , " his attorney , Mike Klinkosum , told Hudson .
" Mr. Brown has fallen into a statutory black hole . "
Anson County District Attorney Michael Parker , who had previously said Brown was " too dangerous " to release , said state law does n't address how to handle criminal defendants such as Brown , whose mental health can't be improved through treatment .
" There needs to be some look at the mental health system for people like Mr. Brown , " Parker said .
" I 'm constantly getting releases from Dorothea Dix who are not competent .
We have to dismiss .
Then , six months later , they 're back in court . "
Prosecutors offered Brown a plea deal last year on a charge of voluntary manslaughter , with credit for the time he had spent in state custody .
But Klinkosum said when he presented the offer to Brown , it was clear he did not understand what was happening .
A judge later agreed when rejecting a request for a trial , finding that Brown was incapable of assisting with his own defense .
An 11 man , 1 woman jury in Orange County found Irvine police officer David Alex Park not guilty of three felony charges after he pulled over a female motorist ( a dancer from Captain Cream Cabaret , identified as " Lucy " in court ) and ejaculated on her sweater .
Four months earlier , Park had stopped Lucy under similar circumstances .
That time , he 'd ignored a plastic drug baggie he'd found in her car and her suspended license .
But the stop was n't a waste of time .
After friendly chit-chat , the officer had scored Lucy 's phone number .
Telephone records show that Park called the stripper the next morning .
She told him she was too busy to meet .
On the witness stand , Park explained that he 'd called Lucy out of concern for a citizen 's safety .
He also shrugged his shoulders when [ sex crimes prosecutor Shaddi ] Kamiabipour slowly listed the first names of nine Captain Cream female employees —
Annette , Denise , Rashele , Marlia , Brandi , Andrea , Deborah , Laura and Shannon — whose license plates he'd run through the DMV computer in the weeks prior to his sexual encounter with Lucy .
( Another coincidence , according to [ defense attorney Al ] Stokke . )
Jurors also learned that Irvine Police Sgt. Michael Hallinan had previously warned Park as they left work to stay away from the strippers .
Park , who works in construction nowadays , conceded that he'd been given the warning but claimed that he had no clue it was Lucy in the vehicle or that she had an invalid driver 's license , even as he approached her car window .
High Performance Btree Module Now Available
AllegroCache is a high - performance , dynamic object caching database system .
It is described on this page .
One feature in AllegroCache is Btree support , which is now directly available for programmers to use directly .
Btrees are useful for applications where you need a simple and efficient way of storing on disk and retrieving vast amounts of data and where you do not want to pay the overhead of transactions and CLOS .
In this note , we discuss Btrees and AllegroCache support for them .
The AllegroCache Btree documentation is here .
Symbols naming Btree functionality are in the db.btree package .
AllegroCache has always provided Btree support internally .
The functionality is now available to AllegroCache users .
Users should note that the internal Btree structure changed from early releases so Btrees created before the change cannot be used in later AllegroCache versions .
The general theory of Btrees is discussed in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btree, what we have implemented is closer to B+trees .
The most important feature is stores and accesses take on the order of Log ( N ) time , where N is the number of nodes in the btree .
This means that store / access times are reasonable even for very , very large btrees .
In Allegro CL , keys ( which identify btree entries ) are stored in order so you can scan the btree in order .
The Allegro implementation of btrees has these properties in addition :
The code is written completely in Lisp in order to get the best performance possible and the best integration into a Lisp program .
Keys and values are simple vectors of type ( unsigned - byte 8 ) .
( You can use other types if you write encoder / decoders to / from ( unsigned - byte 8 ) vectors . )
There is extensive support for caching disk blocks to avoid disk I/O .
Btree Example
Allegro CL also supports
Btree cursors .
A cursor is an object which points to a Btree entry , and which can be moved ( using the functionality supplied ) to point to other entries .
This simple example is taken from the documentation .
It is intended to show how Btrees are created and manipulated .
Cursors are also illustrated .
Note you cannot run this example unless you have loaded AllegroCache into Allegro CL 8.0 .
We do a ( use - package : db.btree ) so we do not have to package - qualify symbols .
cl-user ( 5 ) : ( require : acache ) ;; t cl-user ( 6 ) : ( use - package : db.btree ) t
We define several auxilliary encoding functions which we will use in this example .
( These are discussed in the Encoding section of the Btree documentation ) .
( defun enc-string ( str ) ( string - to - octets str : external - format :utf - 8 :null - terminate nil ) ) ( defun enc-value ( value ) ( enc- string ( write - to - string value ) ) ) ( defun dec-value ( encoded ) ( read - from - string ( octets - to - string encoded : external - format : utf - 8 ) ) ) ( defun enc - pos - int ( value bytes &optional arr ) ( let ( ( res nil ) ) ( loop ( if* ( zerop value ) then ( return ) else ( push ( logand #xff value ) res ) ( setq value ( ash value - 8 ) ) ) ) ( if * (> bytes ( length res ) ) then ( dotimes ( i (- bytes ( length res ) ) ) ( push 0 res ) ) ) ( if * ( and arr ( >= ( length arr ) ( length res ) ) ) then ( let ( ( i - 1 ) ) ( dolist ( val res ) ( setf ( aref arr ( incf i ) ) val ) ) arr ) else ( make - array ( length res ) : element - type '( unsigned - byte 8 ) :initial - contents res ) ) ) ) ( defun dec - pos - int ( val &optional ( start 0 ) ( end ( length val ) ) ) ( let ( ( res 0 ) ) ( dotimes ( i (- end start ) ) ( setq res (+ ( aref val (+ start i ) ) ( ash res 8 ) ) ) ) res ) )
Here we create a btree where we store for each number from 0 to 999 their square :
cl-user ( 7 ) : ( setq bt ( create - btree " foo.bt " ) ) # < db. btree :: btree [ 1 ] foo.bt @ # x1001257ff2 > cl-user ( 8 ) : ( dotimes ( i 1000 ) ( setf ( get - btree bt ( enc - pos - int i 4 ) ) ( enc - pos - int (* i i ) 5 ) ) ) nil
Now we use the btree to find the square of 25
cl-user ( 9 ) : ( get - btree bt ( enc- pos-int 25 4 ) ) # (0 0 0 2 113 ) cl-user ( 10 ) : ( dec- pos-int *) 625
A cursor is an object that can move through a btree allowing you to retrieve keys and values and to delete keys and values .
When you create a cursor you specify the btree that it will scan .
cl-user ( 12 ) : ( setq cur ( create - cursor bt ) ) #< db.btree::cursor @ # x71c5d62a >
When a cursor is first created it does n't point anywhere in the btree .
Thus the operations on the cursor just return nil .
cl-user ( 13 ) : ( cursor - get cur ) nil cl- user ( 14 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) nil
You can specify where a cursor should point in a number of ways .
Here we tell the cursor to point at the first element in the btree ( and since keys are sorted , this will be a pointer to the lowest key in the key sorting order ) .
cl-user ( 15 ) : ( position - cursor cur nil : kind : first ) nil
We can retrieve the key and value at the cursor with cursor - get .
It returns the key and value as two values :
cl-user ( 16 ) : ( cursor - get cur ) # ( 0 0 0 0 ) # (0 0 0 0 0 )
We can tell even without decoding these usb8 arrays that the key and value are both 0 .
To advance the cursor to the next value and retrieve it you use cursor - next :
cl-user ( 17 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 1 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 1 ) cl-user ( 18 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 2 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 4 ) cl-user ( 19 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 3 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 9 ) cl-user ( 20 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 4 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 16 )
You 'll note that after positioning the cursor we used cursor - get to retrieve the first value and cursor - next to retrieve subsequent ones .
If you 're writing a loop to retrieve values it 's undesirable to have to call one function the first time through the loop and another function on subsequent calls .
Thus cursors can be primed which means that they are in a special state so that a cursor - next will not move the cursor before retrieving the value .
Also calling cursor - next will un - prime the cursor .
Here we once again position the cursor at the first item but this time we prime it as well .
Then we can just use cursor - next to retrieve all the values :
cl-user ( 21 ) : ( position - cursor cur nil : kind : first : prime t) nil cl- user ( 22 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 0 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 0 ) cl-user ( 23 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 1 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 1 ) cl-user ( 24 ) : ( cursor - next cur ) # ( 0 0 0 2 ) # (0 0 0 0 4 )
You can position the cursor at the last item in the tree and then scan backwards with cursor - previous .
cl-user ( 25 ) : ( position - cursor cur nil : kind : last : prime t) nil cl-user ( 26 ) : ( cursor - previous cur ) # (0 0 3 231 ) # (0 0 15 58 113 ) cl-user ( 27 ) : ( dec- pos-int *) 999 cl-user ( 28 ) : ( cursor - previous cur ) # (0 0 3 230 ) # (0 0 15 50 164 ) cl-user ( 29 ) : ( dec- pos-int *) 998
You can position the cursor at a particular key .
Note that in this case position - cursor returns t indicating that it found the key in the table :
cl-user ( 36 ) : ( position - cursor cur ( enc- pos - int 385 4 ) ) t cl-user ( 37 ) : ( cursor - get cur ) # (0 0 1 129 ) # (0 0 2 67 1 ) cl-user ( 38 ) : ( dec- pos-int *) 385
If you specify a key not in the btree then position - cursor returns nil and the cursor is set on the next item after the location where the key would have been found .
Here we choose a key value 2000 which is bigger than the biggest key in the table : 999 .
Thus position - cursor returns nil and sets the cursor after the end of the table .
cursor - previous brings the cursor to the last key in the table : 999 .
cl-user ( 39 ) : ( position - cursor cur ( enc - pos - int 2000 4 ) ) nil cl- user ( 40 ) : ( cursor - get cur ) nil cl- user ( 41 ) : ( cursor - previous cur ) # (0 0 3 231 ) # (0 0 15 58 113 ) cl-user ( 13 ) : ( dec- pos-int *) 999
You can position the cursor at a particular key and value as well and position - cursor will return t if it found the pair and nil if it did not :
cl-user ( 41 ) : ( position - cursor cur ( enc - pos - int 385 4 ) : value ( enc- pos-int ( * 385 385 ) 5 ) ) t cl-user ( 42 ) : ( position - cursor cur ( enc - pos - int 385 4 ) : value ( enc- pos-int ( * 200 200 ) 5 ) ) nil
You use a cursor to specify which values to delete from the btree .
In the example below we position the cursor at key 5 .
We delete that key at which point the cursor moves to the next key , 6 .
We move the cursor back one key and we end up at key 4 since key 5 was deleted .
cl-user ( 47 ) : ( position - cursor cur ( enc - pos - int 5 4 ) ) t cl-user ( 48 ) : ( cursor - get cur ) # ( 0 0 0 5 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 25 ) cl-user ( 49 ) : ( cursor - delete cur ) t cl-user ( 50 ) : ( cursor - get cur ) # ( 0 0 0 6 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 36 ) cl-user ( 51 ) : ( cursor - previous cur ) # ( 0 0 0 4 ) # ( 0 0 0 0 16 )
When you 're finished using a cursor for a while it 's best to unbind it .
This disassociates it from any block in the btree and this allows the cursor to be garbage collected should no references exist to the cursor from the heap .
cl-user ( 52 ) : ( unbind - cursor cur ) #< db.btree::cursor @ # x71b06c82 >
So far all the btree operations have been done on the copy of the btree in memory .
In order to write the btree to the disk you must sync - btree :
cl-user ( 53 ) : ( sync - btree bt ) nil
When you 're finished with the btree you should close it .
The close - btree function will call sync - btree to ensure that the btree is completely written to the disk before the btree file is closed .
cl-user ( 54 ) : ( close - btree bt ) # < db. btree : : btree [ 1 ] foo.bt @ # x1001139632 >
It 's no secret that US content owners want the " middlemen " of the Internet economy to better police their networks and services for material that infringes copyright .
The problem , from a legal perspective , is that ISPs like AT&T and Comcast and content hosts like YouTube have the explicit legal go - ahead not to do this ; they operate in a tranquil Caribbean " safe harbor " that exempts them from the crushing responsibility to filter and analyze every bit of content passing through their control .
But some companies have expressed interest in doing such filtering voluntarily , and MPAA boss Dan Glickman praised them for it at a conference in Washington yesterday .
" Their revenue bases depend on legitimate operations of their networks and more and more they 're finding their networks crowded with infringed material , bandwidth space being crowded out , " Glickman said .
" Many of them are actually getting into the content business directly or indirectly .
This is not an us- versus - them issue . "
He went on to say that the movie business wants to " deepen our relationship " with ISPs .
NBC Universal has been one of the big drivers behind this push to outsource the work of filtering to the ISPs .
NBC 's general counsel Rick Cotton recently told the FCC that ISPs should be forced to " use readily available means to prevent the use of their broadband capacity to transfer pirated content . "
Otherwise , corn farmers could be harmed .
An exec at GE , which owns NBC Universal , later praised the idea in a keynote speech to the telecommunications industry and indicated that his company was quite serious about it .
Rather amazingly , given the money and time that will be required to implement such a system , AT&T has agreed to start filtering content at some mysterious point in the future .
Other ISPs could well follow suit , as most of the major networks are owned by or affiliated with companies that also have a voracious need for content ( just think of how both cable companies and telcos like AT&T and Verizon need access to channels for their various TV offerings , if you need an example ) .
The companies want to keep on good terms with content owners , but there may also be some legitimate concern about the impact illicit traffic has on their networks .
Cracking down on illegal file - sharing — should that prove to be technically possible — could help with both of these issues .
Net neutrality rules , if passed , might throw up some roadblocks .
It 's no wonder , then , that NBC and the MPAA as a whole are opposed to such rules .
Click to viewFollowing up on the launch difference between AT&T and Apple stores , we 've got three separate accounts of people reporting that AT&T is forcing them to buy accessories along with their iPhone at three different AT&T stores .
This was definitely not the case at Apple stores , and for AT&T to decide this on their own to cash in on the launch is pretty damn shady .
Advertisement
The first comes from the University Village AT&T store at
4626 25th Ave NE , Seattle , WA ( Phone 206-729-7184 ) .
When buying the iPhone yesterday , the store said all customers must by two accessories with an iPhone , but the accessories could be returned , opened , without a restocking fee .
Add to that the fact that the salesman did n't even know a charger was included and tried to upsell a different charger to the reader .
Advertisement
The second , at the Hawthorne California AT&T Store at 5249 W. Rosecrans in Hawthorne California ( Phone 310-725-9902 ) , the store manager said customers were required to buy a " bundle " of accessories .
The bundle , written up with magic marker on an unofficial sign , listed the 4GB bundle at $ 650 and the 8GB bundle at $ 750 .
The manager told the customer that they could n't buy the phones without the bundle and that they could leave the store if they did n't want it .
When asked if he could return the items , they said yes , but only tomorrow ( today ) .
The third store , at Pike Street in Seattle , forced people to buy $ 60 worth of accessories ( a case and car charger ) , and if you did n't , you 'd get a voucher and the iPhone would be mailed to you some time next week .
The reader eventually went to the Apple Store nearby , and eventually his friend ( who stayed at the AT&T store ) told him they stopped pushing the accessories .
One is a fluke , two is a coincidence , but three ?
And possibly more ?
That , my friends , is ridiculous .
If this happened to you , send a tip to us at tips@gizmodo.com .
Update : Joel says the AT&T store on broadway near city hall in NY was doing the same until some guy told them it was " illegal " .

Scott says the 4th Street store in Santa Ana had 20 phones , and after 10 people went in they announced everything was sold out .
They then told the remaining customers that throgh a " special deal " , they could order an iPhone and receive it within 2 business days .
The special deal ?
To buy 3 accessories that night .
Update 2 : A reader tells us if an AT&T rep does n't sell between $ 60 - $ 65 worth of accessories for each phone sale and $ 20 - $ 30 worth of features , he can be written up and terminated if sales do n't improve within 45 days .
If customers came and bought iPhones without accessories , this would have caused a big downwards drag on their record .
Each accessory sold will count toward a rep 's sales goals , even if it 's returned the next day , plus he gets six cents on the dollar .
Advertisement
Even weirder : regional managers had side bets on Friday with stores and had perks for reps that sold an X amount of accessories .
The reader says they basically acted like used car salesmen .
Update 3 : Not forcing the accessories on people , but the store on Bridford Parkway in Greensboro , NC sealed the phones in with the accessories anyone purchased so they could charge the 10 % restocking fee even if the iPhone box was unopened .

Mike Gravel tells the story on how he released the Pentagon Papers and his involvement in stopping the draft .
He is a great story teller .
His speech is also quite funny .
The entire episode from Democracy Now is available here .
The Real Player stream is here .
I loved the last bit about how they managed to publish the papers .
When they were running out of sources and it seemed like MIT Press would not publish it , Beacon Press decided to publish them : they had the money and were willing to go ahead with it .
The Gravel bit ( alone ) here :
GEEKS may quake .
Their intricate programming skills are no longer required .
A new computer program has been invented that allows anyone — it is aimed at children — to create interactive animations that mix pictures , sound and movement .
The project , called “ Scratch ” , is the brainchild of Mitch Resnick and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Media Lab .
All that is needed is a computer , the ability to read and a familiarity with building blocks .
Most computer languages are designed with the computer in mind .
They are fast and efficient , so long as the program contains no errors .
The language championed by Dr Resnick and his colleagues is different .
Although it is less speedy , it is more forgiving .
It even allows the code to be changed while the program is running .
The upshot is a simple and intuitive way to create interactive games , stories and animations .
Scratch replaces complex computer codes with building blocks that can be manipulated using a mouse .
By dragging blocks on to a desktop area and stacking them on top of one another , a person with no programming skills can , with a few minutes practice , create a dancing cat that changes colour and meows .
All he need do is download the necessary software , which is free .
( It comes from the same laboratory as the One Laptop Per Child initiative to give children computers costing no more than $ 100 . )
Moreover the person can add his own images and manipulate these .
Want to create a video of yourself gliding on a magic carpet over the Hanging Gardens of Babylon while drinking mint tea and singing an ode to Amytis ?
Just add some electronic images and tunes , then stack some bricks .
Want to share the fruits of your new - found skills ?
Just add your handiwork to the Scratch website and anyone will be able to take a look — and comment on it .
Each building block — and there are 90 or so of them to cover most eventualities — contains computer code .
The edges of each block are shaped such that only certain other types of blocks can be stacked above and below them .
That abolishes the need to know the obscure syntax that bedevils more traditional computer languages .
For example , a block that will run an “ if ” command ( “ if the flying carpet is above a fountain ” ) will fit only with one that gives an appropriate answer ( “ yes ” or “ no ” rather than “ ten ” ) .
The type of command that controls other commands , such as “ repeat the following ten times then go on to the next thing ” , is represented by a C - shaped block .
Blocks describing what is to be repeated slot into the space surrounded by the C .
This allows the flying carpet to circle the fountain , say , ten times — then fly to the Tower of Babel .
Using blocks eliminates another fiendish enemy : the typographical error .
Traditional computer programs do not tolerate even small slips of the typing finger .
Replacing a comma with a dot can stop them from running .
Such slip - ups are impossible using blocks .
Even when something other than expected happens — the flying carpet may head off in the wrong direction — the program still runs and this means mistakes are more quickly identified .
Such simplicity will make nerds of us all .
People start asking you for sourcing .
Which I suppose is fair .
Here 's the Brookings report on just about every security variable out there .
They 're all faring pretty , well terribly .
Or at best they have n't gotten much worse lately .
Here are some more important ones .
( ( ( All off - the - wall sci - fi intervionism aside , I ’d pay plenty for a service that could search the interior of my body and compare its state to that of yesterday and a year ago .
Just to know what that * twinge *
really means , or what ’s going on with that aching tooth …
Who would n’t pay for that ? ) ) )

August 18 , 2022 Google Body : Users Find Asses with Both Hands
MOUNTAIN VIEW–Information search giant Google , Inc .
announced Thursday the release of Google Body , a search service aiming to index the internal and external anatomy of every living creature on the planet .
“ Google has long been dedicated to making information both useful and universally accessible , ” notes Google VP of Product
Development Eric Hind .
“ We ’re happy now to extend search to information about human bodies , mine and yours , inside and out , from the number of follicles on my head to the length of the President ’s toenails . ”
The project , known as Google Body , sees the company partnering with public transportation systems , libraries , and motor vehicle departments to place scanning equipment in high - traffic doorways and public thoroughfares .
Though details of the agreements are scarce and reportedly subject participating city and state officials to strict non-disclosure terms , Google ’s announcement confirmed that the project is active in several major U.S. population centers , including Los
Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , and New York City , with agreements with at least 16 other cities in late - stage negotiation .
“ We ’ve passed proof - of - concept at this point , ” adds Hind , “ and now our focus is scalability and rolling this thing out nationwide . ”
The service , which has been available for some three months to invitation - only beta testers , enables users to search for aggregate information about the anatomy of user - defined groups .
“ The service is a boon to the medical research community , ” says Dr. Jennifer Guns of the Johns
Hopkins Clinic for Specialism .
“ Nothing will replace truly controlled trials , but the ability to get a snapshot of , say , the blood pressure of men between 50 and 65 on New
York ’s Upper East Side , can certainly give companies an idea of where they might best spend their research dollars . ”
Early testers have remarked upon a fuzzy - logic “ match my organ ” feature , which helps users get in touch with the nearest , most suitable donor for multiple organ systems .
“ We think of Body as way to bring people together , ” remarks
Google ’s Hind .
The most common searches among testers , however , exploited the service ’s ability to produce three - dimensional images of the bodies of individual subjects .
“ I was shocked when I saw it , ” exclaims Larry
Blender of Carson City .
“ I mean , one , where did they get a 3 - D
rendering of my ass , and , two , does my ass really look like that ?
I admit that I satisfied some of my curiosity about a few of my neighbors and co-workers before I thought to search for myself , but I was still really shocked to see it up there . ”
The service has understandably raised concerns among privacy activists , who point to reports that early users include some well - known insurance companies and two prominent executive recruiting firms .
“ You know what the top two search terms are , after ‘ ass ’ ? ” asks David
Deerfield of People and Privacy , a privacy - focused community outreach group .
“ They ’re ‘ aorta ’ and ‘ arterial plaque . ’
Who do you think is conducting those searches ?
There ’s no doubt in my mind that there are insurance company bots scouring this thing and we think it should stop . ”
Responding to criticism from privacy groups , Google’s
Hind pointed to the program ’s opt - out policy .
“ We are very concerned about user privacy , and that ’s why we will not make publicly available any information about anybody who let ’s us know they do not want to participate by wearing an
Opt -Out headband when in public .
Google archives information about those individuals , but does not make it searchable . ”
The yellow and black vinyl headbands can be requested free of charge by writing to the company at its
Mountain View headquarters .

How to Use a Squat Toilet
How to Use a Squat Toilet
How To : Frank Bures blows the lid off one of the most taboo subjects in travel : how to squat and wipe .
Warning :
This article contains language that some will find offensive , but that others will find refreshingly honest .
The Situation :
You ’re sitting at a bar in the middle of Nigeria when you feel a rumble below your ribcage : the ominous tremors before the eruption .
It ’s the distant roar of a train coming down the intestinal tract .
Ain’t nothing gonna stop it .
You look in your bag and see a cardboard tube that used to have white paper rolled around it , paper that suddenly seems to a have had a magical quality , paper that has been your friend and companion since you were a wee one , paper you learned how to use years ago , and which has n’t been mentioned since .
But you ’re a long way from Kansas and with no idea how people do it here sans paper .
This is information that can be extremely hard to come by .
It does n’t come up at dinner .
It ’s about the last thing anyone wants to talk about at a bar .
And it ’s a little too weird to ask your host family about it .
Besides , there would n’t be time for the conversation , even if you could figure out how to bring it up .
Now , of course , is the worst time to try to acquire this valuable bit of data .
But now is when you usually start to think about it .
Now is when you grasp the wonder of toilet paper .
And now is when you realize you are n’t nearly as culturally immersed as you thought you were .
Now is when you wish you knew how to wipe like most people on the planet .
Background : Squatting is an ancient practice , but knowledge of it has recently been lost in the West .
The flush toilet was n’t even invented until 1596 .
And toilet paper did n’t become popular until the 1900s .
According to the Toilet Paper Encyclopedia , pre-TP , humans used corn cobs , Sears Roebuck catalogs , mussel shells , newspaper , leaves , sand , hayballs , gompf sticks and the end of old anchor cables on ships .
Ouch !
But the good folks at the TPE seem blissfully unaware that most of the world ’s people still use neither toilet paper , nor western sit - down crappers .
Nor do they use corn cobs , gompf sticks or anchor cables .
Because , while most of us in North America and Europe sit , people on just about every other continent squat , using water and their left hand .
In much of Africa and Asia you can be hard - pressed to find anything else besides the squatter .
Beginning Squatting : I called Doug Lansky , a traveler and travel writer who knows the hardships of squatting .
“ It ’s difficult , ” said Lansky , who edited a book called , There ’s No Toilet Paper on the Road Less Traveled .
“ There are n’t any helpful directions , like a seatback pocket , that show you how to use a squat toilet .
You have to sort of find your own technique , whether you ’re up more on the balls of your feet , or whether you get a little more comfortable and put your heels down .
And if you get advanced , you can even bring the newspaper in with you .
That ’s sort of the double black diamond mogul run of squatting . ”
World Hum travel advice guru and Vagabonding author Rolf Potts has also seen a few squatters in his day .
“ In places like India , and many parts of Asia , ” he told me , “ a bathroom wo n’t have toilet paper .
It will have a little cup of water .
Basically , after you ’ve done your business , you take your left hand and wash the exit hole of fecal matter , then wash your hand .
That ’s why nobody shakes hands with their left hand in most of Asia and the Middle East , because that ’s your ass - wiping hand . ”
Dr. Jane Wilson - Howarth is probably the world ’s foremost expert on excretion , a real Buddha of Bowel Movements , and she ’s not afraid to get into the details .
“ My technique when I ’m teaching volunteers about to go abroad , ” said the author of How to Shit Around the World from her UK office , “ is that when you ’re learning , you need to take everything off below your waist : socks , shoes , pants , underwear .
Then squat over the toilet .
Pour water over your bum , and with your left hand , just whittle away with your fingers and try to dislodge any lumpy bits while pouring water .
And that ’s actually not too unaesthetic , because any mess that goes onto your fingers comes off in the water . ”
Advanced Squatting : Do above .
Read The Wall Street Journal Asia .
What to do : Most important : Cultivate the right mindset .
Relax , pretend like you ’ve been doing this for years .
Remember , using your hand is ( according Wilson - Howarth ) actually more hygienic , not less , than using toilet paper .
“ You get good bacteriological cleaning with just rubbing your hands together with soap under running water four times , ” she says , and cites a study which says you do n’t even need soap .
“ It can be ash or mud , just rubbing your hands together under water with some kind of washing agent .
Even dirt from the river bank will give you good bacteriological cleaning . ”
In other words , the dirtiness is primarily in your mind , as Potts found out one day on the road .
“ I think it was when I was traveling through Southeast Asia that I eventually got caught out , ” he told me , “ and was forced into this mental power situation where I just willed myself to use the water .
It was very strange .
We ’re not culturally conditioned to have that kind of intimacy with our butthole .
So I just sort of had to — it ’s sort of like riding a bike , or having sex for the first time — I just had to figure out what I was doing .
Then , of course , I washed my hands extensively afterwards .
But that ’s when I realized it ’s not that big of a deal . ”
What not to do :
* Do n’t ignore your pockets mid-squat .
“ Do n’t lose your wallet , cell phone or passport , ” cautioned Dean Visser , who has lived in Asia for more than 15 years .
“ If you do , chances are you ’ll have to tell someone how it happened .
I speak from hard - won experience , Little Grasshopper . ”
* Do n’t use glossy magazine pages .
( See : Smearing )
* Do n’t be afraid to ask questions .
“ It ’s a difficult topic , ” said Howarth - Wilson “ Just because they ’re embarrassed about it , people do n’t even know where to have a shit sometimes , so they wo n’t ask where the right place is to defecate .
They do a dump and run , then everyone is ending up encountering this stuff . ”
* Do n’t lean back too far .
* Do n’t forget to pour a little water in , if it ’s a porcelain / metal squatter , before you go , to help wash it all down afterward .
Preparation :
It ’s a good idea to get a few , er , dry runs in while still at home .
Because with practice , you can get it down .
After all , as Lanksy and others pointed out , we are biologically designed to squat .
It ’s the fine tuning we lack .
“ The technique , ” said Wilson - Howarth , “ is to use a lot of water so you ’re not actually scraping shit off your ass .
What you ’re doing is facilitating washing it off .
But if you ’re a learner at this , and you do n’t take your bottoms off , it splashes onto your pants and you look as if you had an accident , and everyone laughs at you when you come out . ”
Traveling benefits : Mastering the squatter will save you tons of heartache , stomachache , time , comfort and embarrassment .
It works ; it ’s clean ; and it will give you the fearlessness to travel anywhere .
Besides , you ’ll never step out of the toilet in that Nigerian bar looking like you just stepped out of the shower .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Senate on Thursday night approved a seven - year extension of a moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access .
The Senate voice vote came a little over a week after the House passed a bill calling for a four - year moratorium .
The tax ban , first approved in 1998 , is set to expire Nov. 1 .
Attempts in both the House and Senate to make the ban permanent in recent weeks were unsuccessful despite strong support for the idea .
Sens. Tom Carper , D - Del. , and Lamar Alexander , R - Tenn. , in a joint statement called the agreement " a commonsense victory both for Internet users and for state and local governments . "
The two chambers will have to reach a compromise on the length of the ban and other differences before the bill can be sent to the White House for President Bush 's signature .

The legal crackdown and publicity blitz aimed at people who share music , videos and software online may be having an unintended consequence for the troubled record industry .
The number of file - sharers disguising their BitTorrent activity with encryption is skyrocketing .
Figures from a large UK ISP obtained by The Register show that the portion of BitTorrent traffic encrypted by file - sharers has risen 10 - fold in the last 12 months , from four to 40 per cent .
This time last year , unencrypted torrents accounted for about 500 M bit/s of bandwidth , while files that had been scrambled by uploaders swallowed just 20 M bit/s .
The latest data shows that bandwidth used by unencrypted torrents has fallen to 350 M bit / s. Sharing of masked music , video and software has meanwhile exploded to average more than 200 M bit/s .
Matt Phillips , spokesman for UK record industry trade association the British Phonographic Institute , told The Reg : " Our internet investigations team , internet service providers and the police are well aware of encryption technology : it 's been around for a long time and is commonplace in other areas of internet crime .
It should come as no surprise that if people think they can hide illegal activity they will attempt to . "
" When encryption is used to cloak torrent traffic it tends to be to hide something , and attracts greater attention for that reason .
If certain ISPs are experiencing disproportionately high volumes of encrypted torrent traffic we expect it is partly in response to a combination of effective ISP abuse teams the enforcement efforts of the police and industry . "
The last year has seen a significant escalation of the movie and music industry campaign against copyright infringement .
The RIAA secured its first jury trial against Jammie Thomas , popular tracking site TorrentSpy was ordered to collect user data , and the supposedly private UK - based OiNK network was busted .
The file - sharing public 's response has been revealed by analysis of data from deep packet inspection ( DPI ) technology , such as that made by Ellacoya and Cisco 's P - Cube .
Many ISPs , including BT here and Comcast in the US , have now deployed the kit to help throttle the amount of bandwidth consumed by P2P and other greedy net applications .
Some BitTorrent encryption is certainly an effort to avoid such restrictions .
While DPI is able to identify and manage encrypted file - sharing packets , it is unable to look inside those packets for copyright infringement .
The trend towards encryption means current efforts by music publishers and government to cut a deal with ISPs to create a monitoring system to boot persistent copyright infringers off the internet , which we revealed last month is likely to be rendered pointless .

NEW YORK – Claiming “ state secrets ” are at stake , theU.S. government today requested the dismissal of a federal lawsuit filed bythe American Civil Liberties Union against Boeing Company subsidiary JeppesenDataplan , Inc. for its participation in the CIA ’s unlawful “ extraordinary rendition ” program .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of five rendition victims who werekidnapped by the CIA and secretly transferred to U.S. - run secret overseasprisons or to the custody of foreign intelligence agencies where they weresubjected to torture and other forms of cruel , inhuman and degradingtreatment .
In the lawsuit , the ACLU charges that Jeppesen knowingly provideddirect logistical support for the flights that the CIA used for theclandestine rendition flights .
The following can be attributed to Steven Watt , staff attorney with theACLU ’s Human Rights Program and an attorney on the case :
“ The whole world knows about the U.S. ‘ extraordinary rendition ’ program and the government ’s invocation of ‘ state secrets ’ in this case is just another cynical attempt by the administration to cover up an illegal and immoral program .
“ Historically , the ‘ state secrets ’ defense has been used to exclude discrete information in cases that may contain sensitive national security content .
However , with increasingly regularity , the current administration has invoked the defense as a means of dismissing entire cases seeking accountability for illegal practices and policies it has implemented in the name of national security .
“ Five men have been brutally abused under the ‘ extraordinary rendition ’ program with the help of a U.S. corporation .
These victims deserve their day in court .
And Jeppesen must be held accountable for the instrumental role the company played in their suffering . ”
More information on the ACLU ’s lawsuit against Jeppesen as well as its other work in the fight against rendition can be found online at :

Scientists know that information travels between brain cells along hairlike extensions called axons .
For the first time , researchers have found that axons do n’t just transmit information – they can turn the signal up or down with the right stimulation .
This finding may help scientists develop treatments for psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia in which it is thought that different parts of the brain do not communicate correctly with each other .
“ Until now , scientists have thought that in the brain ’s cortex — where most cognitive processes occur — information was only processed in the cell body , ” said Raju Metherate , author of the study , associate professor of neurobiology and behavior , and director of the Center for Hearing Research at UC Irvine .
“ The result of our study suggests that we must consider the axons as sites of information processing – and of potential problems when things go wrong . ”
This study appears online Aug. 19 in Nature Neuroscience .
Increasingly , studies are beginning to show that complex information processing , and perhaps consciousness itself , may result from coordinated activity among many parts of the brain connected by bundles of long axons .
Cognitive problems may occur when these areas do n’t communicate properly with each other .
Cognitive function occurs when millions of brain cells communicate with each other at the same time .
A brain cell has a network of branches called dendrites through which it receives and processes information from other cells .
The body of the cell then relays the processed information along an axon to a terminal that links to another cell ’s dendrites .
At the terminal , chemicals called neurotransmitters are released , allowing the information to enter the receiving cell .
Until now , scientists believed axons were just the wires between point A and point B .
“ Axons , we thought , were like wires in a radio conveying signals , but we found that if you stimulate the axon , the signal can be altered , like turning the volume knob on the radio , ” Metherate said .
Originally , Metherate and his colleagues had hoped to confirm the idea that the drug nicotine alters information that is processed in the cell body or terminal .
Puzzled by several negative tests , they developed an experiment in which they could study the intervening axon .
In their experiment , they examined a section of mouse brain associated with hearing that contained a brain cell with an axon connecting to the cortex .
Using nicotine , they stimulated the axon to determine how it would affect a signal the brain cell sent to the cortex .
Without applying nicotine , about 35 percent of the messages sent by the brain cell reached the cortex .
But when nicotine was applied to the axon , the success rate nearly doubled to about 70 percent .
“ We looked for more conventional reasons why the response was enhanced , but the evidence just kept pointing to the axon .
Nicotine activated the proteins that we think are on the axon , ” Metherate said .
“ This is a completely new idea about how the brain works . ”

I guess you have n’t gotten the memo yet .
Michael Vick is not just an NFL quarterback , or a notorious pitbull killer .
“ Michael Vick ” is also fast becoming the new HOT verb of 2007 ; primarily used to describe doing something terrible to an animal .
The connotations , however , are most effective when describing actions towards dogs .
BTW , a member ’s submission and subsequent acceptance from Urban Dictionary proves it : Michael Vick
Today at OfferOfTheDay.com , we offer our readers a new verb and some creative ways to use it .
Usage Scenario # 1 :
Does your neighbor have an annoying runt of a dog that he or she keeps in the yard ?
Does this slobbering rat - like creature bark incessantly all day and night ?
Here ’s what you can tell your neighbor when this mongrel keeps you up the night before an important morning meeting :
Put a DAMN muzzle on that thing !
I ’m gonna hop the fence and “ Michael Vick ” your dog if it does n’t shut its trap !
Usage Scenario # 2 :
Is your son ’s dog “ Ashley ” getting up in age ?
Does it limp around in obvious pain with one eye sewn shut due to its recent cataract surgery ?
It ’s pretty much asking to be euthanized , is n’t it ?
Well , here ’s how to “ break ” the news to your son without having to use the word “ euthanize ” and subsequently having to leave the room awkwardly to retrieve your dictionary in order to explain it to him :
Son. I ’m thinking about “ Michael Vick- ing ” your dog because it ’s just getting too old .
You have to understand , it ’s Ashley ’s time .
Plus , remember son…dogs do n’t have souls like you and me .
Remember that , always .
Usage Scenario # 3 :
Did you accidentally run over your family dog while backing out of the driveway and can’t find the words to break the bad news to the family ?
Here ’s what you can do .
Sit your family down on the couch and try this speech out on them :
Boy oh boy .
Daddy really screwed the “ pooch ” this time … LITERALLY .
Remember how I told you that I thought I saw Ashley running away this morning … Uhhhh , that ’s not entirely true .
I guess there ’s no easy way to put this …I accidentally “ Michael Vicked ” the dog this morning while I was reversing out of the garage .
I hid her mangled carcass under the pile of leaves next to the Wilson ’s apple tree because I was running late for a meeting .
The funny thing is , I think their landscapers accidentally bagged her with the leaves , because she ’s not there anymore .
Hey , look on the bright side guys ; at least we do n’t need to pay for a cremation .
So , who wants to go for some Baskin Robbins ?
My treat .
Usage Scenario # 4 ( this one ’s a stretch ) :
Only do this scenario if you are one sick puppy .
Do you have a girlfriend who ’s out of town for the weekend AND coincidentally have neighbors who have asked you to watch their dog while they ’re on vacation …
AND simultaneously , you also need an excuse to tell your friends because you do n’t want to go out with them later ?
Well , thanks to OfferOfTheDay.com , you can tell your friends this little number :
Guys , my girlfriend is out of town and I have to watch over my neighbor ’s dog … ( gulp ) my neighbor ’s well - groomed , very muscular , athletic , and strangely attractive female dog .
I think I ’m gonna buy myself a jar of creamy Skippy peanut butter , turn the lights down low , and get “ Michael Vick - ulated ” by her ALL NIGHT LOOOOOONG BABY !
Now , those of you that got that last one …
You ’re sick .
You truly are SICK !
Get your minds out of the gutter already .
And those of you who did n’t get it , well you ’re probably better off … we just have too much “ class ” to explain it .

Canada has announced one of the largest land conservation initiatives in Canadian history near the East Arm of Great Slave Lake and around the Ramparts River and Wetlands , both in the Northwest Territories .
The northern wilderness set aside totals more than 10 million hectares .
The interim land withdrawals announced November 21 by Minister Baird and the Honourable Chuck Strahl , Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians are a major step forward towards creating a national park in the East Arm of Great Slave Lake and a national wildlife area for the Ramparts River and Wetlands ( Ts'ude niline Tu'eyeta ) .
The Government also announced an Interim Land Withdrawal to protect approximately 62,000 square kilometers with the Akaitcho Dene First Nations from the allowance of mineral staking , sale or lease during the course of negotiations .
" All total , today 's announcement by the federal government amounts to the largest land withdrawal for interim protection in Canadian history , " said Lorne Johnson , Ottawa Bureau Director , WWF - Canada .
" This is a great example of sequencing conservation first , up front in the development process , while we still have a chance to protect the North 's lands and waters . "
In the last year , the Government of Canada has committed to :
a massive expansion of the Nahanni National Park Reserve ;
creation of the Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area ;
$ 30 million to protect the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia ;
$ 3 million to the restoration of Stanley Park in Vancouver and Point Pleasant Park in Halifax ;
$ 225 million for the Nature Conservancy of Canada to preserve and conserve up to half a million acres of land across the country ;
$ 5 million to protect the Sahoyúé §ehdacho National Historic Site on the shores of Great Bear Lake , the largest lake in Canada .
The Government will be also providing $ 3 million for a study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national park in the vicinity of the East Arm of Great Slave Lake and $ 830,000 over five years to establish the Ramparts River and Wetlands National Wildlife Area .

" Tyranny , like Hell , is not easily conquered ; yet we have this consolation with us , that the harder the conflict , the more glorious the triumph .
What we obtain too cheap , we esteem too lightly ; it is dearness only that gives everything its value . "
- Thomas Paine ( 1 )
THE WORLD changes constantly ; so much so that a lesson learned in the past is n't necessarily a useful lesson now .
I 'm not sure we can apply the errors of the past to enable us to act better .
An understanding of the past might even cause paralysis .
You see that nothing 's simple ; everything 's interconnected ; it 's all relative ; there is nothing that can be called truth .
There is no truth at all , of any kind , about anything .
You start out as a child with exposure to a narrow environment , and the concept that there are right and wrong ways to live and act .
You ask questions and you get answers .
You ask , " Why is the sky blue ? " and the teacher answers , " Because it reflects the sea . "
That 's the answer .
That is the truth .
When you hear another answer , you 're tempted to reject it as false , because , after all , how can there be two truths ?
Then you find out that your teacher was somewhat mistaken and you get confused .
This is the beginning of wisdom .
By studying history you become aware that there are many explanations for everything and that they all are , if not precisely true , at least equally true .
Even though one explanation may not be much good , is not therefore invalid .
The " because it reflects the sea , " answer may not tell you much about the sky , but it tells you a lot about your teacher .
Even though one answer may be a good one , it does not invalidate the others .
In debates going on now about , say , the First Amendment , many of those who argue in favor of it tend to reject the other arguments in favor of it , not realizing that both can be perfectly true .
A fairly vigorous debate has arisen surrounding the Second Amendment , as well , and how it should be interpreted at the close of the millennium .
People come up with " an " answer to these questions , rejecting all the other answers .
They deny the other answer a voice .
They wo n't listen to what the other person has to say .
This is dimwitted .
The Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights had a lot of things in mind .
They tried to include as many of them as possible , without excluding things that they had n't thought of , or that had n't happened yet , but might .
They were inclusive , rather than exclusive .
The Framers recognized one great truth , and left all the little truths to look after themselves : the Bill of Rights did not create the rights that it outlines .
The Bill of Rights recognizes and discusses , guarantees and protects certain rights , but it did not call them into being .
Even if the Bill of Rights did not exist , or if it were repealed , or if it were so circumscribed by law and judicial opinion as to become meaningless , the rights would nonetheless exist undiminished .
They would merely be accorded no official protection .
The First Amendment guarantees that the government will not interfere with your right to speak out against injustice or to worship God .
That right existed long before there was a First Amendment , or even a State .
Without that right , there could be no just government .
Government is just in direct proportion to the amount of free speech people have , and the lack of official interference with matters of conscience .
The Second Amendment does not create the private right to keep and bear arms .
It recognizes the pre-existing right and enumerates one good reason for it , without implying in any way that other such good reasons do not exist .
You have a right to protect yourself from criminals , both public and private , and you have a right to the means of protection .
You have a right and an obligation to come to the need of the State , risking your life and property if necessary .
You have a right to purge the State of tyrants , by force if necessary .
That is , after all , what the Founders of our nation actually did , and they did not do it with hard words or their naked fists .
All these reasons are good reasons , and two , or three , or four good reasons do not ever add up to only one good reason .
There are a lot of reasons why people should have privacy .
There are a lot of reasons why people must be able to speak and write and read whatever they want to .
There are a lot of reasons why your sexual affairs are nobody 's business but your own ; what ; with whom , when or where .
There are a lot of reasons and they 're all correct , and none of the reasons excludes the others .
There are many explanations for everything .
I guess that 's the main thing I 've learned so far - that there are myriad right answers , and they 're all right .
I enjoy target shooting , which is the pleasant pursuit of turning money into noise .
It 's not quite as much fun as shooting tin cans off a fence post , but we do live in the big city .
I 'm not as good a shot as my dear mother , nor yet as good as her father , who was a paragon , but with time I may improve .
We Goines ' have a long tradition of keeping the means for resistance within easy reach .
In 1717 the Crown took away my first American ancestor 's land , with the excuse that he was " a Negro , and consequently not a citizen . "
By 1834 the Free Colored citizens of most Southern and many Northern states had lost all their civil rights , including the right to keep and bear arms .
My ancestors did not agree that they should become second - class citizens , and went into the hills , guns , dogs , children and all .
It then became a simple matter of just how serious the State was in its desire to enslave them .
You will not be surprised to hear that representatives of the State found themselves in some doubt on the matter when vigilantes , militia - men and soldiers went into the hills and did not come out again .
We used them for fertilizer .
If you think it can't happen here and now , you 've got another think coming .
Look at Waco .
My ancestors did not fight and shed their life 's blood for my rights so that I might blandly surrender them to fools and demagogues .
" Who 's going to catch us ?
We 're the police .
We 're in charge . "

PEOPLE go to church because they already believe what the preacher is saying .
Their attendance is more along the line of reinforcing a conviction that what they already think correct are opinions shared by others .
Not too many go in the front door as heathens and come out when the service is over as Episcopalians .
The American Civil Liberties Union Newsletter reaches an audience of people who have joined the ACLU because they already agree with its goals .
Members of the National Rifle Association get monthly comfort from American Rifleman magazine , which is addressing an audience already persuaded and does n't really need much beyond the occasional refresher course in the basic ideology .
These publications are preaching to the choir .
Think of me more as a streetcorner evangelist .
This essay is not aimed at those who already agree with my contention that the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees individual citizens the right to keep and bear arms .
I 'm after the ones who do n't agree , or who have no clear opinions on the subject , but feel a vague sense of unease when the matter comes up .
The Second Amendment to the Constitution is part of a fabric of rights that depend utterly , each on the next , for the integrity of the whole .
Weaken one , and you weaken all .
Strengthen one , and all gain vigor .
Our system of government depends upon a balance of powers , not only among the tripartite administration , not only between the several states and the federal authority , but between the governed and the government .
Its bulwarks are in the First and Second Amendments .
The people have a right to criticize their government , and to replace it - severally or collectively - if necessary .
This makes the government responsive to the needs of the people .
In non-democratic political systems , the rulers are isolated from the citizenry .
The pain of the people is rarely the pain of the ruler , and since the ruler does not starve in the famine , or get shot in the war , or suffer abuse at the hands of the police , the ruler has no incentive to care about the needs and desires of the people .
In a democracy , the people can take the government to task , thus providing it with a genuine incentive to accede to their demands ; to listen to their needs ; to follow their suggestions .
The ballot is the strength behind our free press .
The press keeps us informed of government activity , and if the people are displeased with their elected and appointed officials , when election time rolls around , they can replace them .
But what , you might ask , is the strength behind the ballot ?
Ballots are only made of paper , and if the government really , truly , chooses to ignore them - to break the law - then what ?
We live in a society of law .
Few , if any , nations have a written constitution that binds all parties in the manner of our Constitution .
The Constitution outlines the duties and responsibilities of all parties - federal government , states and private citizens - to one another , and spells out how the balance is to be maintained .
This ultimate law was intentionally made exceedingly difficult to change .
Most laws contain an " enabling clause . "
That 's the part of the law that is n't the law itself , but which says , " we have the ability to enforce this law . "
As far as we private citizens are concerned , the " enabling clause " of the Bill of Rights is the Second Amendment .
The Second Amendment provides for a right of the people themselves to do three main things .
First , to defend their lives and property from those who would do them harm .
Second , to come to the assistance of the State in time of need , and third - and this is the " enabling clause , " to throw off , by force of arms if necessary , a tyrannous government .
Those who would weaken the right of Americans to posses , carry and use guns should appreciate that if they succeed , they will in the same act diminish a vital safeguard of citizen rights .
Those who believe that America will be a safer , pleasanter place if that right is diminished should carefully examine the actual causes of crime and violence , and appreciate that these causes are in no meaningful way connected with the presence or absence of arms among the people .
Those who believe that other nations - England , Canada , or Japan - have a program of gun prohibition that we might profitably emulate , should also understand that all other citizen rights in these nations are weak in direct proportion .
They might keep in mind that if First Amendment rights , or the right to trial by jury , or the right to counsel , or freedom of religion , were being discussed , they would likely find the policies of these nations reprehensible .
They would not be pleased to hear that these nations either do not have a constitution in any proper sense , or do not pay any attention to its provisions .
They would not caper with joy to find that every single right that they hold precious has been nibbled away , or did not exist in the first place , or is in the process of erosion to the same , exact degree as the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms . ( 3 )
The future of our nation is not certain .
Paths diverge in ways that we cannot foresee .
Actions have consequences that we cannot predict .
We have the oldest Constitutional democracy in the world .
It provides for a tremendous degree of freedom , and accepts a tremendous degree of risk .
It entrusts the people with power that no other government will tolerate .
Let those who would trifle with the magnificent machinery of our Republic take care that , by their ignorant meddling , they do not destroy the whole .
You Say You Want a Revolution ?
ON October 26 , 1774 , the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia to consider its response to " Intolerable Acts , " imposed by the British colonial authority .
The fifty - six delegates , representing every shade of political thought to be found among the American colonies - from the utmost conservatism to those of the radical firebrand - passed ten resolutions enumerating the rights of the colonists and their assemblies .
But , the colonial reaction was not confined to empty talk :
This is the most magnificent movement of all !
There is a dignity , a majesty , a sublimity , in this last effort of the patriots that I greatly admire .
The people should never rise without doing something to be remembered - something notable and striking .
This destruction of the tea is so bold , so daring , so firm , intrepid and inflexible , and it must have so important consequences , and so lasting , that I can't but consider it as an epocha in history !
- John Adams , Diary [ on the Boston Tea Party , December 17 , 1773 ]
In response to the Boston Tea Party the British Parliament dispatched General Thomas Gage , together with 4,000 troops , to the New World .
General Gage was made Governor of Massachusetts , and his troops were quartered on the populace .
Anticipating armed rebellion , the first move that General Gage made was to capture or destroy hidden stores of patriot guns and powder , and to arrest John Hancock and Samuel Adams .
On the night of April 18 , 1775 , Paul Revere , Billy Dawes and Samuel Prescott rode to warn the Lexington Minutemen that seven hundred British troopers were crossing the Lexington River , headed for Concord , to capture a rebel arsenal .
On their way to Concord , Revere and Dawes were arrested and held , but Prescott managed to escape .
In Lexington , seventy - seven Americans gathered on the village green to confront ten times their number .
As the British approached , the Minutemen opened fire ; the British responded , and in the resulting skirmish eight Americans were killed .
Meanwhile , Prescott had managed to carry the warning to Concord , where ringing churchbells called farmers and townspeople from their homes .
The Concord militia attacked a troop of British soldiers holding a bridge leading into the town , and from positions behind trees , stone walls , houses , barns and hillocks of earth , poured a withering fire into the British ranks .
The British retreated to Lexington , where they were met by reinforcements .
On their return to Boston , the British troops were harassed constantly by colonial snipers and suffered heavy losses .
The purpose of these hidden munitions , arsenals and secret hordes of powder and shot that General Thomas Gage so urgently sought , was to enable the American colonists to throw off the intolerable yoke of an unjust , incompetent , rapacious and punitive government .
What is a Right ?
Inalienable rights are those of which a man cannot divest himself by contract ; which he may not , under any circumstances , lawfully demit ; but he may forfeit them by crime , and be wrongfully deprived of them by others - Mark Hopkins , lecture , Lowell Institute , Boston , 1862
THE Constitution outlines two kinds of citizen rights , one natural and the other arising from society .
Natural rights are those that come with the condition of being human .
These are the rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
All people have a right to these things , and by implication , a right to resist infringement upon them .
A natural right , as it is understood in the Constitutional sense , can neither be conferred nor withdrawn .
It is innate , axiomatic , a thing that can only be recognized or ignored .
The Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights did not conceive of themselves as creating , but rather as guaranteeing , natural rights which they derived from the English tradition of Common Law .
The two most important rights , considered the cornerstones of a free people , were the right to own property and the right to keep and bear arms .
Political rights are those which do not come with the condition of humanity , but which are a function of living in human society .
These rights are more problematic , and the Constitution spent a good deal of time outlining them .
The right to vote , or have a trial by a jury , or to be able to post bail , or to bring a suit at law - these are not rights that are innate .
These are rights which have been established over a period of time , and which the Framers of the Constitution believed would make for a just and healthy nation .
Therefore , when we talk about rights , we are actually talking about two kinds of rights , which over time have become somewhat intermixed .
However , when push comes to shove , we get back to the basics : we have a right to live , and a right to defend ourselves against anyone who would take our life from us .
We have a right to freedom , and a right to resist anyone or any institution that would enslave us .
We have a right to own property , and to enjoy the fruits of our labor .
We have a right to protect our property and to keep it if someone tries to take it away unjustly or illegally .
These are the natural rights that are protected by the Second Amendment .
The political rights that are enumerated throughout the Constitution were deemed by the Founders to be essential for the protection of the natural rights .
The right to vote is a simple , non-violent weapon which in the hands of a well - informed , free electorate will prevent most injustice .
Our whole Republican form of government is a weapon against tyranny .
Freedom of speech will keep the electorate aware of what the government is doing .
Freedom from a State religion is a right that will prevent a terrible amount of social friction .
All the political rights are calculated to protect the natural rights , and to forestall the rise of tyranny and the consequent destruction of our nation .
Once political rights are acquired , they become part of the underpinnings of natural rights .
Since the first ten amendments to the Bill of rights were added to the Constitution , we have continually enlarged the concept of political rights .
Rights can expand , but they cannot contract .
With rights , as with living things , it 's grow or die .
Or , as Gibbon said , " All that is human must retrograde if it does not advance . " ( 4 )
At the time of the American Revolution , the American of Black African ancestry existed in some doubt as to his rights to full citizenship .
( 5 ) When the Fourteenth Amendment was passed , he cast off forever any doubt that he was a full citizen with all rights , duties and privileges of that condition .
Even though these rights were not acknowledged within the original Constitution , they exist now , and Black Americans are not going to lose the right to vote , to own property , to resist enslavement .
If anyone were to attempt to infringe upon or withdraw any of these rights , Americans of Black African ancestry - even though their grandfathers and great grandfathers did not enjoy any of the rights of citizenship - would have a right to appeal to all possible resources under the law and , those failing , to resort to force of arms .
The concept of both natural and political rights as inalienable is contained in the Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights of 1776 , which enumerates " certain natural , inherent and inalienable rights , amongst which are , the enjoying and defending life and liberty , acquiring , possessing and protecting property , and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety . "
And a real effort was made to carve these rights in stone .
Section 46 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provided : " The declaration of rights is hereby declared to be a part of the constitution of this commonwealth , and ought never to be violated on any pretense whatever . " ( 6 )
Much of what American Colonial thinkers conceived of as " natural rights , " and " natural law , " derives from De Iure Belli ac Pacis , a comprehensive work on the law published in 1625 in Paris by Hugo Grotius .
Another important source for the concept of rights is found in the seminal thinking of In The Leviathan , Thomas Hobbes outlined significant legal concepts , and discussed the concept of rights at length .
Hobbes posits a state in which the welfare of society - safety and civil order - are paramount .
The only right that Hobbes concedes is the right to self - defense , which he argues cannot be given , bargained or taken away .
Rights , therefore , can be divided into the two classes of natural and social .
A further definition of rights can be made according to the means by which they are obtained .
A natural right is inborn .
It can be recognized or unrecognized , but it exists and may be appealed to regardless of other circumstances .
A natural right can neither be taken or bestowed , nor can it be surrendered voluntarily or unwillingly .
A natural right is inalienable .
A right can be granted , but by the same measure , so can it be withdrawn .
The right to own property , for example , exists at the sufferance of the State and may be restricted , altered or taken away entirely as it serves or impedes the welfare of the State .
If an individual is said to own property , this is a semantic distinction which does not actually explain the relationship of the owner to the rest of society .
The State may tax the property and take it away if the tax is not paid .
The State may define who may and may not own property , and closely legislate what may be done on and with it .
The State may narrowly control the buying and selling of property , and prohibit some transactions and require others .
Thus , it might be said that there exists - and in this Hobbes fully agrees - no actual right to own property at all , but that the citizen holds property in trust for the good of the State .
If the good of the State conflicts with the desires of the citizen , the State takes precedence .
A right may be won , or lost .
Such rights as are won require unceasing vigilance for their preservation , as by their very existence they are a continual challenge to the sovereignty of the State .
The First Amendment enumerates rights that were created and maintained by conflict between the citizen and the State .
Such rights wax and wane , according to the times and the circumstances .
Hobbes did not accept the validity of such rights , as they threatened public safety .
The simplest definition of a right is that it is no more than what you can get and hang onto .
There are in reality no such things as inalienable rights , as demonstrated by the simple fact that they are alienated all the time all over the place .
Might , in no small sense , makes right , and the prudent citizen is well advised to be sure that he retains as much might - both political and physical - as he possibly can .
No person or institution takes anything away if it entails more risk than the confiscation justifies .
The concept of certain rights as axiomatic , that is , a universally recognized , self - evident truth , for which no proof is necessary , does not originate with political thinkers like Thomas Hobbes or John Locke , but they do find themselves in the position of having to find some inalienable attribute of even the most primitive human , within or outside society .
The rights that they at length conclude are axiomatic are those that they feel can neither be conferred nor withdrawn .
They can not be given up , and even the meanest slave or most backward savage possesses and enjoys them to the same degree as the monarch or wealthy citizen .
Thomas Hobbes , who concedes absolutely nothing in the way of rights or liberties of the individual , nonetheless admits of the right to self - defense :
For not every fear justifies the action it produceth , but the fear only of corporeal hurt , which we call bodily fear , and from which a man cannot see how to be delivered , but by the action .
A man is assaulted , fears present death , from which he sees not how to escape , but by wounding him that assaulteth him ; if he wound him to death , this is no crime ; because no man is supposed at the making of a commonwealth , to have abandoned the defense of his life , or limbes , where the law cannot arrive time enough to his assistance . ( 7 )
Hobbes qualifies this with the caveat of obligation to seek assistance and not to take the law into one 's own hands ,
But to kill a man , because from his actions , or his threatenings , I may argue he will kill me when he can , ( seeing I have time , and means to demand protection , from the Sovereign Power , ) is a crime . ( 8 )
John Locke finds that freedom of conscience and the freedom to worship God as one sees fit , are axiomatic :
... no man can give another man power ( and it would be to no purpose if God should ) over that over which he had no power himself .
Now that a man cannot command his own understanding , or positively determine today what opinion he will be of tomorrow , is evident from experience and the nature of the understanding , which can no more apprehend things otherwise than they appear to it than the eye see other colors of the rainbow than it doth , whether those colors be really there or not . ( 9 )
Religious worship being that homage which I pay to that God I adore in a way I judge acceptable to him , and so being an action or commerce passing only between God and myself , hath in its own nature no reference at all to my governor , or to my neighbor , and so necessarily produces no action which disturbs the community . ( 10 )
From what is premised I think will follow :
1 . That in speculations and religious worship every man hath a perfect , uncontrollable liberty which he may freely use , without , or contrary to the magistrate 's command , without any guilt or sin at all ... ( 11 )
What we have here presented as axiomatic , inalienable rights are , of course , the very foundation stones of the First and Second Amendments .
What is the Distinction Between a Right and a Power ?
Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
The government has powers .
Citizens have rights .
The government may confer powers on specific citizens , such as policemen to act as its agent .
The government may not , however , confer rights .
Citizens grant powers to the government , but government has no rights , except against other branches of itself .
What is the Law ?
MY understanding of Anglo - Saxon law is that at its center , it is not capricious .
It is based on three profound traditions : precedent , written rules , and rhetorical conflict .
It derives , ultimately , from the Babylonian tradition of formal legal contracts - a system of the utmost antiquity , antedating writing itself by a good five thousand years .
( 12 ) The concept of written laws arose from these contracts and disputes concerning them .
From this tradition , in turn , springs the Judeo - Christian tradition of encoded law , to which all who would do right refer , and by which actions are judged as correct or incorrect .
The third leg upon which our system of laws rests is the adversarial concept .
This is the very center of our own legal system .
It pits champions against one another before an impartial judge , and derives from the rhetorical devices of the ancient Greeks .
Written Law and Judgment are Based on Precedent
THE code of Hammurabi marks the departure from tribal custom administered by the headman .
The Babylonians relied on an actual written set of rules , to which all , without regard for class or status , were compelled to turn for justice .
It was the law of the State , not the family or tribe , arising out of the ancient concept of the written contract .
The center of the written law was precedent : tens of thousands of contracts and litigations stored in the temples over thousands of years .
The law was administered by judges and appeal was allowed .
The Bible , that cornerstone of American thought , presents the identical transition from headman administering tribal justice to formal judge administering written law .
As tribal leader , Moses handed down judgments among the people , each verbal case tried individually , based upon oral tradition and custom alone :
Exodus 18 : 13-20
And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening
And when Moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ?
why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
And Moses said unto his father in law , Because the people come unto me to enquire of God :
When they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
And Moses ' father in law said unto him ,
The thing that thou doest is not good .
Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
Hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee :
Be thou for the people to God-ward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God :
And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
Moses listened to his father in law , and at his earliest opportunity went up to Mount Sinai where he got clear , simple , written laws from God , conveniently carved in stone for future reference :
Exodus 24 : 12 And the Lord said unto Moses , Come up to me into the mount , and be there : and I will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments that I have written : that thou mayest teach them .
Absolutely none of this was lost on the Framers of the Constitution .
The original ten Amendments to the Constitution are the verso of the tablets handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai : the ten " Thou Shalt Nots " from God to the people are mitigated by the ten " Thou Shalt Nots " from the people to the State .
The Oresteia of Aeschylus ( 525-456 BC ) is a tale of the transition from the family as the fundamental social structure , and private revenge as a means of redress , to the ascendance of the State and submission to formal law .
The build - up is contained in the first two plays of the tragic trilogy , Agamemnon and Choephorae , and is resolved in the Eumenides , in which the Furies are transformed from private gods , avengers of family wrong , into public gods and protectors of the State .
The real lesson of the Eumenides is clearly that the old law of blood incessantly crying for more blood , which hitherto had been thought inescapable , must be superseded , and that Athens , mother of civilization , is the natural sponsor of the higher code .
Converted by Athena , the avenging Furies change their nature and become well - disposed . ( 13 )
. . . with their ancient office ( the protection of the sacredness of the blood tie ) not abrogated . . . but enhanced , since thenceforth they will punish violence within the polis , not only within the family . ( 14 )
The Adversarial Tradition
THE Western adversarial tradition stems from the Ancient Greeks , who discovered the power of language as creator of reality .
They had trouble with the idea at first , as we still do .
The charge against Socrates , for which he was sentenced to death , was that he made the weaker argument appear the stronger , and corrupted the youth .
Roman law was based on the Greek tradition of two skilled orators publicly arguing a case before judges .
The speaker with the best argument won .
Similarly , " the American criminal justice system , like the American political system , expects that justice will arise out of the conflict between various independent authorities . " ( 15 )
Two contending attorneys duke it out under the watchful eye of a judge .
A jury decides who made the better case , and the stronger argument carries the day .
Our entire system of government is based on the adversarial concept .
Each part of the government is pitted against the others , all keeping watch over all .
The executive , legislative and judicial vie for power , each kept from taking over by the jealousy of the other two .
The people and the government itself are also at constant odds , each trying to wrest the most power from the other .
This adversarial tradition is central to the way we thrash out how our society is to operate .
The Second Amendment is a vital buttress of this tradition , giving the people real power against the State .
Our nation has a long history of bitter dispute over basic legal , political and social issues .
Most of the time we 've managed to work it out through public debate .
The current dispute over interpretation of the Second Amendment falls within this fine old tradition , and this paper is part of the bloodless fray .
This is how our society works , and we like it that way .
Other societies are different , and their ways work fine for them .
When we look at other cultures and admire or dislike one part or another , we must be careful to remember that we can't take one aspect out and examine it in isolation , any more than one part of our own culture can be praised or condemned without considering the whole .
The Constitution is a Written Contract
THE Constitution is a written contract between the State and the citizen .
The actual blackletter of a contract is not generally set aside in favor of later or different interpretations .
The Constitution is not a suggestion of how things might be under ideal circumstances , or a starting - point for negotiation .
Contending parties may agree to re-write the contract , but one side may not do so unilaterally and expect the other party to continue to abide by its conditions .
Usually , when one party violates the letter and spirit of a contract , the other party may consider the bargain void , and negotiate for a new and better contract .
This is exactly what the Declaration if Independence is : the formal refusal to abide by a contract that has been abrogated by the other party , and a demand for a new relationship .
Just listen to the language :
When in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the Powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
. . .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing inevitably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
This is the aggrieved party saying , " you broke your side of the contract . "
Then , the various transgressions are enumerated :
To prove this , let Facts be submitted to a candid world .
He has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good .
. . .
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice , by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers .
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone , for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their salaries .
. . .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power .
And so on and so forth .
The Declaration goes on to indicate that the injured party has made a bona fide effort to come to the table , but has been snubbed :
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms :
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
It ends with the statement , " the deal is off . "
We , therefore , . . . solemnly publish and declare , That these United Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States ; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown , and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain , is and ought to be dissolved . . .
There .
Now that 's the way to dissolve a contract .
By 1790 a contract between the original colonies and their new government had been drawn up and agreed to .
All that remained was to append the theretofore neglected contractual statement that outlined the relationship of the private individuals who made up the States to their government .
What is expected of the citizen ?
What can the citizen expect from the State ?
What happens if there is a disagreement ?
What happens if there is a really serious disagreement ?
What guarantee does the citizen have if the State violates any part of its bargain ?
What powers does the citizen retain to ensure the fidelity of the State ?
This enumeration of citizen rights was added to the Constitution in 1791 .
Why do We Have a Written Constitution ?
It has been often doubted too , whether a written constitution has any superiority over one unwritten .
This is a point of comparison between the English constitution , and that of Virginia .
An unwritten constitution can , upon the appearance of a defect , be amended , without agitating the people .
A written one is a standing ark , to which first principles can be brought on to a test .
Whatever merit is due to either opinion , it should not be forgotten , that the sprit of a people will in construction frequently bend words seemingly inflexible , and derange the organization of power .
- Edmund Randolph , " Essay on the Revolutionary History of Virginia " ( circa 1809 - 1811 ) ( 16 )
THE precept of democracy is that of individual accountability within the framework of law .
The Framers of the Constitution were well - educated men .
They were steeped in the Classics , from which they derived an ideal of society .
The citizens of Athens devised a new system of government that looked to the citizens themselves .
Democracy , or " rule of the people , " worked reasonably well in the small city - states , but eventually broke down into " ochlocracy " or " rule of the mob . "
The flaw of the Athenian system lay in the ability of the assembly to make or change the very structure of law on a whim . ( 17 )
In the Republic Plato warned , " Democracy passes into despotism . " ( 18 ) What Plato meant by this was that if the people were all - powerful , the whim of the moment could persuade them to unjust , ill - considered acts which would in short order create chaos .
The resulting anarchy would cause the citizens to demand safety and order , to effect which they would elect or create a dictator .
The dictator would make it his first order of business to destroy his only real enemy , the aristocracy .
This accomplished , he would created and maintain a standing army , by which to enforce his will .
Once in the hands of the dictator , there would be no escape .
This , in short , is exactly what happened to Rome .
The democracy of our fledgling Republic recognized this danger , and compelled all democratically - arrived - at decisions to the scrutiny of a higher law - the Constitution - which was intentionally made extraordinarily hostile to tampering .
The English " constitution , " on the other hand , is largely unwritten .
It depends upon precedent modified by a constant process of interpretation .
Much of the constitution is no more than legal history , that is to say , it has been developed by the courts as part of the general body of common law .
Though this flexibility may be considered a virtue , the fact that there is no written reference allows the British parliament to commit the errors of the ancient Greeks .
Parliament is supreme , with no check or limitation save what can be found in precedent .
What Can and Cannot be Done by Those Who Disagree with the Law
INTERPRETATION of the law relies on precedent : how has the law been applied in the past ?
What were the intentions of the lawmakers themselves ?
Americans who dislike guns , for whatever reasons , are welcome to dislike guns as much as they please .
They may not , however , entertain the conceit that their dislike of guns provides a sound basis for infringement of a fundamental Constitutional right .
They may not cite the way things are done elsewhere as a sound basis for interpretation of the Bill of Rights .
They may not pick out one part of the Second Amendment that they like and let the rest go where it may .
Those who most strongly favor gun prohibition must reconcile the legal precedent for the Second Amendment , as well as the legislative intent of the Framers of the Constitution , with their desire to see the American people deprived of arms .
I do not believe this is possible .
Their only recourse is the repeal or re-writing of the Second Amendment , in which I wish them the joy of their endeavor .
" As Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted in reference to criticism of the privilege against self - incrimination as an obstacle to the needs of law enforcement in an era of rampant crime : ' If it be thought that the privilege is outmoded in the conditions of this modern age , then the thing to do is to take it out of the Constitution , not to whittle it down by the subtle encroachments of judicial opinion . ' " ( 19 )
Arma virumque cano .- Virgil , The Aeneid , Book One , line 1 . ( 20 )
OUR Founding Fathers based many of their decisions on how to organize the new nation 's government on the examples of Ancient Greece and Rome , and the historical example - provided to the Colonial citizen by Edward Gibbon 's ( 1737 - 1794 ) Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire - of gradual destruction of the Roman Republic .
When discussing the intent underlying the Constitution and Bill of Rights , we must consider the examples of Athens and Rome , and realize that the loss of freedom and rise of dictators were of the utmost concern to the classically - educated framers of our early government .
Our Founding Fathers took pains to avoid repeating the errors of the Ancient Greek and Roman Republics .
They believed that with the fall of the Roman Empire , mankind slipped into a slough of darkness , only gradually to emerge into the daytime of the Enlightenment .
They intended to do everything in their power to prevent such another decline of Western civilization .
Aristotle - the author of the Athenian Constitution - warned , in Politics , that a characteristic of tyrants was " mistrust of the people ; hence they deprive them of arms . " ( 21 )
The Founding Fathers were familiar with the myth of Prometheus , creator and friend of Mankind .
When Zeus , the king of the gods , resolved upon destroying the human race and replacing them with other beings , Prometheus alone concerned himself with their fate .
He stole fire from Olympus and brought it in a hollow reed to Mankind , thus conferring on his creatures the power to resist the tyrant Zeus .
The parallel between fire in a hollow reed and firearms in the Second Amendment is so obvious that I scarcely need draw it .
The framers of the Constitution knew that the people needed a defense against an otherwise all - powerful State .
Not merely a bulwark of words , as provided for in the First Amendment , but one of action , as well .
Without the Second , the First is " bricks without straw . "
( 22 ) Weak , liable to crumble , likely to wash away .
English Antecedents for the Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights
DURING and after the Revolution , the loosely allied States were governed by the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation , which delegated severely limited powers to the central government , and reserved the rest to the states .
The lack of central authority , combined with economic chaos and political confusion , spurred the call for a convention to consider a new form of government .
On September 17 , 1787 , a new Constitution was drawn up , and was ratified by all the States of the Union by May 29 , 1790 .
The Constitution outlined the machinery of government , defining the relationship of the central government to the Several States , and of the States to each other , but did not address the issues defining the relationship of those governments to their individual citizens .
To remedy this , the first Ten Amendments to the Constitution were adopted in 1791 .
They were patterned on the British " Bill of Rights , " of 1689 , which we should examine before proceeding .
The Declaration of Right
A cornerstone of English Constitutional history , the Declaration of Right - known also in England as the Bill of Rights - is not as well known as it might be .
On the 13th of February , 1689 , a committee of the Commons presented these fundamental principles of Constitution to the prince and princess of Orange , afterwards William III and Mary .
This " Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject , and Settling the Succession of the Crown , for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties " is remarkably similar to the American Bill of Rights , for which indeed it provided the model .
Its seventh provision - heavily circumscribed and religiously biased though it may be - is undoubtedly the immediate ancestor of our own Second Amendment , and the strong foreshadowing of other elements of our Bill of Rights is plain to see .
The first part of the statute listed the abuses of Charles II and James II :
(5) By raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace , without the consent of parliament , and quartering soldiers contrary to law .
(6) By causing several good subjects , being Protestants , to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law .
The second part of the Bill of Rights " created laws to prevent recurrence of the abuses .
It affirmed that the right to bear arms ( like other rights ) was not being created or granted by government , but had always been a traditional right of Englishmen : " ( 23 )
(1) That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal .
(2) That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority , as it hath been assumed and exercised of late , is illegal .
(3) That the commission for erecting the late court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes , and all other commissions and courts of like nature , are illegal and pernicious .
(4) That levying money for or to the use of the crown , by pretense of prerogative , without grant of parliament , for longer time or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted , is illegal .
(5) That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king , and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal .
(6) That the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace , unless it be with consent of parliament , is against law .
(7) That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions , and as allowed by law .
(8) That elections of members of parliament ought to be free .

The Magna Carta
ANTICIPATING this document , and of equal if not greater importance in the history of rights of individuals as against the State , is the Magna Carta , granted on the 15th of June , 1215 at Runnimede by King John , surnamed " Lackland " ( 1167-1216 ) , to the English people .
These are laws that the king himself must obey .
The king signed them at sword 's point , not at all happy about it .
The king reneged on his bargain , and by force of arms was compelled again to treat with his subjects .
He died - tradition has it that the cause was a surfeit of peaches - on the 19th of October , 1216 .
In the main , the Magna Carta is concerned with money , and the various rotten ways that Bad King John was squeezing the people to get it .
Incidentally , it delves into matters of administration of justice , and outlines the ideals of good government .
The Magna Carta contains three significant contributions to our concept of government : first , that the king could not levy taxes without the consent of a representative of the people .
Second , that he could not imprison a free man or deprive him of his property except by the judgment of that man 's peers or the law of the land .
Third , it contains the exceedingly important idea that the king is not above the law , and may be compelled to obey it by the same means that any other person is compelled to obey the law : by force .
This third concept is contained in Chapter LXI , which provides for the execution of the royal promises , and what is to happen if the king does not abide by them .
LXI : Inasmuch as , for the sake of God , and for the bettering of our realm , and for the more ready healing of the discord which has arisen between us and our barons , we have made all these aforesaid concessions , - wishing them to enjoy for ever entire and firm stability , we make and grant to them the following security : that the barons , namely , may elect at their pleasure twenty five barons from the realm , who ought , in all their strength , to observe , maintain and cause to be observed , the peace and privileges which we have granted to them and confirmed by this our present charter .
In such wise , namely , that if we , or our justice , or our bailiffs , or any one of our servants shall have transgressed against any one in any respect , or shall have broken some one of the articles of peace or security , and our transgression shall have been shown to four barons of the aforesaid twenty five : those four barons shall come to us , or , if we are abroad , to our justice , showing to us our error ; and they shall ask us to cause that error to be amended without delay .
And if we do not amend that error , or , we being abroad , if our justice do not amend it within a term of forty days from the time when it was shown to us , or , we being abroad , to our justice : the aforesaid four barons shall refer the matter to the remainder of the twenty five barons , and those twenty five barons , with the whole land in common , shall distrain and oppress us every way in their power , - namely , by taking our castles , lands and possessions , and in every other way that they can , until amends shall have been made according to their judgment .
Saving the persons of ourselves , our queen and our children .
And when amends shall have been made they shall be in accord with us as they had been previously .
And whoever of the land wishes to do so , shall swear that in carrying out all the aforesaid measures he will obey the mandates of the aforesaid twenty five barons , and that , with them , he will oppress us to the extent of his power .
And , to any one who wishes to do so , we publicly and freely give permission to swear ; and we will never prevent any one from swearing .
Moreover , all those in the land who shall be unwilling , themselves and of their own accord , to swear to the twenty five barons as to distraining and oppressing us with them : such ones we shall make to swear by our mandate , as has been said .
And if any one of the twenty five barons shall die , or leave the country , or in any other way be prevented from carrying out the aforesaid measures , - the remainder of the aforesaid twenty five barons shall choose another in his place , according to their judgment , who shall be sworn in the same way as the others .
Moreover , in all things entrusted to those twenty five barons to be carried out , if those twenty five shall be present and chance to disagree among themselves with regard to some matter , or if some of them , having been summoned , shall be unwilling or unable to be present : that which the majority of those present shall decide or decree shall be considered binding and valid , just as if all of the twenty five had consented to it .
And the aforesaid twenty five shall swear that they will faithfully observe all the foregoing , and will cause them to be observed to the extent of their power .
And we shall obtain nothing from any one , either through ourselves or through another , by which any of those concessions and liberties may be revoked or diminished .
And if any such thing shall have been obtained , it shall be vain and invalid , and we shall never make use of it either through ourselves or through another . ( 24 )
This chapter creates a committee of barons , to which , if the king or any of his servants do something wrong , complaint may be made .
The barons , in turn , are to make complaint to the king .
If within forty days the wrong is not redressed , the committee of barons has the power to seize land and property of the king , or to obtain justice in any other way possible .
They must not , however , kill the king , the queen , or their children .
As it happened , this clause was required immediately .
In granting the citizenry the right to force the king to respect and obey the law , Chapter LXI comes very close indeed to our Second Amendment .
There is a reason that this clause is in the Magna Carta : without it - without the underpinning of force of arms - the entire document would be " a scrap of paper . "
( 25 ) The Second Amendment is in the Constitution for a similar reason .
Blackstone as Interpreter of English Common Law
WILLIAM Blackstone ( 1723-1780 ) , through his Commentaries on the Laws of England ( 1765 ) , became the arbiter of English common law .
His work was intimately familiar to every Colonial jurist .
He was a great admirer of the Magna Carta , and through him its principles were elucidated and discussed in Revolutionary times . ( 26 )
Blackstone conceded that the rights that the barons claimed for themselves , they claimed for the nation at large .
Thus , the Magna Carta was regarded by the Framers of the Constitution as giving equal rights to all Englishmen .
At the time of the American Revolutionary War , we were Englishmen , too .
Blackstone specifically discussed the right of " the subject , " by which he meant any Englishman , to have arms for his personal defense as well as to resist " the violence of oppression . "
The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject , that I shall at present mention , is that of having arms for their defense , suitable to their condition and degree , and such as are allowed by law .
Which is also declared by the same statute 1 W. & M. st. 2 c. 2 . and is indeed a public allowance , under due restriction , of the natural right of resistance and self - preservation , when the sanctions of society are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression . ( 27 )
In his May 13 - 15 , 1776 , notes of the debates of the Continental Congress John Adams quoted a Mr. Wilson citing the precise section of the Magna Carta as justifying the rebellion :
In Magna Charta , there is a Clause , which authorizes the People to seize the K[ing ] 's Castles , and opposes his Arms when he exceeds his duty .
The appeal - all else failing - contained within the Magna Carta to force majeure is exactly what the Second Amendment is all about .
Lacking this ultimate resource - the physical capacity to compel a wayward government to hearken and act as the people demand - the balance of the Bill of Rights means nothing .
Legislative Intent Behind the Second Amendment
DEBATE surrounding the adoption of the Second Amendment is noteworthy for its scarcity .
Two quite contrary conclusions may be drawn from this : one , that it was of no great importance , added as an afterthought , just something to be gotten through .
Another , and more likely explanation , is that the Framers were in such profound accord on this matter that debate was entirely unnecessary .
But , a reliable index of intent can be gleaned from what the Founding Fathers said and wrote about guns .
Amateur gunsmith Thomas Jefferson had a handsome collection of pistols and long guns , and wrote to his fifteen - year - old nephew , " A strong body makes the mind strong .
As to the species of exercise , I advise the gun .
While this gives moderate exercise to the Body , it gives boldness , enterprise and independence to the mind .
Games played with the ball , and others of that nature , are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind .
Let your gun therefore be the constant companion on your walks . " ( 28 )
I must say that it pleases me no end to imagine the reaction that the anti-gun thinker must have when he is compelled to accept that the men who framed the Constitution were near to religious in their reverence for firearms .
They thought guns were swell , and went on and on about the contrast between America and degenerate Europe and England where the leaders were " afraid to trust the people with arms , " and that Americans need have no fear of their own government because of " the advantage of being armed , which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation . " ( 29 )
As Jefferson said in a letter to George Washington , " One loves to possess arms . "
( 30 ) George Washington seems also to have loved to possess arms , for he had a collection of fifty , and in his own writings he talks about them frequently in the most laudatory terms . ( 31 )
James Monroe believed that " the right to keep and bear arms " was a " basic human right " that he proposed be amended into the Constitution . ( 32 )
Patrick
Henry said , " the great object is , that every man be armed .
. . .
Everyone who is able may have a gun . "
( 33 ) Patrick Henry and George Mason were appointed co-chairmen of a committee to draft a Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution .
Mason was selected because he and Richard Henry Lee kicked up a fuss because a Bill of Rights had not been part of the original Constitution , and the two of them are responsible for a compromise which allowed the Constitution to be ratified by the Several States on the condition that a Bill of Rights would follow immediately .
George Mason felt that the English monarch 's intention to " disarm the people ; . . . was the best and most effectual way to enslave them . "
( 34 ) Lee , no less concerned with the individual right to arms , wrote in Letters From the Federal Farmer , that " to preserve liberty , it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike , especially when young , how to use them . " ( 35 )
To secure ratification of the Constitution , the Federalists had committed themselves to the addition of " further guards for private rights . " ( 36 ) To this end , the Federalists put forward Madison , the leading and most ardent supporter of the original Constitution in Congress , to draft the proposed amendments .
Madison 's own notes on his proposal reflect the ultimate organization of the Bill of Rights ; his notes on the amendments , in which the right to arms appears very early , state that the amendments " relate first to private rights . "
( 37 ) Equally corrosive of the exclusively state 's right view is the original organizational scheme revealed by Madison 's notes .
Not conceiving the idea of simply appending the whole set of amendments to the Constitution as a separate document ( today 's " Bill of Rights " ) , Madison intended to attach them to , or after , each section of the original Constitution to which they related .
Had he viewed the right to arms as merely a limitation on article I , section 8 's provisions concerning congressional control over the militia , he would have inserted in section 8 immediately after clauses 15 and 16 .
Instead , he planned to insert it with freedom or religion , of the press and various other personal rights in section 9 , immediately following clause 3 , which establishes the rights against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws .
Surely the amendment was understood by Madison 's congressional colleagues as guaranteeing an individual right .
For instance , Madison 's proposals that " the rights of conscience , of bearing arms [ etc. ] . . . , are declared to be inherent in the people . "
( 38 ) In addition , two written interpretations on the proposed amendments were available to the members of the first Congress .
The first , and more authoritative - by virtue of having received Madison 's imprimatur - was a widely reprinted article by his ally and correspondent Tench Coxe .
Having discussed the first amendment , Coxe moved on to describe the second in unmistakably individual rights terms :
As civil rulers , not having their duty to the people duly before them , may attempt to tyrannize , and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country , might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens , the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms . ( 39 )
A similar interpretation appears from Anti-Federalist editorials .
Samuel Adams , who had taken the modified Anti-Federalist position of conditioning ratification upon the addition of a guarantee of personal rights , had proposed in the Massachusetts Convention that " the said constitution be never construed . . . to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms . ( 40 )
Though this is telling , the wealth of debate that reveals the inner workings of other Constitutional provisions is lacking .
We may therefore successfully consult legislation that immediately preceded , as well as legislation that immediately followed the enactment of the Second Amendment .
The Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights enumerates sixteen rights of citizens , and is immediately followed by the Plan or Frame of Government for Commonwealth or State of Pennsylvania , which enumerates 46 provisions for the structure of the state .
Passed in Convention on September 28 , 1776 , and signed by Benjamin Franklin , as president of the Convention , it anticipates the Constitution and Bill of Rights of the United States .
In this document , article XII contains provisions incorporated into the First Amendment :
That the people have a right to freedom of speech , and of writing and publishing their sentiments : therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained . ( 41 )
Immediately following this , as is also the case with the Bill of Rights , is article XIII :
That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state ; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty , they ought not to be kept up ;
And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to , and governed by , the civil power . ( 42 )
As if to emphasize the acceptance of the armed citizen as good and normal , Article VIII , which states " That every member of society hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life , liberty and property , and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expense of that protection , and yield his personal service when necessary , or an equivalent thereto . . . " makes particular provision for one who because of conscience , cannot be a part of the militia : " . . .
Nor any man who is conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms , be justly compelled thereto , if he will pay such equivalent . . . " ( 43 )
Just as Articles XII and XVI found themselves combined into the First Amendment , so did Article XIII and the concept of militia service find themselves combined in the Second .
As I discuss below ( Origins of Liberal Anti-gun Sentiment ) , the idea of exempting conscientious objectors was discussed in the process of framing the Bill of Rights , but was dismissed as a possible ploy for disarming citizens who had no such objection .
The provision that a citizen could pay someone else to serve for him if his conscience forbade bearing arms also did not make it into the Bill of Rights , though it was proposed .
An examination of this document reveals much of the original hashing - out of the Constitution and Bill of Rights .
It is much wordier and legalistic than its successor , but makes abundantly plain what such men as Thomas Paine - one of its framers - intended when they pared it down to the more elegant form which followed .
Not only do the Constitution and Bill of Rights contain whole phrases taken bodily from the Pennsylvania document , but the telling phrase " the people have a right " and other specific references to individual rights , recurs throughout , and particularly when there might be any doubt that these are rights reserved to individual citizens as against incursion by the State .
When the Constitution came up for ratification , both Pennsylvania and New Hampshire kicked up a big fuss about the absence of a Bill of Rights .
On December 12 , 1787 , Pennsylvania proposed 15 amendments containing guarantees for individual rights :
The amendments proposed by the Pennsylvania minority bear a direct relation to those ultimately adopted as the federal Bill of Rights .
Indeed , eight of the first 10 amendments were first suggested as amendments in the proposals of the Pennsylvania minority .
These include the following Amendments ultimately adopted : the First ( freedom of conscience , speech , and press -Pennsylvania 's proposed amendments 1 and 6 ) ; Second ( Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 7 ) ; Fourth ( Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 5 ) ; Fifth ( privilege against self - incrimination and right not to be deprived of life , liberty or property ' except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers '- Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 3 ) ; Sixth ( right to speedy and public jury trial , to accusation and confrontation , and counsel - Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 3 ) ; Seventh ( Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 2 ) ; Eighth ( Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 4 ) ; and Tenth ( Pennsylvania 's proposed amendment 15 ) . ( 44 )
New Hampshire ratified the Constitution on June 21 , 1788 , thus bringing it into effect .
Though the ratification occurred without a successful demand that a Bill of Rights be included , the New Hampshire Ratifying Convention had recommended 12 proposed amendments .
The first nine were taken almost verbatim from those proposed by Massachusetts .
The last three were added by the New Hampshire drafting committee : 10 ) No standing army without a three - fourths vote and a ban on troop quartering ( the latter the first official state recommendation of what became the Third Amendment ) ; 11 ) ' Congress shall make no laws touching Religion , or to infringe the rights of Conscience ' ( the first official state recommendation of the freedom of conscience guaranteed by the First Amendment and , most important , the first use of the actual prohibitory language with which the First Amendment starts - a vast improvement , from a legal point of view , in the language of the freedom of religion guarantee ) ; 12 ) right to bear arms ( the first official state recommendation to protect the right guaranteed by the Second Amendment ) . ( 45 )
On June 27 , 1788 , the Virginia ratifying committee also insisted upon amendments protecting basic individual rights as a condition for ratification . "
( 46 ) Article 17 , later adopted as the Second Amendment , is as follows :
That the people have a right to keep and bear arms ; that a well - regulated militia , composed of the body of the people trained to arms , is the proper , natural , and safe defense of a free state ; that standing armies , in time of peace , are dangerous to liberty , and therefore ought to be avoided , as far as the circumstances and protection of the community will admit ; and that , in all cases , the military should be under strict subordination to , and governed by , the civil power . ( 47 )
The Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 forms a precedent for all succeeding " Bills of Rights , " and holds the singular distinction , followed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights of the United States , of being superior to all other laws within the state .
It went through a number of drafts , but the first version in the handwriting of George Mason , stood substantially unchanged .
In it , the antecedent of the Second Amendment finds an early form :
Article 12 : That a well - regulated Militia , composed of the body of the people , trained to arms , is the proper , natural , and safe defence of a free State ; that Standing Armies , in time of peace , should be avoided , as dangerous to liberty ; and that , in all cases , the military should be under strict subordination to , and governed by , the civil power . ( 48 )
Thomas Jefferson 's draft of the Virginia Constitution makes clear that he considered an individual right to keep and bear arms an indispensable mark of freedom .
Under " Rights Private and Public , " he enumerates :
No freeman shall be debarred the use of arms [ within his own lands or tenements ] ( 49 )
The First Militia Act ( 1792 ) opens a further window to the legislative intent of Congress .
In this Act , the " militia " spoken of in the Second Amendment is clearly defined to include the entire able - bodied military - age male citizenry of the United States , and required each of them to own a personal firearm .
Richard Henry Lee in Additional Letters From The Federal Farmer ( 1788 ) made it abundantly clear that no mistake should be made : " A militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves . . . and include all men capable of bearing arms .
. . .
To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms .
. . "
Cut it any way you want to , you still end up with a Constitution and Bill of Rights which was framed by men who unequivocally felt that every American citizen had the right , the privilege , the honor and the obligation to possess pistols , rifles and shotguns - all weapons which were fully current at the time .
The opponents of the plain meaning of the Second Amendment may wriggle and squirm as much as they wish , but there 's no way around it .
English common law , and its descendant , American common law , make much of legal precedence and legislative intent .
Unless some way can be contrived to make an exception of the Second Amendment , its plain meaning must be honored in law and in spirit .
THE SECOND AMENDMENT ITSELF
A well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .
THERE are many good and sufficient reasons why the citizenry of a healthy Republic should be armed , all of which are expressly contained within , implied by , or beneath the penumbra of , the Second Amendment .
None of these excludes the others .
Indeed , they work together to make a strong fabric of legal purpose .
The Framers of the Constitution recognized the necessity of an armed populace , and incorporated that fundamental right into the Bill of Rights .
The Second Amendment recognizes that :
The citizen has a natural and inalienable right to self defense and to the means of self defense .
The possession of arms distinguishes the free man from the slave .
The possession of arms breeds independence , self - respect and civic responsibility .
An armed citizenry reduces the incidence of criminal activity .
The armed citizen is not compelled to rely upon the assistance of the State for all protection .
The armed citizen forestalls the rise of a tyrant from within the State .
A citizenry accustomed to the use of arms and provided with their own personal weapons can come to the assistance of the State as a militia , either to subdue domestic turmoil or to repel a foreign invader .
The Second Amendment is not an Archaism
I am unprepared to accept that parts of the Constitution may be dismissed as vestigial archaisms , perhaps valid in the eighteenth century , but no longer of any relevance to our modern day .
The first ten amendments were proposed and adopted largely because of fear that Government might unduly interfere with prized individual liberties .
The people wanted and demanded a Bill of Rights written into their Constitution .
The amendments embodying the Bill of Rights were intended to curb all branches of the Federal Government in the fields touched by the amendments - Legislative , Executive , and Judicial .
. . .
In construing other constitutional provisions , this Court has almost uniformly followed the precept . . .
' It is never to be forgotten that , in the construction of the language of the Constitution . . . , as indeed in all other instances where construction becomes necessary , we are to place ourselves as nearly as possible in the condition of the men who framed that instrument .
. . .
I cannot consider the Bill of Rights to be an outworn 18th century ' straight jacket ' as the Twining opinion did .
Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some .
And it is true that they were designed to meet ancient evils .
But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few at the expense of the many .
In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted , enforced and respected so as to afford continuous protection against old , as well as new , devices and practices which might thwart those purposes .
I fear to see the consequences of the Court 's practice of substituting its own concepts of decency and fundamental justice for the language of the Bill of Rights .
. . .
To hold that this Court can determine what , if any , provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced , and if so to what degree , is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution .
- Justice Black , expressing a dissenting opinion in Adamson v California 332 us 46 ( 1947 )
The whole trend of The Enlightenment was toward recognizing the significance of the individual as a valid participant in the political process .
Individual responsibility for action and belief is the heart of the Protestant faith ; a logical consequence of these concepts is that the citizen becomes the monitor of the State .
The Third Amendment , Though Infrequently Invoked , is not by that Standard Obsolete
THE Third Amendment provides that
No soldier shall , in time of peace , be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by law .
The Third Amendment is sometimes cited - in company with the Second - as an old - fashioned garment which we could easily discard .
This is a dreadful misunderstanding .
The reason that soldiers do not come into our houses , eat up our food , insult our womenfolk and spy on our daily activities is because it is forbidden by the Constitution , by the Congress , and by the people .
People tend to forget pain when the pain is no longer with them .
They forget what caused the pain , and may even lightly dismiss the dangers that surround them simply because they are not at that moment suffering .
They take chances that they should n't , get hurt , and wish they 'd been more careful .
But , by then it 's too late .
Nothing would be more convenient for a repressive regime than to have soldiers living among - living in the very homes of - a suspect group .
If the government could do so without fear of censure or retribution , you may be sure that soldiers would be quartered among and upon people in potential trouble spots .
Think of the Third Amendment as a kind of lightning rod that we all have on our houses .
Should we tear it off just because we have n't been struck by lightning recently ?
If we dismiss the lightning rod as useless , have we not completely failed to grasp the function of a lightning rod ?
A lightning rod safeguards your house from destruction by lightning : if your house has not been destroyed by lighting , it means that either 1 ) there has n't been any lightning around for a while or 2 ) the lightning rod has been doing its job .
In either case , you 'd have to be some sort of lunatic to take off the lightning rod simply because your house has n't been demolished by lightning .
I fail to see the virtue in the " it 's old so lets toss it in the trash " line .
The Third Amendment follows the Second with good reason , just as - for equally good reason - the Second follows the First .
No less a menace than rioters or outlaws was the pillaging soldier , loosed not only on foreign populations but in his own country for political , religious , or social reasons or because of the King 's inability to pay and thus to control him .
Generally speaking , there was no difference in character among rioters , felons and soldiers - who were often one and the same .
Often the soldier was a common criminal inducted directly out of jail and unleashed on the King 's enemies , whether foreign or domestic .
The perpetration of such outrages upon his critics by Charles I engendered the Petition of Right of 1628 and helped eventually to bring him to the headsman .
But of innumerable such examples that might be cited from European history in this period , probably the one most remembered by eighteenth century Englishmen and Americans would have been the persecution that drove the Huguenots to their shores by the thousands .
As a modern historian has noted , among the numerous tribulations visited in the 1690s upon the Huguenots in order to compel them to convert ,
'. . . the most atrocious - and effective - were the dragonnades , or billeting of dragoons on Huguenot families with encouragement to behave as viciously as they wished .
Notoriously rough and undisciplined , the enlisted troops of the dragoons spread carnage , beating and robbing the householders , raping the women , smashing and wrecking and leaving filth . . . [ Barbara W. Tuchman , The March of Folly , 21 ( Alfred A. Knopf , 1984 ) ]
As Englishmen and Americans were well aware from their readings of Bodin , Beccaria and Montesquieu , the Huguenots had been rendered incapable of resisting either individually or as a group by the Continental policy of disarming all but the Catholic nobility . " ( 50 )
The Third Amendment is one of those rare examples of a law that everybody agrees is a good one , and that everybody obeys .
( 51 ) Scarce as hen 's teeth .
The Fourth Amendment , against unreasonable search and seizure , flows inevitably from the Third :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
These same soldiers , so obnoxiously quartered on the citizens , were also the means by which the Crown sought to police the increasingly rebellious populace .
During the 1760s and early 1770s England dispatched ever - increasing numbers of troops as the Stamp Act was added to the Navigation Acts , and then succeeded by the Townshend Acts , the Tea Tax , etc .
These soldiers ( eventually operating under a specially appointed British Customs Board ) executed both ordinary warrants and the notorious Writs of Assistance under which they made wholesale searches of vessels , homes , vehicles , and warehouses , perusing goods , documents and records , all in a tumultuous process in which even those things not seized were often destroyed along with the surrounding furnishings . ( 52 )
In short , not only are these rights phrased in substantially identical terms ( the first , second and fourth amendments all speak in terms of " rights of the people " ) , but their roots , and the situations in which they were visualized as operating , are closely identified . ( 53 )
Despite Antique References , the Seventh Amendment Is not Obsolete
In suits at common law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved , and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States , than according to the rules of the common law .
ANYONE who tried to seize upon the archaic " where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , " and from that construct an edifice which denied the validity of the Seventh Amendment , would not get too far .
The courts look at the literal wording , the original spirit and intent , and continue to enforce its clear dictate with no palaver about " twenty dollars " cluttering up the issue at hand .
Though courts sometimes give constitutional rights additional scope in order to effectuate what is deemed to be their original intent , courts have no authority to reduce or eliminate the plain terms of a constitutional guarantee because they disagree with that intent or view it as obsolete . ( 54 )
This refusal to arrogate to itself the power to delete the provisions of the Constitution is clearly expressed in the case of State of Oregon v. Kessler ( 1980 ) in which the court acknowledged its responsibility to accept the intent of the drafters of the Constitution :
We are not unmindful that there is current controversy over the wisdom of a right to bear arms , and that the original motivations for such a provision may not seem compelling if debated as a new issue .
Our task , however , in construing a constitutional provision is to respect the principles given the status of constitutional guarantees and limitations by the drafters ; it is not to abandon these principles when this fits the needs of the moment . ( 55 )
In this the court bowed to the dictate of Alexander Hamilton who firmly stated in the Federalist Papers , Number 78 , what courts may and may not do regarding legislation :
[ T ]he right of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void . . . [ does not ] by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power .
It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both ; and that where the will of the legislature declared in its statutes , stands in opposition to that of the people declared in the constitution , the judges ought to be governed by the latter , rather than the former . ( 56 )
An Armed Populace Demands the Respect of its Government , and Intimidates the Aspiring Tyrant
I am not here to argue that guns are not dangerous , though indeed they are not so dangerous as many would like to think .
Guns are dangerous , and that is their purpose .
In the hands of the American public , guns are an inexpensive , highly effective form of insurance against the excesses of government , and against the rise of a tyrant .
They serve , from time to time , to chasten an overweening authority and dish out a generally tonic lesson in humility , something that all governments profit from when they lose sight of their proper function .
The Second Amendment is a vital part of the system of checks and balances that has made our system of government so durable .
Just as an armed citizenry discourages violent crime , so does it discourage the greatest enemy of Democracy , a rapacious government .
Among other evils which being unarmed brings you , it causes you to be despised .

Immediately after the disarming of the Japanese peasantry , the sword - wielding Samurai class was given the right to " kill and depart . "
To complete the humiliation and terror of the upstart peasant , any who failed to render appropriate subservience to his social better could be struck down on the spot and left to welter in his gore .
This technique worked very well indeed .
The neck of the Japanese people has grown to love the yoke for which it was fitted it in the sixteenth century . ( 58 )
Government respects strength and despises weakness .
Nothing illustrates this so well as Harry Hopkins ' account of the " Big Three " meeting at Yalta toward the end of the Second World War .
Churchill is reported to have told the other heads of state that the Pope had suggested that a certain course of action would be right .
Stalin is reputed to have indicated his disagreement by asking , " And how many divisions did you say the Pope had available for combat duty ? " ( 59 )
The right of revolution is an inherent one .
When people are oppressed by their government , it is a natural right they enjoy to relieve themselves of the oppression , if they are strong enough , either by withdrawal from it , or by overthrowing it and substituting a government more acceptable .

If they are strong enough .
There you have it .
If the people are weak , in resolve , in expression or in arms , they must endure oppression .
The logical response when the First Amendment rights are outlined is , " Where 's the beef ? "
Right there in the Second Amendment .
The Second Amendment is the " enabling clause " of the original ten amendments to the Constitution .
In order for a law to work , it must be enforceable .
Within the structure of a body of law there is contained , either implicitly or explicitly , something that gives the law some teeth .
The enabling clause of the Magna Carta was Chapter lxi , which provided the Barons with the right to use physical force against the king or his representatives if they disobeyed the law .
When a policeman arrests a suspected criminal , the force employed is a legal use of force .
What the framers of the Constitution provided with the Second Amendment was the legal use of force to compel the State to obey the law .
Succeeding amendments are " self enabling . "
The Thirteenth Amendment , for example , is in two sections .
Section one is the amendment itself , followed by section two , which states , " Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . "
This gist of this clause is repeated in the Fourteenth , Fifteenth , Eighteenth , Nineteenth , Twenty - third , Twenty - fourth and Twenty - sixth Amendments .
The Second Amendment exists to forestall the rise of tyranny .
The balance of power between the government and the governed should be equal .
All the might should not be on one side .
Power corrupts , and an all - powerful government will become corrupt .
If the citizen can confront his government with force of arms , it is that much more difficult for the government to become corrupt and tyrannous .
The Founding Fathers regarded occasional " challenge from below , " as good for a government .
As Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to James Madison on January 30 , 1787 ,
I hold it , that a little rebellion , now and then , is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical .
And in a letter to William Stevens Smith on November 13 , 1787 ,
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants .
It is its natural manure .
To paraphrase William Safire , those in authority should occasionally be taught a lesson in humility .
Government must not view itself as god - like , omnipotent , omniscient , omnipresent and eternal , because it is n't .
Occasional suffering teaches an arrogant government to respect its constituency , and refreshes the collective mind that though government is not perfect , it is perfectible .
If citizens are at the mercy of their government , they strive to protect themselves when injustice is perceived by creating , from among themselves , tyrants and demagogues .
A secure citizenry is much less influenced by rabble - rousers .
The operative word within the Second Amendment is " free . "
If the Second Amendment were to have been framed without that word , thus :
A well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of the State , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .
It would clearly outline a responsibility of the citizen to the State , similar to the obligation expressed and defined in Chapter xvi of the Magna Carta .
XVI : No one shall be forced to do more service for a knight 's fee , or for another free holding , than is due from it .
Chapter XVI declares that those who owe military service for their lands shall not be called upon to perform more than the due amount of that service .
This provision , protecting the citizen against a punitive or excessive military obligation , is quite distinct from Chapter LXI , which empowers the citizen to compel the king to honor his agreements , by force of arms if necessary .
Since , however , the Second Amendment indeed contains the word " free , " two things become inescapable : first , that the Second Amendment was intended to reserve a right of citizens to protect themselves against possible incursions by the State itself and second , that the purpose of this Amendment was to keep the State itself free .
Free from foreign aggression , no doubt ; free from domestic insurrection , probably ; but free from the most dangerous eventuality likely to confront the fledgling Republic - the rise of internal demagogues and despots - certainly .
To entrust the welfare of the State to the State itself is , on its face , nonsense .
To safeguard the State by entrusting its welfare within the body of the people themselves is plainly the legislative intent .
Caesar had his Brutus ; Charles the First his Cromwell ; and George the Third [ " Treason ! " cried the Speaker ] - may profit from his example .
If this be treason , make the most of it .
- Patrick Henry , Speech on the Stamp Act , House of Burgesses , Williamsburg , Virginia , May 29 , 1765 .
Citizens should be armed in order to counter the dangers of a professional , king - making army , unresponsive to any branch of government ( see clause 6 of the Declaration of Right , above ) .
The interests of the military and the interests of a democracy are often in conflict .
If one side has all the words and the other side has all the guns , in the event of controversy the well - organized , armed party will probably prevail .
This happened in Ancient Rome , and it could happen here .
The professional army , particularly the Praetorian Guard , became the kingmakers of Rome , even going so far as to elect a dictator from among their number .
Therefore , the framers of the Constitution provided for a citizen army , as in the early days of the Roman Republic .
What the Second Amendment says is this : in order to throw off the yoke of tyranny , we need a citizenry that 's able to form an army .
In order to do that , we have to make sure that the guns are n't all on one side ( the tyrant 's ) but evenly distributed among the populace .
This will serve two useful ends : first , we 'll have citizens who can , on short notice , become competent soldiers if we need them .
Second , they 'll have enough clout to intimidate the potential tyrant so that we might not even need to bring out the militia in the first place .
An armed citizenry is its own best excuse , if you follow my drift . ( 60 )
If we go beyond the models provided by Britain , and examine the broad Classical foundation of the Constitution , we can make a good case that the intent of the Second Amendment was not so much to resist an aggressor , or to topple a tyrant , as to prevent the rise of a tyrant in the first place .
We see therefore that the " well - regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , " is not so much designed to prevent the invasion of King George as to forestall the rise of King George Washington .
This interpretation is entirely valid in the light of the model of ancient Rome and its decay and the thorough understanding of the problems of a new Republic in the light of the old .
Nothing is in the Constitution for No Reason
ANY contention that the Second Amendment is present in the Bill of Rights by random accident , and is not there because it enumerates rights of the citizen vis-a - vis the State is deeply unconvincing .
The right of the citizen to keep and bear arms is enumerated in the Bill of Rights , immediately after freedom of speech and religious worship , because it is of the greatest importance , and its precepts were elemental to earlier English documents with similar aims .
I am unprepared to accept that the framers of the Constitution , so perspicacious in other regards , took a casual attitude toward these first ten amendments to the Constitution .
In Richfield Oil Corp. v State Bd. of Equalization , Justice Douglas , recounting a dictum of Chief Justice Marshall , stated , " it would be dangerous in the extreme to infer from extrinsic circumstances , that a case for which the words of [ the Constitution ] expressly provide , shall be exempted from its operation . " ( 61 )
The Second Amendment Applies to Both the Federal Authority and to the States
THE argument that the Second Amendment is applicable only to federal authority , and not to the states , is exactly the sort of weasel wording used in bygone times to slip around the demonstrable intent of the framers of the Constitution .
This is the argument that in times past was also leveled against the First Amendment , and is as invalid now as it was then .
The Fourteenth Amendment clearly states ,
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
The Fifteenth Amendment , which has been found so elastic as to stretch the First Amendment to cover the Several States and all localities within them , extends the strictures binding the Federal Authority to bind the States , as well .
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude .
Should , therefore , the Federal Authority recognize the fundamental right to self - defense expressed by Thomas Hobbes and recapitulated in the Federalist Papers , the sundry restrictions imposed by the various States , counties and municipalities would be swept away with one breath .
The celebrated case of Heart of Atlanta Motel , Inc. v United States ( 1964 ) which outlawed private discrimination in public accommodations held that Congress had " ample power " to overturn state and local laws when they came into conflict with the precepts of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .
In a similar case , the State of South Carolina held that the reserved powers of the state were encroached upon by the 1965 Voting Rights Act .
In South Carolina v Katzenbach ( 1966 ) the Court held that the Fifteenth Amendment gave Congress broad powers to " use any rational means to effectuate the constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting . "
What 's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander .
I would like to see the logic of these cases applied to the Second Amendment .
The Second Amendment Reserves a Right of the People as Individuals
FROM the founding of our nation through the middle of this century , the general legal understanding of the Second Amendment has been that it guaranteed every law - abiding citizen the right to possess most ordinary weapons . ( 62 )
Coincident with the Warren Supreme Court ( 1953 - 1969 ) , a period distinguished by otherwise sweeping liberalization of the rights of the individual , somehow the Second Amendment ran afoul of an anti-gun mentality which sought to divest the individual of his arms in favor of an interpretation that guaranteed the right as extending only to the Several State 's right to arm formal military units .
( 63 ) Contrary to the general trend , this States ' Rights , anti-Second Amendment stance was eagerly embraced by those who should have most been outraged by it - the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Bar Association .
The measure that the Second Amendment exists solely " in furtherance of a well - regulated militia , " i.e. , whether it serves the State , not whether it serves the individual citizen is the official position of the American Civil Liberties Union , as outlined in a letter to me on June 11 , 1993 . ( 64 )
The Framers of the Constitution did not differentiate between the citizens right to bear arms for the purpose of self defense and for the purpose of serving the needs of the State , and it is a flight of legal fancy to distinguish between them on Constitutional grounds .
It is absurd to construe the Second Amendment as having no relevance outside of service to the welfare of the state , since a central function of the Second Amendment is forestall the extermination , enslavement and abuse of citizens by their own government .
Furthermore , the Second Amendment contains the telling words , " right of the people . "
The Constitution makes careful use of these words , and any reading which interprets them other than contained in the plain legislative intent is wrong on its face .
When the Bill of Rights uses the phrase " the people , " or " the right of the people , " it refers to the right of the people as distinct from the right of the States .
No slight - of - hand can separate the identical phrase in the First Amendment , the Fourth Amendment and the Ninth Amendment from that found in the Second .
No legerdemain can pretend that the Tenth Amendment does not clearly outline a separation of powers among the United States , the States themselves and the people .
I cannot imagine the logical process that contrives to construe that the phrase " right of the people " actually means " right of the States " in this Amendment only , while freely admitting that any such reading , if applied to the First Amendment or to the Fourth would be utterly grotesque .
I encountered this same pitiful logic in a book that was kicking around the house when I was a boy .
In it , the author strained to prove that every time the Bible used the word " wine , " it actually meant " grape juice . " ( 65 ) Even at the age of seven I was unconvinced .
Even a child can see through this sort of shabby rhetoric , and I find myself astonished and ashamed that any responsible , well - educated American - such as members of the American Bar Association or the American Civil Liberties Union - could seriously expect such a painfully contrived conclusion to pass unremarked .
If the matter were not so serious , it would be comic .
The Second Amendment does not Secure a Collective Right to the Exclusion of an Individual Right
MANY otherwise staunch defenders of the Constitution and Bill of Rights support an interpretation of the Second Amendment which " guarantees nothing to individuals , [ and ] protects only the state 's right to maintain organized military units . " ( 66 )
The American Civil Liberties Union was founded by Roger Baldwin in 1920 as a primary defender of the First Amendment .
In no time flat , it became the champion of the whole Bill of Rights , with the notable exception of the Second Amendment .
To be sure of the ACLU 's position , in April of 1993 I wrote them and asked them to tell my what the ACLU official position actually was .
On June 8 , 1993 , I received a reply from Rita Buland , speaking for ACLU Public Education :
As you know , the amendment states that " A well - regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . "
The ACLU agrees with the Supreme Court 's longstanding interpretation of the Second Amendment as set forth in the 1939 case , U.S. v Miller : that the right to bear arms applies only to the preservation of a " well - regulated militia . "
Except for police and military purposes , we believe that the possession of weapons by individuals is not constitutionally protected . ( 67 )
I have enclosed a copy of our policy on gun control . ( 68 ) As you can see , there was a period of time just after the adoption of this polity when the ACLU affirmatively supported gun cont
The sun soaked nation of Algeria has a good idea and they are running with it .
They plan on building massive solar thermal power plants , using all the energy they need and exporting the rest to Europe .
Even though they are Africa ’s second largest nation they are more than 4/5ths desert , with an estimated solar resource able to power all of Europe 60 times over .
This idea has been a long time coming .
Finally construction has started on Algeria ’s first solar power plant at Hassi R’mel , 260 miles south of the capital Algiers .
This hybrid plant will use both solar energy and natural gas to generate 150 megawatts .
Of that , 25 megawatts will be from solar .
This plant is the first of its kind worldwide , and will be online by 2010 .
Algeria has ambitious plans of producing 6000 MW of solar power for export to Europe .
“ Our potential in thermal solar power is four times the world ’s energy consumption so you can have all the ambitions you want with that , ” said Tewfik Hasni , managing director of New Energy Algeria , or NEAL , a government run company created in 2002 to promote renewable energy .
Algeria ’s plans involve running undersea cables to Spain and Italy some time around 2010 - 2012 and with Europe ’s lofty goal of getting 20 % of its energy from renewable sources this prospect may only become more financially feasible as old European economies groan under the struggle of shifting gears to renewable energy .
Algeria ’s plans to go solar make it unique among OPEC nations .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been a strong supporter of Algeria ’s efforts and said that it would “ bind France and Algeria ” in a “ Mediterranean Union ” , witch has lead some to believe that France will finance the undersea cables to get that solar energy to Europe .
The Hassi R’Mel plant is the first of four solar plants planned .
It plans on using natural gas to power the plant when it is cloudy or at night when there is no sun .
Currently 125 out of 150 MW is produced by natural gas , so Algeria has not gone too far astray from its fossil fuel past ( the exports of which produce $ 54 billion for the country last year ) .
In the future as natural gas becomes more and more expensive it is likely that they will rely more and more on solar .
Algeria faces some serious financial and technological hurdles to overcome and they themselves say it will be at least ten years before they start making any profits .
BAGHDAD , Oct 10 ( Reuters ) - Car bombs , assassinations , kidnappings , mortar attacks and suicide bombers aside , it 's convoys of private security guards hurtling through Baghdad streets that strike fear into many Iraqis .
Incensed with the involvement of a U.S. security firm in the killing of 17 civilians at a busy Baghdad junction last month , Iraqis were again furious after guards from another foreign company shot dead two women in a car on Tuesday .
But the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki came in for almost as much criticism as the foreign guards .
" As long as the state is weak and cannot impose its control on the security situation , so the security companies will act freely in the streets , " said a man , giving his name as Muhanad .
" All this is linked to the power of the government .
The government 's only obsession is to protect itself and its friends while the Iraqi citizens can go to hell .
The citizen is the victim , that 's the truth , " he said .
U.S. defence officials says contractors in Iraq serve critical roles that free U.S. troops for other duties .
But senior U.S. officers , including the chief of staff for U.S. forces in Iraq , have said some contractors do over - react .
Iraq says there are more than 180 mainly U.S. and European security companies in the country , with estimates of the number of private contractors ranging from 25,000 to 48,000 .
Many Iraqis see them as private armies who can shoot and kill civilians with impunity .
The firms are immune from Iraqi law under a 2004 ruling issued by the U.S. - led authority that ruled Iraq after Saddam Hussein was toppled a year earlier .
When a convoy of heavily armed sports utility vehicles approaches , lights flashing , guards atop bristling with guns , drivers veer quickly aside and hit the brakes .
They are all too aware of the dangers .
" Of course I 'm afraid .
You can't see anything but their guns pointing at people .
Maybe they will open fire randomly and we will be killed , " said a man , who gave his name as Hasan .
" The security companies are wrong and endanger peoples ' lives . "
SHOOT FIRST
A U.S. congressional report said this month that U.S. security firm Blackwater has been involved in 195 shooting incidents since 2005 and shot first in 84 percent of them , despite a contract agreement to use force only in defence .
Adopting the high - profile , strong - arm approach to driving through the Baghdad streets brings its own dangers as convoys are then hit by insurgents hoping to kill a VIP passenger .
" The situation is not safe because the companies are also targeted in the streets , but what did the people who were killed in the car do wrong ? " said Hasan .
Iraq wants Blackwater to pay $ 8 million to each of the 17 families who lost loved ones in the Sept. 16 shooting in Baghdad .
Blackwater says it acted " appropriately " in that incident after its convoy came under small - arms fire .
Private security contractors in Iraq are now the subject of several U.S. reviews .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had ordered tighter controls on Blackwater , including putting cameras on their convoys .
However Maliki has said Blackwater has no future in Iraq , and a government spokesman has also accused the guards in Tuesday 's incident of an " unprovoked " attack .
The company involved said it deeply regretted the incident and that a vehicle had failed to stop despite warnings .
The buzz and whine of the small helicopters used by Blackwater is a daily reminder the company is still very much out and about on Baghdad 's streets .
" We look at the security companies as a mafia , not as security companies working to make the situation more secure for the people , or even the delegations they are guarding , " said a man , who gave his name as Kasi .
" Even the Iraqi government can not impose its control .
People run away from them , they are afraid to cross the street in front of them .
This is a horror , not a security patrol , " he said .
" Even the guards during the Saddam era did not behave in this way . "
Barrel - mounted cameras are n't exactly revolutionary , but it 's not everyday that you see the boys in blue sporting one on their sidearm .
Nevertheless , Orange County 's sheriff 's emergency service team and the Newburgh Police Department will reportedly " be the first groups to test the pistol cam , " which would record audio and video whenever the weapon was removed from its holster .
According to Chief Eric Paolilli , it 'll be implemented if trials prove that there are no safety / functionality issues associated with it .
As it stands , the state has set aside $ 35,000 in order for the device to be adequately tested , and if everything goes smoothly , Newburgh officers could soon be rocking the camera ( and creating footage for COPS ) as part of their standard equipment .

Foreign - trained doctors are helping to staff our health system , but is it ethical to recruit from developing nations ?
British Columbia desperately needs more doctors , and many of them are not being delivered from UBC or Canada 's other faculties of medicine .
Traditionally , the majority of the province 's international medical graduates ( IMG ) have come from the U.K. , but now the number of IMGs arriving from the developing world is increasing .
They may be drawn to our relatively safe and stable society and arrive in search of a better life for themselves and their families .
But when they depart the developing world , they often leave behind insidious health - care problems like the AIDS epidemic and contribute to dire doctor shortages .
We 've reaped the benefits of this mobile brain trust for decades .
IMGs fill gaps in the province 's health - care coverage and compensate for the herds of Canadian - trained doctors moving to the U.S. 's more profitable pastures .
But despite the fact that the vital role IMGs play in the Canadian health - care system is beyond dispute , controversy surrounds the doctors who desert the developing world , especially if they are recruited .
In a report released last January , the Canadian Policy Research Networks ( CPRN ) –an Ottawa - based independent think tank that creates research to guide those who craft social and economic policy –looked into this .
It agreed there was a serious issue of moral principles to be confronted .
Attempts to restrict the immigration of doctors from the developing world may seem ethical , but such actions might raise questions about the right of people to chart their own life courses .
Carla Fast , a Brazil - trained nephrologist living in Vancouver , hopes to secure a position this year in the provincially funded IMG residency program at St. Paul 's Hospital .
Each year , more than 100 IMGs compete for the 18 positions – 12 in family medicine and six in medical specialties –but Fast is optimistic nonetheless : the number of positions has tripled from the six offered in 2005 .
" It 's not discouraging anymore , " she told the Georgia Straight .
" Now you see people getting in , so that 's a major change . "
Fast , 40 , arrived in Vancouver 12 years ago planning to do a few years of medical research at UBC before returning home .
But then she met her future husband , experienced B.C. life , and ultimately decided to settle in Vancouver .
The mother of a two - year - old , Fast said , " I can offer my son things here that I 'd never be able to offer in Brazil in this lifetime . "
She has returned to Brazil to practise medicine , but only temporarily , and that experience just affirmed her life - changing decision .
" It 's an unstable country and not a safe country , " said Fast , who grew up in a barred house surrounded by an electric fence .
" Criminality has gone up ” ¦you have corruption in the police force . "
As a board member of the Association of International Medical Doctors of B.C. ( AIMD BC ) , Fast is just one of 400 international grads who have banded together to ensure that IMGs are integrated equitably into the health - care system .
The organization has gained momentum since it launched in 2003 and is now a key player in high - level discussions on the topic .
In January , AIMD BC representatives met with B.C. Health Minister George Abbott to propose solutions to the province 's medical - doctor shortage .
At the forefront of the advocacy efforts is association president Alfredo Tura , the chief resident of the IMG–B.C. program at St. Paul's .
Becoming a physician in Canada is " a long struggle " , according to Tura .
Upon departing Italy with a medical degree a decade ago , he retrained as a nurse on Vancouver Island in order to gain employment in the medical field .
Today , at 35 , he 's nearing his goal .
" It 's my dream to be a resident in family medicine here , " he said on the phone from the Comox Valley , where he was on an elective - residency rotation .
The CPRN's January report , called The Ethical Recruitment of Internationally Educated Health Professionals , says Canada has always relied on IMGs but that the origins of these doctors are changing .
The proportion of doctors arriving from Asia and Africa is increasing , while the proportion arriving from Europe and the U.S. is decreasing .
The report says it is inappropriate for wealthy nations like Canada to deal with their own health - resource issues by relying on developing countries .
It also says better planning is needed for self - sufficiency .
Canada 's harnessing of medical brainpower from the developing world " opens up huge ethical issues " , said Dr. Margaret MacDiarmid , president of the B.C. Medical Association , on the line from Trail .
" It all depends whether you 're looking at it as if you 're a citizen of Vancouver , B.C. , Canada , or the world . "
Trail is a regional centre in B.C. 's West Kootenays , and MacDiarmid practises family medicine there alongside IMGs .
" Lots of foreign - trained physicians have come , " she said , listing doctors from South Africa , China , Nigeria , and even the U.S. " It 's not always easy to get a Canadian to move to a smaller town . "
Recruitment agencies attempt to balance the tendency for Canadian - trained doctors to settle in cities by encouraging IMGs to settle in rural areas .
But IMGs in B.C. affect worldwide doctor - distribution trends .
World Health Organization data show that global imbalances are staggering .
Canada , with only 2.14 doctors per 1,000 people , does n't measure up to Italy 's 4.20 , Sweden 's 3.28 , or the U.S. 's 2.56 .
But Canada 's ratio far exceeds Libya 's 1.29 , Brazil 's 1.15 , and South Africa 's 0.77 per 1,000 .
André Jaquet , former South African High Commissioner to Canada , brought the issue of doctor brain drain into the limelight on February 7 , 2001 .
" All our rural areas are hopelessly understaffed , some sections of different hospitals have to close , and people are waiting a long time for medical treatment , " he told CBC Radio .
Jaquet estimated that South Africa–the richest nation on the African continent –was short 3,000 doctors ; a few years later , a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 1,750 South African doctors were practising in Canada .
The 2005 study , aptly titled The Metrics of the Physician Brain Drain , found that 15,700 doctors , totalling almost a quarter of Canada 's doctor work force , were IMGs , and that 40 percent of these doctors were from " lower - income nations " .
The study also compared doctor swapping between four recipient countries –Canada , the U.S. , the U.K. , and Australia–and found that Canada was running a doctor deficit due to the 9,000 Canadian doctors who had moved south .
When B.C. –trained doctors move to the U.S. , the province loses out on an investment in medical brainpower .
But this is meagre compared with investments made by many lower - income countries .
" Many developing nations invest proportionately much more of their resources in the training and development of health professionals , " the CPRN report noted .
Fast , for example , was trained at a federally funded university in Brazil .
" For six years of med school , I did n't pay a thing , " she said .
But she does n't believe education subsidies should oblige doctors to practise in any particular location .
" You leave your country for different reasons .
It 's a big move , a very important decision , and it's not easy ” ¦but people should be able to move , " she said .
Tura 's reasons for immigrating were both personal and professional .
As a young adventurer , he fell in love first with the B.C. coastline and second with the Canadian concept of a family doctor who looks after patients from birth to old age .
" That role is lost in many other countries , including Italy , " he said .
Though Tura was not from an underserviced country himself , he said many IMGs found that immigrating to Canada raised personal ethical dilemmas .
He said many aspire to give back to their home nation and many do , returning with supplies , medicines , and practical know - how to share .
The CPRN report dubs reciprocity , or giving back , as a " best practice benchmark " of ethical recruitment , but notes that the subject raises controversial questions , including who would be responsible for providing it and what form it would take .
Another area rousing ethical debate is the case of the student - visa doctors .
They come to Canada for specialist training on their government 's tab , and many decide to stay despite a contract obliging them to return to their country of origin .
Last January , the Medical Post magazine published excerpts from an April 2006 letter from the Libyan Embassy in Ottawa that said Libya invests $ 500,000 in each of these students and asked licensing authorities to refuse to license them .
But when the Medical Post contacted nine provincial and territorial licensing authorities , only the licensing colleges in B.C. and Manitoba said they would not license such students .
Despite the firm ethical standpoint of the College of Physicians & Surgeons of B.C. , deputy registrar Dr. Elliott Phillips does sympathize with the students .
He told the Medical Post that their circumstances raise the question of what " sort of obligation they really have to that country after eight or 10 years of postgraduate training elsewhere " .
Patrick Coady , executive director of AIMD BC , said the licensing of these doctors shows a lack of ethical judgment on the part of many provinces .
He said it shows that " if you 're desperate enough for doctors , then you 'll compromise your ethics . "
The licensing of these doctors also affects IMGs because vacant positions become filled by the visa doctors–and at no cost to the province , he said .
" So there is a reason why some provinces are interested in doing this .
It 's not just that they 're desperate ; it 's that they 're saving a lot of money . "
There 's no win–win solution to these ethical dilemmas .
Recruitment is a complicated topic .
The very definition of the word is debatable , and medical recruiters in this country are a diverse group .
Some agencies , like Physicians Canada , are nationwide and fee- based , while others , like Health Match BC , are provincewide and government - funded .
Professional recruitment activities range from advertising in international medical journals to attending medical conferences to inviting IMGs to visit underserviced communities .
Big money is often spent on recruiting doctors .
A Saskatoon StarPhoenix article from 2003 , for example , said the Saskatoon Health Region spends $ 750,000 each year on recruitment activities , including paying doctors ' moving expenses , and giving them grants to establish practices and interest - free loans for house payments .
Some recruitment agencies have codes of ethics to guide them through the controversial waters they constantly navigate , but the CPRN report says there is one clear - cut ethical blunder : poaching doctors from developing countries .
Even though many members of AIMD BC are from developing countries , the grassroots association agrees .
" I do n't think it 's right to actually go recruit in other [ developing ] countries , " Carla Fast said .
AIMD BC 's efforts to support IMGs in Canada may actually undermine its own position .
Coady said the easier it is for IMGs to be integrated into the health - care system and the more supports that are available , the more foreign doctors will be tempted to make the move .
" And some of those doctors are going to be coming from developing nations , but we 're not actively recruiting .
We 're not even passively recruiting . "
Perhaps the same logic applies to the IMG–B.C. residency program : if more positions become available , more IMGs may arrive in the hopes of gaining one .
Rodney Andrew , the IMG–B.C. program director , said the province has been criticized for accepting South African doctors , " but you ca n't discriminate .
The people who come here come on their own volition .
We do n't recruit them , " he said .
" They come here for a variety of reasons , mostly because they 're looking for a better life for themselves and their children . "

The Web site can be accessed by a doctor in India as easily as by one in Ontario .
But when it comes to actively recruiting from developing countries , Health Match BC has taken the ethical high road .
The agency 's director , Ethel Davis , told the Straight that it has never recruited from developing countries .
According to Davis , Health Match BC has also never recruited in South Africa , although she said there is still a chance that South African doctors have been attracted to B.C. because the agency advertises in international journals .
Developing an effective policy on ethical recruitment would be " extraordinarily complex " , the CPRN report warns .
Made in Canada guidelines would be a good start but no quick fix .
" Codes of conduct and policy statements are only as strong as the will to conform to them , " the report notes .
Health Match BC's
Web site says it is recruiting in the U.S. , England , and Scotland .
Medical graduates from these countries may be able to practise immediately upon arrival in Canada .
" You 're going to want to try to ensure that you 're able to promote opportunities to people who are eligible to work in British Columbia , " said Davis of the target countries .
The College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia , which licenses 100 to 150 IMGs each year , says on its
Web site that a fast - tracked route to practise is more likely for doctors from English - speaking countries with histories , cultures , and educational systems comparable to Canada's .
When IMGs launch straight into practice , they ease the doctor shortage at a much lower cost to the province than training a Canadian or putting an IMG whose credentials are not recognized through a residency .
Each resident in the IMG–B.C. residency program costs the province about $ 180,000 over the course of the two - year program , Andrew said .
Canada could n't possibly accept all medical degrees at face value .
Some foreign training programs are four years long , while others are eight ; some are book - based , while others integrate patient contact ; and most screen students before training them , while others do post - degree student screening .
Dr. Jim Thorsteinson , executive director of the BC College of Family Physicians , supports more IMGs being integrated into the system but believes foreign embassies should be clearer about the barriers that many foreign - trained doctors face .
" The people coming through there are excellent , " he said of the IMG–B.C. program .
" [ But ] they need to be fully informed . "
Credential barriers often limit IMGs to working in fields outside of medicine .
When asked about the reality of IMGs driving taxicabs , Thorsteinson said , " It 's a waste . "
Increasing the number of IMG residency positions and extending the college 's list of acceptable foreign medical schools are among the recommendations that AIMD BC made to Health Minister Abbott in January .
The association 's foremost recommendation , however , was for B.C. to employ IMGs as " clinical assistants " , a position that would allow IMGs to work as doctors under temporary licences .
" We should n't keep those people behind a counter selling coffee , " Fast said .
Estimates on the number of Canadians without a family doctor range from one million to four million .
Nadeem Esmail , health director for the Fraser Institute , says relying on IMGs to fill human - resource gaps is a shortsighted solution .
" It 's very nice to pull in a fully trained doctor , but in a way it 's irresponsible of Canada , because we know we 're turning away Canadian students at the medical schools , " he said .
In September , 256 undergraduate students will enter UBC 's medical school .
This number falls short of meeting our province 's need for 400 more doctors annually , as estimated by the B.C. Medical Association .
In the unlikely event that they all stay in B.C. , there would still be a 144 - doctor shortfall in their graduating year .
" The optimal solution to Canada 's shortage is obviously to remove restrictions in training , practicing , and pricing , and to introduce user charges , " says a " Fraser Alert " from last August .
" The current system is simply not working , " Esmail said .
MacDiarmid also believes that Canada should aspire to self - sufficiency , but regarding the Fraser Institute 's proposed tuition deregulation , she said : " I would be worried that only people from certain socioeconomic groups would have the opportunity to be doctors . "
IMGs whose credentials are not recognized by the college also encounter financial obstacles on their path to practise .
Fast wrote two costly national exams and a language - proficiency test , and had " endless documentation " translated and notarized .
If and when she gets licensed , she plans to tabulate all these expenses–but she 's not ready to pull out her calculator just yet : " It would be too depressing .
My government invested so much in my education , and I 'm still not a fully licensed doctor , " she said .
But at least the wheels are in motion .
In July , she will write an exam that could gain her one of 35 available positions in a three - month clinical - assessment program .
Her performance during this program could make or break her chance to earn a residency position .
But even a solid performance would not guarantee her a position .
As a resident , Tura is working tirelessly toward his future as a Canadian doctor .
He has signed a return - of - service agreement obliging him to work in an underserviced community for two years upon graduating next year .
He chose to work in the Comox Valley and looks forward to the placement .
" I think that for us [ IMGs ] , we wanted to help out with the medical - doctor shortage , " he said .
" So I think we are just keeping our promise . "
As the once - mighty dollar continues to wane , it 's proving a source of both risk and opportunity for investors .
The dollar 's long slide has become a fixture of financial markets in recent years .
Against the currencies of a broad group of trading partners , the dollar now stands at its weakest point in more than a decade .
The situation is even more dramatic with certain individual currencies .
Earlier this month , the dollar hit a modern - day nadir versus the Canadian dollar and a 26 - year low against the British pound .
This past week , it touched a fresh record low against the euro .
One euro now buys roughly $ 1.48 compared with just $ 1 five years ago .
Meanwhile , last week a new factor emerged to weigh on the dollar : talk that oil - rich nations in the Persian Gulf , which have pegged their currencies to the dollar for years , are reconsidering those arrangements .
Another Down Week
The dollar 's recent slide is part of a broader worrisome mix that includes slowing economic growth and soaring oil prices and mortgage - related turmoil at financial institutions .
These factors helped send both the Dow Jones Industrials Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 1.5 % last week .
For the year to date , the Dow industrials are up 4.2 % and the Nasdaq , up 7.5 % .

Boomerang is a programming language for writing lenses — well - behaved bidirectional transformations — that operate on ad - hoc , textual data formats .
Every lens program , when read from left to right , describes a function that maps an input to an output ; when read from right to left , the very same program describes a " backwards " function that maps a modified output , together with the original input , back to a modified input .
Lenses have been used to solve problems across a wide range of areas in computing including : in data converters and synchronizers , in parsers and pretty printers , in picklers and unpicklers , in structure editors , in constraint maintainers for user interfaces , in software model transformations , in schema evolution , in tools for managing system configuration files , and in databases where they provide updatable views .
The best way to get started with Boomerang is to download our system and work through the examples in the first few chapters of the manual .
Many more details can be found in our research papers .

多 段SSHの話。
2010-03-08 OpenSSH 5.4 以降のnetcat mode ( ssh - W host : port ... ) を使えば、ncコマンドは不要かも。
2010 - 11-08 zsh
でNo such file or directory と言われるのは、これが原因かもhttps://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1494
正攻法でこたつにアクセスするには下図のようなSSHアクセスを繰り返さなければならない、といった状況があるとする。
uchi ----> otonari otonari ----> genkan genkan ----> kotatsu
uchi$ ssh otonari otonari$ ssh genkan genkan$ ssh kotatsu kotatsu$ echo yatto tsuita
もう少しイメージがわきやすいように注を加えるとこうなる。
自社NW │ 他社NW │ 他社NW │ の踏み台 │ の内部セグメント ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ uchi -│-> otonari │ │ otonari -│-> genkan │ │ genkan ----> kotatsu
これを、下図のように、ダイレクトにこたつに入れるようにするには、どうするのがスマートだろうか？
uchi -((-> otonari ----> genkan -) )-> kotatsu
答えはこうだ :
$ cat ~/.ssh / config
Host kotatsu ProxyCommand ssh genkan nc -w 10 kotatsu 22 Host genkan ProxyCommand ssh otonari nc -w 10 genkan 22 Host otonari User hirakegoma Port 7650
これで、
uchi$ ssh kotasu howareyou atatatakainari
のように直接こたつにアクセスすることが可能となる。
ただし、前提として、各ホストでncコマンド ( netcat , The GNU Netcat ) が使える必要がある。（ncコマンド以外でも、connect.cなど、同様なもので代替可能である）
ポイントは 、ProxyCommandでsshコマンドの引数として指定するホスト名は、ほかのHostキーワードで定義したものが使える、という点である。（冷静に考えるとこれは当然である。なぜなら、ProxyCommandはローカルで実行されるのであるから）
今回の例で はProxyCommandを使用しているのはkotatsuとgenkanの2段だが、この仕組みを利用すれば、幾重にもProxyCommandを重ねてどこまでも遠くへゆくことが可能となる。（たとえば、kotatsuの先にある、todana、oyatsuなど）
さて、直接アクセスできることの利点を考えると、先にみたように対話的なSSHログインがコマンド1つでできる他に、
scpやrsync -e sshでのファイルコピーが簡潔にできるようになる。 中継ホスト ( otonariやgenkan ) に一時コピーをする必要がない 。
rdiffを使い、uchiとkotatsuとの間でファイルの差分の確認をするのが簡潔にできるようになる。
といったものもあげられ、局面によっては大変、有益だといえる。
BRISBANE ( Reuters ) - Australia ’s incoming Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , a Mandarin - speaking former diplomat , has pledged closer ties with key friends and allies after sweeping away 11 years of conservative rule under John Howard .
Rudd , 50 , presented himself as a new generation leader by promising to pull around 500 frontline Australian troops out of Iraq and sign the Kyoto Protocol on climate change , further isolating Washington on both issues .
“ To our friends and allies around the world , I look forward as the next Prime Minister of Australia to working with them in dealing with the great challenges which our world now faces , ” he told cheering supporters at a victory party late on Saturday .
“ We extend our greetings tonight to our great friend and ally the United States , to our great friends and partners across Asia and the Pacific , and to our great friends and partners in Europe and beyond . ”
The surge to Labor left Howard battling to win even his own parliamentary seat , which he has held since 1974 , putting him in danger of becoming the first prime minister since 1929 to lose his constituency .
“ King Kevin the new conqueror , ” said the Sun - Herald newspaper in Howard ’s home town of Sydney on Sunday .
“ It ’s Labor in a Ruddslide ” , said the Australian national newspaper .
At least four and possibly six government ministers , including Howard , looked likely to be ejected after a swing of more than six percent across the nation , bringing only the sixth change of government since World War Two .
Election analyst Antony Green predicted Labor would win up to 86 seats in the 150 - seat parliament , giving it a majority for the first time since it lost power to Howard in 1996 .
Rudd is expected to forge closer ties with China and other Asian nations and has said he wants a more independent voice in foreign policy , with past Labor governments more supportive of an energetic United Nations and global organizations .
Rudd promised to sign the Kyoto climate pact immediately and lead his country to next month ’s UN climate summit in Bali , expected to kick - start talks on a post - Kyoto deal to slash greenhouse gas emissions globally .
But Labor could be frustrated by a hostile Senate ( upper
house ) , where the conservatives will have sway until July next year , possibly frustrating Rudd ’s Kyoto plan and promise to dump unpopular government labor laws which propelled his victory .
Centre - left Labor will have to negotiate with diverse minor Senate parties including the left - leaning Australian Greens and the conservative , Christian values Family First party .

In a message of unity , Rudd promised to govern for all Australians , including migrants and the poor .
“ Today the Australian people have decided that we as a nation will move forward , ” Rudd , flanked by his wife Therese and family , told around 1,000 wildly cheering home supporters at a football stadium in the tropical northern city of Brisbane .
The election was fought mainly on domestic issues , with Labor cashing in on anger at labor laws and rising interest rates which put home owners under financial pressure at a time when Australia ’s economy is booming .

“ Like Howard , he will quickly attempt to secure his administration with the fortress of institutional and cultural change .
In short , Australia will shift to the left , ” said the Bulletin news magazine .
“ Rudd will have to open negotiations soon with the United States about the withdrawal of Australia ’s combat troops from Iraq .
This is a delicate operation because it will be Labor ’s first testing of the alliance , ” veteran political commentator Michelle Grattan wrote in the Sun-Herald .
President George W. Bush congratulated Rudd on his election victory , and praised Howard ’s leadership .
“ The United States and Australia have long been strong partners and allies and the president looks forward to working with this new government to continue our historic relationship , ” the White House said in a statement .
Howard , who had won four consecutive elections and held power for 11 years , conceded his government had lost power in front of a crowd of supporters in Sydney late on Saturday , saying he took full personal responsibility for the defeat .
“ This is a great democracy and I want to wish Mr Rudd well , ” Howard said .
“ We bequeath to him a nation that is stronger and prouder and more prosperous than it was 11 - 1 / 2 years ago . ”
The result puts Labor in power nationally and in all of Australia ’s six states and two territories , with the lord mayor of the northern city of Brisbane now the senior ranking elected official in Howard ’s Liberal Party .
Howard , who on Sunday went for his regular morning walk in the wake of defeat , had won four consecutive elections and was Australia ’s second - longest serving prime minister behind Liberal Party founder Sir Robert Menzies .

Over the past six years , President Bush has proven pretty definitively that he was just kidding when he once claimed to be a “ compassionate conservative . ”
But his opposition to providing health insurance for impoverished and working class kids might rank as an all time low , even for him .
The administration has actively opposed reauthorization of the State Child Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , a highly successful Clinton - era initiative that extended health insurance to families who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance .
The plan enrolls some 7 million children .
In attempting to put a lid on the program , the administration already has banned states from using federal money to cover kids who are above 250 percent of the poverty line , which many had begun to do .
Bush officials have argued that the states had n’t yet enrolled enough eligible poor kids in Medicaid to justify extending government aid to better off families .
But now , the administration is trying to prevent states from doing just that –signing up more eligible kids .
On Aug. 31 , the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a new regulation that would ban states from using federal funds to enroll poor kids for Medicaid or SCHIP if the work takes place in a public school .
Not surprisingly , some states have found that the single best way to sign up lots of kids for Medicaid is to do outreach through their schools .
If the new rule is approved , those programs will all but disappear , leaving thousands of kids without access to the health care they ’re already entitled to .

A Los Angeles forum on global warming Saturday provided three presidential candidates time to throw around vows to cut carbon emissions , spur a green economy and renew American leadership in the world .
But if the intent was to buff their green credentials , more than anything the gathering thrust into glaring relief the differing approaches of Democrats Dennis J. Kucinich , Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards as each seeks the presidency .
First came Kucinich , the Ohio congressman and presidential longshot , who touted his modest - size house , efficient car and vegan diet as indicators of his personal parsimoniousness and vowed to guarantee an annual income to untold numbers of Americans .
Next came Clinton , the New York senator , who offered a stern argument for pragmatism , barked down a heckler and warned the audience that global warming legislation pending in the Senate would be too incremental for their taste -- even as she refused to say whether she would back it .
Advertisement
Last came Edwards , the former senator and former vice presidential nominee , who railed against corruption in government and challenged candidates to “ put political calculation aside and actually stand up with a little backbone for what ’s right . ”
He did n’t mention Clinton by name , nor did he need to .
For front - runner Clinton , sandwiched between two men whose talk of moral imperative clanged against her bent for compromise , the event was a reminder of why it is difficult for sitting senators to graduate to the White House .
The mincing steps of legislating are hard to spin into political success -- particularly before an audience desiring aggressive leaps .
Kucinich had no such difficulty .
Unlike most of the candidate debates so far , where he has been relegated to the sidelines , the format Saturday gave him equal standing .
The event , held at the Wadsworth Theatre before hundreds of activists , was sponsored by the online environmental group Grist , as well as a host of other environmental organizations , including the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund .

All of the Democratic and Republican candidates were invited , but only the three showed up .
Each offered a 10 - minute speech and then answered a panel of questioners , leaving the stage before the next candidate strode on .
Kucinich vowed an administration that would push “ massive ” spending on mass transit , incentives for renewable energy and environmentally safe construction techniques , and said he would use NASA to press the country to develop “ green technologies . ”
And he contrasted the other candidates ’ lifestyles with his -- replete with 1,600 - square - foot home , dull - if - efficient sedan and restricted diet .
“ If you want a leader who can reach out and lift this planet up , then we have to look at : How do you live ? ” he said .
He offered a precursor of Edwards ’ later argument , countering a skeptical question about his ability to thwart the efforts of oil and gas companies to block global warming legislation .
Advertisement
“ Imagine a president with no ties to those interest groups , ” he said , adding : “ Under a Kucinich administration , their control is broken . ”
But he appeared to catch even fellow progressives by surprise when he promised to compensate coal miners and others whose livelihoods would be harmed by his environmental policies .
“ I ’m speaking of a guaranteed annual income , ” he said .
“ For everybody ? ” a panelist , looking surprised , asked .
Advertisement
“ Absolutely , ” Kucinich replied .
Clinton opened her remarks by saying she had put forth a “ bold , comprehensive ” plan to tackle energy independence .
But she quickly slapped at both Kucinich and Edwards .
“ You will hear speeches this afternoon from those who will certainly draw tremendous applause and shouts of agreement , ” she said , “ but I hope we are all here today because we are serious about what it is we intend to do together . ”
Clinton struck many of the same themes as the other Democrats -- criticizing President Bush and vowing to dramatically reduce carbon emissions by midcentury and to unleash American innovation .
She pledged to meet with leaders of other polluting nations every three months .
Advertisement
But she bridled at an interruption by a heckler -- “ Were you invited to speak here this afternoon ? ” Clinton asked firmly -- and appeared to be preparing environmentalists for disappointment when it comes to future global warming laws .
She said a lesson from her failed 1990s effort to overhaul healthcare was that “ everybody is also worried that people in politics are not going to be pure enough .
. . .
So your allies are not happy because you are not 100 % , and your adversaries are thrilled because they ’ve already divided you before you begin .
“ So perhaps a thought that you might take away from this forum :
There is no way that we will ever produce a piece of legislation that will get through the Congress that every one of you will agree with . ”
But Clinton refused to say whether she would vote for the bill to which she appeared to be referring -- a measure that would curtail emissions , but not by as much as Clinton has proposed in the campaign .
Advertisement
“ I ca n’t tell you how I will vote because I do n’t know what the final bill is going to be , ” she said .
“ On the one hand , it is nowhere near what I would want .
. . .
On the other hand , we have never gotten this far before . ”
Edwards , too , offered a laundry list of proposals : cutting “ carbon welfare ” subsidies to big firms , encouraging “ smart ” energy grids , opening new energy markets .
But his overall approach was a sharp rebuke to the senator who had just walked offstage .
“ The system in Washington , D.C. , is broken and there is no better example of that than global warming , ” he said .
“ We know that the steps we need to take are right in front of us .
All we have to do is have a little backbone and courage to actually do it .
But Washington is not taking them , and when I look at Washington today I see politicians who are too afraid of rocking the boat to face the challenges in front of us . ”
Without naming names , he said their goal was to placate lobbyists .
“ We have to ask ourselves a basic question :
Are we willing to put political calculation aside and actually stand up with a little backbone for what ’s right ?
Are we willing to say that the time for compromise and half - measures is over ?
Advertisement
“ The government has become corrupt , and we need to be honest about that , ” he said to applause .
“ Why does America not have universal healthcare ?
We do n’t have universal healthcare because of drug companies and insurance companies and their lobbyists .
Why does America not attack global warming in the way that we need to ?
We know why we have n’t -- oil companies , power companies , gas companies and their lobbyists in Washington , D.C. ”

Months after the initial Twitter boom , it 's still strong and kicking .
A day rarely goes by that we do n't notice some new Twitter tool in the wild .
The ideal place for Twitter - related tools is the web browser , which is apparent from the quick - rising number of Firefox plugins .
We 've found eight ; you let us know if there are more !
1. Twitbin
The latest plugin in this bunch is very new , and we 've covered it here on Mashable .
Twitbin can be used to send and receive messages from Twitter , it 's a sidebar ( which , unfortunately , means it 's occupying the space where most users like to keep their bookmarks ) and it looks quite nice .
twitbin.com
2. Tweetbar
Tweetbar works with both Firefox and Flock , and just like Twitbin , it 's a sidebar - based plugin which you can use to send and receive messages from Twitter .
It opens with a keyboard shortcut : Ctrl +
Shift + T , or Cmd +
Shift +
T for Mac users ( which is not that good , because it collides with one of Firefox 's newer functions : open recently closed tab ) .
You can also find it in View - Sidebar - Tweetbar .
mikedemers.net/projects/tweetbar
3. TwitterNotifier
As the name suggests , TwitterNotifier notifies you with updates from your Twitter friends .
Instead of being located in the sidebar , it 's activated with a small icon in the right bottom corner of Firefox .
Of course , you can also send Tweets with it .
Also , when your friends write new tweets , a small balloon box appears in the right - bottom corner in a browser window .
If you click it , your friend 's Twitter page will open in a new tab .
www.naan.net/trac/wiki/TwitterNotifier
4. TwittyTunes
If you think that the world should know exactly which song are you listening to at any given time , then TwittyTunes is the plugin for you .
It works with the FoxyTunes Firefox extension ( but it 's not obligatory ; it just wo n't post music info without it ) , and it allows you to automatically post your currently playing songs to Twitter .
Furthermore , you can also let everyone know what website you 're currently viewing , and what videos you 're watching ( be careful there , you might not want people to know you 're currently viewing Me So Asian 3 ) .
www.foxytunes.com/twittytunes/
5. Ludicrous
For those who do n't like sidebar - based plugins , Ludicrous might be the ideal solution .
It allows you to post updates to Twitter directly from your Firefox search bar .
Once again , standard safety measures apply : do n't forget to change your Firefox search bar to a search engine , otherwise you might accidentally post your search query to Twitter .
lud.icro.us/post-twitter-updates-from-firefox /
6. Another Firefox search bar plugin
We 're not sure that this plugin even has a name , but it works quite similar to Ludicrous .
Just click the link and it will be added to your search bar , from which you can now send Tweets .
6brand.com/twitter-plugin-for-firefox-quicksearch
7. Twitterbar
If you like Ludicrous , but you constantly find yourself accidentally sending your search queries to Twitter , you might want to try out Twitterbar .
It is basically the same thing , with an important difference : you post tweets from your address bar , not the search bar .
Simply type in the address bar , and then click on the small grey icon on the right , which will tell you how many characters you have left as well as let you post the tweet .

8. Power Twitter by 30 Boxes
The plugin for power users comes from 30 boxes , and it 's named accordingly : Power Twitter .
Instead of adding functionality to Firefox , it adds features to your actual Twitter page ; it embeds Flickr and YouTube , shows you the true addresses of tinyurls , maps links to web page titles .
Additionally , it maps user information from 30 boxes , so you can get the latest updates and additional info for those Twitter friends who use 30 boxes .
Power Twitter by 30 Boxes
Every once in a while someone comes up with an idea that is so astoundingly simple that you have to wonder “ why did n’t I think of that . ”
Every year in this part of the country a remarkable thing happens .
The leaves fall off the trees , the sun goes into hibernation , and the rain turns into snow , we call it winter .
Global warming aside , its a pretty regular event that can be counted on every year .
The number one feature of winter that most people notice is that , it gets really freaking cold outside .
This is key to the workings of an invention by a company called Freeaire .
The Freeaire system is an add on product for existing walk in freezers , coolers , meat lockers , cold storage , and any other refrigerated space ( I am sure you could modify it to work with a home unit , but its designed for commercial spaces ) .
It works with all those large walk in coolers that are in just about every corner store in the world .
It has a little sensor and a fan , and when its really cold outside it pumps in cold outside air instead of turning the compressor on .
Simple , cheap , why did n’t I think of this .
From the Site
The Basic Freeaire Refrigeration System can be used in walk - in coolers , freezers and cold storage warehouses anywhere in the world .
A Freeaire system utilizes an electronic controller called the Cooler Controller to finely tune the operation of standard refrigeration equipment .
The microprocessor inside the model 2001 Cooler Controller knows the exact temperature that you want and the best way to achieve it .
It knows when critical refrigeration system components should run and it saves energy and money by knowing when they should n’t .
It controls the condensing unit ( compressor and condenser fan ) and evaporator fans to keep a constant temperature throughout the space .
It stops the evaporator fans when not needed , usually more than half the time , which also reduces the compressor ’s refrigeration load .
Proper airflow is maintained when the evaporator fans switch off by operating one or more of the Freeaire ’s energy - efficient Circ circulating fans .
The Cooler Controller regularly and thoroughly defrosts the evaporator coils , but for only as long as they need it .
It allows heaters to defog reach - in glass doors , but only when necessary .
Some Freeaire systems use highly efficient replacement Evap evaporator fan motors that use 30 to 40 % less energy than standard ones .
All of these measures combine to save you huge amounts of electricity and money , whether you live at the equator or the Arctic Circle .
But it ’s in colder climates , where the words “ snow ” , “ ice ” and “ wind - chill factor ” are often heard , that the Freeaire has a special talent .
It taps into the greatest source of refrigeration ever created : winter .
The Freeaire ’s Cool Breeze Outside Air Package can use fresh , cold outside air to cool the room , simply using what Nature has so considerately and freely offered , to give the whole condensing unit and evaporator fans the winter off .
Simply moving cold air from the outside to the inside is much more efficient than making cold air with a compressor system , even when the outside air is only a few degrees colder than the air it ’s replacing .
In the northern United States , it is not uncommon for a walk - in cooler with a Freeaire system with outside air to use less than 10 % of the energy needed by a compressor system for 150 days per year .
Here is a simple payback example of a client .
So you save money , save electricity , save greenhouse gas emissions , help the planet , your wallet , and you still get a nice cold pop to drink all year long .
If you own a large walk in cooler , you owe it to yourself and the planet to check out Freeaire .
NEW YORK , Oct 6 ( Reuters ) -
The release of popular rock group Radiohead ’s new album next week is the latest wake - up call for a music industry still struggling to deal with the advent of digital music , experts say .
Normally a Radiohead release generates huge buzz as fans and critics alike wait to hear the latest musical direction of a band that has produced such varied offerings as the radio hit “ High and Dry ” to the experimental musings of “ Kid A . ”
But the English band ’s seventh studio album “ In Rainbows ” is being closely watched for business reasons ; the album is being released digitally on Wednesday by the band itself , just 10 days after the completion of recording and mixing .
And the price ?
Fans can pay what they want .
The price listed at radiohead.com says simply : “ IT ’S UP TO YOU . ”
“ This has been a long - brewing issue with artists , ” said Ted Cohen of music consulting firm TAG Strategic .
“ In a digital world where you can create something relatively quickly and get it out there immediately , why wait ?
Is there any overwhelming need to sit on something for three or four months ? ”
Typically a band of Radiohead ’s stature would be signed to a major recording label , which would wait several months before releasing the music to allow time for buzz to develop and plan a tour and marketing campaign .
Tony Bongiovi , a record producer who has been in the music business since the 1960s , said the fast turnarounds could hurt a music business that he believes is losing money as it becomes more singles - driven , rather than album - driven , in the age of iTunes and Internet file - sharing .
Some bands would n’t work to complete an album if they could put out a good single right away , he said .
LESS CASH FROM SINGLES ?
According to Bongiovi , a singles - driven market would lead to less money for musicians and producers , and , ultimately , to fewer artists getting a shot at the big time .
“ When you go into a record label now , its got to be such a sure thing .
Otherwise , there ’s no money for you , ” he said .
Radiohead is releasing its latest recording alone after benefiting from label support for their first six albums , the last out in 2003 .
But fast releases might not be as worthwhile for newer bands .
“ People know who Radiohead are -- there is a pent - up demand of people waiting for the next thing , ” said Gartner Vice President Mike McGuire .
“ Very few bands have that kind of loyal audience following . ”
Radiohead ’s quick release in some ways is evocative of the early days of rock ‘n roll , when it was not uncommon to record a song in the morning , press it into a 45 in the afternoon and have it on store shelves the next day .
Radiohead is not alone in taking advantage of new technology , helping artists to stay ahead of fast - changing musical trends and reducing the risk of illegal downloading .
Stars , an indie Canadian rock band known for lush pop songs , made their album , “ In Our Bedroom After the War , ” available for download on July 10 , four days after completion .
The CD only became available in stores on September 25 .
The band said the album would have inevitably leaked during the period usually marked for promotion , and it hoped fans would choose to support it by paying to download it .
It also said they believed that the widespread release would help build word - of - mouth about the release .
“ We believe that the line between the media and the public is now completely gray , ” Stars said in a statement .
“ What differentiates a commercial radio station from someone adding a song to their Last . fm channel ?
Or their MySpace page ? ”
Brooklyn - based indie rockers Bishop Allen said they have benefited from putting out their music speedily .
They wrote and recorded a four - song EP every month in 2006 , making the record available for purchase or download the last day of each month .
“ The idea that you could make something from what you ’re thinking at the moment , and that fans can immediately access those thoughts , makes it more like a dialogue , ” said Justin Rice , who plays guitar , piano , and sings in the band .
“ They were hearing what we were saying without a weird lag .
It ’s kind of beautiful , ” he said .
Update : Nope , my solution wo n’t work .
As Christian Matthies points out in the comments , it is possible to spoof the HTTP
Host header as well ( his link in the comment is broken because of an extra comma , but this one works ) .
As a kludge , browsers could be modified to prevent Host header spoofing , but ( a ) it would take a long time to deploy to the world at large , and ( b ) it would be only a bandaid for a much bigger problem .
Summary :
While there ’s no way to protect browsers against the DNS rebinding attack , you can protect web sites and web services by forcing them to check the HTTP
Host header with every request .
This is easy to do for RESTful services going through a regular web server like Apache — you get it by default with virtual hosts — but might be trickier for WS -* services .
If you or your company is using HTTP - based web services ( either WS -* or REST ) , you might be in trouble — a new exploit allows a web site from outside your firewall to use a web browser as a proxy to read any web site or service inside your firewall .
Artur Bergman at O’Reilly has a posting on the DNS rebinding ( aka anti-DNS - pinning ) attack that works against all major browsers , including all versions of Firefox and MSIE .
There ’s no obvious general fix for this , though there ’s a Firefox extension that helps a tiny bit .
The attack
In a DNS - rebinding attack , the attacker is able to force your browser to read data from any IP address that your browser has access to , even if you ’re behind a router / firewall , by changing the IP address associated with a domain name you ’ve connected to .
That means that given an IP address , an outside attacker can read your local website ( at 127.0.0.1 ) , anything behind your corporate firewall ( such as an Intranet accounting page or a web service ) , or — I think ( have n’t tested yet ) — a website that you ’re logged into using a cookie ( HTTP authentication will force a popup , since the browser will see a different domain name , even if you ’re logged into the site in another tab / window ) .
If you run a local web server on your computer ( say , at 127.0.0.1 ) , you can go to http://www.jumperz.net/index.php?i=2&a=1&b=7, type in the local address , and see jumperz .
net use the exploit display the source of your home page .
The defence There ’s no way to protect the browser yet , but you can protect your HTTP - based sites and services from this attack very easily — in fact , many sites on the web are already unknowingly protected , though I do n’t know if most enterprise web services are .
The trick is in the HTTP Host header .
While the DNS rebinding attack can associate a new IP address with a hostname , it cannot change the hostname itself , so the browser will still send the original hostname to the new host .
Nearly all shared - hosting servers — and many servers at dedicated hosts as well — will check the Host header to decide what pages to serve out .
As long as the site does something harmless when it gets an unrecognized hostname ( such as returning a “ 501 Not implemented ” HTTP status code ) , the site will be safe the attack .
In Apache , for example , you use the ServerName directive for each virtual host , and just make sure that there ’s a default virtual host that returns an error or at least does nothing harmful .
For Web Services , the same thing applies .
It ’s often tempting to use IP addresses instead of hostnames for web services ( including RESTful services ) , especially during development , but doing so opens you right up to a DNS - rebinding attack , which could be very harmful if you ’re using real data for development and testing .
To protect your HTTP - based services from this attack , you need to make sure that every web service is accessed via a hostname rather than a raw IP address , and that every service checks its hostname .
For RESTful services , this is trivially easy ( since you ’re probably going through Apache or something similar anyway , just as with a web site ) ; for WS -* services , I do n’t know the implementations well enough to be sure , but it should be possible to force them to check the Host header somehow .
Even if you ’re not building web services , managing an enterprise intranet , or running a public web site , do n’t forget to protect the web server on your local computer , if you have one .
This simple technique will help you bring those scratched CD ’s and DVD ’s back to life .
Before proceeding , be sure that you have the following ingredients :
1- A regular household microwave
2- Ice cream
3- Chocolate syrup
4- An egg
5- A sliced dill pickle
6- A marshmallow hamburger
We ’ve covered several technique on how to fix damaged CD ’s in the past , but this one is the most innovative so far .
See the following video for instructions :
I ’ll say it once again BEFORE the video .
Do NOT do try this !
The following video is a JOKE .
you should never put a CD or DVD in a microwave .
It seems that even though the tone clearly humorous in the video and that I posted a warning saying that the video was a joke , some people actually thought it was real .
the warning was extremely clear , so do n’t come and blame us because you do not know how to read .
UN nuclear watchdog set to submit Iran report Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday November 13 , 2007

Print This Email This Update : Officials now say the Iran report will be released either Wednesday night or Thursday The long - awaited report by the United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency about Iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program is scheduled to be released to diplomats Thursday , sources close to the Vienna - based agency tell RAW STORY , after earlier saying it would be released Wednesday .
The report will be submitted to the United Nations and released in restricted form to the public .
Sources declined to disclose the contents of the report .
Late Tuesday , Iran handed over to the UN nuclear watchdog a document containing design information that could help to make nuclear weapon parts .
But diplomats said it was unclear whether the gesture really was a sign of goodwill on the part of Tehran or a last - minute attempt to stave off further possible UN sanctions .
This may have delayed the report 's release .
The IAEA report is crucial because the United States , Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany all agreed to hold off a vote on additional sanctions until after its release .
The six nations met in London last week in an attempt to coordinate strategy with regard to Iran 's nuclear program .
Any additional sanctions would target trade and economic activity with Iran more generally .
Iran has vowed not to give up its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is legal under the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Both the IAEA and Iran have characterized the talks as constructive .
Iran and the IAEA have conducted a series of highly technical talks since August , when Iran promised to answer questions under the threat of additional UN sanctions in response to its secretive enrichment program .
The UN Security Council has already passed tough sanctions against Iran twice , once December 2006 and again in March 2007 .
Both rounds of sanctions primarily affected sales of technology and materials that could contribute in any way to Iran 's uranium enrichment and missile programs .
The 2006 sanctions imposed an asset freeze on any companies considered to be engaged in helping Iran on programs identified by the United Nations Security Council .
In March , these sanctions were tightened further .
Iran says that it has given the IAEA all the information needed to prove that its development of centrifuges for the enrichment of uranium is intended for a peaceful energy program and not for nuclear weapons .
The IAEA has expressed satisfaction with the talks but has declined to comment in advance of the report on whether Iran has fully resolved the issues of transparency .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned Monday that he would seek not only tougher sanctions but also a worldwide ban on oil and gas investment in Iran if Tehran continued to defy the UN .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have also indicated a " get tough " policy towards Iran .
Russia and China , meanwhile , which have veto power in the UN Security Council , have consistently opposed harsher sanctions .
Harsher action therefore appears unlikely .
The United States wants Iran to drop its enrichment program entirely .
Recent American rhetoric has suggested that even allowing Iran " the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon " is unacceptable .
" We got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel , " President Bush declared last month .
" So I 've told people that if you 're interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon .
I take the threat of Iran with a nuclear weapon very seriously .
And we 'll continue to work with all nations about the seriousness of this threat .
Plus we 'll continue working the financial measures that we 're in the process of doing . "
The Bush Administration declared the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) a terrorist organization Oct. 25 - the first time in history that a military branch of a sovereign state has been labeled with such a designation .
Tensions have been running high .
Last week , after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that Iran " could n't care less " about sanctions , Israel 's Deputy Prime Minister accused IAEA head Mohamed El Baradei of complacency over Iran 's nuclear ambitions and called for him to be replaced .
An Iranian spokesman retorted that " the U.S. - led world arrogance along with the Zionist regime are trying to orchestrate misleading reports about Iran . "
France 's Foreign Ministry responded to the controversy by declaring its " full support " for ElBaradei , while Saudi King Abdullah called for Iran to avoid " escalation , confrontation and challenge . "
Karolina Obrycka is a bartender .
As a responsible bartender , she noticed that one of her patrons had a little too much to drink and refused to continue to serve him .
As a responsible bartender , the choice made was one that anyone who has an rsa certificate melbourne and has the right to serve alcohol would safely make .
This did not sit well with the customer 38 year - old Anthony Abbate who became increasingly belligerent to the point where he began attacking her .
Surely the police who were present in the bar would come to her aid to protect her ?
Oh , did I mention that the man attacking her was an off duty police officer ?
Here ’s the video :
As it turned out , Anthony Abbate was not the only police officer in the bar that night ; surely they would come to the woman ’s aid ?
Investigators are now trying to determine if several other police officers threatened the bartender with false charges to keep her quiet .
If this is true then these officers should all be hauled off to jail along with this Neanderthal .
This is not the first time Officer Anthony Abbate has been on the wrong side of the law .
Back in 1992 he was arrested for drunk driving .
The charges were dropped .
It seems to me that we should hold our men and women in blue to a higher standard instead of giving them a license to break the law .
Whatever the penalty is for assault and battery ( or any other crime ) for a civilian should be doubled for anyone in law enforcement .
This is truly disgraceful .
I wonder if FOX will run this clip on every segment and belittle him and attack him and start boycotts of his concerts .
Will Drudge lead the charge against these kinds of hate filled threats of violence against Hillary , Feinstein and Barack ?
With Machine guns in his hands --- he says ...( rough transcript )
Nugent : I was in Chicago last week I said --- Hey Obama , you might want to suck on one of these you punk ?
Obama , he 's a piece of shit and I told him to suck on one of my machine guns ...
Let 's hear it for them .
I was in NY and I said hey Hillary --- you might want to ride one of these into the sunset you worthless bitch ... Since I 'm in California , I 'm gonna find -- she might wanna suck on my machine gun !
Hey , Dianne Feinstein , ride one of these you worthless whore .
Any questions ?
Freeeeedom !
If someone said this about Bush as Jamie suggested , they would be in Gitmo right now ...
When developing buildings or ideas , it is critical to start with a good solid foundation .
In fact , when people fail to build with a solid foundation , is usually not even worth one ’s while to correct the work .
It ’s best to trash the entire project and start over with a worthy foundation .
When it comes to ideas , there are three intellectual foundations that become indispensable .
These three foundational ideas were set forth in the opening words of Philosophy in the Flesh : the Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought , by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson ( 1999 ) :
The mind is inherently embodied .
Thought is mostly unconscious .
Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical .
Based upon evidence proposed by Lakoff and Johnson ( and numerous other cognitive scientists ) , the battle over these ideas is utterly over .
To argue otherwise is , in fact , to argue foolishly .
Yet , for many , these three principles have not soaked in .
There is constant deep resistance to these ideas among many of the people who present themselves as today ’s premier philosophers , sociologists , psychologists , theologians , teachers , and political leaders .
As to why these ideas are so often ignored , there could be many potential explanations .
I suspect that many people fear each of these principles because they suggest that we humans lack complete power and control over our lives .
That thought makes all of us uncomfortable , of course , though a few of us are willing to take our harsh medicine to heart .
Most people , however , are not willing to re-conceptualize traditional accounts of what it means to be human .
They are not willing to dispense with a believe that each of us has an ethereal soul that is “ free ” to think any thought , a soul that is unencumbered by our clunky , fallible , poop and saliva - laden bodies .
They like to believe that our conscious thoughts fully capture the full importance of every moment and every drop of sentience and proto- sentience .
They prefer to believe that when it comes to words , Humpty Dumpty correctly declared : “ When I use a word , it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more or less . ”
They want to believe that humans have the power to speak forcefully without first having to develop a coherent theory of language , as though words serve as infallible conduits for transporting our purified ideas from here to there .
The three principles presented by Lakoff and Johnson are dangerous to each of those who crave control more than truth .
To those of us who seek truth above all other things , however , these three principles constitute our new foundations for any meaningful metaphysics .
They constitute three indispensable acid tests for any highfalutin theory for the meaning of life that happens to stroll into town .
Lakoff and Johnson discuss these three concepts in the first several chapters of Philosophy in the Flesh .
The main purpose of their book is to ask how philosophy would be practiced if it were faithfully constructed based upon these three principles .
Their answer is that philosophy ( in psychology and politics and everything else ) would be radically different .
Lakoff and Johnson argue that it is “ shocking ” to discover how different we are from what are philosophical traditions have advised us .
For starters , reason is not disembodied .
“ The same neural and cognitive mechanisms that allow us to perceive and move around also create our conceptual systems and modes of reason . ”
It is for the same reason that the study of evolution is intimately related to the understanding of human cognition .
There is no evidence that a physically unencumbered soul floats over each human body .
To the contrary , “ Reason is thus not an essence that separates us from other animals ; rather , it places us on a continuum with them . ”
In short , Descartes was incorrect : there is no evidence for any sort of dualism .
Human reason is shaped by the body .
Human reason “ is a form of animal reason , a reason inextricably tied to our bodies and the peculiarities of our brains . ”
How well can we know our own cognition ?
Not well , if we limit ourselves to introspection .
According to Lakoff and Johnson , “ we can have no direct conscious awareness of most of what goes on in our minds .
The idea that pure philosophical reflection can plumb the depths of human understanding is an illusion . ”
Johnson and Lakoff present the many cognitive activities occurring while you are in a conversation .
We are aware of very few of these , if any :
Accessing memory relevant to what is being said .
Comprehending a stream of sound as being language , dividing it into distinctive phonetic features and segments , identifying phonemes , and grouping them into morphemes .
Assigning a structure to the sentence in accord with the vast number of grammatical constructions in your native language .
Picking out words and giving them meanings appropriate to context .
Making semantic and pragmatic sense of the sentences as a whole .
Framing what is said in terms relevant to the discussion .
Performing inferences relevant to what is being discussed .
Constructing mental images where relevant and inspecting them .
Filling in gaps in the discourse .
Noticing and interpreting your interlocutor ’s body language .
Anticipating where the conversation is going .
Planning what to say in response .
Introspection is thus largely helpless to determine the manner in which humans think .
We need to be careful , because we think we know ( and we want to think we know ) how we think , even though experiments show that introspection is often way off the mark .
I have summarized some of this evidence for the limitations of introspection here .
How does human cognitive unconscious actually express itself through thought and language ?
Large portions of Philosophy in the Flesh spell out detailed and persuasive arguments that it is through conceptual metaphor .
“ The hidden hand of the unconscious mind uses metaphor to define our unconscious metaphysics . ”
The argument is that our abstract concepts , to the extent that they are grounded at all , are grounded in basic human sensorimotor capacities :
An embodied concept is a neural structure that is actually part of , or makes use of , the sensorimotor system of our brains .
Much of conceptual inference is , therefore , sensorimotor inference .
As George Lakoff wrote “ Thought is imaginative , in that those concepts which are not directly grounded in experience employ metaphor , metonymy , and mental imagery–all of which go beyond the literal mirroring , or representation , of external reality .
It is this imaginative capacity that allows for “ abstract ” thought and takes the mind beyond what we can see and feel . ”
Women , Fire , and Dangerous Things : What Categories Reveal About the Mind , Preface , p. xiv , ( 1987 ) . at 184 .
Probably the most dramatic conclusion I drew from reading Philosophy in the Flesh is that it is not possible to do meaningful philosophy without having developed a reality - based theory of language .
This might sound like bad news for those of us who think of the study of language as a dry topic .
I used to be one of those people , but no longer .
To the contrary , Lakoff and Johnson have written some terrific works to introduce would - be philosophers to the exciting study of language itself ( another good starting point would be Metaphors We Live By ) .
For those who take the study seriously , the works of Johnson and Lakoff are capable of turning your worldview upside down and inside out .
You will never again think of human beings or human language the same .
You will have a deep understanding of conceptual metaphor as something that is not an option for any human being who dares to explore any abstract field of study ( whether it be religion , philosophy , law , politics , psychology or sociology ) .
In the end , there is no escaping that there is a wonderful and frustrating fluidity to the meaning of words .
Except for the most encrusted bureaucrate - ese , words breathe human air .
It is naïve , then , to claim that our words of explanation ( regarding any topic ) depend on the words themselves , rather than upon complex and living interrelationships formed by those who other such words .
To the extent our words are meaningful , they are always alive and they originate in our sensorimotor capacities as human animals .
Experientialism ( the term of Lakoff and Johnson give to their approach to language and philosophy ) makes a strong case in showing that the “ objective ” use of language is a myth : there is no such thing as abstract and disembodied thought .
Truly “ objective ” thought would require the impossible : a “ logical propositional trajectory from principle to concrete application , ” and there is no evidence for such a mechanism .
Still , many people will fight to the death for the principle that words and simply mean what we consciously intend for them to mean .
George Lakoff has given us a reason why so many people cling to this unwarranted form of radical and unsupportable objectivism :
“ There is a major folk theory in our society according to which being objective is being fair , and human judgment is subject to error or likely to be biased .
Consequently decisions concerning people should be made on ‘ objective ’ grounds as often as possible .
It is the major way that people who make decisions avoid blame .
If there are ‘ objective ’ criteria on which to base a decision , then one cannot be blamed for being biased , and consequently one cannot be criticized , demoted , fired , or sued . ”

Why do so many puzzling human activities boil down to a difficult - to - constrain craving for power and control ?
CORVALLIS , Ore. - Generations of studies on vitamin E may be largely meaningless , scientists say , because new research has demonstrated that the levels of this micronutrient necessary to reduce oxidative stress are far higher than those that have been commonly used in clinical trials .
In a new study and commentary in Free Radical Biology and Medicine , researchers concluded that the levels of vitamin E necessary to reduce oxidative stress - as measured by accepted biomarkers of lipid peroxidation - are about 1,600 to 3,200 I.U. daily , or four to eight times higher than those used in almost all past clinical trials .
This could help explain the inconsistent results of many vitamin E trials for its value in preventing or treating cardiovascular disease , said Balz Frei , professor and director of the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University , and co-author of the new commentary along with Jeffrey Blumberg , at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University .
" The methodology used in almost all past clinical trials of vitamin E has been fatally flawed , " said Frei , one of the world 's leading experts on antioxidants and disease .
" These trials supposedly addressed the hypothesis that reducing oxidative stress could reduce cardiovascular disease .
But oxidative stress was never measured in these trials , and therefore we do n't know whether it was actually reduced or not .
The hypothesis was never really tested . "
The level of vitamin E that clearly can be shown to reduce oxidative stress , new research is showing , is far higher than the level that could be obtained in any diet , and is also above the " tolerable upper intake level " outlined by the Institute of Medicine , which is 1,000 I.U. a day .
OSU researchers are not yet recommending that people should routinely take such high levels , but they do say that controlled clinical trials studying this issue should be aware of the latest findings and seriously consider using much higher vitamin E supplement levels in their studies .
In lab , animal or human studies , there 's evidence that vitamin E can reduce oxidative stress , inhibit formation of atherosclerotic lesions , slow aortic thickening , lower inflammation , and reduce platelet adhesion .
Some human studies using lower levels of vitamin E supplements , such as 100 to 400 I.U. a day , have shown benefits in reducing cardiovascular disease risk , and others have not .
An underlying assumption was that these levels were more than adequate to reduce oxidative stress , since they far exceeded the " recommended dietary allowance " or RDA for the vitamin , a level adequate to prevent deficiency disease .
" What 's now clear is that the amount of vitamin E than can conclusively be shown to reduce oxidative stress is higher than we realized , " Frei said .
" And almost none of the studies done with vitamin E actually measured the beginning level or reduction of oxidative stress . "
Proper studies of vitamin E , researchers say , must be done carefully and take into account the newest findings about this micronutrient .
It 's now known that natural forms of the vitamin are far more readily absorbed than synthetic types .
It 's also been discovered that supplements taken without a fat - containing meal are largely useless , because in the absence of dietary fat vitamin E is not absorbed .
Some clinical trials may wish to study the long term effect of vitamins on healthy individuals .
But if a clinical trial seeks to learn the value of reducing oxidative stress , they should select patients in advance for those who have high , measurable oxidative stress - often people who are older or have a range of heart disease risk factors , such as obesity , poor diet , hypertension or other problems .
Cognizance should also be taken of people with health issues that may further increase their vitamin needs , such as smokers .
" A pill count simply is n't enough to determine the value of vitamin E , " Frei said .
" We need to select people for trials properly , make sure they are taking the right form of the vitamin , at the right levels and at the right time , and then verify the metabolic results with laboratory testing . "
" Only when we do these studies right will we answer questions about the value of vitamin E in addressing cardiovascular disease , " he said .
" So far we 've been flying blind . "
A parallel , Frei said , would be presuming to test the value of a statin drug , which lowers cholesterol , without ever measuring cholesterol levels in the test subjects , neither at the beginning nor at the end of the study .
Such trials would be ridiculed in the science community .
So far , that 's the way vitamin E has been studied .
The use and intake of vitamins , experts say , has traditionally been thought of in terms of overt deficiency - for example , not enough vitamin C causes scurvy .
Much less research has been done on the levels that can help create optimum health .
The issue is of special importance with modern populations that have very different diets , activity levels and increased lifespan , and are dying from much different causes - predominantly heart disease and cancer - than people of past generations .

Life was hard for opinionated intellectuals before the internet .
Getting published at all was an ordeal , even for the world ’s greatest programmer .
He got to consider things harmful once in a while , but he did n’t get to post a dispatch every week on any punch - card version of Wordpress .
The only thing 1970s intellectuals could do to foist their opinions on the world was to give long speeches .
People would transcribe these , and much later they would be put on the world wide web and periodically , reverently linked to .
One of these exhumed speeches is about cargo cult science , which Dive into Mark thought relevant to Apple and open source .
The metaphor was bent into service in a post titled “ When the bough breaks , ” though that metaphor was not intended to refer to the other .
The thing about these speeches is that they are deadly boring .
They were prepared for captive , worshipful audiences .
Every word did not count .
Apparently not even every paragraph counted .
Most people pressing that digg button for them can’t have gotten much farther than the esteemed by and date lines .
But regarded as cultural artifacts , they ’re fascinating .
One that ’s been around the block lately is Dijkstra ’s speech , “ The Humble Programmer . ”
Coderspiel felt obligated to slough through it , given its contrast with our “ glory of software programming ” dedication .
So here we are , reporting from 1972 .
Running in high heels considered silly
Dijkstra ’s coming - of - age story is compelling .
He became a programmer before it was a recognized profession , simply because he wanted to .
Nowadays , there ’s really no such thing as a recognized profession .
Or perhaps anything you can dream up immediately becomes a recognized profession .
But in the old days you had to do something respectable to get a marriage license , so Dijkstra had to lie and say he was a theoretical physicist .
And so programming as a job emerged slowly and without much respect .
We ’re summarizing by about one order of magnitude , but this is still boring .
So let ’s skip down to some trash talking .
There were these horrible “ third generation ” computers back then that were so bad they made every one retarded :
But the design embodied such serious flaws that I felt that with a single stroke the progress of computing science had been retarded by at least ten years : it was then that I had the blackest week in the whole of my professional life .
… still so many people honestly believe that some law of nature tells us that machines have to be that way .
They silence their doubts by observing how many of these machines have been sold , and derive from that observation the false sense of security that , after all , the design cannot have been that bad .
But upon closer inspection , that line of defense has the same convincing strength as the argument that cigarette smoking must be healthy because so many people do it .
Sweet .
Dude , where is ur blog ?
Oh right , did n’t have them then .
But this quote finds its echo , surprisingly enough , in something posted just last week about how Groovy is as slow as an abacus :
Subj : 400 billion flies cannot be wrong
Most probably you will soon hear “ If groovy were so slow , Fortune 500 companies would not use it - so it can not be so slow . ”
I have already given up on the subject .
Ha ha !
Boom .
Naturally , the reply message dutifully says that , yes , it does work in somebody ’s big company without turning the hardware to a pile of smoldering plastic , so there !
It ’s all about the “ context , ” he says in capital letters .
Hey , I get it .
I ’m going to write a script that is for some reason ideally suited to running in high heels .
Something that demands dynamic typing , and also demands being run on a virtual machine that is horrible at dynamic typing .
Let ’s go !
The software chopportunity
This Dijkstra speech is really about “ the software crisis , ” and how to solve it .
As machines became faster , humanity ’s appetite for software only increased and programmers were increasingly failing to satisfy it .
Dijkstra concludes ( spoiler alert ! — but you should be grateful ) that programmers must take a modest view of their own abilities to avoid drowning themselves in software complexity .
This is n’t exactly what we expected , as it ’s a personal application of modesty and it does n’t conflict with programming being glorious .
We could code modestly and still be carried down the streets by thankful masses who just have to have their Facebook , et cetera .
Still , “ glorious ” is starting to wear thin and we ’ll probably change it anyway .
For the love of programming ?
Well , something like that .
But whatever happened to that software crisis ?
Dijkstra was particularly taking aim at the programming language PL/ 1 , which helped the U.S. land on the moon but was at least as complicated as a lunar lander .
Dijkstra being the killer app that he was , was able to bury PL / 1 in a trench somewhere off the coast of Madagascar .
Near the gulf of goto .
But , surprise !
We ’re still having a software crisis .
The man knew we would be , of course .
The point of any speech is to motivate people , using white lies as needed .
And who knows where we ’d be if PL / 1 had n’t been completely destroyed .
This could be a computing dark age , and it is n’t .
But The New York Times tells us that since we now have “ interconnected and interdependent networks ” ( hmm ) we ’re in real big trouble :
problems arising from flawed systems , increasingly complex networks and even technology headaches from corporate mergers can make computer systems less reliable .
Meanwhile , society as a whole is growing ever more dependent on computers and computer networks , as automated controls become the norm for air traffic , pipelines , dams , the electrical grid and more .
Striving to be timely , the article casts the problem as one heavily aggravated by modern networks .
Computers themselves have , of course , been involved with important ( and often military ) business as long as they ’ve been around .
And they ca n’t help being complex .
( The demands always are . )
Networks have been connecting them for almost as long , wreaking havoc while being enormously useful .
Reporters might not have had much interaction with them until the mainstream internet , but networks have always been out there threatening to malfunction and blow us up with H - bombs .
Here ’s a theory of software quality for you : software must be nurtured .
The existence of bugs is n’t mysterious to any honest programmer .
They are the product of neglect .
Finding a bug in one ’s code is n’t so much a surprise as a feeling of déjà vu .
Ohhhh yesssss , I remember thinking I should check that condition .
Programmers have complete control over the quality of their code and , when working on code they care about , tend to produce things that work .
The secret is to care for the programmers , so that they take good care of the software .
Large organizations generally drive their software bees into combat formations , rather than nurturing colonies .
Standardization is the mantra .
Everyone will use one language , one set of libraries , and three ostentatious software “ patterns . ”
In such forced conditions the feeling of code ownership vanishes and quality goes out with it .
Weeks of planned system testing only reinforces the idea that bad code is expected and responsibility does n’t exist .
The late , unreliable , and inefficient software that is produced is everyone ’s baby and no one ’s , raised in a dysfunctional orphanage .
The alternative is obvious : break systems down into their smallest practical units , and let small groups of programmers determine implementations from top to bottom .
Necessary interfaces between modules are hammered out according to the best available standards ; unnecessary interfaces are not built .
Coders get to work in their favorite technology , or learn a new one .
There are obvious downsides to that approach , the first out of everyone ’s mouth being that the code will be impossible to maintain because no one knows anything but Struts 1.0 .
Let ’s imagine a portion of a system is built in Django , because there ’s a lot of excitement about it these days .
The programmers nail it , and build the software twice as well and in half the time that they would have in a forced Struts march .
Not just because Django makes the work easier , but because they are motivated .
Then they go out to celebrate and are poached by a rival corporation .
Oh my God , how will you ever do the phase two ?!
Craigslist .
Python programmers are out there , looking for a job where they can actually use their favorite language .
They probably are n’t even used to being paid as much as corporate Java programmers .
So , that could be good .
Incidentally , Dijkstra had some thoughts on salaries :
in the coming years programmer salaries may be expected to go down .
… perhaps the programmers of the past decade have not done so good a job as they should have done .
Society is getting dissatisfied with the performance of programmers and of their products .
… the price to be paid for the development of the software is of the same order of magnitude as the price of the hardware needed , and society more or less accepts that .
But hardware manufacturers tell us that in the next decade hardware prices can be expected to drop with a factor of ten . …
You can not expect society to accept this , and therefore we must learn to program an order of magnitude more effectively .
Oops .
His braininess just fell into a common pricing fallacy .
It is n’t about what the buyer ( in this case the employer ) is willing to pay , it ’s about what price the sellers ( programmers ) are willing to accept .
Perversely , dissatisfaction with software produced in large organizations tends to increase salaries .
The more programmers are disliked for failed software the more poorly they are treated , and the more poorly they are treated the more it costs to keep their seats filled .
If only those seats did n’t have to be filled !
Yeah .
If only you did n’t need that software .
And so it pays more to write bad software for large organizations than good software for small ones , if you can put up with constant , thinly veiled contempt .
And regimental work conditions .
And regular failure .
This is not a crisis — it is a condition .
It ’s brought on by lack of understanding between programmers and everyone else .
We wo n’t make the mistake of predicting that it will be healed this decade , but we can at least say that the outlines of the problem are becoming clearer .
It is n’t software in general that is so intolerably bad ; it ’s software in large organizations .
As raganwald points out , that ’s becoming more obvious :
As if that was n’t enough , the really bad news is , when our users go home they have this thing called the Internet . …
You see , the users get exposed to other ways of doing things , ways that are more convenient for users , ways that make them more productive , and they incorrectly think we ought to do things that way for them .
Again , let ’s recognize that resentment by itself only makes the problem worse .
You can fire an entire IT department and within five years the replacements will be smothered , and lulled , into the same state of malfunction .
But as it becomes clear that the chaos of the internet runs circles around the lockstep of corporate methods , someone is bound to take the risk of modeling systems after the internet , allowing programmers to act independently , and internal competition to thrive .
And when that works , it will spread .
One thing those battleships do quickly is imitate any hint of success in their competition .
Legitimate enterprise competition , of course .
Glory , glory , hallelujah
We did n’t find what we were looking for about professional attitudes from Dijkstra .
He was too concerned , naturally , with the relationship between programmer and computer .
We ’ll have to ask Humphrey Cobbler instead .
He ’s a fictional character in Robertson Davies ’s The Salterton Trilogy .
Cobbler is an organist , an absurdly enthusiastic musician , and a constant scandal in society for his refusal to conform .
And this what he says about his work :
That ’s what wrong with my job , too , you know .
Too much talk about the nobility of it , and how the public ought to get down on its knees before the artist simply because he has the infernal gall to say that he is an artist , and not enough honest admission that he does what he does because that is the way he is made . [ p. 365 ]
Since the 1954 publication of those words musicians have been so successful in rebranding themselves as “ artists ” that , if for some reason you ’re listening to the most recent Christina Aguilera album , you can hear one of her fans pledging in a non-musical interlude that Christina is absolutely the best artist ever .
Yikes .
Maybe programmers are just like the 1950s musicians that lacked Cobbler ’s confidence , snatching desperately for public nobility .
Thus far our attempts at title theft have been less successful than theirs , though not for lack of trying ( e.g. software developer / architect / engineer ) .
Like musicians , our work requires not only talent but years of practice , and we see ourselves as “ different . ”
The average person cannot walk up to a piano , or a computer keyboard , and produce anything of value .
Writers ?
Throw them in here too , certainly .
Are reporters not a little too serious about being called “ journalists ” ?
Of course , this line of thought would annoy both of those professions , them being old , established , and respected compared to programming .
How pathetic .
Creation is a wonderful thing , without a doubt .
But there ’s no point in trying to explain why , or how , one way of doing it is so wonderful ; inevitably it makes you ridiculous .
( We ’ll be changing that Coderspiel dedication ! )
The best homage you can make to the work is simply to do it .
Make something for yourself , and make something for other people .
If it gives them pleasure , you just might be recognized for it .
But not as much as Christina Aguilera .
Running , in high heels .
While giving a speech .

Baxter Wood is one of Hubert Dreyfus ’ most devoted students .
During lectures on existentialism , Wood hangs on every word , savoring the moments when the 78 - year - old philosophy professor pauses to consider a student ’s comment or relay how a meaning - of - life question had him up at 2 a.m .
But Wood is not sitting in a lecture hall on the UC Berkeley campus , nor has he met Dreyfus .
He is in the cab of his 18 - wheel big rig , hauling dog food from Ohio to the West Coast or flat - screen TVs from Los Angeles to points east .
The 61 - year - old trucker from El Paso eavesdrops on the lectures by downloading them for free from Apple Inc. 's iTunes store , transferring them to his Hewlett - Packard digital media player , then piping them through his cabin ’s speakers .
He hits pause as he approaches cities so he can focus more on traffic than on what Nietzsche meant when he said God was dead , then shifts his attention back to the classroom .
“ I ’m really in two places at once , ” he said .
“ The sound of chalk on the chalkboard makes it so real . ”
By making hundreds of lectures from elite academic institutions available online for free , Apple is reinvigorating the minds of people who have been estranged from the world of ideas .
For several years universities have posted recorded lectures on their internal websites , giving students a chance to brush up on their classes or catch ones they missed .
But 28 colleges and universities , including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Stanford and Yale , now post select courses without charge at iTunes .
The universities want to promote themselves to parents and prospective students , as well as strengthen ties with alumni .
Some also see their mission as sharing the ivory tower ’s intellectual riches with the rest of the world .
“ It was something we could n’t easily do before the digital age , ” UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said .
These unofficial students , invisible to their instructors , wo n’t earn degrees for listening .
Some professors wo n’t even respond to their correspondence .
But they relish the explosion of free lectures .
Retirees in Long Beach and Weaverville , Calif. , halibut fishermen in Alaska , data entry clerks in London , casting agents in New York -- all separated from the classroom by age , distance or circumstance -- are learning from some of the world ’s top scholars .
“ Something revolutionary is happening , ” said UC Berkeley professor Richard Muller , whose Physics for Future Presidents class airs on iTunes .
“ A large number of people around the world want more education .
They thirst for understanding and knowledge . ”
One e-mail Muller received came with the subject line “ Thank you from a grateful sailor in Iraq . ”
Apple began working with Duke University in late 2004 to broadcast classes from its website using iTunes software and has expanded the service to other schools .
Separately , some universities started putting lectures on the iTunes store in the form of podcasts , which are free video or audio recordings that anyone can download to their computer or iPod .
The downloads have surged since May , when Apple began featuring lessons on the iTunes home page under the heading iTunes U. For example , the 86 courses UC Berkeley offers are now being downloaded 50,000 times a week , up from 15,000 before Apple ’s promotion .
Analysts say Apple foots the bill for storing and cataloging the recordings to create goodwill with universities , which are big buyers of its Macintosh computers .
It has another motive : Podcasts drive demand for iPods .
For their part , universities are experimenting to see what works .
Mogulof said UC Berkeley had no plans to charge for the podcasts but acknowledged that the benefits were unclear .
“ We know there ’s oil under the ground , ” he said .
“ People are punching a lot of holes , and no one is sure what will come up as a big gusher . ”
The courses on iTunes U may not be the stuff of Casey Kasem ’s “ American Top 40 . ”
But they are ranked nonetheless , and some become surprise download hits .
One recent week , popular iTunes U podcasts included Modern Theoretical Physics from Stanford , Elementary Greek from Concordia Seminary in St. Louis and Intro to Biology from MIT .
It ’s a stretch to say that professors compete for iTunes popularity , but many are eager to know how many people tune in and see whether the university can benefit .
Dreyfus has cracked the top 20 .
He ’s the iTunes U equivalent of an indie rocker with a cult following .
Fans of his podcasts have trekked to his office in Moses Hall to meet him .
Many have sent the university money , generally between $ 5 and $ 500 , to show their appreciation for him and other podcasting professors , said Benjamin Hubbard , a co-manager of webcast . berkeley , which produces Berkeley ’s online courses and events .
One week last spring , before Apple started promoting the lectures on its home page , one of Dreyfus ’ philosophy and literature lectures -- he calls it “ From Gods to God and Back ” -- ranked 58th among podcasts on iTunes .
It trailed programs from the BBC and Comedy Central but was downloaded more often than NPR ’s “ This I Believe ” and NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
To improve the sound quality of his lectures , Dreyfus agreed to teach in a room outfitted with a microphone and special recording device .
But he is ambivalent about the benefits of broadcasting his philosophy class to the world .
He said 25 % of his enrolled students cut class .
One of the occasionally absent is Alexander Diaz , 18 , a second - year philosophy major from Downey .
He says he skips roughly every third class and listens , with his feet up , to the missed lectures through his iPod headphones on his back porch while he takes notes in the margins of Heidegger ’s “ Being and Time . ”
“ I ’m pretty honored to take the class , but at the same time , when he does his lectures , it ’s not like I ’m there with Dreyfus the man , ” Diaz said , referring to the impersonal feeling of sitting in a large lecture hall .
Dreyfus , who has taught at Berkeley since 1968 , has long questioned the effectiveness of distance learning .
In his 2001 book of essays , “ On the Internet , ” he called the practice a “ disembodied telepresence ” and worried that remote students would take fewer risks than those sitting face - to - face with their instructors .
But Dreyfus says the chance to disseminate ideas softens his reservations .
And the e-mails he receives from the listening audience -- “ you podcast people , ” he calls them during class -- are touching .
Zachary Streitz soaks up the philosophy lectures as he baits hooks on a 58 - foot fishing boat in the Gulf of Alaska , where he trawls for halibut and black cod .
On shore , the 30 - year - old fisherman loads up on course books .
“ There are enough hours spent here that my hands are involved in the repetition that is my work , and my mind has more or less free rein to wander , ” he wrote to Dreyfus in June 2006 .
“ If ever you are in need of any halibut , let me know . ”
Joe and Diane Mercier , who live outside Weaverville in Northern California ’s Trinity County , get their Dreyfus fix over morning coffee .
They also listen to Muller ’s physics class from UC Berkeley and a Stanford course on geography and world cultures .
Joe , a 60 - year - old evidence officer for the county Sheriff ’s Department , is annoyed by some of the routine instructions that begin and end classes as well as the sound of a student ’s phone ringing or a professor scolding someone for leaving early .
But he and his wife revel in the moment when Dreyfus dispenses with administrative work with his usual , “ OK , here we go ” and plunges into a philosophical discussion .
“ We listen to relieve ourselves of mainstream television , ” Joe said .
He occasionally writes the papers that Dreyfus assigns but has n’t submitted any , unsure whether they would be read .
Arthur Marquis , 59 , a former Justice Department attorney in Long Beach , told guests at his retirement party last year that he wanted to use his newly free time to see the world differently .
They laughed .
Marquis , who graduated from UC Berkeley ’s law school decades ago , started taking French lessons at a local school .
He found Dreyfus on iTunes and then bought an iPod so he could listen on his treadmill or outdoors .
“ It ’s like electronic schizophrenia , ” he said .
“ I can hear voices in my head , and it ’s Dreyfus . ”
While other truck drivers talk to one another on their CB radios , Wood prefers to pass time on his weeks - long routes by sampling from an academic smorgasbord .
He has listened to classes on astronomy from Ohio State University , geography from UC Berkeley and behavioral endocrinology from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore , which makes podcasts available through its website but not iTunes U .
“ I ’m a curious person , ” said Wood , who comes from a family of Pentecostal ministers and missionaries .
He attended the University of Alaska in the 1960s and remembered only one thing from his philosophy class : the name Kant ( which belonged to the 18th century German thinker Immanuel Kant ) .
He worked as a wood and stone turner until the dust started bothering him .
In 2002 , he became a truck driver .
This spring , he found the lectures on iTunes .
“ I felt like I discovered the Fountain of Youth , ” he said .
Wood does n’t listen to classes during his one week off the road each month , only when he ’s behind the wheel .
“ For me , driving and listening are bound together like space and time , ” he said .
Sometimes , the classes that involve math or obscure concepts such as string theory lose him .
But not Dreyfus ’ class , which he finds electrifying .
He remembers being somewhere in western Kansas in April when he heard Dreyfus ’ concluding lecture on existentialism , during which the professor asked students to vote , by raising their hands , for their favorite philosophies .
Dreyfus offered a thumbnail description of each : traditional Christianity , with God the creator and heaven ; Kierkegaard ’s unconditional commitment to another person or cause ; Dostoevski ’s unconditional commitment to all human beings ; Nietzsche ’s belief in different identities , a life more like a series of short stories than a novel .
Wood , who long ago broke away from his family ’s religion , voted for Nietzsche silently .
“ OK , that ’s it , ” Dreyfus said .
“ I have to stop and hand out the evaluations . ”
The class erupted in a sustained ovation , whooping and whistling .
The course had been recorded a year earlier .
But Wood , separated by space and time , clapped and whooped too .
“ Big trucks have enormous inertia .
They practically drive themselves , ” he said .
The machine , indifferent to his emotions , powered on , his body molded to the wheel , his mind having a great ride .
