I realize people will immediately think , “ But eggplant is a fruit . ”
Technically , you might be correct , but also technically there is a chance a rabid clown might be in your closet right now .
Do you want everything that ’s technical to be the case ?

PROVIDENCE , R.I. 
It was a finely honed machine , this United States Census team , and it had a good run .
But in the coming days and weeks , many of its members will experience the pain of unemployment  once again .
Christine Egan , a 31 - year - old massage therapist , says her census job offered shelter from the economic storm last year .
“ The economy was terrible ; there was nothing , ” she says .
“ I ’ve already gone through ‘ horrific , ’ so I ’m immunized . ”
She smiles , optimism almost extending to her eyes .
“ It must be better now , right ? ”
When the Census Bureau hired upward of 700,000 Americans over the last two years  most in the last six months  it landed more experienced workers with more sophisticated skills than any time in recent memory .
This was the unintended upside of the nastiest recession of the last 70 years .
Now , its decennial work largely done , the Census Bureau is shedding hundreds of thousands of workers  about 225,000 in just the last few weeks , enough to account for a jot or two in the unemployment rate , say federal economists .
Most of those remaining will be gone by August ; a few will last into September .

The relatively quick arrest in the botched May 1 Times Square bombing temporarily quieted the political sparring over national security policies .

But the cease - fire has now ended .
Missouri Sen. Kit Bond , the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee , says he does n’t yet buy the Obama administration ’s claim that the alleged bomber , Faisal Shahzad , was trained , directed and likely financed by Pakistani Taliban militants .
Attorney General Eric Holder said in televised interviews Sunday that Shahzad , a 30 - year - old Pakistani - born American , was working at the direction of the group known as Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan .
Holder ’s appearance was part of a high - visibility administration response to the Times Square incident , which contrasted with the administration ’s previous handling of other terrorism cases …
Upon arriving in Shanghai recently , the author was immediately struck by two inescapable observations : the massive sprawl of real - estate construction and the rotten , ubiquitous smog .
While Chinese growth has been bolstered by other factors , both of these phenomena are results of the Chinese state 's socialist intervention in environmental law .
The Chinese state 's arrogation of all pollution litigation to its own courts is a clear collectivization of environmental property rights — most notably rights to air and property surfaces , most of which are covered in soot after a few years of operation .
The state 's subsequent , systematic refusal to enforce property owners ' claims against pollution damages to the serviceability of their air and the appearances of their structures ' outward surfaces , then , constitutes a redistribution of these collectivized rights to " dirty " industries and other heavy polluters .
What Can and Cannot Be Said
Some may argue that the speedy growth in Chinese output statistics and employment opportunities outweigh the costs of environmental socialism .
Indeed , it is theoretically indisputable that the recent decades of environmental cost externalization have contributed to the attractiveness of China for foreign investors in high - polluting markets .
However , such a claim is economically indefensible .
There is simply no such thing as " total utility , " and thus no quantity of " optimal " social utility .
Rather , utility is merely the economist 's term to represent the comparison of expected serviceability that guides the economic actions of individuals , and is inherently unquantifiable .
It is impossible to know whether the utility gained by Chinese people who enjoy employment in dirty industry or by the consumers of products these workers produce somehow outweighs the utility lost by those whose property or person is damaged .
Those speaking of what is " best " for entire nations or regions of individual actors do not practice economics , but statist intellectual vandalism .
Furthermore , while envirosocialism has certainly helped to make China a leading haven for polluters , it also has likely had inhibitive effects on investment in less - emissive and more - eco-reliant industries .
For example , China 's polluted water and constant smog overcast are hardly productive inputs for organic agriculture or quality food production .
It is also impossible to calculate the employment and productive increases that might have occurred with a free market in environmental litigation , and of course it would still be impossible to quantify a total shift in utility if such a market were allowed to emerge .
What can be said with certainty , however , is that firms and individuals acting in free markets will enter into cooperative legal relationships that one can expect to produce the best - possible results , given the constraint of the demands of opposing parties .
It is easy to recognize that such consensual relationships will tend to produce greater social peace and genuine economic progress compared to the antagonistic relationships produced by corrupt rent - seeking , which is encouraged by collectivized environmental property .
Indeed , conflict minimization is the very impetus for the enforcement of private - property rights , and it is the reason that private - property societies have always and everywhere become more highly developed than similarly endowed socialist societies .
The Libertarian Perspective
For such relationships to develop in the most practical and legitimate manner , the standard libertarian paradigm of property rights simply needs to be extended to environmental rights .
First - use homesteading must be the basis of the environmental rights to air , water , soil , and other currently socialized property .
Technical details , such as the height of a homeowner 's air parcel , should be determined by private and competing courts and enforcement agents .
In the majority of cases , current titleholders will inherit the first user 's environmental rights by virtue of their being the most legitimate heir .
Even where the enforcement of their inherited rights may contradict the state 's collective environmental laws , these owners ' rights are to be enforced .
This is because the legal standards were illegitimate from the beginning , having been imposed by the aggressive violence of the state rather than by mutual consent .
A revocation of environmental collectivism will indeed tend to sterilize previous investment outlays in dirty industries , and thus it will initially have negative effects on industrial growth .
However , as libertarian property ownership of a scarce good must include the right to transfer and lease the good , firms and individuals will choose to sell or lease part or all of their environmental rights where the price is right .
Thus , where the benefits of pollution to a company outweigh its cost to affected individuals , as demonstrated by their willingness to buy or lease the necessary rights at market prices or simply continue to violate property and pay ongoing damages , such pollution will occur .
Where such pollution is not mutually beneficial , firms will be forced to cease to pollute .
The resulting dynamic will balance the demands of consumers and the emissive realities of production engineering with the preferences of property owners .
Justice systems guided by profits will clearly tend toward decisions much more just than will monopolized state courts and law enforcers .
Indeed , where environmental law is produced and enforced by compulsory monopoly — which is , by definition , the state — the monopolist will not need or even seek such dual consensus , as there exists no alternative for nonconsenting parties .
To avoid violent revolution , and to profit from rent seeking , the highest managers of such legal monopolies — heads of state — collude with the economically superior class .
Together they serially violate the rights of the weaker class , who lack the legal redress provided by a free society .
That this has been the observed history of environmental socialism is beyond argument .
The Chinese courts , predictably , have consistently redistributed air property from poor , nonpolluting firms and individuals to rich industrialists .
The industrialists , in turn , provide the political class with a global reputation for promoting economic growth — as well as higher tax income , bribes , and campaign donations .
Western nations have also acted according to the perverse incentives of monopoly .
As property owners in Western nations are much richer , they are much more able to provide fat campaign donations and make for more attractive collusion partners .
Dirty industry also constitutes a far - smaller share of national output in Western markets , and thus it is less well equipped to provide bribes , tax revenues , and donations .
This fact helps explain the tendency of Western politicians to provide constant public flagellation of even light polluters .
Conclusion
The Chinese government , far from being too passive in environmental policy , has been one of the world 's most active environmental enforcers in the world , as proven by China 's vast skylines of soot and smog .
Rather than furthering state control of property and environmental law , the only sensible policy for the future is the liberalizing of the market for property - rights enforcement and arbitration .
Were you one of the 6/1000th of 1 % of Facebook users who deleted their accounts ?
Odds are clearly against it .
You would have a better chance of getting dealt four hands with 4 - of - a - kind in stud poker than of being one of the few who actually did what millions threatened to do .
What went wrong ?
Three things contributed to the failure of “ Quite Facebook Day ” …
1. Zuckerberg Folded ( sort of )
Growing concerns and negative press about Facebook ’s insanely complex privacy policy were assuaged late last week when they made changes to the content of the policy as well as simplified the method that people controlled their settings .
There are still complaints .
There always will be now that the privacy / security genie is out of the bottle , but the key to pacification by large social media sites such as Facebook , Twitter , and Digg has always been to cave to the masses prior to revolt .
JUST prior to revolt seems to be the best way and in this case contributed to Facebook not losing much more users yesterday .
2 : Making a Statement is so 20th Century
While millions voiced their concerns over Facebook privacy and offered supporting words to those willing to quit , few were willing to pull the trigger .
The rallying call was for people to stand up and say , “ We ’ll join you in sending this message ! ”
The reality was that a lot of people were saying , “ We ’ll support you in your efforts and we ’ll miss you when you ’re gone . ”
It ’s one thing to be upset and want to take action .
It ’s another thing to actually delete .
Deleting is so permanent .
It was too much to ask for most .
3 : “ Ready to Delete . Now What ? ”
As has been the case for years , wanting to delete your Facebook account and knowing how to do it are often two completely different things .
Facebook does n’t make it easy to leave .
Perhaps more importantly , most who want to leave the site simply leave , never to log in again , but with their profiles and pages still intact , withering away into inactivity and waiting for someone to hack it .
Did Facebook and Zuckerberg Get the Message ?
You bet they did .
If they were cocky and feeling invulnerable before , now they realize they ’re bullet - proof .
The 2 “ G "s are the only ones with a chance of taking down Facebook any time in the near future .
Government or Google .
The 2 " G " s . Even they may not be strong enough .

Steve Gibson has a plan to save the media world 's financial crisis – and it's not the iPad .
Borrowing a page from patent trolls , the CEO of fledgling Las Vegas - based Righthaven has begun buying out the copyrights to newspaper content for the sole purpose of suing blogs and websites that re-post those articles without permission .
And he says he 's making money .
" We believe it 's the best solution out there , " Gibson says .
" Media companies ' assets are very much their copyrights .
These companies need to understand and appreciate that those assets have value more than merely the present advertising revenues . "
Gibson 's vision is to monetize news content on the backend , by scouring the internet for infringing copies of his client 's articles , then suing and relying on the harsh penalties in the Copyright Act – up to $ 150,000 for a single infringement – to compel quick settlements .
Since Righthaven 's formation in March , the company has filed at least 80 federal lawsuits against website operators and individual bloggers who 've re-posted articles from the Las Vegas Review - Journal , his first client .
Now he 's talking expansion .
The Review - Journal 's publisher , Stephens Media in Las Vegas , runs over 70 other newspapers in nine states , and Gibson says he already has an agreement to expand his practice to cover those properties .
( Stephens Media declined comment , and referred inquiries to Gibson . )
Hundreds of lawsuits , he says , are already in the works by year 's end .
" We perceive there to be millions , if not billions , of infringements out there , " he says .
Righthaven 's lawsuits come on the heels of similar campaigns targeting music and movie infringers .
The Recording Industry Association of America sued about 20,000 thousand file sharers over five years , before recently winding down its campaign .
And a coalition of independent film producers called the U.S. Copyright Group was formed this year , already unleashing as many as 20,000 federal lawsuits against BitTorrent users accused of unlawfully sharing movies .
The RIAA 's lawsuits were n't a money maker , though – the record labels spent $ 64 million in legal costs , and recovered only $ 1.3 million in damages and settlements .
The independent film producers say they nonetheless expect to turn a profit from their lawsuits .
" People are settling with us , " says Thomas Dunlap , the head lawyer of the Copyright Group 's litigation .
The out - of - court settlements , the number of which he declined to divulge , are ranging in value from $ 1,500 to $ 3,500 – about the price it would cost defendants to retain a lawyer .
The RIAA 's settlements , which it collected in nearly every case , were for roughly the same amounts .
But experts say that settling the Righthaven cases , many of which target bloggers or aggregation sites , might not be as easy .
The RIAA lawsuits often accused peer - to - peer users of sharing dozens of music files , meaning the risk of going to trial was financially huge for the defendants .
The same is true of the BitTorrent lawsuits .
The movie file sharers are accused of leeching and seeding bits of movie files , contributing to the widespread and unauthorized distribution of independent movies such as Hurt Locker , * Cry of the Wolf * and others .
But each of the Righthaven suits charge one , or a handful , of infringements .
Defendants might be less willing to settle a lawsuit stemming from their posting of a single news article , despite the Copyright Act 's whopping damages .
" You 'd have to go after a lot of people for a relatively small amount of money , " says Jonathan Band , a Washington , D.C. copyright lawyer .
" That is a riskier proposition . "
Gibson claims Righthaven has already settled several lawsuits , the bulk of which are being chronicled by the * Las Vegas Sun* , for undisclosed sums .
One defendant who is ready to settle is Fred Bouzek , a Virginia man who runs bikernews .
net , a user - generated site about hardcore biker news .
He was sued last week on allegations the site ran a Las Vegas Review - Journal story about police going under cover with the Hell 's Angels .
Even if he had grounds to fight the case , he says it would be cheaper to settle .
" The only choice I have is to try to raise money and offer a settlement , " he says .
Bill Irvine of Phoenix says he is fighting infringement allegations targeting AboveTopSecret.com , the site he controls under The Above Network .
The site is accused of infringing a Review - Journal article on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
The site is a user - generated discussion on " conspiracies , UFO's , paranormal , secret societies , political scandals , new world order , terrorism , and dozens of related topics " and gets about 5 million hits monthly , Irvine says .
Righthaven , he says , should have sent him a takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , because the article was posted by a user , not the site itself .
" In this case , we feel this suit does not have merit , " he says .
" We are confident we will have success challenging it . "
Gibson says he 's just getting started .
Righthaven has other media clients that he wo n't name until the lawsuits start rolling out , he says .
" Frankly , I think we 're having tremendous success at a number of levels , " Gibson says .
" We file new complaints every day . "

The International Monetary Fund has called for support measures to protect vulnerable homeowners in Ireland burdened with mortgage arrears as a result of the financial crisis .
The Washington - based authority says such measures could limit the social and economic fallout of the current crisis , provided they were narrowly targeted .
In a preliminary report issued yesterday , following a recent visit to Ireland , the IMF said Irish policymakers had gained significant credibility as a result of measures taken to deal with the current crisis .
The IMF suggests that the banks , which have absorbed billions in State funds , could use their stronger financial position to fund the scheme on an initial basis .
" With their bolstered capital , banks could absorb the initial costs , perhaps basing themselves on the welfare system to identify eligible beneficiaries .
This process will be aided by an overdue shift to a more efficient and balanced personal insolvency regime , " it added .
The most recent mortgage figures showed that one in every 25 Irish residential mortgage holders is more than three months behind on their payments .
The head of financial regulation at the Central Bank , Matthew Elderfield , said there was no " silver bullet " solution to the issue of mortgage arrears , expressing concern last month that any such approach could carry the risk of " moral hazard " , whereby it could incentivise homeowners to breach their financial obligations .
The IMF , considered to be a global financial watchdog , is broadly positive on the Government 's approach to the financial crisis , saying it has gained " significant credibility " .
However , its report warned of possible “ consolidation fatigue ” as new problems emerged and more cuts were needed .
The agency highlighted the need for new taxes and for making the public service more efficient as “ years of tight budgetary control ” lay ahead .
IMF experts drew up their report after visiting Ireland last month for two weeks .
The trip included a meeting with Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan and consultation with a range of public and private bodies .
The IMF praised Irish policymakers , saying they achieved their goals in a " remarkably socially cohesive manner " , while balancing social and economic goals .
" These actions have reassured the global policy community and international financial markets . "
It also said plans to " proactively reshape " the banking system are appropriate , adding that a market - oriented approach should be applied to the banks in future .
The agency also called for strong supervision of lending to small businesses , noting that problematic loans in the sector have grown rapidly .
The IMF concluded that exports would lead the Republic 's recovery , with growth to rise to 3.5 per cent by 2015 .
High unemployment would linger , however , with the experts pencilling in a peak of 13.5 per cent this year and a 9 per cent jobless rate in five years , presuming new policy measures are not taken to address this .
Mr Lenihan yesterday welcomed the IMF ’s analysis and acknowledged the importance of keeping faith with the Government ’s policies .
A spokesman for the Department of Finance said that , at an overall level , the IMF had endorsed the Government ’s policies both in relation to the public finances and the banking sector .
He added that the IMF suggestion of targeted support for vulnerable householders was in line with existing Government policy that used the social welfare system to administer the mortgage interest subsidy scheme .
The spokesman said an expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt would report to Mr Lenihan by the end of June .
Fine Gael ’s housing spokesman Terence Flanagan said the IMF report had highlighted the " complete and utter inaction " of Fianna Fáil and the Greens when it came to helping those struggling with debt .
Plenty has been said about the ethics of reporters infiltrating the “ 12 - step ” program for recovering homosexuals frequented by Pastor Tom Brock — the closeted Lutheran pastor who blamed that tornado during ELCA ’s vote on gay clergy on The Gays .
Like how it ’s wrong to invade meetings where privacy is of utmost importance to achieve betterment .
But such arguments ignore the type of meetings Brock attends .
The support groups sponsored by Faith In Action , the Minnesota chapter of “ ” the global Catholic gay - chastity - maintenance organization ” Courage ( and perhaps not to be confused with Faith 2 Action and Faith & Action ) , resemble the recovery techniques of Alcoholics Anonymous only in their logistics : group sharing , coffee and donuts .
But then there ’s the Bible - based means of denigrating same - sex attraction .
Yes , Brock ’s so - called therapy group is for ex-gays ( and wannabe ex- gays ) , but it also serves as a strategy session for the mental release of the very same - sex attraction these men rally — and in Brock ’s case , preach — against .
Either way , it got Brock ousted , at least temporarily .
The expose filed by Lavender magazine ’s John Townsend about Brock , the preacher at Hope Lutheran Church in North Minneapolis , involved Townsend posing as a gay man in need of recovery .
And the church is n’t denying his findings that Brock confessed to some sexual slippage on a trip to Slovakia .
But it is n’t confirming it either .
In the meantime , they ’ve put Brock on administrative leave while they investigate , uh , something .
His sexuality ?
Brock ’s supervisor Pastor Tom Parrish says it ’ll take about two weeks , and in the meantime they removed all his videos from the web ( though Queerty saved the one about the tornado ) .
It ’s unclear whether Brock will continue hosting his six - times - a - week radio show while his church looks into whether he can control his gay urges , but probs not , ’ cause , awkward , right ?
The Rev. James Livingston , a Catholic priest and the chaplain at North Memorial Hospital , says Townsend ’s report about Brock “ was n’t so much an ethical decision as a hate crime . ”
Targeting anti-gay gays because of their religious - based hatred ?
Where does it end .
Iceland will become a haven for whistleblowers ' leaked information following a unanimous vote in the Icelandic parliament to accept a Wikileaks idea to build an international " new media haven " on the island .
The move coincides with a proposal to set up Iceland as a host nation for the world 's datacentres .
Iceland is now expected to pass the world 's strongest press and whistleblower protection laws , and to set up an international prize for freedom of expression .
According to Wikileaks , a whistlebower website , one of the events that inspired the proposal was the gagging of Iceland 's national broadcaster , RUV , by Iceland 's then largest bank .
Kaupthing .
RUV had planned to expose the bank 's risky loans .
The details appeared later on the Wikileaks website .
The parliament 's general affairs committee made two changes to the original proposal .
The first was to widen the arena for free speech research .
The second called for the government to look into the prospects for operating data centres in Iceland especially with respect to operational security , and to organise an international conference in Iceland on the changes to the legal environment being caused by expansion of cloud computing , data havens , and the judicial state of the internet .
AUSTRALIANS are being told to brace for much higher interest rates - the OECD predicts at least four more rises , and most likely five , in the year ahead .
The organisation 's Economic Outlook , which was released in Paris yesterday , predicts the Reserve Bank will push up its cash rate from its present 4.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent by December and then 5.7 per cent by next June .
Australia 's cash rate at the time would be one of the world 's highest , exceeded in the the OECD by only Turkey , Poland , Mexico and Iceland .
The prediction is sharply at odds with that of Australian financial markets , which have priced in a tightening of only 0.25 percentage points in the year ahead .

Family , friends and associates gathered in Tucson , Arizona on Saturday ( June 19 , 2010 ) to honor the legacy of a widely popular archery industry leader whose participation and contributions to the sport spanned more than five decades .
George Leonard Chapman , Jr. died Friday , June 11 , following several months of deteriorating health issues .
He was 75 .
Chapman was best known for his tireless promotion of archery among shooting enthusiasts , sporting goods retailers and quite frankly , anyone who would listen .
Throughout his career as a competitor , bow builder , company employee , bowhunter , dealer instructor and archery shooting coach , Chapman impacted the sport and its business though his motivating and passionate personality , and his congenial and forthright , grassroots manner .
He was among the first to join Pete Shepley , the president and founder of bow manufacturer Precision Shooting Equipment , in the building , marketing and sales of some of the first compound bows offered to the public , beginning in 1973 .
When he retired from PSE after 32 years , he was the only remaining original employee , having served as the company 's national sales manager , engineering director , quality assurance manager , special projects director , archery coach and dealer school director .
It was Chapman 's direction of the groundbreaking PSE Dealer School Program beginning in 1989 and his subsequent coaching and shooting instruction that garnered him industry - wide acclaim .
The Chapman - led dealer instruction program was the first of its kind in the shooting industry , later spawning imitators among both archery and firearms manufacturers .
Under his direction , thousands of archery equipment dealers and retail employees were trained in the basics of selling , maintaining and marketing bows and arrows , as well as how to promote the sports of archery and bowhunting .
The Chapman concept was simple , but effective : teaching retailers how to succeed and thrive in the shooting - sports business .
Concerned about a growing attrition rate among archery dealerships in the 80s , Chapman believed that only through education could the trend be reversed .
Chapman also served as a coach , mentor , and tutor to hundreds of archers and bowhunters , novice and pro alike .
After his retirement from PSE in 2005 , he and his wife Patti-an accomplished archer in her own right - continued to coach and teach through the George Chapman School of Archery .
Mrs. Chapman preceded him in death in 2009 .
Many of Chapman 's friends and school alumni never knew many details about the depth and scope of his own archery prowess .
Having shot his first bow and arrow in 1948 , during the 1960s and 70s Chapman was a leading competitor on the Midwest archery shooting circuit .
In the late 1960s he took top honors at a pair of major events - the Illinois NFAA Outdoor State and the NAA Indoor State - shooting one right - handed and one left - handed .
He also shot the first recorded perfect field - round score with a compound bow ( 560 ) , during a 1973 tournament in Robinson , Illinois .
That Citation bow , the first off the PSE production line , is a cherished part of the Chapman family heirlooms .
George Chapman is survived by his son , Steve Chapman of Fresno , CA ; son , Scott ( Debbie ) Chapman of Middleville , MI , and daughter , Sandy ( John ) Buss of Belleville , IL ; brother , Lloyd of Covington , IN ; seven grandchildren , Chris , Kyle , James , Robin , Greg , Jeff , Elizabeth and Jessica and five great - grandchildren , Leah , Taylor , Zach , Bobby and Bryce .
Counterpoint to the previous post : Carl ’s Jr. is rolling out a foot - long cheeseburger .
For a mere $ 4 ( $ 4.50 if you want things on it that are not meat and cheese ) , you too can own a foot - long cheeseburger .
The existence of Carl ’s Jr. ’s cheeseburger , which is being tested in select markets and which the Orange County Register describes as “ three tiny round patties carefully placed between a Hoagie - style bun , ” raises important questions .
For instance :
At what point does a hoagie containing three beef patties cease to be a hoagie and become a long hamburger ?
Also , is there a God ?
Nutritional information for the foot - long burger is suspiciously absent from Carl ’s Jr. ’s website .

How are bonuses influencing performance ?
Often people expect that higher bonuses will yield higher level of ability and performance — but do they ?
Here is a talk I gave on this topic ( see also Chapter 1 in “ The Upside of Irrationality ” )
NEW YORK —
Is competitive cheerleading a sport ?
At first blush , it would n’t seem to qualify , though , to be sure , it involves physical skills , training and coaches , and there are regular cheerleading competitions around the country .
In any case , whether cheerleading is a sport would n’t seem a question of earthshaking importance .
But here in the United States of litigation , there ’s a serious case under way on the matter , involving a Connecticut university , a federal district court , two lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and the contradictory opinions of various experts — with laws governing gender equality in collegiate athletics at issue .
What happened is this : Quinnipiac University , an institution in Hamden , Connecticut , with nearly 8,000 students in 52 undergraduate and 20 graduate academic programs , announced that it was dropping its women ’s volleyball team and substituting competitive cheerleading instead .
Local news reports explained that cheerleading involved more participants and cost less , so the move was basically an effort to use money more efficiently .
The university also made cuts in men ’s sports , like golf and outdoor track ( there is no men ’s volleyball team ) .

Keith Chegwin has come under fire for allegedly plagiarising other comedians ' routines .
But does intellectual property law protect jokes ?
Have you heard the one about Keith Chegwin standing accused of stealing gags ?
The comedian has been attacked for supposedly posting other comics ' material on his Twitter feed and passing it off as his own - a charge Chegwin strenuously denies .
His critics insist that he has violated a " gentleman 's agreement " among the comedy fraternity not to pilfer each other 's material , but would doing so also constitute a breach of the law ?
Matthew Harris of intellectual property specialists Waterfront Solicitors say that , in theory , a joke can be copyrighted - but with shorter , snappier gags which rely on abstract ideas rather than specific plots , any infringement would be difficult to prove in an English court .
" The joke would have to be more than just a few words long , " he says .
" As long as it's not word - for - word identical , there would have to be a relatively detailed plot [ for it to breach copyright ] .
And if that plot were so abstract as to fall within the general field of comedic tools , that 's fairly debatable .
" I think a one - liner would fall on the cusp of what 's covered by the law . "
In other words , he says , simply changing a long , detailed Englishman , Irishman and Scotsman joke to one with a Frenchman , a German and a Spaniard and an identical plot would not be enough to protect a plagiarist .
But the more succinct a gag and the more generic the basis of the humour - politicians being crooks or Manchester being rainy , say - the less likely that a court would rule that anyone could not have come up with the quip independently .
The Answer In theory , jokes can be copyrighted
But with shorter , generic , more abstract gags it is harder to prove infringement
If the jokes are sufficiently similar , the burden of proof passes to the defendant
However , Mr Harris adds that were the joke sufficiently similar to the one allegedly being plagiarised , the burden of proof would fall on the defendant rather than the complainant to demonstrate that he or she came up with the idea alone .
It is a highly complex legal conundrum , and it appears that , so far , jurisprudence has not reckoned with the likes of Keith Chegwin .
For his part , the comedian insists that he had come up with the jokes on his Twitter feed himself or " remembered [ them ] from old " .
However , fellow gagsmiths insisted that one example - " My auntie Marge has been ill for so long we changed her name to ' I can't believe she 's not better ' " - was the work of Mock the Week 's Milton Jones .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Other tweets were said to have been pilfered from Jimmy Carr and The Simpsons , according to Chegwin 's accusers , comedians Simon Evans and Ed Byrne .
Nor is the idea that the courts could get involved in such disputes entirely fanciful .
In 2004 Jimmy Carr issued legal threats to fellow comic Jim Davidson for using a similar joke to one of his own .
For what it 's worth , the quip ran : " Someone came up to me last week and complained about a joke , quite a big - boned girl .
She said : ' I think you 're fattist . '
I said : ' No , I think you 're fattest . ' "
It may sound trifling , but comedians whose livelihoods depend on making audiences laugh complain that such behaviour is no laughing matter .
The thing with jokes is that once audiences have heard them , they 're no longer funny Dan Antopolski , Comedian
The comedian Dan Antopolski had to confront this dilemma after one of his one - liners won the best joke award at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe .
Soon after the gag - " Hedgehogs : why can't they just share the hedge ? " - was given the accolade , it went viral across the internet .
But quickly , he realised he would have to drop the routine from his set - because his audiences had already heard it , and some might even assume that Antopolski had plagiarised the gag himself .
His agents were also forced to issue a cease and desist order to a company which produced T - shirts reproducing the joke .
" The thing with jokes is that once audiences have heard them , they 're no longer funny , " he says .
" In my Edinburgh Festival comedy world , the ethic is that you write your own material .
" In the traditional Bernard Manning days , it was different because any two comedians might never play to the same audience .
But TV changed all that .
" And now the internet means that people post up comedians ' routines , and then they spread with no mention of who the author is - it 's difficult to talk about it seriously because it all seems so silly , but this does affect people 's ability to make a living . "
Silliness may be what comedy is all about .
But with the web making artists protect their intellectual property more fiercely than ever , such complaints are unlikely to be laughed out of court .
Every once in awhile I come across unrelated stories that somehow associate themselves in my mind .
Take these , for instance :
First , I hope you saw Lex ’s tribute to Starchild ( given name , Gary Shider ) , he of P - Funk fame .
As Lex notes , Shider experienced problems where the cost of fighting the cancer that killed him was concerned .
Second , another American music icon , Alex Chilton , passed away earlier this year .
A NOLA.com interview with his wife revealed that “ at least twice in the week before his fatal heart attack , Chilton experienced shortness of breath and chills while cutting grass .
But he did not seek medical attention , Kersting said , in part because he had no health insurance . ”
Third , a Future of Music Coalition study released in May found that 33 % of musicians responding to a nationwide survey said they have no health insurance .
That ’s nearly double the national average of 17 % .
Among the uninsured , 86 % said they lack coverage because they ca n’t afford it .
These numbers are actually an improvement over the group ’s 2002 study , which found that 44 % were uninsured ( vs. 14 % of the general population ) .
Fourth , powerful Christian organizations continue to oppose healthcare reform for a variety of reasons , ranging from the conviction that blastocysts have more rights than living , suffering human beings to the canard that “ freedom ” has something to do with supporting private , for - profit interests .
Finally , this headline arrived yesterday , courtesy of Reuters : US scores dead last again in healthcare study .
The lead paragraph sums it up nicely :
Americans spend twice as much as residents of other developed countries on healthcare , but get lower quality , less efficiency and have the least equitable system , according to a report released on Wednesday .
There are a number of narratives one could probably craft from these data points .
An obvious one would lead us into a rant on the condition of our healthcare situation here in the greatest nation on Earth .
But you ’ve heard that one a thousand times in the last year alone and odds are your mind is made up .
I ’m not going to work up the lather needed for A ) a good sermon to the choir , or B ) a tree falling in the forest .
I suppose if you did some research into the life and times of artists like Chilton ( and perhaps Jay Bennett ) you could maybe generate a morality tale on the virtues of taking better care of yourself and perhaps devoting more of your money to your health and less to things that compromise your health .
Still , there are so many out there who have illnesses that are n’t the result of a decadent rock ‘n roll lifestyle that the story is one you ’d have to be pretty cold and myopic to invest in too deeply .
The narrative that I ’m pondering begins a little closer to home , though .
If you know me or have read my writing for any length of time you probably know that Don Dixon is one of my musical heroes , and he has been since I was in college and he was still with Arrogance .
For years I bought his music , played it to death , and when I was DJing I spun it for whatever audience happened to be within earshot .
I did n’t know Don personally , but we had a number of mutual friends and acquaintances , and I finally asked one of them ( I think it was Jeffrey Dean Foster ) to introduce us .
This resulted in one of the best interviews I ’ve ever had the privilege of conducting , and also in my making a new friend .
Turns out Don is as great a person as he is a musician and producer .
Then Don encountered some medical and financial issues .
Here ’s his explanation of what went down .
I had good coverage as an AFTRA member but the requirements to qualify kept increasing and my income through the union did n’t keep up .
I ran through my COBRA and did n’t find any insurance I could afford .
I had a heart attack and got to the hospital in time to be saved but the cost was massive and even with the generosity of hundreds of people all over the world , I was unable to keep from going bankrupt .
In defense of the hospital , they knew I was n’t covered when they admitted me and saved my life with no guarantee of payment .
I was having a heart attack and dying … had they sent me some where else , I would n’t have made it .
We are slowly digging our way out of this financial situation …
So , musicians have a hard time coming by insurance .
Sometimes they die as a result .
My friend nearly became one of them .
Our healthcare system is the worst in the developed world .
Because here in America , we have settled on a system ( and constructed rhetoric to sanctify it ) that places a very low priority on the lives of those whose art enriches our culture in ways that are vitally important to the spiritual life of the nation .
I know , I know – it ’s not that we ’ve made a decision that it ’s okay for musicians , per se , to drop dead if they ca n’t afford coverage .
It ’s people in general , and musicians happen to be a slightly more vulnerable and visible subset of the overall population .
But as a guy who grew up enraptured by music , mesmerized by visual art , entranced by the power of literature , I ca n’t help finding something especially tragic in the bargain that the American artist has to strike with society .
Our nation has never been anything but anti-intellectual , and that lack of concern , if not open disdain for pure knowledge is paralleled by a leveling in how we value the creative side of the brain .
Arts and music education has decreased by more than 50 % .
Federal policies , in redefining the public interest as “ what the public is interested in , ” have helped gut the very idea of art as an ennobling force .
These dynamics have corroded the assumption that there is such a thing as beauty apart from consumer value , such a thing as excellence that ’s fundamentally distinct from mere entertainment .
In short , we do n’t value art or artists .
Why ?
My colleague , Dr. Denny , notes that how we value things is learned behavior .
Where do these values come from ?
Well , we learn values at home and in schools .
Children who grow up religious learn values in church .
As the link just above makes clear , schools are teaching less and less in the way of art and music , and in doing so are communicating an implicit lesson that these things do n’t matter .
Art and music are treasured in some homes , but in an anti-intellectual society we ’re talking comparatively fewer than we ’d hope for .
Churches ?
I grew up Southern Baptist and the only art I ever recall being valued was music of the specifically religious sort .
Other traditions are different , though – the Catholic Church has , through the centuries , been a force behind some of the most glorious art ever produced .
But again , the artist needed to align with the goals of Rome , and nearly all of what we ’re talking about was in Europe – the American Catholic Church has never really spawned anything like the Renaissance , has it ?
Despite all this , America is capable of spectacular creative genius , especially in the popular arts , and I suppose you can note that the hardiest flowers are those that can thrive in the harshest environment .
Very few of history ’s Michaelangelos have emerged from the country club and the spa .
By that standard , maybe you ’d expect great art to arise in the places that value it the least ?
And it ’s not like the United States actually invented suffering for one ’s art .
Still , part of me finds it exceptionally callous , cruel and self - loathing when a culture turns its back on its spiritual well - being .
Matthew 16:26 says this :
For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
The same wisdom applies to the society as a whole .
A great nation must prove its excellence in many arenas , but it ’s fair to ask what value , ultimately , is a thriving economy , a world - changing science infrastructure or a dominant sporting complex if the collective being is a spiritual void .
When people die of poverty , of broad ideological indifference , when art is allowed to drop dead for want of a few dollars a month , there ’s a part of me that begins to think we ’re way beyond the banalities of mere politics .
When our organs of “ faith ” are used to prop up partisan institutions that transgress every pro-human ethical and moral code in history , the question is no longer “ how will we survive ? ”
Instead , it ’s “ why bother ? ”
I ’m not going to close on that note , though .
Instead , let ’s take a moment to celebrate the music .
This is Alex Chilton with Big Star singing “ September Gurls . ”
And finally , this is Don and the Jump Rabbits doing what may be my favorite Dixon song ever , “ The Night That Otis Died . ”
We love you Don , and we ’re glad you ’re still with us .

* Net impact on economy unclear , keeping M&A at bay
* BankUnited CEO :
No bearing on our thinking
* Regulators may give affected banks some breathing room
* FDIC auctions in region may draw fewer bidders ( Adds Trustmark comment )
By Paritosh Bansal and Joe Rauch
NEW YORK / CHARLOTTE , N.C. , July 14 ( Reuters ) -
As the oil from the BP Plc BP.L gusher laps onto U.S. Gulf Coast shores , it is also muddying the prospects of Southern bank mergers .
The worst offshore spill in U.S. history is likely to have a broad impact on banks serving communities in the region , hurting consumer credit and real estate values , both residential and commercial .
Every Gulf state -- Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and Texas -- has been soiled by the spill .
This could add to problems at banks like Columbus , Georgia - based Synovus Financial Corp SNV.N , which also has exposure to Florida .
But the disaster also is also likely to bring billions of dollars to the region from clean - up efforts and claims paid by BP and insurance companies .
More than two months into the spill , however , the net effect for local economies remains unclear , and buyers are likely to wait on the sidelines for now , banking experts said .
“ If you are an acquirer , are you going to double - down if you are already in the Gulf , or are you going to enter the Gulf just because of the spill ?
I do n’t think so , ” said Chip MacDonald , a financial institutions lawyer at Jones Day .
“ It is affecting people ’s ability to raise capital down there because people are saying , ‘ There is a risk . ’”
Miami Lakes , Florida - based BankUnited BKUNQ.PK , which wants to buy banks to grow , does not see the spill creating fresh opportunities , Chief Executive Officer John Kanas said .
“ I do n’t think that this is doing permanent damage to those institutions -- enough so that one would expect that to result in some M&A , ” Kanas said .
“ I do n’t think it will have a bearing on our thinking . ”
BankUnited , with $ 11 billion in assets , is backed by a consortium of private equity firms that include WL Ross & Co , Carlyle Group [ CYL.UL ] and Blackstone Group BX.N .
While markets like Florida are considered desirable over the long term as Americans retire and move to warmer climates , they have also been hurt badly by the real estate downturn .
The oil spill could push some already weak banks there over the edge .
“ The failures might happen anyway , but the spill sure does n’t help it , ” said Sterne Agee bank analyst Peyton Green .
CATALYST FOR SOME
This weakness could prove to be an opportunity for would - be buyers to get deals at a bargain rate .
“ The deals are going to be relatively small , ” Green said , “ but they will be meaningful for the banks looking for an entry into the state . ”
Green and his colleagues at the Birmingham , Alabama - based brokerage last week listed Synovus , Mobile , Alabama - based BancTrust Financial Group BTFG.O , Jackson , Mississippi - based Trustmark Corp TRMK.O and New Orleans - based Whitney Holding Corp WTNY .
O among banks that stand to lose from the spill .
Among would - be acquirers , the analysts named Little Rock , Arkansas - based Bank of the Ozarks OZRK.O , Gulfport , Mississippi - based Hancock Holding Co HBHC.O , Lafayette , Louisiana - based Iberiabank Corp IBKC.O and MidSouth Bancorp MSL.A .
“ We are closely monitoring the situation , but it is too early to predict the effect it will have on us , ” BancTrust Chief Financial Officer Mike Johnson said .
Late on Tuesday , Whitney announced a $ 5 million reserve for spill - related losses , saying the disaster “ tempered our optimism ” for the second half of the year .
A spokeswoman for Trustmark said its credit risk was limited to Florida ’s panhandle region , and the bank did not see it as a long - term issue .
Synovus declined to comment .
The other banks were not immediately available .
FEWER FAILURES ?
For now , the oil spill could actually slow the number of banks that go over the edge and are auctioned by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp as regulators may provide some breathing room to those hurt by the spill .
“ The regulators are committed to working with the industry to respond to issues that arise in the aftermath of the Gulf oil spill and to minimize disruption and burden on banks and credit unions in affected areas , ” U.S. bank regulators said in a joint statement on Wednesday .
Jones Day ’s MacDonald said the FDIC would also probably get better bids for failed banks when people have more insight into the impact of the spill , which could be months from now .
“ I do n’t think anybody is saying , ‘ Hey it ’s such a great opportunity , ’ because prices were already cheap , ” MacDonald said .
“ What brings back bank M&A is some stability and vision going forward as to balance sheet risk .
And an event like the oil spill is just the opposite . ”

Chief executive Tony Hayward hands responsibility for clean - up to American as new containment cap is placed on top of leak
BP is to hive off its Gulf of Mexico oil spill operation to a separate in - house business to be run by an American in a bid to isolate the " toxic " side of the company and dilute some of the anti-British feeling aimed at chief executive Tony Hayward , the company said today .
The surprise announcement was made during a teleconference with City and Wall Street analysts in which Hayward attempted to shrug off the personal criticism saying words " could not break his bones " .
BP has faced mounting anger in the US over the accident on 20 April when the Deepwater Horizon rig blew up and sank with the loss of 11 oil workers ' lives .
The Macondo well continues to spew out oil although a containment cap was placed on top of the leak today .
Hayward said it would take a further 48 hours to know whether it was successful .
Responsibility for the leaking well and the clean - up strategy will placed in the hands of Bob Dudley , one of the company 's most able directors .
Dudley , a US citizen , has been looking for a suitable role in the company since he was thrown out of Moscow in a battle with the Russian shareholders of the TNK - BP joint venture in the middle of 2008 .
Hayward said the clean - up business would be run separately by Dudley with his own staff but the finances and budget would come from the main BP group .
The BP chief executive said the purpose of the split was to allow Dudley to concentrate on the Gulf problem while he and other directors were not distracted from keeping the main business on track .
Hayward stressed , however , that his priority was sorting out all the wider fallout from the rig disaster and he apologised repeatedly for the loss of lives and ongoing damage to the beaches of the southern United States .
" Everyone at BP is heartbroken by this event , by the loss of life and by the damage to the environment and to the livelihoods of the people of the Gulf coast , " he said .
" It should not have happened and we are bound and determined to learn every lesson to try and ensure it never happens again .
We will stand by our obligations .
" We will halt this spill and put right the damage that has been done .
We will rebuild the confidence of the American people and the world in BP . "
The spill has brought verbal attacks on BP from everyone up to Barack Obama , who said yesterday during his third trip to the gulf region : " What I do n't want to hear is , when they 're spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising , that they 're nickeling and diming fishermen or small businesses here in the gulf who are having a hard time . "
In the face of such criticism , Hayward insisted that he had a " thick jacket " , adding : " They 've thrown some words at me , but I 'm a Brit .
Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me . "
He denied there was tension between him and BP 's new Swedish chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , saying both he and the wider board had been extremely supportive .
Svanberg has been accused of keeping himself out of the line of fire but has denied that , saying it was important for the purpose of a clear message that one person took the main role in explaining actions of the company .
Svanberg also ignored demands from two US senators that the company should halt the payments of any dividends to shareholders until the extent of its clean - up liabilities were known .
The chairman said no decision would be taken on future dividends until they had to , but stressed his belief that the company was in good financial shape , indicating it could do both .
He said : " We fully understand the importance of our dividend to our shareholders .
" Future decisions on the quarterly dividend will be made by the board , as they always have been , on the basis of the circumstances at the time . "
Hayward 's gaffes
" This was not our accident … This was Transocean 's rig .
Their systems .
Their people .
Their equipment . "
4 May
" The Gulf of Mexico is a big ocean .
The amount of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . "
14 May
" No one wants this over more than I do .
I would like my life back . "
30 May
" So far I 'm unscathed ... Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me . "

The G20 Summit in Toronto concluded with a declaration that the “ advanced economies have committed to fiscal plans that will at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt - to - GDP ratios by 2016 . ”
The non-binding agreement follows shortly after the Greek debt crisis , which in turn has sparked a crisis of confidence regarding other highly - indebted European nations , particularly Spain and Portugal .
In short , the G20 agreed to austerity .
The thinking is that “ the failure to implement [ fiscal ] consolidation where necessary would undermine confidence and hamper growth . ”
The dissenting view , advanced by President Barack Obama , holds that sufficient economic growth cannot be realized without further government stimulus .
Likely due to the president ’s influence , the declaration acknowledges the risk that “ synchronized fiscal adjustment across several major economies could adversely impact the recovery . ”
Yet , for all the reservations and qualifications in the declaration , it ’s clear the G20 is willing to take that risk .
While non-binding , the U.S. has still agreed to the deficit reduction goal , and that agreement , combined with the Democrats ’ waning political mandate , will make it difficult to pass another major stimulus bill .
Though we have n’t yet seen major federal cuts to social welfare programs ( i.e. ‘ austerity ’ ) , Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman argues that “ because Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress wo n’t authorize additional aid to state governments , that austerity is coming anyway , in the form of budget cuts at the state and local levels . ”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , states face severe budget gaps at least through 2012 , and they point out that federal assistance has mostly been used up , with only about $ 40 billion remaining for 2011 .
“ States will continue to struggle to find the revenue needed to support critical public services for a number of years , threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs [ … ]
When all is said and done , states will have to deal with total budget shortfalls of some $ 260 billion for 2011 and 2012 . ”
Without additional government stimulus , the burden of economic growth will fall overwhelmingly on the private sector .
The riskiness of this strategy is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that , in May , private employers only added 41,000 jobs – compared with an increase of 390,000 in government ( mostly temporary Census positions ) .
The official employment report for June is n’t released until Friday , but initial estimates put job gains in the private sector at a dismal 13,000 .
But these numbers are , of course , pre-Toronto .
The question is whether the deficit reduction programs will improve confidence in the private sector enough to stimulate growth and sustain the recovery .
Another Nobel Prize - winning economist , Joseph Stiglitz , says it will not .
“ The austerity measures that are occurring in Europe are increasing uncertainty .
The austerity measures that are occurring in Europe are leading to downgrades because business ( finance ) realizes that , if the government is n’t supporting these economies , growth is going to be lower , and , with growth lower , economic problems across the board are going to be greater . ”
Stiglitz called for more stimulus , particularly investment in areas likely to yield high returns , which he identified as public technology , infrastructure and education .
Likewise , he criticized current low - yield investments in military and war .
Barring further government investment , the forecasts from both Krugman and Stiglitz are grim .
Stiglitz said there is a “ very high risk ” of a double - dip recession , while Krugman worries that we are in the process of entering a full - blown depression .
Nearly 7 percent of sixth graders across the U.S. are severely obese , reveals a new study appearing online in the Journal of Adolescent Health .
“ Severe obesity in children requires attention because it is associated with high rates of risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease as children get older , ” said Marsha Marcus , Ph.D. , lead study author .
Researchers invited 6,365 middle - school children to health screenings at 42 middle schools in diverse U.S. locations .
Half of the children were minority students or eligible for free or reduced lunch .
Clinicians define severe obesity differently in children than they do in adults .
In children , the measurement used is a percentile of body mass index ( BMI ) for age and sex .
For this study , researchers considered children with a BMI in the 99th percentile to be severely obese - and 6.9 percent of students fell into this category .
“ Ethnic children appear to have higher rates of severe obesity , but rates for all children were high , ” said Marcus , who heads the Eating Disorders Program at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
Marlene Schwartz , Ph.D. , deputy director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University , said , “ The findings of this study are alarming because it shows there are even more children than we realized at medical risk due to excess weight . ”
She has no affiliation with the study .
Schwartz , who has worked with children in both clinical and research settings , added , “ In both situations , I have been surprised that some children who are severely obese according to their BMIs do not always look heavy .
As a culture , we have become used to seeing heavier children so the visual norm has shifted .
Because of this , many children are at risk of not receiving help since their parents do not see them as obese . ”
While no simple answer exists , “ Parents need to talk to their children ’s doctors and seek treatment for children with severe obesity , ” Marcus said .

An underwater robot collided Wednesday with a cap placed atop BP PLC 's leaking deep - water well in the Gulf of Mexico , temporarily slowing the company 's ambitious plan to nearly double the amount of oil it captures each day at the offshore site .
The underwater collision forced BP to halt operation of the Discoverer Enterprise , the larger of two ships capturing oil where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers .
A mile - long pipe from the cap to the ship helps recovery crews siphon ...
It 's a face palm moment .
Republican ( naturally ! )
Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , also the chair of the Republican Governors Association and a name floated as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , wants us to know that worse that the oil spill currently gushing tens of thousands of oil every day into the fragile eco-system of the Gulf of Mexico and wetlands of the Gulf Coast is the mean ol ' Obama administration 's moratorium on further gulf oil drilling
How do you reason with someone who thinks it's his God - given right to have cheap gas ?
I honestly do n't know if Barbour is just being a partisan hack or if he is really just so naively stupid as to the impact that he does n't get that cheap gas is really the least of his worries now .
How does he think the whole country be impacted by this ?
Why would an undersea spill be worse ?
One outcome could be the expansion in size and extension in time of a seasonal " dead zone " that already plagues the Gulf of Mexico as a result of industrial pollutants and agricultural run-off from the Mississippi River .
While huge Gulf of Mexico algae blooms help to naturally clean up the Midwest 's factory emissions and wasted fertilizer , such a process does n't come without a cost to the ecosystem .
Every spring , in a condition known as hypoxia , this fast growing algae depletes large sections of the Gulf 's water column of the oxygen crucial for other life forms to survive there .
The BP oil spill is likely to exacerbate this problem , as natural oil - eating microbes swarming over undersea oil plumes could cause or add to hypoxic conditions in otherwise teeming swaths of the Gulf .
According to NOAA researcher Samantha Joye , the undersea oil poses a direct threat to large marine wildlife , such as fish , sharks and cetaceans , and also to the tiny stuff , including zooplankton , shrimp , corals , crabs and worms .
By endangering these latter populations , the foundation of the marine food chain , the oil could have chronic long - term effects on the wider Gulf ecosystem , including the industries -- more shrimp and oysters come from the Gulf than anywhere else in the world -- that rely on them .
Another worry is how the chemical dispersants being used to break up the undersea oil will impact the Gulf 's ecosystems and inhabitants .
The dispersant 's ingredients are a trade secret closely held by the company that makes it , and therefore have not been vetted by marine biologists to determine their safety for use in such a large application .
It also remains to be seen what impact the tiny oil droplets left in the dispersant 's wake will have .
It could actually be worse for the undersea environment to break the oil up into tiny droplets ( which is done to try to make it easier for microbes to digest them ) .
Beyond all these undersea environmental effects , the oil is also starting to wash up into coastal wetlands already besieged by overdevelopment , pollution and the lingering effects of Hurricane Katrina .
Simply put , we have no idea the long term effects on the wetlands .
I 've read some reports that even if the oil only penetrates 15 % of the wetlands , that number equates to the coastline and while it 's a relatively small percentage overall of the ecosystem , it could mean as much as 80 % of the wildlife that makes the wetlands their home .
When we 've killed off the bottom of the food chain , it endangers those higher up on the food chain .
How important is that $ 3.00 / gallon gas gonna be when all that destruction works up the food chain to us ?
Transcripts below the fold
MR. GREGORY : Right .
Well , to the -- to that point , Governor , what 's worse , the moratorium or the effects of this spill on the region ?
And I talk about the moratorium on offshore drilling .
GOV .
BARBOUR : Well , the moratorium .
The skill -- the spill 's a terrible thing , but the moratorium is a , is a terrible thing that 's not only bad for the region , it 's bad for America .
Thirty percent of the oil produced in the United States comes out of the Gulf of Mexico , and 80 percent of that is from deepwater drilling .
So that 's a fourth of all of our oil .
As , as John may have said or somebody said , this is going to drive the price of energy up .
Now , there are people like Congressman Markey whose bill in Congress , the -- that mostly effects electricity , would drive up , up energy costs .
As President Obama said , under -- he told a San Francisco paper , and I quote , " Under my cap and trade plan , electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket . "
One of the things President Obama and I agree on .
This moratorium is going to have the same sort of effect .
The App Store is one the most important reasons the iPhone is as successful as it is .
Yet for all its success , it 's a really tiny business for Apple .
The App Store has only kicked in 1 % of Apple 's overall profits since the App Store opened in June 2008 , according to an analysis by Piper Jaffray 's Gene Munster .
Apple app sales total $ 1.43 billion , with Apple getting 30 % , or $ 429 million .
After you factor out payment to the credit card companies and storage and delivery , Apple 's gross profit is $ 189 million .
Apple 's overall gross profit since the App Store launched is $ 33.7 billion .
This comparatively small profit is by design .
The App Store was never supposed to be a big business .
Its job is to sell more iPhones , iPod touches , and iPads .
And so far , it 's doing that spectacularly well .
Munster estimates 81 % of apps downloaded are free , and the average price for a top - 50 paid app is $ 1.49 .
Here 's how the price of an app breaks out .

What would you get if you crossed a whale with a shark ?
Maybe something like Leviathan melvillei , a long - extinct , hypercarnivorous whale with teeth longer than any T. rex ever had .
L. melvillei — a newly described sperm whale named to honor Herman Melville , author of the whaling novel Moby - Dick — lived between 12 million and 13 million years ago , says Olivier Lambert , a vertebrate paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris .
The aptly named leviathan is known only from remains of a jawbone and skull , which is about 75 percent complete , Lambert and his colleagues note in the July 1 Nature .
By comparing those fossils , which were found in southern Peru in November 2008 , with more complete remains of other species , the researchers estimate that Leviathan measured between 44 and 57 feet in length , slightly smaller than adult male sperm whales of today .
The longest of Leviathan ’s teeth measure about 14 inches including the root , more than 40 percent longer than those of today ’s sperm whales .
And , Lambert notes , the longest tooth of Sue , one of the largest Tyrannosaurus rex specimens yet found , measures only 10.6 inches from root to tip .
Wear patterns indicate that Leviathan ’s teeth sheared past each other during a bite , a sign that the beast could rip chunks of flesh from prey .
Lambert and his colleagues speculate that Leviathan fed on medium - sized baleen whales , whose blubber would have been a rich source of calories .
“ This is a pretty exciting discovery , ” says Erich Fitzgerald , a vertebrate paleontologist at Museum Victoria in Melbourne , Australia .
Leviathan represents “ one thing we do n’t have in the oceans today — a macropredator , a hypercarnivorous whale . ”
Modern sperm whales feed largely on invertebrates such as giant squid , but have been known to feed on fish and other creatures as well .
The extremely robust , deeply - rooted structure of Leviathan ’s teeth strongly suggests that the creature fed on large , presumably struggling bony prey like sharks do .

Image caption Most experts agreed human activity was affecting the climate system
Some 98 % of climate scientists that publish research on the subject support the view that human activities are warming the planet , a study suggests .
It added there was little disagreement among the most experienced scientists .
But climate sceptics questioned the findings , saying that publication in scientific journals was not a fair test of expertise .
The findings have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study 's authors said they found " immense " differences in both the expertise and scientific prominence of those who supported the " primary tenets " of latest assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and those who were sceptical of the IPCC 's findings .
In general , they added , the researchers who were convinced of the human impact on climate change had published twice as many papers as their sceptical counterparts , and were cited in other people 's research two to three times more often .
It 's typical of this broad - brush study to make such wide ranging claims similar to the infamous ' the debate is over ' Professor Hans von Storch , University of Hamburg
Lead author William Anderegg , from Stanford University in California , US , said the findings suggested that not all experts were equal in what they claimed .
" The researchers who are convinced ( by the IPCC 's assessment reports ) have a lot more experience in climate research and have published a lot more papers in the scientific literature and are generally well respected in their field , " he said .
" And it also demonstrates the converse that those who are sceptical of the IPCC 's claims , in general , know a lot less about the climate system . "
Mr Anderegg and his colleagues drew from a list of 908 researchers who had contributed to research used by the IPCC and have signed statements broadly in support of the UN body 's assessments .
On the sceptical side , they chose 475 scientists from a list of 11 major sceptical declarations and open letters .
The researchers said they felt the need to carry out the survey because of the growing public perception that scientific opinion was divided on the issue following recent scandals , such as " climategate " at the UK's University of East Anglia and the use of non-peer reviewed literature in the IPCC findings .
" We really felt that the state of the scientific debate was so far removed from the state of the public discourse and we felt that a good quantitative , rigorous comparison of this would put to rest the notion that the scientists ' disagree ' about global warming , " Mr Anderegg told BBC News .
' Broad - brush study '
Sceptical groups , however , argued that publication in scientific journals was not a fair test of expertise .
They said that those who choose which papers to publish favoured research that supported the IPCC 's view , and suggested that the new study was tautologous .
Professor Hans von Storch , from the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg , said : " You have to ask yourself - which are the the tenets of ( the human induced climate change ) outlined by the IPCC the ' " convinced " groups of scientists agree with .
" There is a core of assertions , dealing with the effect of greenhouse gases on temperature and sea level , which enjoy general agreement , " Professor von Storch told BBC News .
" While others , for instance , related to the Himalaya glaciers , the changing tropical storms and their damages or the fate of Greenland , are heavy contested .
" It 's typical of this broad - brush study to make such wide ranging claims similar to the infamous ' the debate is over ' . "
Dr Sonja Boehmer - Christiansen , from the University of Hull , UK , added : " Who judges expertise and prominence ?
It looks to me that the authors belong to an IPCC supporting group that must count as believers and belong to the beneficiaries of the man-made warming scare . "

Hundreds of thousands of credit cardholders ’ accounts have been zinged in recent years by credit card companies based in part on where consumers shopped , what they bought , who they bought from or who held their mortgages , according to a new federal report issued Friday .
The cardholders were hit with credit limit reductions , interest rate hikes or had their accounts closed by issuers who told federal regulators that decisions to clamp down on credit to these consumers were based on tracking their spending and loan data .
Among the consumer shopping practices that triggered negative account changes :
The location of where transactions were made .
The identity of the merchant processing the transaction .
The type of credit card transaction .
Identity of the mortgage lender .
Here ’s a breakdown of what actions were taken against cardholders due to data mining , and how many consumers were affected ( story continues below ) :
WHAT YOU BUY , WHERE YOU BUY SOMETIMES HELD AGAINST YOU Congress ordered the Federal Reserve to study whether banks were mining credit card transaction data — such as what people bought , where they bought it , who they bought it from — and using it to take punitive action against those customers .
After surveying the 175 institutions that issue 98 percent of the general purpose credit cards in the U.S. , the Fed answered : Yes , it ’s rare , but it happens .
Here are the actions the banks took , how many of the 175 banks took them , and how many customers were affected .
Action taken … …
By this many banks … …
Against this many customers Reduced credit limit
6 ( including 5 of the 25 largest banks ) 323,714 Raised interest rate 2 ( including 2 of the 25 largest banks ) 194,246 Closed a credit card account
4 ( including 4 of the 25 largest banks ) 416 Source : Federal Reserve , “ Report to the Congress on Reductions of Consumer Credit Limits Based on Certain Information as to Experience or Transactions of the Consumer , ” May 2010
The 72 - page report , conducted by the Federal Reserve Board , was quick to point out that profiling card users ’ spending habits was rare among credit card issuers and actually affected a relatively small number of card users .
Still , the report gives the first official glimpse at how some in the credit card industry have used a technique called behavioral modeling to mine spending data for clues about whether customers will default on their credit card loans .
The types of behavior that might trigger adverse credit card changes could include changes in spending habits .
If you shop at pawn shops , casinos , discount stores and low - end retailers when you have n’t frequented these establishments before , it might signal an increased risk of defaulting on credit card loans .
Having a troubled mortgage lender in a ZIP code full of foreclosures might mean your net worth is rapidly dwindling .
Buying retread tires could also hint at someone just scraping by .
Or , critics say , the changes in behavior could mean nothing but you blew off some steam , shopped with a new friend or found yourself a super bargain .
The Fed report confirmed a practice that was widely reported and criticized by consumer groups :
Where you shop and the type of people who shop at that same store could impact your credit limit .
The Fed report recounts the response of an unnamed credit card issuer : “ In considering whether to reduce the credit line of a given cardholder , this issuer considered the performance and spending patterns of other cardholders with similar credit - related characteristics who shopped at the merchants where the given cardholder had made purchases . ”
Two credit card issuers reported using merchant category codes and geographic locations of stores along with the customer ’s payment history to develop risk models .
“ A third issuer grouped all charges into a small number of very broad categories and considered the performance of its other customers within those categories in deciding on line reductions for a given individual , ” according to the report .
The report was a mandate of the Credit CARD Act of 2009 .
It required the Fed to investigate whether credit card companies engaged in these practices at any time during a three - year period before the credit card reform law was enacted .
Is it profiling ?
Members of Congress , led by Rep. Maxine Waters of California , were concerned after reports surfaced in 2009 about credit cardholders whose credit limits were reduced and interest rates jacked up because they began to shop at discount stores .
Other consumers complained they may have been hit with less favorable credit terms based on where they lived .
Waters , who was not available for comment on the new Fed report , suggested last year the practices might be a form of “ profiling , ” targeting certain groups for different treatment .
For those institutions that have used such information , the proportion of cardholders actually affected has been small .
Waters said the actions also appeared to border on credit card redlining , a controversial practice used in the insurance or mortgage industries during the 1960s and 1970s to keep African Americans and other minority groups from purchasing homes in certain neighborhoods or targeting some areas for discriminatory treatment .
Today , federal fair housing and equal opportunity lending laws ban such treatment .
The Fed report was based on a survey of 175 financial institutions , including the 100 largest issuers of general - purpose credit cards .
Together , the banks , credit unions and lending firms included in the survey issue about 98 percent of the open - end consumer credit cards in the United States .
The Fed sent written surveys to the 175 lenders in November 2009 .
Credit card issuers were asked if they had engaged in any of a list of practices between Nov. 30 , 2006 and Nov. 30 , 2009 .
The CARD
Act requested information for a three - year period , but because banks are required to keep data for only 25 months , the Fed ’s results are based on the shorter reporting period of Nov. 1 , 2007 to Nov. 30 , 2009 .
Participation in the survey was mandatory .
In addition , Fed investigators interviewed other banking regulators and major credit card issuers as part of the study .
The Fed ’s report does not identify any of the credit card issuers involved in the study .
Of the major credit cards issuers , only American Express acknowledged in 2009 that it had used information about where consumers shop to lower credit limits .
But after negative news coverage and public outcry over the practice , the company said it would discontinue the practice .
The Fed said that several of the card issuers in the survey said they would discontinue monitoring practices because of negative publicity about their methods .
Of the 175 institutions , six — including five identified as among the largest commercial banks — indicated they had engaged in at least one of the questionable practices that had contributed to the decision to lower the cardholders ’ credit limits .
Of the six issuers , two also said they had raised interest rates and four said they closed accounts based on cardholders ’ behavior .
No credit unions in the survey reported using any of the practices .
Relatively rare practice
The proportion of cardholders affected was small compared to the total number of U.S. credit cards and the cases where profiling behavior or shopping habits were used were “ relatively rare ” incidents .
“ For those institutions that have used such information , the proportion of cardholders actually affected has been small , ” according to the report .
It cited the example of two credit card issuers that together have 53 million active accounts .
Only about 340,000 of those accounts had credit limit reductions — for any reason — in November 2009 .
Of those , only about 1,900 accounts had credit limits reduced because of any of the questionable monitoring practices during that month .
All credit card issuers said the decisions to reduce credit or increase rates were not based solely on the spending data .
The issuers weigh a number of factors when reviewing accounts , including past payment history .
According to the Fed : “ Discussions with card issuers and their federal supervisors found that other metrics used to manage credit risk , such as measures of late payment behavior or measures of cash advance activity , are much more important factors in reducing lines or setting interest rates than the practices ” reviewed in the study .
“ Moreover , significant changes in broad economic conditions can be important factors leading to changes in account terms or account closures . ”
If the delinquency arose from ‘ excessive ’ gambling , they would cut the available credit line or close the account .
The report revealed that some credit card issuers are also monitoring other types of transactions not specifically requested for review in the CARD Act .
Some issuers said they consider how much consumers spend and how frequently they use their credit cards as indications that they may be at greater risk of defaulting on their credit card loans .
Four banks said gambling activity of cardholders who were behind on their payments was a factor in reducing credit limits .
“ If the delinquency arose from ‘ excessive ’ gambling , they would cut the available credit line or close the account , ” according to the report .
Cash advances as red flag
In addition , “ One card issuer indicated that , for some of its new cardholders , it monitors cash advance activity in conjunction with card purchases at certain types of merchants ( for example , jewelry and electronic goods stores ) .
According to this issuer , it has found such behaviors among new cardholders to be an early warning of elevated credit risk . ”
In another instance detailed in the report , a credit card issuer admitted it had lowered credit limits on cardholders with low credit scores if they did not shop at the retailer affiliated with the card issuer .
“ This issuer reported that it found that cardholders with lower scores who did not shop at the affiliated retailer had elevated delinquency rates , ” according to the Fed .
For those uneasy about the amount of personal data that is tracked , the Fed offers this explanation of the tracking methods used by industry : “ Card issuers that make use of transaction - related items in adjusting account terms tend to rely on fairly general metrics — for example , the total amount spent on a purchase rather than the amount spent on a specific item ; broad merchant category codes , such as hardware stores , entertainment establishments , or grocery stores , rather than a specific merchant identity ; or general geographic location of the merchant rather than the street address , census block group or census - tract designation , or local five - or nine - digit ZIP code of the business . ”
Racial discrimination unclear
The report concluded it was “ impossible to know ” whether there was a link between negative credit card changes and demographics , such as the race or income level of the cardholder .
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( also called Regulation B ) prevents lenders from collecting information about the race or ethnicity , among other things , of borrowers .
However , a 2008 Boston Fed study by economist Ethan Cohen found a potential link when he studied U.S. Census tract data based on the ZIP codes that are provided on credit reports .
People living in white neighborhoods were more likely to be approved for new credit cards than those living in black neighborhoods .
Fraud detection tool
The Fed made no specific recommendations , but urged Congress to be cautious in writing any law to ban or limit monitoring of cardholder spending .
The same tools used to monitor spending habits for credit reduction purposes are also vital in detecting fraudulent use of credit cards .
“ Transaction - specific information , such as the identity of the merchant or the amount of a charge , is an essential element of fraud detection and prevention systems , ” the Fed report notes .
“ In this context , credit card issuers routinely use transaction - related information to temporarily block access to accounts or to close accounts until the cardholder can be contacted to verify the authenticity of the transaction . ”
“ The identity of the merchant , the merchant location , and the size and timing of charges are all central elements of fraud detection and prevention systems , ” according to the report .

Finansminister Sigbjørn Johnsen vil rote i lønningsposen til ansatte i finanssektoren .
-
Helt på trynet , sier fondsforvalter Jan Petter Sissener .
I kjølvannet av finanskrisen har blant annet G - 20 og EU gått inn for å detaljstyre lønnsordningene i finanssektoren .
Nå kan også norske arbeidsplasser bli rammet av ordningen .
De nye reglene ble sendt ut på høring på fredag .
Får Johnsen det som han vil , kan lønnen til ansatte i finanssektoren bli en helt annen fra og med 2011 .
Hovedtanken bak myndighetenes forslag er at finanssektoren ikke skal gi incentiver til å ta for høy risiko eller ha høyt fokus på kortsiktig vinning , som kan føre til finansiell ustabilitet .
Reglene innebærer blant annet at halvparten av bonusen må være i form av aksjer .
Ansatte med lederstilling eller med ansvar for selskapets risikoeksponering , vil i de fleste tilfeller få en høyere andel fast lønn og mindre andel bonus .
Har du kontrollansvar , skal ikke lønnen din bli påvirket av resultatet .
« Dersom variabel godtgjørelse benyttes , skal minst halvparten av årlig variabel godtgjørelse enten gis i form av aksjer eller andre egenkapitalinstrumenter utstedt av foretaket eller et annet foretak i konsernet , med en frist for når egenkapitalinstrumentene kan disponeres » , heter det i notatet .

- Renner over for meg
- Dette var kraftig kost .
Her blandet myndighetene seg inn i noe de verken har kompetanse på eller har noe med .
Det renner over for meg , sier fondsforvalter Jan Petter Sissener tydelig irritert til NA24 .
Sissener frykter at vi får et særnorsk regelverk som vil gjøre finansnæringen ytterligere handikappet , slik at de flinkeste flytter utenlands .
- Hvorfor skal myndighetene drive detaljstyring av våre virksomheter ?
Hverken norske meglerfirmaer eller forvaltningsmiljøer har noen gang hatt behov for , eller mottatt , statlig hjelp .
Det er ikke Norge som er årsaken til krisen ; at vi skal straffes for det er helt på trynet .
Forslaget er ganske ironisk i og med at Statens Pensjonsfond – Utland er lønnsledende innen forvaltningsindustrien , sier Sissener .
- For mange rammes
De nye reglene som er sendt ut til høring vil gjelde et stort spekter av næringer – både alle norske banker , finansieringsforetak , forsikringsselskaper , pensjonsforetak , verdipapirforetak , forvaltningsselskaper for verdipapirfond og holdingsselskaper i finanskonsern .
Per Broch Mathisen , administrerende direktør i Norsk Fondsmeglerforbund , reagerer på at så mange næringer blir rammet .
- Jeg er overrasket over at nedslagsfeltet er så bredt .
Sigbjørn Johnsen går for langt , sier Mathisen til NA24 .
Mathisen mener forslaget er dårlig begrunnet , og strider imot Kredittilsynets egne anbefalinger .
Sissener er enig , og mener detaljstyring av lønningene eventuelt bør begrenses til bankansatte .
Om reglene trer i kraft vil ikke Sissener ta myndighetenes reguleringer for god fisk .
- Ingen skal få utbetalt halve bonusen i form av aksjer i Sissener AS ! , sier Sissener .

Remember back in February when everyone was going crazy about Myriad Group ’s new optimizations to Android ’s Dalvik Virtual Machine ?
Well they have n’t slowed down just because Google baked the same optimizations into Android 2.2 .
They ’ve announced that they ’ll soon be releasing their version of Dalvik for free in conjunction with MIPS on their community site for MIPS - based devices .
When we saw the demo of the technology at the Mobile World Congress , it reportedly only offered ~ 2 x more performance than the original Dalvik VM .
Now , they ’re claiming to have achieved a performance boost of 5x , putting it right around the range that Google ’s reporting with the JIT - enabled vession .
From the sound of it , there really does n’t seem to be much of a difference between Dalvik Turbo and the JIT - enabled Dalvik that Google ’s bringing , but their one claim to fame is that this will be compatible with all versions of Android from 1.0 ( ha ! ) all the way up to 2.2 and beyond .
We ’ll update you when this finally becomes available .

The liberal thesis that capital punishment is brutal because it condones murder is fallacious because it takes the isolated act of killing the murderer out of context . "
[ Libertarian Review , June 1978 ]
There are few issues that have gripped the general public more compellingly in recent years than the death penalty .
Throughout the country , and especially in urban areas , a rising tide of violent crime , mugging , and murder has led to an outpouring of public sentiment for revival of the death penalty for homicide .
If for no other reason than this one , the libertarian movement — especially the Libertarian Party — must address itself directly to the capital - punishment question , for only by addressing squarely the important political issues of the day can we make libertarianism relevant to the public .
There is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the public , regardless of creed or occupation , vehemently supports the return of the death penalty , ending the abolition that had been put over by liberal intellectuals and their judicial sympathizers .
In New York , liberal Governor Hugh Carey has risked his political neck by vetoing a bill restoring the death penalty ; in California , former Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis has taken a leading role in the Republican race for governor by championing the return of the death penalty for murder .
Even the august Supreme Court of the United States has kept its eye on the election returns .
In 1972 , it banned any capital punishment on the curious new constitutional doctrine that it violated the Eighth Amendment 's prohibition of " cruel and unusual punishment . "
In 1976 and 1977 , however , it retreated to the point of allowing the death penalty for murder alone ( and not for rape or kidnapping ) , but only where its imposition had not been mandated by the legislature .
Thirty - three states now have death penalty statutes , which continue to be tested in the courts .
The Libertarian Party , including myself on the platform committee , has tended to shy away from the capital punishment question until a broad consensus on punishment theory is attained within the libertarian movement .
Opinion within the movement ranges far and wide , from the ultrapacifist view that all punishment must be abandoned , to the " hanging judge " position that any infraction of someone 's private property , however minor , shows that the criminal has no respect for property rights and therefore that this minor aggressor deserves to be executed .
But we can afford to wait no longer to come to grips with the capital - punishment question .
This has become a pressing question in political life , more than just a fascinating problem in high libertarian theory .
We must resolve the issue within our ranks and then advance our views in the public debate .
In my view , it is not an accident that there is very little support among the public for the death penalty except for the crime of murder — even though in 18th - century England , for example , the death penalty was employed in cheerful abandon for numerous crimes .
I believe that the instincts of the public are correct on this issue : namely , that the punishment should fit the crime ; i.e. , that punishment should be proportional to the crime involved .
The theoretical justification for this is that an aggressor loses his rights to the extent that he has violated the rights of another human being .
If A steals $ 10,000 from B , he should be forced , not only to return the $ 10,000 ( the " restitutionist " position , with which most libertarians would agree ) , but he also loses his rights to his own $ 10,000 ; that is , he should be forced to pay the victim $ 10,000 for his aggression .
But if A loses his right to $ 10,000 , should B , the victim , also have the right to have A executed for his crime ?
Surely not , for then the punishment would be grossly disproportionate .
The criminal would then lose an important part of his own rights , and B — the previous victim — and his accomplices , would now be committing their own act of aggression upon A .
It is relatively easy to allot monetary penalties in the case of theft .
But what about such a crime as murder ?
Here , in my view , the murderer loses precisely the right of which he has deprived another human being : the right to have one 's life preserved from the violence of another person .
The murderer therefore deserves to be killed in return .
Or , to put it more precisely , the victim — in this case his surrogate , in the form of his heir or the executor of his estate should have the right to kill the murderer in return .
Libertarians can no longer afford to wait to come to grips with capital punishment .
It has become too pressing a problem .
" In all cases , it should be the victim — not ' society ' or ' its ' district attorney — who should bring charges and decide on whether or not to exact punishment . "
The liberal thesis that capital punishment is brutal because it condones murder is fallacious because it takes the isolated act of killing the murderer out of context : the context of the previous murder that the aggressor had committed .
We are familiar with the common charge that liberals , in weeping over the murderer , willfully ignore the far more tragic violence that he committed on his victim ; and this charge is surely correct .
Another common liberal complaint is that the death penalty does not deter murder from being committed .
All sorts of statistics are slung back and forth trying to " prove " or disprove this claim .
While it is impossible to prove the degree of deterrence , it seems indisputable that some murders would be deterred by the death penalty .
Sometimes the liberal argument comes perilously close to maintaining that no punishment deters any crime — a manifestly absurd view that could easily be tested by removing all legal penalties for nonpayment of income tax and seeing if there is any reduction in the taxes paid .
( Wanna bet ? )
Furthermore , the murderer himself is certainly " deterred " from any repetition of his crime — and quite permanently .
But in any case , note that I did not couch my argument in utilitarian terms of deterrence of future crime ; my argument was based on basic rights and the requirements of justice .
The libertarian takes his stand for individual rights not merely on the basis of social consequences , but more emphatically on the justice that is due to every individual .
Some states provide for the death penalty only for murderers of policemen or prison guards , and not for any other cases of homicide .
The libertarian can only regard such statutes as an obscenity .
To levy capital punishment solely for killers of government officials , but not for murderers of private citizens , can only be considered a grotesque travesty of justice .
Does this mean that the government proposes to protect fully only the rights of its own members , and not of anyone else ?
So far we have gone all the way with the proponents of the death penalty , ranging ourselves with the instincts of the general public and against the sophistries of the liberal intellectual elite .
But there is an important difference .
For I have been stressing throughout the right of the victim , not that of " society " or the state .
In all cases , it should be the victim — not " society " or " its " district attorney — who should bring charges and decide on whether or not to exact punishment .
" Society " has no right and therefore no say in the matter .
The state now monopolizes the provision of defense , judicial , and punishment service .
So long as it continues to do so , it should act as nothing more and nothing less than an agent for guarding and enforcing the rights of each person — in this case , of the victim .
If , then , a crime is committed , it should be up to the victim to press charges or to decide whether the restitution or punishment due him should be exacted by the state .
The victim should be able to order the state not to press charges or not to punish the victim to the full extent that he has the right to do so .
Thus , suppose that A aggresses against B ; but B is a pacifist or does n't believe in punishment for whatever reason ; the State should not be able , as it is now , to continue to prosecute A in the name of " society " even though the victim may be urging otherwise .
Or , similarly , the criminal should be able to go to the victim and buy his way out of his prosecution or punishment ; for in that case , the victim has agreed voluntarily to allow the criminal to pay him monetary restitution in lieu of other sanctions against him .
In short , within the limits of his proportional right of punishment , the victim should have the sole decision how much , if at all , to exercise that right .
But , it has been pointed out , how can we leave the decision up to the victim in the case of murder , precisely the one crime which removes the victim totally from the scene ?
Can we really trust his heir or executor to pursue the victim 's interests fully and wholeheartedly , especially if we allow the criminal to buy his way out of punishment , in dealing directly with the heir ?
This , however , is not an insuperable problem .
The answer is to deal with the problem in the same way as any wishes of a deceased person are obeyed : in his will .
The deceased can instruct heirs , courts , and any other interested parties on how he would wish a murderer of his to be treated .
In that case , pacifists , liberal intellectuals , et al. can leave clauses in their wills instructing law enforcement authorities not to kill , or even not to press charges against a criminal in the event of their murder ; and the authorities would be required to obey .
As a practical matter , in the here and now , and until such wills become a matter of common practice , libertarians can enter the political arena with the following clear - cut position , a position that not only endorses the fervent instincts of the general public , but will also instruct them still further on libertarian principles , namely , that we advocate capital punishment for all cases of murder , except in those cases where the victim has left a will instructing his heirs and assigns not to levy the death penalty on any possible murder .
In that way , the possessors of a liberal or pacifist conscience can go about their business assured that they could never be a party to capital punishment ; while the rest of us can have the capital punishment we would like to have , free from the interference of liberal busybodies .
This article originally appeared as " The Plumb Line : The Capital Punishment Question " in the Libertarian Review , Vol. 7 , No. 5 ( June 1978 ) , pp. 13 –14 .
The recent take - up of oil through the cap and the LMRP to the Drillship Enterprise was at a daily rate of 15,400 bd .
This latter is a Well Testing Service Vessel ( WTSV ) Dynamic Positioning ship , which has systems for the reception and processing of fluids from well completion , stimulation and repair .
For those interested in well flow rates , that measuring capability is among its capabilities .
• Reception of the products from the well via flexible hoses connecting the well to the production system installed on the ship .
• Process and separate water , wasted and un-wasted chemicals , gas , crude oil and solids .
The water will be stored in the WTSV ’s tanks and later re-injected into industrial waste well or offloaded to a processing facility onshore .
•
The crude and gas will be measured in quantity and quality .
The combination may be returned to the export line , or if this last is not available , the gas will be flared and the crude stored in the WTSV ’s tanks to later be exported to an onshore or an offshore offloading terminal .
•
The solids are stored in containers to be disposed to shore .
•
Crude ranges are from low to high ( 12 to 43 ° ) API .
Pressures up to 10,000 psi at the well head .
It has been suggested that it might arrive on site on the 19th June .
The Loch Rannoch should arrive a few days earlier , releasing the Drillship Enterprise , which , I suspect , has other things that it might now be doing .
The Toisa Pisces was formerly a cable - laying vessel , and is not a Floating Production , Storage and Offloading unit ( FPSO ) .
My main topic for this post , however , is not the possible change is the fleet over the well , but rather some thoughts on how to avoid this happening again .
There were likely a cascade of several errors , each of which alone would not have led to the disaster , but cumulatively they did .
So how do we stop it happening again ?
In some ways the problem is similar to that the Mining Industry faces after more than twice the number of deaths ( 29 ) at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia in April .
In both cases , there were safety concerns reflected in the numbers of citations that the companies had received relative to other companies .
So how does one install a different attitude in those who work to produce the fuel that we all need ?
To a degree , it has to be done through the imposition of regulations that enforce the concept of safety in daily working life .
Included in those regulations should be the appropriate recommended practices for carrying out different tasks in the operation .
But even with those regulations in place , they are only as good as the enforcement of them .
If my memory serves , you could not become an Inspector of Mines in Britain during the National Coal Board years , unless you had a First Class Certificate of Competency ( which is the examination that allows you to manage a mine ) .
The standards of education and training for inspectors must be high , and they need to require a reputable image .
The problems , in part , for both industries , are that the fossil industry historically has been cyclic in nature .
Often driven by the price of oil , when that price is high , there are lots of jobs , and both coal and oil boom .
The price falls , times get tight , and lots of folk get laid off .
It has happened more than once in my career , as we have students go from having many job offers , to students coming back for graduate degrees because there was no work in the industry .
The employees that are laid off go find work in other , less cyclic industries .
And so when the next boom comes around , they are no longer available .
Furthermore , the teaching departments at the Universities have closed .
It is as a result of this boom and bust cycle that there is a dearth of middle management in many companies that work in the fossil fuel business .
For many years , they were not hiring , and the folk that they now need as long - time trained and experienced individuals do not exist in large numbers .
The number of both mining and petroleum engineering schools have fallen , and student enrollments , until the recent rise in the price of oil ( the $ 140 one ) were bringing other departments closer to that action .
At one time , for example , Leeds University in the UK had one of the largest mining departments .
At that time , it was housed in a building that was funded by those in the Industry in 1928 .
That building is now occupied by the Art Department and somewhere – not quite sure where ( this from the alumni office and the secretary in the building that houses the remaining odd faculty member ) – there is still someone that teaches the odd course ( he was out ) .
There is only one other Mining School in the UK , and it studies hard rock mining at Exeter ( used to be Cambourne School of Mines ) .
The Old Mining Building at Leeds
The commemorative plaque
It is hard to criticize University leaders , who must look to where the students are , and which faculty hire will bring the best return to the University .
In recent years that has not been within the ability of the fossil fuel departments , and so they are closing – though the demand for their product is now rising again .
It is one of those interesting items to note that the latest reviews of world oil supply are beginning to suggest , increasingly , that the world is approaching if not past the point of peak global oil production .
That will require more mining and petroleum engineers , though at places like Leeds ( my alma mater ) , they will likely only be able to produce the modern version of Thomas Hair , to record the modern version of his “ Art of Mining , ” rather than the subjects of that art .
So what does all this have to do with regulation and responsibility ?
Well , it is very difficult to maintain high quality folk in industries that go through severe manpower cycles .
When regulations are severely enforced under one administration and then almost neglected in another , either because the industry is in disfavor , or the apple of the administration ’s eye , it is hard to keep the regulatory inspectorate that is a vital part of running a safe industry .
The regulations should be fair , be strict , and must be enforced by individuals that have been properly trained to a high level of understanding as to both the technology that they are reviewing and the consequences of error .
Historical evidence is clear that Universities cannot be left alone to provide that education , and supply those individuals .
The National Mine Health and Safety Academy at Beckley is a start in the right direction for the mining industry , but there are other changes that must be made , in the investment in research into new technology , in the general attitude to those who work to provide the fuels that we need ( and will continue to do so ) .
Treating the industries and those who work in them as pariahs is not the way to solve this problem .
Oh , and not to get anyone excited , but for the first time in the recent past there is some earthquake activity under the Myrdalsjokull glacier in Iceland , the home of the Katla volcano .
The map shows the age of recent earthquakes .
Eyjafjallajokull is the site of the currently active volcano .
The Letter Frank Sinatra Wrote Criticizing George Michael ’s Career Choices
Click here to get each day ’s one thing to see by email !
Back in 1990 , the Los Angeles Times ran a story about singer George Michael ’s plans to do no interviews , music videos , or touring to support his new album in an effort to get out of the limelight .
Apparently , Frank Sinatra read the article and fired off the above letter to the Times criticizing Michael ’s career choices .

HERSHEY , Pa. — Rep. Darrell Issa , the conservative firebrand whose specialty is lobbing corruption allegations at the Obama White House , is making plans to hire dozens of subpoena - wielding investigators if Republicans win the House this fall .
The California Republican ’s daily denunciations draw cheers from partisans and bookings from cable TV producers .
He even bought his own earphone for live shots .
But his bombastic style and attention - seeking investigations draw eye rolls from other quarters .
Now , he ’s making clear he wo n’t be so easy to shrug off if he becomes chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2011 .
" That will make all the difference in the world , " he told 400 applauding party members during a dinner at the chocolate - themed Hershey Lodge .
" I wo n’t use it to have corporate America live in fear that we ’re going to subpoena everything .
If the GOP takes the House , It starts all over again .
I do n't know that they have a chance , but if nothing else , this tells us that we do n't have the luxury of slacking off this November .
We need to get out the vote .
Issa and the GOP have made it clear that they will do anything to get power , even if it means destroying this country in the process .
And if you think that is hyperbole , just look at the Bush years - and how dedicated the Republicans were to bringing down President Clinton .
If they win the House , there 's a good chance that Issa could become chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2011 .
And would n't that just be peachy ??
UPDATE : Almost forgot - a belated hat tip to vcthree , whose tweet alerted me to this situation .
Thanks , vcthree !!
UPDATE 2 : From vcthree :
Did you ever wonder why Angelenos are screaming for less government ?
Consider my story .
In 2001 , I purchased my first house .
It was the only one I looked at .
The deal closed in three weeks .
It is a typical Spanish - style duplex with a converted garage as a guest house .
The seller converted the garage in 1983 and tenants have lived there since .
After the tenant moved out in 2003 , I upgraded it to the tune of $ 55,000 .
It ’s a beautiful unit that is an oasis of serenity in the center of the city .
In February 2004 , I was cited by the city for having an illegal unit .
I immediately went about legalizing the unit .
I spent two years trying to comply with the mind - numbing rules and conflicting instructions .
Five times the same city staffer provided me different requirements on parking .
I got signatures from neighbors – many of whom also have converted units ( but have n’t been cited ) .
I was “ sentenced ” and attended Landlord School ( think Traffic School but only worse ) .
I was listed as a “ slumlord . ”
The Los Angeles Housing Department came within a week of jailing me for six months for not complying with the order to legalize the unit despite the fact that I was in the process of doing so with the city ’s Planning , and Building and Safety departments .
Jail put off
With the fear of conviction in front of me , I made a commotion and got to meet with the administrator of the Planning Department .
Within a few months the required variances were approved and jail was put off – thanks to another hefty fine .
Things were looking up .
The city went through its processes and the final step was getting Building and Safety to have an inspector come out and make sure that everything was OK and issue the occupancy permit – all relatively pro forma given that the unit was updated .
Building and Safety would n’t send an inspector until Planning signed off on another document – the variances that Planning issued were n’t good enough .
Planning staff would n’t sign off on the new document because their administrator had issued the variance , not staff , so the administrator would have to sign off .
He could n’t : He was killed in the Metrolink accident .
The new administrators ( several over the years ) refused to sign , or meet with me or my architect .
My architect gave up .
The office of then - Councilman Jack Weiss tried and gave up ( after a pretty feeble effort ) .
I let it go – there was simply nothing more that could be done until one department was willing to work with the other .
In January , the city reissued its order to comply .
The new order states that any prior variances were no longer valid because the statute of limitations had expired on them .
True – because the city departments would n’t work together on the approvals that were in place for years !
If the departments would n’t work together , what about help from my new councilman ?
Paul Koretz ’s office did n’t respond to my letters , e-mails and phone calls .
How about the Mayor ’s Office ?
For three months , I worked with the mayor ’s liaison on these issues – and he came back to me saying that I had to start the legalization process over from scratch because the statute of limitations had expired .
I ca n’t start the process over .
I have spent six years and nearly $ 22,000 to get to this point .
I have been unemployed for 16 months and do n’t have the financial wherewithal , let alone the stamina , to continue the fight .
I ’ve let my tenant know she has to leave .
She ’s about to go to seminary and I have waived her rent for several months since she lost her job in February .
Things are bad for me , but worse for her .
No choice
It ’s mind - boggling that we ’ve come to this .
I have no choice .
I ca n’t even sell the place with a notice - to - comply on the title .
I guess I ’ll convert it to a garage after she moves out , since bureaucracy beats out common sense .
Nothing ’s wrong with the unit – I have n’t been cited for poor construction , anything dangerous or unhealthy .
It ’s a great place to live .
I jumped through every hoop the city put in front of me – several times in fact .
The city changed the game by not playing for two years only to start over .
So they win .
I lose .
Is it any wonder that people are screaming for less government ?

This week the US supreme court issued a decision against the Vatican the importance of which has been compared by one lawyer to the fall of the Berlin Wall .
That may sound like an exaggeration , but the court 's decision that the Vatican does not have legal immunity in a claim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest could have far - reaching ramifications for the church .
The case , John V Doe v Holy See , has been filed by a plaintiff ( using a pseudonym ) who claims to have been sexually abused on several occasions in the mid-1960s by a Roman Catholic priest called Andrew Ronan .
The claim was filed back in 2002 , and thanks to the court 's decision last week , it can finally proceed against the Vatican – allegedly liable because it acted as the priest 's employer .
Jeffrey Lena , the US - based lawyer who is defending the Vatican , has argued that the Holy See should not be regarded as an employer of priests because it does not pay them any salary , or benefits , and does not exercise a day - to - day control on their activity .
But the real issue in the case has been immunity .
The Vatican attempted to invoke the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act ( FSIA ) of 1976 , under which foreign states cannot be sued .
The supreme court refused to allow this .
The decision last week was , coincidentally , delivered on the same muggy summer 's day in which Rome and the Vatican celebrate the feast of Saints Peter and Paul , patrons of Rome .
The religious holiday sees the city shut down and attracts a flood of tourists in St Peter 's Basilica , one of the strongest symbols of the terrain power of the Vatican .
Many who visit the city learn of the time when , on 20 September 1870 , the Pope has lost his temporal power as the Italian army breached the Aurelian Walls at Porta Pia to conquer Rome .
Despite its turbulent history , the political and economic influence of the Vatican has never ended .
Avvenire , the Italian bishops ' newspaper , predictably describes the supreme court rejection of the immunity claim as " a non-decision " .
But in reality it is a decision , and a controversial one with the potential to shake the Vatican 's foundations and have far - reaching financial and reputational consequences .
In the legal community , the debate on immunity rages on .
Most Italian commentators tend to agree that the Vatican is a sovereign entity as it has a marked territory , with Latin as the official language , an independent legal system and its own police body , facts which tend towards giving it the same immunity as states .
One of Italy 's most famous lawyers , Franzo Grande Stevens , has published an open letter in the newspaper La Stampa saying that the Vatican clearly has an immunity .
But there are others who argue that it is not a member of the United Nations ( it has a permanent observer status ) and that religious leaders do not usually enjoy an immunity status .
The US supreme court decision paves the way for other suits to be filed against priests accused of paedophilia , which will in turn involve the Vatican .
Jeff Anderson , the lawyer representing the claimant , is already understood to have more cases against the Holy See in the pipeline .
The combination of potentially thousands of victims in numerous jurisdictions , and the economic incentive for lawyers seek - out cases ( particularly in America where so - called " ambulance - chasing " is rife ) , could result in enough cases to have devastating implications for the church .
The Vatican 's response so far has been to deny liability , and last week it said it would prove it can't be held responsible for the priest 's actions .
But how the law will deal with such strong political , religious and economic powers challenging what is in legal terms an uncertain and evolving area , remains to be seen .

There is an ancient story of a game design that I think is worth remembering .
It is the story of Senet .
Senet is one of the oldest games known to date , with boards and pieces dating back to 3500 B.C.
It was a popular game in its time , representing something of historic importance to Egyptian society .
The game has been pictured in paintings of tombs , and Senet boards were placed in graves as tools in the afterlife for esteemed persons .
It is often portrayed as a bridge between the living and the afterlife , and its place in the Egyptian Book of the Dead underlines the spiritual importance of the game 's overall message .
Senet artifacts are beautiful works of sculpture , engraving and clever combinations of technology , using all kinds of materials .
Unfortunately , however , the rules of Senet have been lost to us over the centuries .
Without the rules , the game cannot speak , and its message , which was so compelling thousands of years ago , is gone .
Senet , without its rules , is just a collection of pretty bits .
As an art form , game design is thousands of years old .
Game designers today face the same fundamental artistic problems as their ancient counterparts .
Senet illustrates how , for a large portion of history , game design was transmitted by spoken tradition , and how much can be lost .
Nevertheless , enough has survived to instruct the modern game designer and remind us of our craft .
There is much understandable excitement in the potential for computer games to be the ultimate combination art form .
There are games created today that combine dance , architecture , storytelling , improvisational theatre , music , painting and film - making in various ways .
Add to this amazing scope our ability to create shared online games , ( where one to millions of players can communicate and compete ) and it is easy to understand why computer game design is now in such a state of creative turmoil .
It is hard to know where to begin with such choice .
Happily , there is a simple tool at the center of all game design , whose exploration requires no team or cost , and from which any game designer can learn by its consideration : rules .
Furthermore , I believe that the creation and selection of game rules is an art form in and of itself .
By this , I mean that the rules of a game can give an artistic statement independent of its other components .
Just as a poem does n't need pictures and a painting does n't need music , a game needs nothing else apart from its rules to succeed as a work of art .
It can certainly benefit from other elements but it does n't need them .
By examining games from this point of view , a game designer can swiftly advance the quality and artistic merit of any effort .
Rules as Art
Rules are not entirely obvious as art , especially within the recent age of computer game development .
Computer games can record thousands of rules , and a computer can remember and execute decisions based on these rules without ( much ) difficulty .
Instead of inventing specific rules and weighing each one 's meaning , it is easy to try and follow the path of simulation .
Today , many developers face a sea of choices about the representation systems that communicate their rule sets .
To some extent , it is understandable that rules governing player choice have taken a back seat .
This is largely because the simulation of complex , real - world phenomena ( including human behavior ) is an alluring mental challenge in and of itself .

MUST READ : SWAT team brings in a man , seizes his legally purchased guns - for a crime no one committed
REASON ^ | June 2010 issue | Radley Balko
Posted on by Former Military Chick
To hear them tell it , the officers who apprehended 39 - year - old David Pyles on March 8 thwarted a mass murder .
The cops were able to successfully take a potentially volatile male subject into protective custody for a mental evaluation ,  the Medford , Oregon , police department announced in a press release .
The subject had been placed on administrative leave from his job not long before , was very disgruntled ,  and had recently purchased several firearms .
 Local Law Enforcement agencies were extremely concerned that the subject was planning retaliation against his employers ,  the press release said .
Fortunately , Pyles voluntarily  turned himself over to police custody , and his legally purchased firearms were seized for safekeeping . 
This supposedly voluntary exchange involved two SWAT teams , officers from Medford and nearby Roseburg , sheriffs deputies from Jackson and Douglas counties , and the Oregon State Police .
Pyles hadnt committed any crime ; nor was he suspected of having committed one .
The police never obtained a warrant for either search or arrest .
They never consulted with a judge or a mental health professional before sending military - style tactical teams to take Pyles in .
 They woke me up with a phone call at about 5:50 in the morning ,  Pyles says .
 I looked out the window and saw the SWAT team pointing their guns at my house .
The officer on the phone told me to turn myself in .
I told them I would , on three conditions .
I would not be handcuffed .
I would not be taken off my property .
And I would not be forced to get a mental health evaluation .
He agreed .
The second I stepped outside , they jumped me .
Then they handcuffed me , took me off my property , and took me to get a mental health evaluation . 
By noon , Pyles had already been released from the Rogue Valley Medical Center with a clean bill of mental health .
Four days later the Medford Police Department returned Pyles guns , despite telling him earlier in the week falsely that he would need to undergo a second background check before he could get them back .
The Medford Police Department then put out a second press release , this time announcing that it had returned the disgruntled  workers guns and now considers this matter closed . 
There s nothing wrong with looking for signs that someone is about to snap .
If he is waving multiple red flags , wed certainly want law enforcement to investigate .
And obviously if someone has made specific threats , a criminal investigation should follow .
But that s a far cry from what happened to Pyles .
Pyles problems followed a series of grievances with his employer , the Oregon Department of Transportation .
 It was never personal ,  he says .
 We were handling the grievances through the process stipulated in the union contract . 
( Pyles declined to discuss the nature of the complaints , citing conditions in his contract . )
On March 4 he was placed on administrative leave , which required him to work from home .
On March 5 , 6 , and 7 , after getting his income tax refund , he made three purchases of five firearms .
Pyles describes himself as a gun enthusiast who already owned several weapons .
All three purchases required an Oregon background check , which would have prohibited the transactions had Pyles ever been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving violence or been committed by the state to a mental health institution .
Pyles says he has no criminal record , and he says he never threatened anyone in his office .
( Later reports confirmed that Pyles never made any threat of violence . )
The Oregon State Police , the Medford Police Department , and the Oregon Department of Transportation did not respond to requests for comment .
 In my opinion , the apprehension of David Pyles was a violation of Oregons kidnapping laws ,  says James Leuenberger , a criminal defense attorney who is advising Pyles .
 He definitely deserves to be compensated for what they did to him , but even if he wins a civil rights suit , that will just result in the officers  employers paying for their mistakes . 
That means the final tab will be paid by Oregon taxpayers , not the offending cops .
 I want these law enforcement officials held personally responsible ,  Leuenberger says .
 I want them criminally charged . 
It s hard to see that happening .
Joseph Bloom , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health and Science University and an expert on civil commitment law , says the police who apprehended and detained Pyles likely were acting within the states laws .
Bloom says the police are permitted to decide on their own to take someone in for an evaluation , and that theres no requirement that they first consult with a judge or a mental health professional .
Bloom believes this is a wise policy .
 It s important to remember that this is a civil process ,  he says .
 There s no arrest .
These people arent being taken to jail .
It s not a criminal action . 
SWAT teams , guns , and handcuffs but not a criminal action ?
And what if Pyles had refused to voluntarily  surrender to the police ?
 Well , yes ,  Bloom says .
 I guess then it would become a criminal matter . 
If what happened to Pyles is legal in Oregon or elsewhere , we need to take a second look at the civil commitment power .
Even setting aside the SWAT overkill in Medford , theres something discomfiting about granting the government the power to yank someone from his home based only on a series of actions that were perfectly lawful .
Even if the apprehension of Pyles was legal , the seizure of his guns was not .
Civil commitment laws do not authorize the police to search a private residence .
According to Pyles , he closed the door behind him as he left his home .
Because the police didnt have a search warrant , they had no right to enter Pyles home , much less take weapons that he bought and possessed legally .
 For me ,  says Pyles ,  this is about civil rights .
This seems like something the NRA and the ACLU can agree on .
South Oregon is big gun country .
If something like this can happen here , where just about everyone owns a gun , it can happen anywhere . 

NUTS .
Now if he were nuts , and based on some type of reasoned SOP than I MIGHT entertain the discussion of the ability of the police to do this .
But , not to remove his legally obtained weapons , this is just NUTS .
Anyone outraged by this article ?
If so pass it along , because the idea that you can search without a warrant , seize w/o a warrant , based on no crime , only the offerings of another that a man may be nuts is .
Now if he were nuts , and based on some type of reasoned SOP than I MIGHT entertain the discussion of the ability of the police to do this .
But , not to remove his legally obtained weapons , this is just NUTS .
SWAT , what if he had n't complied peacefully , it appears without a crime , they sure thought it was possible .
It is worthy of a second read .
Love the idea that this may rise to " kidnapping "
If it can happen there , it can happen anywhere .
I am going to call our local cops to see what the SOP is here , offering to send this article as the purpose of my inquiry .
Stunning article .

Here is the reason they failed :
He did not respond the way they wanted him to .
He gave himself up .
What if he had said , “ I ’ve done nothing wrong , and unless you have a warrant , I expect you to leave my property . ”
Would it have escalated ?
Could they have said they have one of these “ nutcase constitutionalist TEA baggers ‘ holed up ’ in his home ” ?
I think they were the equivalent of a man poking a bear , just hoping it would swat at him so he could shoot it .

Just another random , isolated example of the 99 % giving the 1 % a bad name .
These cops should be criminally charged and police , when convicted , should be subject to substantially harsher penalties than citizens and should not be protected from serving their time in the general population .
If the police ever suffered legitimate punishment for breaking the law maybe they 'd start to " serve and protect " again .

Joseph Bloom , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health and Science University and an expert on civil commitment law , says the police who apprehended and detained Pyles likely were acting within the states laws .
Bloom says the police are permitted to decide on their own to take someone in for an evaluation , and that theres no requirement that they first consult with a judge or a mental health professional .
Always watch out for the professional liars - they 're the worst .
What Bloom is n't saying is that it is precisely the fact that these police abused their powers of evaluation to make this raid .
Those powers are not devoid of responsibility .
Put on the stand , these cops will not be able to justify their evaluatory conclusions , and the state will therefore not back them up since without justification , it was an abuse of power .
So the suit will nail the cops for abuse , and the state for lack of oversight and training .
Of course , in truth this was a political op to push the boundaries of acclimitization for civil SWAT raids with no probable cause to either shoot political enemies dead or throw them into psychiatric lockups .
Sound farfetched ?

Frightening !
Exactly where do they get this power ?
Are they exempt from the Constitutional restraints of Due Process , Illegal Search and Seizure or Equal Protection ?
Sounds like Soviet style " disappearing " tactics .
What happens if you resist the Police " diagnosis , " do they get to shoot you down like a dog ?

KABUL -- Even as the U.S. and the Taliban continue to pound each other on the battlefield , the two adversaries appear to be conducting parallel internal debates about what an eventual political reconciliation might involve .
Each side wants to bargain from a position of maximum strength , and for the foreseeable future , that means trying to inflict maximum pain .
Each seems to be betting that the staying power of the other is limited -- by domestic politics , regional dynamics and the cost of the conflict in money and blood .
The main advantage of the Taliban , arguably , is that their fighters are a permanent part of the landscape .
U.S. military commanders here see signs that their aggressive " capture or kill " operations have rocked the Taliban -- and pushed some of the insurgents to consider negotiations with President Hamid Karzai .
This Special Forces campaign involves 125 to 150 operations each month , a senior military official said here Saturday , adding that in the last four months , 525 insurgents had been detained or killed , including 130 who are at the level of district commander or above .
" The argument within the Taliban is about resolving the conflict , " says the military official , citing prisoner interrogations and other intelligence .
" They want to figure out what the conditions would be , " he explained , including such issues as : " How do we do it ?
Will we be part of the ( Afghan ) government ?
Will we fear for our lives ? "
Taliban prisoners have told U.S. interrogators that this pounding in Afghanistan -- coupled with attacks by Predator drones on their safe havens in Pakistan -- has taken a psychological toll .
According to the senior military official , lower - level fighters complain , " Hey , we 're doing all the dying out here ? " and ask their commanders , " How much longer can we put up with this ? "
But top administration officials , starting with President Obama , expressed skepticism over the weekend that Taliban leader Mohammad Omar is willing to make any serious compromises yet .
CIA Director Leon Panetta cautioned Sunday on ABC's " This Week " : " We have seen no evidence that they are truly interested in reconciliation . "
The U.S. strategy is to keep firing away , in the hope that the enemy will be more pliable by 2011 , when Obama plans to begin withdrawing American troops .
The inner circle of the administration has begun its own debate about a strategy for Afghan political reconciliation .
Obama has publicly supported reconciliation , but with some significant preconditions .
And while he has said that this process should be " Afghan - led , " the U.S. also wants to steer the process in the direction most favorable to its interests .
Complicating the situation for both the U.S. and the Taliban are the recent discussions between Karzai and Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani , the Pakistani army chief .
The Pakistanis would like to broker any settlement in Afghanistan .
They appear to have had some success in convincing Karzai that , given Obama 's July 2011 timetable to begin withdrawal , Pakistan is their most reliable long - run partner .
The Taliban has developed its own version of a " population - centric " strategy to win Afghan hearts and minds .
The military official in Kabul cited intelligence reports that Omar has ordered his fighters to curb corruption , reduce civilian casualties and run more effective local courts .
Taliban leaders who were unpopular or ineffective have been recalled from the battlefield , the U.S. official said .
Both the U.S. and the Taliban have set heavy preconditions for negotiations , which for now have stymied serious dialogue .
The U.S. insists that Taliban fighters disarm , renounce any links with al - Qaeda and accept the human - rights provisions of the Afghan constitution .
The Taliban demands the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan .
For now , those demands have produced an impasse .
But some U.S. advocates of reconciliation see signs that Omar may be ready to distance the Taliban from al - Qaeda .
One official cites an interview conducted in March by Pakistani journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad that appeared in Asia Times Online , in which an anonymous Taliban official describes Osama bin Laden as " just an individual " and said the U.S. was using him as an excuse to avoid real talks .
In the Pashtun culture , reconciliation is possible when there is a gundi , or balance of power , that conveys mutual respect and security .
So far , neither the U.S. nor the Taliban has a reconciliation strategy that could be articulated so succinctly .
Just a quick update on a little project I 've been working on over the past few months .
Idiorm is “ a lightweight nearly - zero - configuration object - relational mapper and fluent query builder for PHP5 , ” and is released under a BSD license .
Idiorm on GitHub .
The starting point for Idiorm was the topic of my talk at BarCampBrighton last year : “ Minimalism in Web Development ” , the idea that for many purposes , simpler solutions are often preferable to complex ones .
Idiorm lets you start using an ORM in your application with almost no effort .
No XML files , model classes , database introspection or code generation is required :
You just need to tell the ORM how to connect to your database , and away you go .
The fluent interface allows you to build most basic queries without writing any SQL , and gets out of the way when you need to do something more complex ( both raw WHERE clauses and complete raw queries are supported ) .
Once you have one or more instances of the ORM class ( representing the rows in your database tables ) you can access the data in them directly as properties of the objects ( using PHP 's magic __get and __set methods internally ) , modify and save them , as well as delete them .
For full documentation and lots of code samples , see the README file .
Obviously , such a simple project ( the whole ORM class is only about 600 lines of code ) would probably never be used in a huge , complex PHP application .
The main drawback to using a generic ORM class instead of domain - specific model classes is that you can't attach your own behaviour to the models .
So the ( extremely sensible ) idea of placing most of your business logic in your models ( Skinny Controller , Fat Model ) is n't possible with Idiorm as -is .
I have three answers to this problem .
The first is that many applications simply do n't need any business logic more complex than basic CRUD operations , for which Idiorm is perfect .
Secondly , one clear use case for Idiorm is to clean up legacy applications which are littered with raw SQL statements , usually passed directly into some custom - written “ database abstraction ” class or set of functions .
Here , the application is already a mess , and in the absence of a complete rewrite , integrating Idiorm can only make things better .
Finally , there 's no reason why you could n't build a full model layer as a lightweight wrapper on top of Idiorm .
This would probably take the form of a factory object which returns instances of the correct model class , using Idiorm to populate them with data .
I have a rough - and - ready implementation of this idea on my laptop which I may release at some point , but it 's easy enough to build yourself .
If you 're using PHP 5.3 ( and so have access to late static binding ) , you could even code up a pretty nice implementation of the active record pattern around Idiorm .
Update : I have now released Paris , which is an Active Record implementation built on top of Idiorm .
So to summarise , Idiorm is n't really intended to replace something like Doctrine or Propel ( or ActiveRecord , or Django's ORM , or SQLAlchemy , etc ) .
It 's designed to be a quick and easy solution to database abstraction in small - to - medium sized applications .
And let 's face it - most of us are building small - to - medium sized applications .
We 're building bicycles , not space shuttles .
If Doctrine is a rocket engine , Idiorm is a bottom bracket .
But if all you want to do is get to the corner shop , a bicycle is a much quicker way to travel .
Finally , if you think you 'd find Idiorm useful , please let me know .
Fork the project , make suggestions using GitHub 's Issues system or just leave a comment on this post .
Packing tape has gotten MacGyver out of many a jam , but he never managed to make an entire home out of the stuff .
So he could probably learn something from Viennese / Croatian design collective For Use / Numen .
The team uses nothing but packing tape to create huge , self - supporting cocoons that
visitors could climb inside and explore .
Installed three times in the past year , the next deployment will be next week from June 9–13 at DMY Berlin ’s International Design Fair , which is now in its 8th year .
The installations , which look like the work of horrifyingly large arachnids , grew in scale and scope as the year progressed , first deployed inside a small Croatian gallery , then an abandoned attic during October ’s Vienna Design Week .
At the last installation inside Odeon , a former stock exchange building in Vienna , the group used nearly 117,000 feet and 100 pounds of tape .
“ The installation is based on an idea for a dance performance in which the form evolves from the movement of the dancers between the pillars , ” explains For Use ’s Christoph Katzler .
“ The dancers are stretching the tape while they move , so the resulting shape is a recording of the choreography . ”
Watch below to see how it was done .
Wal - Mart Inc.'s Sam's Club will begin offering loans of up to $ 25,000 to members in an effort to set itself apart from other warehouse chains and build goodwill to bring in more business .

WASHINGTON , June 4 ( Reuters ) - BP Plc BP.LBP.N aims for the containment cap placed over the gushing well pipe in the Gulf of Mexico to stop at least 90 percent of the flow of oil spilling into the ocean , a senior official with the British energy giant said on Friday .
“ I ’d like to see us capture 90 plus percent of this flow .
I think that ’s possible with this design , ” BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told the CBS “ Early Show . ”
“ Of course what we have to do is work through the next 24 or 48 hours to optimize that .
But that would be the goal .
...
We want to stop this oil from spilling to the sea , ” Suttles added .
Suttles told CNN of the containment cap : “ It should work . ”
Suttles was the first BP official to discuss the placement of the containment cap on the well , which has been gushing oil into the Gulf since April .
Using robot submarines , BP managed on Thursday to shear away the gushing well pipe a mile ( 1.6 km ) below the ocean surface , then lowered the containment cap over the jagged hole left atop the crippled wellhead assembly in its latest bid to curtail the oil flow .
“ We do have a cap successfully in place , ” Suttles said .
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen called the move a “ positive development ” but “ only a temporary and partial fix . ”
Once the containment cap is firmly in place over the wellhead , the plan is to start funneling at least some of the escaping oil and gas into a large hose that would carry it from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico to the surface , where it would be collected in ships and safely removed .

I like being able to have fun playing on pcs next to my buds with all of us connected over a Router / switch ...
Sure it might be a neccessity for LAN at a tournament , but what if Blizzard staff are late to arrive ?
We hold the tournament until their flight arrives ?
That 's pretty stupid ...

i mean , clan wars and tournaments like CSL ( for the casual gamers ) will most likely have to use bnet 2.0 .
I just dont see this " Professional Edition " spreading to the foreign community ( at least not in the forseeable future ) .
PS : If they have lan functionality and gives it to the chinese ( who hosted tournaments like stars war ) , wont the chinese just hack the shit out of it anyways ?

And how do you figure ?
if there 's LAN that only blizzard is allowed to use for official blizzard tournaments how the hell does that help the actual playerbase who have wanted LAN features to play with friends or at local LAN parties ?
this wo n't put an end to anything , other than showing that Blizzard did take the time to code LAN for sc2 , but they do n't trust the playerbase with it .

BURNS -- Biologist Linda
Beck stands in water halfway to her knees , gazing out on a lake strangely empty of waterfowl .
Cormorants , pelicans , gulls and terns by the millions once wheeled and shrieked above Malheur Lake while ducks bobbed and dove for insects .
Now , the lake and sky are eerily empty .
" I mean , there are no birds , " said the 35 - year - old fish biologist for the
, splashing to dry ground on the north shore on a recent afternoon .
" We still should be seeing some birds . "
There 's a one - word explanation for the dramatic downturn in waterfowl on the shallow 50,000 - acre lake 30 miles south of Burns : carp .
Their ranks have exploded over the course of decades -- and nothing , not even a succession of wholesale poisonings , has beaten them back for long .
Carp out - compete the waterfowl for Sago Pondweed , aquatic invertebrates , insects and other food .
They also root on the lake bottom , stirring up sediment and diminishing the sunlight necessary for the growth of lake grasses .
" It 's a giant carp pond , " said Bob Sallinger , spokesman for the
.
" That lake is basically a dead lake . "
Migratory waterfowl , shore birds and colonial waterbirds used to darken the sky above Malheur Lake and the
during their annual stop on the Pacific flyway .
Duck production alone averaged more than 101,000 annually with a peak of 139,000 in 1946 .
No more .
Waterfowl production is down 75 percent at the refuge and visiting bird numbers have fallen by several million a year , according to the Fish and Wildlife Service .
The fish invaders have caused problems on the refuge since the 1940s .
The federal agency has poisoned the lake and tributaries with an odorless chemical poison called rotenone multiple times in unsuccessful efforts to kill them off , the last time 1992 .
But rotenone has n't proven a long - term solution -- the carp populations return in force within four years , Beck said .
Part of the difficulty is that carp inhabit the Silvies River and can restock Malheur Lake when the river and lake flow together during cyclical wet weather , about every seven years , she said .
Another factor is that a 5 - pound female carp can produce 500,000 eggs per year for 30 years .
The federal agency has a new working group of experts to weigh other possibilities .
They include commercial harvesting and processing the carp for a variety of uses :
-- Consumption by Russian Orthodox Church believers , for whom carp is a traditional food .
U.S. anglers often regard carp as a " trash fish , " complaining the meat is bony and oily , but " I had some that was smoked and I loved it , " Beck said .
-- Organic fertilizer .
-- Feed for chickens , cows , swine and fish .
-- Alternative energy fuel .
-- Removal of carp pituitary glands for injection into other fish species to accelerate sexual maturity and aid spawning .
One gram of diluted carp pituitary can bring $ 350 , Beck said .
Still , it may be years before the refuge can gain control over the carp .
" There are some really tough issues to grapple with , " said Sallinger , a working group member who suspects the battle against carp will guide refuge polices for 15 years .
Carp are native to Europe and Asia and were artificially introduced into the Silvies River in about 1920 , probably to keep nearby irrigation canals open on the premise that carp would eat aquatic plants and algae , Beck said .
Their numbers in Malheur Lake -- which averages 18 inches deep -- verges on the unbelievable .
Biologists estimate 1.5 million carp inhabit the lake , although nobody knows for sure .
Collectively , they could weigh 7 million pounds .
An average carp is a rich golden color and weighs 5 pounds , while some tip the scales at 17 pounds and a few 80 - pounders are possible , said Przeyslaw Bajer , a research associate studying carp at the University of Minnesota at St. Paul .
They sometimes live 50 years , he said .
Some scientists believe carp are smarter than other fish species , said Bajer , a recent visitor to Malheur Lake and a member of the working group .
" They have a good memory , " he said .
" I think they can remember at least the layout of the lake and where different things are . "
They 're also tough -- tolerating water temperatures ranging from near - freezing to 86 degrees , Beck said .
When water turns shallow , they sometimes burrow into the bottom , which allows water to flow in and giving them a deeper environment , she said .
One solution -- fishing -- is n't a possibility for now .
The refuge does n't allow the public to angle for carp in Malheur Lake .
And winning approval would likely be an unwieldy process involving insertion of a proposal in the Federal Register in Washington , D.C. , and probably would take two years , Beck said .
On windless summer days , when Malheur Lake 's surface becomes still , Beck said she sometimes stands on the deck of one of the refuge 's two shallow - draft airboats watching the dorsal fins of thousands of carp stir the water in circles an inch or two above the surface .
They remind her of the great white shark in " Jaws . "
" You just kind of look out across the lake and you see the fins , " she said .
" It 's crazy . "
Resilient fish
Biologists do n't know the exact population of carp in Malheur Lake .
During the 1980s , when high water expanded the lake to a vast 110,000 acres and waves splashed across Oregon 205 , motorists reported hitting carp with their cars .
Historic data of rotenone treatments of carp at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge :
1957 : 1.5 million carp killed in Malheur Lake and nearby Boca Lakes
1959 : 58,000 carp killed in Blitzen River and Sodhouse Pond
1960 : 400,000 carp killed in Malheur Lake and Blitzen River
1961 : 150,000 carp killed in Malheur Lake and Blitzen River
1968 : 240,000 carp killed throughout refuge
1969 : Blitzen River treated with rotenone , number of carp killed unknown
1977 : Unknown thousands killed in Malheur Lake and 50,000 killed in Blitzen River
1992 : 100,000 killed in Blitzen River and Sodhouse Pond

Stuart Fisk advises other men not to bother volunteering to work with children A think tank has suggested that relationships between adults and children are being poisoned by an increase in child - protection measures .
Others argue that the rules protect children from abuse - the Home Office says that more than 20,000 unsuitable people were weeded out by Criminal Records Bureau ( CRB ) checks in the past year alone .
An illustration of the difficult balancing act that must be struck between these opposing views is provided by the experiences of one man , who volunteered to work as a mentor to young children in an Essex primary school .
Stuart Fisk , 36 , from Colchester , claims he was treated " like a paedophile " by the staff of St Osyth Church of England Primary School , near Clacton - on - Sea .
Regret
Now he says he regrets his well - meaning attempts to help vulnerable children .
How long will it be before parents who host sleepovers for their children also need to be checked out by the police ?
Professor Frank Furedi
The school denies it made Stuart feel unwelcome .
It says its child protection rules are designed to protect both children and the adults who work with them .
Said Stuart : " Someone visited my office to talk about mentoring children in a nearby school and I decided to give it a go .
" I wanted to give something back , to help children - and I also thought it might look good on my CV .
So I volunteered . "
Stuart had a CRB check for any criminal history .
Nothing was found .
He said : " My job was to talk to kids who might be at risk or have troubles at home .
" I was supposed to gain their trust and act as a role model .
If I thought the child might be in trouble I could offer advice . "
Suspicious attitude But , said Stuart , he encountered what he says was a " suspicious " attitude from staff at the school .
" When I started I was told that whenever I was with children , I had to sit in full view of another member of staff at all times .
" I also was n't allowed to go and pick up any children from the classroom for the mentoring sessions .
I was told I had to wait in the school library for them to be brought to me . "
After seven weeks , Stuart left St Osyth .
He said : " I had been fully checked out but the school still made me feel like I was a potential paedophile .
" My advice to anyone - especially a man - thinking of helping out in a primary school is ' do n't bother ' , " he said .
Standard protocols
The school denies that Stuart was not allowed to escort children to and from the library .
But head teacher Tim Palmer said Stuart was asked to abide by " standard child protection protocols " .
" What we ask is that anyone talking to children do so in a public space - not squirreled away in some corner somewhere .
THE SPREAD OF VETTING
More than 1 in 4 adults in England - 11.3 m people - will be on a child protection database by 2009 Volunteer drivers and parents hosting school exchange visits are soon likely to be subject to CRB checks Parents may get powers to check whether nannies or new partners have paedophile convictions Ministers plan to require CRB checks on parents who let a child stay on a foreign exchange visit " This is for the protection both of the volunteer mentor , and the children . "
Whatever the rights and wrongs of Stuart 's experiences , his attitude is not unique .
Last year a survey by the NCH children 's charity estimated that 13 % of men who do not volunteer to work with young people said it was due to the fear of being perceived as a paedophile .
Expanding measures Professor Frank Furedi , who co-authored Wednesday 's report Licensed to Hug , published by the think tank Civitas , warns that these fears are being stoked by what he terms a " stealthily expanding " growth in child protection measures .
His report argues that the " routine police vetting of adults " fuels mutual suspicions and transmits negative signals to children .
It also undermines the ability of adults to take responsibility for children , and diminishes adult authority .
Most controversially , says Professor Furedi , an over - reliance on CRB and other official child protection measures actually puts the safety of children at risk .
Tragic toddler
The cumulative outcome of the trends is to discourage adults from taking responsibility for the welfare of young people , he writes .
The report offers up the tragic example of Abigail Rae , a three - year - old from Warwickshire who drowned in a pond after she escaped from her nursery .
An inquest into her death in 2006 heard that Clive Peachy , a bricklayer , had passed the toddler by as she wandered the road alone .
He failed to stop and help her - fearing people might think that he was trying to abduct the little girl .
In his summing - up the coroner described the incident as a " sad reflection " on society - but said people " may well understand the circumstances .
Defenders of the current system say it is not responsible for this type of incident , and have called for the return of " common sense " .
Childline campaigner Esther Ranzten told the BBC : " Nobody wants the over - correct political reaction which prevents grandparents from videoing their children in a pantomime - that sort of thing .
" That 's just irrational ... it 's not to do with the vetting procedure . "

Federal agents slaughtered more than 250 geese and dozens of their babies in Prospect Park after corralling the adults and their young into a small pen early Thursday morning , boxing them up , and tossing them in a gas chamber .
The horror - movie - style measure was part of the city ’s ongoing effort to exterminate the feathered creatures within a seven - mile radius from both LaGuardia and JFK airports — a radius that was expanded last year to include Prospect Park , putting all its birds in the path of a federally mandated massacre .
Carol Bannerman , a Department of Agriculture spokeswoman , confirmed the grim reaping that federal Wildlife Services staff executed on the fateful morning of July 8 .
“ Free - ranging waterfowl like this can be gently herded , then individually picked out , put into crates , moved into a nearby location and euthanized using carbon dioxide , ” Bannerman said .
Beaky is believed to be among the dead .
The Brooklyn Paper / Stephen Brown
“ Is this a difficult decision ?
The answer is yes , ” she added .
“ But if you have to make the choice between a plane of people and that same number of birds , it ’s easier to see the answer . ”
She said that the geese were buried , but would not reveal the location of the feathery mass grave .
“ In other states [ the goose meat ] can be donated to food pantries , but that process has n’t been set up in New York State , ” Bannerman noted .
Among the dead include such avian celebrities as Beaky , the adored and deformed goose that was missing the top part of its beak after surviving an encounter with a fish hook ; and Target , the resilient goose who not only survived being shot through with an arrow , but mesmerized the borough for days .
Park watchdogs Ed Bahlman and Anne-Katrin Titze rightly suspected the worst when they came across a field of goose feathers and plastic handcuff - like ties ( below ) .

Park - goers were crying fowl over the weekend , when several bird lovers gave The Brooklyn Paper a tour of the crime scene , a mysterious , feather - covered area where the birds had apparently been corralled .
Plastic handcuff - like ties were also littering the site .
“ It ’s like a crime scene that they forgot to clean up , ” said Ed Bahlman , a regular park watchdog .
The birds entered the city ’s crosshairs after Capt .
Sully Sullenberger pulled off the “ Miracle on the Hudson ” and landed an airplane in the Hudson River after flying into a flock of geese .
This latest episode likely means that the mysterious animal - related violence in Prospect Park has reached its nadir .
Park watchdogs Ed Bahlman and Anne-Katrin Titze discovered a new mystery in Prospect Park : a field of goose feathers and plastic handcuff - like ties .
The pair believes that someone has apprehended all of the park ’s waterfowl .

First , gory piles of animal entrails were found by the lake .
Then , dozens of chicken heads were dumped in the water .
As the weather heated up , dead animals began appearing in startling numbers .
Around that time , park - goers mourned the death of John Boy , one of the park ’s beloved swans .

Landmark credit - card legislation signed into law last year halted some of the predatory tactics used by banks to attract student borrowers , but the new law has n’t stopped colleges from preying on their own students .
Some of the nation ’s largest universities are selling students ’ names and addresses to credit - card companies for millions in kickbacks from big , bailed - out financial giants like Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase , the Huffington Post Investigative Fund reports .
Through inconspicuous collegiate - corporate relationships known as “ affinity agreements , ” schools and their alumni associations not only profit from selling students ’ personal information , they also earn royalties for each student who keeps a university - sponsored credit card open for more than 90 days .
Schools can earn up to three times more — about $ 3 per cardholder — when students carry a balance on these cards , and some colleges earn bonuses when students incur debt .
The Huffington Post obtained 17 contracts detailing affinity agreements between universities and banks , but it ’s unclear just how many of the nation ’s 2,700 four - year colleges are involved .
At Brown , Bank of America agreed in 2006 to pay $ 2.3 million over seven years for students ’ names and addresses .
At Michigan in 2003 , the bank agreed to pay $ 35.5 million over 11 years for its student information .
In total , BOA has affinity contracts with some 700 schools , and more than 100 schools are believed to have affinity agreements with other financial institutions , according to the Huffington Post .
Bank of America claims it ’s not taking advantage of students ; rather , it ’s amassing a new base of loyal customers .
But consumer advocates beg to differ , questioning whether colleges with affinity agreements are doing enough to safeguard young people from financial ruin .
“ Universities should place the welfare of their students as their highest priority , ” said Ed Mierzwinski , consumer program director for the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups .
“ [ They ] should n’t sell them off for profit . ”
CHANCELLOR George Osborne is to throw everyone in Coventry out of work after a brilliant suggestion from Harriet Harman .
Mr Osborne had spent an hour setting out a hard - hitting budget but then immediately withdrew it after Ms Harman said it would have the same impact as taking the axe to the West Midlands hellhole .
The chancellor said : “ That is just a stunningly good idea .
Does anyone really object ?
I mean really ?
And do n’t just disagree for the sake of it .
Let ’s think about this for a minute . ”
Holding aloft a copy of the Budget , he added : “ This is horribly complicated .
Tax rates , allowances , thresholds , family credits and stuff .
It takes ages to read and , I ’ll be perfectly honest with you , I do n’t really understand any of it .
“ Sacking Coventry is fair , simple and should only take me about 20 minutes .
“ Now some will no doubt say ‘ what about all the people in Coventry ?
What are they supposed to do ?’.
But I do n’t care about them and neither does anyone else .
“ We can protect welfare support for the rest of the country and make sure that middle class families continue to receive the annual increases in child benefit that they need to buy really good chorizo .
“ Mr Deputy Speaker – Coventry .
FUCKED .
I commend it to the House . ”
A Treasury spokesman said the imminent de-Coventrisation of the UK replicated the key aims of the Budget perfectly by targeting around 300,000 indolent scroungers with ghastly regional accents .
He added : “ We will however be pressing ahead with the VAT increase , but to those on low incomes who are concerned we would simply say , why not spend the money on fresh fruit and vegetables for a change instead of yet another enormous television that you ca n’t afford anyway and will only make you even more fat and stupid , as if that was actually possible ?
“ Do n’t poor people make you sick ? ”
Petra Kvitova introduced herself to the world as an aggressive player with the will to play tennis at the net , to hit volleys , to move forward , and that sometimes worked for her Thursday at Wimbledon .
The 20 - year - old from the Czech Republic set Serena Williams on her heels often , especially in the first set .
But when she needed it , Williams , the 28 - year - old No. 1 - seeded player and the defending champion , relied on what commentator Lindsay Davenport calls the best shot in women 's tennis , the first serve , to win easy points and move on to the Wimbledon final with a 7 - 6 ( 5 ) , 6 - 2 win over the left - handed Kvitova , who is ranked 62nd in the world and had never experienced such a moment .
Williams ' serving prowess was evident in the final game of the match .
She hit a service winner for 15 - 0 ; another for 30 - 0 ; a third for 40 - 0 .
It allowed her to make a couple of errors before finally winning the match with the help of a lucky net - cord bounce on match point .
Williams did an elaborate curtsy at the end , showing it off for a second time though she never did it for the queen of England .
Williams had missed that chance when she was put on Court 2 last week and Queen Elizabeth II went to Centre Court .
Now Williams will play in her sixth Wimbledon final , against 21st - seeded Vera Zvonareva on Saturday .
" I do n't have anything to lose going into the finals , and she does n't either , " Williams said .

Keep an eye out for claims that carbs are making a comeback .
A new diet book slated to hit stores this summer , “ The Carb Lovers Diet , ” promises that eating carbohydrates is the key to weight loss and long - term health .
The so - called secret :
Eat not just any old carbs but a certain type of carbohydrate called resistant starch .
FOR THE RECORD :
Carbohydrates :
An article in Monday ’s Health section on nutritional properties of resistant starch misidentified professor Joanne Slavin of the University of Minnesota as Jennifer Slavin . —
The term “ resistant starch ” refers to starch that does n’t get fully digested in the small intestine , which is where refined carbohydrates , such as white bread and pasta , get broken down into glucose .
Because resistant starch , like fiber , avoids digestion in the small intestine , it travels on to the large intestine , where it feeds the bacteria that reside in the lower gut .
Like fiber , resistant starch also increases stool bulk and has a laxative effect .
In fact , because it acts so much like fiber , food scientists classify it as such , says Jennifer Slavin , professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul .
Studies of human populations have shown that people whose diets are rich in fiber tend to eat less and also tend to weigh less , Slavin says .
Still , it ’s not clear that resistant starch is better than other types of fiber , she adds .
In part , that ’s because the term resistant starch refers to a large category of carbohydrates with different activity in the body .
Some pass through the intestines entirely undigested , whereas others get partially digested in the small intestine and partially broken down in the large intestine .
The purported benefits of resistant starch derive in part from their resistance to digestion , as well as their partial digestion in the lower gut , says Michael Keenan , a professor of human nutrition and food at Louisiana State University and the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in Baton Rouge .
Keenan has studied the effects of resistant starch on lab animals .
When lab rodents were fed a diet that consisted of as much as 25 % of a type of resistant starch called RS2 , they ended up with less body fat than rodents eating the same number of calories but no resistant starch , Keenan says .
In addition to burning more fat , the rodents consuming the starch developed a different set of microflora , or bacteria , in their large intestine .
Keenan says this proliferation of bacteria in the gut could be a predictor of improved long - term health prospects :
Human studies have indicated that obese people and people with Crohn ’s disease or ulcerative colitis have a different set of microflora than lean , healthy people .
Still , the precise implications of the rodent experiment for humans remains unknown .
While it ’s clear that lab rats burn more fat when they eat resistant starch , there ’s no definitive evidence that humans who consume the starch will weigh less than humans who do n’t , says Janine Higgins , nutrition research director of the Clinical Translation Research Center at the University of Colorado , Denver .
There are four types of resistant starch .
Two are fairly easy to find :
One occurs naturally in whole grains and another forms in starchy foods such as white rice , pasta and potatoes after they are cooked and then cooled .
The other two types of resistant starch are ones that are modified in the lab to resist breakdown in the gut and are often sold as powders .
The advantage of these , Higgins says , is that they can be sprinkled or baked into otherwise low - fiber foods , such as yogurt or ice cream .
In other words , it ’s a convenient way to work a type of fiber into the diets of people who are n’t otherwise consuming fruits , vegetables and whole grains .
Resistant starch powders can also be used as a substitute for flour in , say , white bread .
The resulting slice of bread would provide fewer calories than the usual slice and could therefore help people trying to maintain a healthy weight , Higgins says .
The downside : Such products , including the flour - substitute Hi-maize and high - resistant - starch banana flour , ca n’t be found in your average grocery store , but some can be purchased from online purveyors .
It ’s much easier , of course , to find foods naturally high in resistant starch .
Slavin adds that not only whole grains but also many sources of complex carbohydrates , including beans , legumes , and some fruits and vegetables , contain resistant starch and make for a healthier overall diet too .
Higgins points out that while resistant starch may share the beneficial effects of fiber , consumers should be wary of promises of a weight loss miracle in the making .
“ Fiber of any type makes you feel fuller longer and makes you eat less over time , but it ’s not the magic bullet , ” she says .
“ If you want to lose weight , you ’re going to have to restrict your diet .
At the end of the day , it ’s about common sense : calories in minus calories out . ”

RECENT TRENDS CONTINUE AS CPC LEAD SHRINKS TO LESS THAN FIVE POINTS – June 10 , 2010
DIRECTION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TIES RECORD LOW POINT
[ Ottawa – June 10 , 2010 ] – In an often repeated pattern , we see the electorate gently recoiling after bestowing a large lead on the Conservative Party .
This has produced a much tighter race .
We are also seeing a continued decline in confidence in the direction of the federal government , which is now in sub -40 territory .
These patterns are clearly worrisome trends for the government .
Although the Liberal Party continues to be stuck at very low levels , the recent trajectory for the Conservatives has seen them move out of the range where they were approaching a majority to a point where they no longer have even a comfortable margin of victory .
In addition to the downward trajectory of confidence in federal direction ( which we have found to be a much stronger leading indicator than “ leadership ” measures ) , the regional patterns do not augur well for the Conservatives right now .
The Liberals have regained a significant lead in the crucial Ontario arena and now lead in the Atlantic .
Quebec remains a puzzling wasteland for federalist parties with no one doing well .
Also of note is the continued strength of the Green Party which , at 12.6 % , would actually begin to achieve seats .
This poll comes in the midst of growing chatter about coalitions .
In some senses , this poll reinforces that movement by showing just how dramatically the centre and left vote in Canada is fragmented across 4 party options , which together attract nearly 70 percent of the electorate .
On the other hand , the poll also shows that a Conservative march to victory in the next election is by no means a preordained inevitability and this recognition may take a bit of wind out of the sails of the coalition movements , which had a tinge of desperation fuelling them .

The Bush administration 's fiscal record
One of the other takeaways from the Congressional Budget Office 's long - term budget outlook is that the Bush administration really was n't fiscally responsible , while the Obama administration pretty much has been .
The major domestic initiatives of the Bush years -- the tax cuts and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit -- made the budget picture much , much worse .
The Obama administration 's health - care reform proposal has , by contrast , made the budget picture much better .
( You could say that the stimulus was n't paid for , but that was sort of the point of the thing .
And if we want to put emergency measures into the mix , we also have all costs related to 9/11 and TARP accruing to Bush .
And I 've been nice and have n't mentioned Iraq so far .
Oops . )
In fact , there 's no high - priced initiative from the Bush years that improved the budget situation , or was even paid for .
This has , I think , had a psychological effect on Washington .
One reason people are so skeptical that the government will actually pay for health - care reform -- as it is now statutorily obligated to do -- is because people got used , under the Bush administration , to seeing the government routinely shirk its fiscal duties .
And the fact that the same people who voted for all that shirking are now screaming about deficits just makes observers less willing to credit the commitments made by politicians .

How pilots on doomed plane carrying Polish president ' ignored ' 13 warnings before fatal crash
The pilot of a doomed aircraft carrying Polish president Lech Kaczynski apparently ignored more than a dozen warnings before the crash which claimed 97 lives .
Transcripts from cockpit recordings released today by the government show on - board systems instructed crew to regain altitude in the last minute before the crash .
' Pull up , pull up ... Terrain ahead , ' the on - board warning system told the pilots 13 times shortly before the crash .
There were also clear warnings from ground control about the appalling conditions , including the stark phrase : ' There are no conditions for landing . '
Crash scene :
The mangled wreckage of the Polish president 's plane which crashed on April 10 killing all on board
The transcripts recorded how one of the pilots cursed after the plane hit a tree .
It is only when it is too late to abort disaster that the pilot says ' let 's go ' , signaling an attempt to pull the plane up .
The last sound was a prolonged curse by an unidentified person in the cockpit .
President Kaczynski died alongside dozens of leading officials when his plane came down on April 10 .
The aircraft came down in dense fog close to Smolensk military airport .
The transcript is notable by failing to explicitly answer the key question that has dogged the probe into the crash - whether President Kaczynski pressured the pilots to land so he would not miss a high profile ceremony commemorating the victims of a wartime Stalinist massacre in which 22,000 of his countrymen perished .
Yet nine and a half minutes before the crash , it reveals Kaczynski's head of protocol Mariusz Kazana was in the cockpit saying : ' The president has not decided yet what we will do . '
No specific instructions to the pilots are head from air force chief General Andrzej Blasik who , unusually , was in the cockpit in the final moments of the flight .
One phrase will trouble investigators who still have to conclude the cause of the crash which devastated Poland .
Victims : Both President Kaczynski and his wife Maria died in the crash
It it not clear who uttered the words which can be translated as ' He will go berserk if ...' or ' He will be furious if ....' , nor why they were said .
President Kaczynski had a track record of putting pressure on his pilots to land in difficult conditions .
The dead president 's twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski today demanded the return from Russia of the original black box recorders .
Kaczynski - a candidate in the Polish presidential election caused by his brother 's death - also called for Warsaw to take over the crash investigation from Russia , a move which Prime Minister Donald Tusk has refused .
Alan Henry calls on his 40 years of experience as a Formula One journalist to pick his top 10 grands prix at Silverstone .
This was one of the most gripping and truly sensational of races ever to be staged at Silverstone , still an event which is talked about with great passion and enthusiasm 40 years later .
Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt were regarded with some justification as amongst the finest of their era and were genuinely close friends .
But that friendship was put on hold as they battled wheel - to - wheel for 84 laps of the 2.9 - mile circuit with Stewart 's Matra MS80 and Rindt 's Lotus 49 C swapping the lead repeatedly .
Eventually Rindt had to pit with a loose wing endplate and subsequently made a second stop to top up with fuel , handing the Scot an easy win .
1973 : Revson proves his class
Jody Scheckter hit the headlines in this event , in fact he exploded to the top of every newspaper front page after spinning his McLaren M23 coming out of Woodcote corner on the opening lap of the race , triggering a multiple pile - up which understandably resulted in the race being flagged to a halt .
At the restart Peter Revson , the popular and underrated American driver , stamped his unobtrusive and well - judged domination on the event , holding sway at the head of a four car battle to beat Ronnie Peterson 's Lotus 72 , Denny Hulme 's McLaren M23 and the emergent James Hunt 's Hesketh March 761 in a tight quarter covered by barely four seconds .
1957 : Collins take his final victory
Although Stirling Moss grabbed pole position for Vanwall , this turned out to be a two - horse race for close friends and Ferrari team - mates Peter Collins and Mike Hawthorn .
On this occasion Collins had the measure of his pal , handling the works Dino 246 with commendable assurance to notch up and unflurried Maranello 1 - 2 on the drivers ' home patch .
But it was Roy Salvadori's third place in the works Cooper - Climax which rammed home the prevailing message of the time , namely the days of the front - engined F1 car were indeed numbered .
1965 : Clark takes his fourth
This was the final British GP to take place under the 1.5 - litre F1 regulations and was noteworthy for two key factors .
It was Jim Clark 's fourth straight British GP win for Lotus and marked the British debut of the new Honda in the hands of Richie Ginther ; the American driver qualifying the Japanese machine on the front row of the grid and leading the race as far as Stowe corner on the opening lap .
From then on , it was Jimmy all the way , his Lotus slowed only in the closing stages by flickering oil pressure , but his legendary gentle touch saw him nurse the car home for another win ahead of Graham Hill 's BRM .

This was a race in which it looked as though James Hunt would have his work seriously cut out if he was to do well , not least because he was driving the tricky McLaren M26 rather than the user - friendly M23 which had carried him to the previous year 's title crown .
Sure enough , in the opening stages John Watson had the legs of him at the wheel of Bernie Ecclestone 's flat - 12 Alfa - engined Brabham BT45 , but this fine performance from the Ulsterman was blighted by a fuel pick - up problem , allowing Hunt to romp home ahead of Niki Lauda 's brake - troubled Ferrari .
1960 : Graham
Hill out of luck
This was a race made memorable by the searing pace set by Graham Hill 's BRM for much of the race , the mustachioed Londoner leading until a few laps from the finish when he spun off while lapping some slower cars under pressure from the wily Jack Brabham , who was thus able to score another good win for Cooper .
Not only did this race showcase Hill 's rising star , it did much the same for the brilliant John Surtees who finished a magnificent second on his Grand Prix debut , bringing his Lotus 18 past the chequered flag ahead of his more seasoned team - mate Innes Ireland .
1987 : Mansell shows his class
The intra-team rivalry between Williams - Honda team - mates Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet was a highlight of the 1986 and 87 seasons , but reached its competitive zenith during the 1987 British GP on Silverstone 's wide open spaces .
Piquet led from the start with Mansell initially keeping pace , but increasingly troubled by a front wheel vibration caused by a lost balance weight .
When Nigel pitted at the end of lap 35 for fresh tyres - with 30 left to go - it seemed as though there would be no way he could possibly make up the 28 second deficit .
But he did just that and double - bluffed Piquet out of the lead with a brilliant slice past at Stowe corner at 180 mph on the penultimate lap .
1983 : Prost bids for championship
Alain Prost did not manage to win the 1983 world championship , but his pace and fitness at the wheel of the works Renault RE40 in torrid conditions at Silverstone saw him see off an early challenge from the Ferraris of Patrick Tambay and Rene Arnoux as well as the Brabham - BMW of Nelson Piquet to take one of his most memorable victories .
Mansell was also one of the stars of the show , demonstrating great determination to finish fourth in the promising new Lotus 94T on its debut outing .
2000 : Great day for DC
This was the year in which the grand prix weekend was ruined by torrential rain and flooded car parks .
The race was led in the early stages by Ferrari's new number two Rubens Barrichello , but it eventually came down to a superb all - McLaren battle between Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard .
The Scot eventually prevailed over his colleague by just over a second after one of his very best F1 performances .
Michael Schumacher 's Ferrari was third ahead of brother Ralf 's Williams - BMW .
2008 : Lewis proves it 's true
He may have qualified only a lowly fourth in his McLaren , but Lewis Hamilton rocketed into an immediate second place behind team - mate Heikki Kovalainen as the pack hurtled into a soaking Copse corner on the opening lap .
Hamilton took five laps before swooping past his team - mate to grab the lead at Stowe mid-way round lap five , after which the story was pretty much over .
Hamilton utterly dominated the afternoon from then on .
measuring a computer ’s iq the singularity way
Another day , another Singularitarian idea for measuring artificial intelligence , this time , through statistical problem solving .
Contrary to what you might think from my posts about the notion of the Technological Singularity , I do take the claims made by Singularitarians quite seriously and take time to look at their arguments .
Now , often times I ’m reading papers dealing with very abstract ideas , few tangible plans for a particular system , and rather vague , philosophical definitions which have little to do with any technical designs .
Recently , however , I took a look at the work of Shane Legg at the recommendation of Singularity Institute ’s Michael Anissimov , and found some real math into which to sink my teeth .
Legg ’s goal was to come up with a way to measure intelligence in a very pure and abstract form , especially as it applies to machines , and provide a better definition of Singularitarian terms like “ super - intelligence , ” creating a very interesting paper along the way .
But , as you probably guessed already , there are some issues with his definitions of intelligence and what his formula truly measures .
To make a long story short , Legg is measuring outcomes of an intelligent agent ’s performance in a probability game based on what strategies should yield the best results and the biggest rewards over time .
And that ’s an effective way to tackle intelligence objectively since in the natural world , bigger and more complex brains with new abilities are encouraged through rewards such as food , water , mating , luxuries , and of course , a longer , better lifespan .
But there are a few problems in applying a formula to measure performance encouraged by a reward of some sort to a bona fide intellect , especially when it comes to AI .
Humans program the strategy the machine will need to meet these intelligence tests and are basically doing all the work .
Even if the machine in question does have to learn and adapt , it ’s following human algorithms to do so .
Compare that to training any intelligent animal which learns the task , figures out exactly what it needs to do and how , then finds shortcuts that either maximize the reward or reduce the time between rewards .
Legg ’s formula can measure outcomes in both cases , but what it ca n’t measure is that a computer has been “ pre-wired ” to do something while mice , dogs , or pigs , for example , effectively “ re-wired ” their brains to accomplish a new task .
The paper is keenly aware that people like me would question the “ how ” of the measured outcomes , not just the grading curve and circumvents this problem by saying that the formula in question is concerned only with the outcomes .
Well that hardly seems fair , does it ?
After all , we ca n’t just ignore the role of creativity or any other facets of what we commonly call intelligence , or make the task of defining and building AI easier with various shortcuts meant to lower the bar for a computer system we want to call intelligent .
Just as Legg ’s preamble points out , using standardized IQ tests which deal with certain logical and mathematical skills is n’t necessarily an accurate summation of intelligence , just some facets of it that can be consistently measured .
To point this out , then go on to create a similar test taking it up one notch in abstraction and say that how well a subject met certain benchmarks is all that matters , does n’t seem to break any new ground and countering a pretty important question by saying that it ’s just out of the work ’s scope seems like taking a big shortcut .
Even when we cut out emotions , creativity and consciousness , we ’re still left with a profound difference between an intelligent biological entity and a computer .
Although patterns of neurons in brains share striking similarities with computer chips , biology and technology function in very different ways .
When we build a computer , we design it to do a certain range of things and give it instructions which predict a range of possible problems and events that come up during an application ’s execution .
If we can take Legg ’s formula and design a program to do really well at the games he outlines , adopting the strategies he defines as indicative of intelligence , who ’s actually intelligent in this situation ?
Legg and programmers who wrote this kind of stuff for a typical homework assignment in college , or the computer that ’s being guided and told how to navigate through the IQ test ?
Searle ’s Chinese Room analogy actually comes into play in this situation .
Now if we were compare that to humans , who are born primed for learning and with the foundations of an intellect , playing the same games , the fundamental process behind the scenes becomes very different .
Instead of just consulting a guide telling them how to solve the problems , they ’ll be actively changing their neural wiring after experimenting and finding the best possible strategy on their own .
While we can pretend that the how does n’t matter when trying to define intelligence , the reality is that living things like us are actually guiding computers , telling them how we solve problems in code , then measuring how well we wrote the programs .
To sum it up , we ’re indirectly grading our own intelligence by applying Legg ’s formula to machines .
The same can be said about a hypothetical super - intelligence which we ’ve encountered before in a paper by futurist Nick Bostrom where it was very vaguely and oddly defined .
Legg ’s definition is much more elegant , requiring that in any situation where an agent can earn a reward , it finds the correct strategy to get the most it possibly can out of the exercise .
But again , apply this definition to machines and you ’ll find that if we know the rules of the game our AI will have to beat , we can program it to perform almost perfectly .
In fact , when talking about “ super - human AI , ” many Singularitarians seem to miss the fact that there are quite a few tasks in which computers are far better than humans will ever be .
Even our ordinary bargain bin netbook can put virtually any math whiz to shame .
Try multiplying 1.234758 × 10 ³³ by 4.56793 × 10¹² .
Takes a while , does n’t it ?
Not for your computer which can do it in a fraction of a millisecond though .
Likewise , your computer can search more than a library ’s worth of information in a minute while you may spend the better part of a few months to do the same thing .
Computers can do a number of tasks with super - human speed and precision .
That ’s why we use them and rely on them .
They reached super - human capabilities decades ago but because we have to write a program to tell them how to do something , they ’re still not intelligent while we are .
In fact , I think that by using computers and outsourcing detail - oriented , precision and labor intensive tasks for which evolution did n’t equip our brains is in itself a demonstration of intelligence in both logical and creative realms .
In our attempts to define computer intelligence , we need to remember that computers are tools and if we did n’t have access to them , we could still find ways of going about our day to day tasks while any computer without any explicit directions from us would be pretty much useless .
Now , when computers start writing their own code without leaving a tangled mess and optimizing their own performance without any human say in the matter , then we might be on to something .
But until that moment , any attempt to grade a machine ’s intellect is really a roundabout evaluation of the programmers who wrote its code and the quality of their work .
The ACLU filed an appeal brief last Friday in its lawsuit against a Louisiana school district that segregates students by sex .
The ACLU is representing two girls who attend the Rene A. Rost Middle School in Vermilion Parish School District in Kaplan , Louisiana .
Two weeks before classes were to begin last fall , the mother of our clients learned that the school would be segregating the students by sex in all of the core curriculum classes in all grades in the school .
We contacted the school board on the girls ' behalf , informing the board that it was illegal to segregate students by sex , particularly because the school did not even offer a coeducational option .
The school responded that it would offer a coeducational class , but when the school year began , we learned that the only classes that were not sex - segregated were special education classes , which the school never planned to segregate .
Apparently the principal 's belief that students would be better served by segregated classes did n't apply to students with special education needs .
We filed a lawsuit against the school board and sought a preliminary injunction to stop the school from segregating students by sex .
Unfortunately the district court denied our request .
Although the court noted that the sex - segregation program was flawed , had been wrongfully implemented and was based on " extremely flawed " data , it found that the school did not intend to harm the students and refused to issue a preliminary injunction , but did require substantial modifications to the program .
It limited the number of sex segregated classes in each grade to two ( one for each sex ) and required that parents be informed that students with IEPs will be accommodated in both coeducational and sex- segregated classes .
However , these changes , although a definite improvement for the students of Rost Middle School , are insufficient given that there was simply no basis for any sex segregation at the school .
Referring to the data that the principal used to sell the program as " extremely flawed " is generous at best .
During the 2008 - 2009 school year , the principal , with the approval of the school board , conducted an experiment on eighth grade students to prove his beliefs that segregating students based on sex would improve student performance .
He put all of the students in coeducational classes for the first 12 weeks of the school year , and then , without seeking consent from parents , switched most of the students to sex - segregated classes for math and English for the next 12 weeks .
He gave the math and English teachers materials authored by sex-segregation advocates to help them learn " gender specific " teaching strategies .
At the end of the school year , the principal proclaimed the experiment a success , saying that grades increased during the period of sex segregation .
Based on this purported success , the school board adopted sex-segregation for the entire school for the 2009 - 2010 school year .
But it appears that math was not the principal 's best subject .
A review of the actual student records shows that actual academic performance as measured by test results and report card grades declined for the students during the period of sex segregation , and there was no positive impact on student behavior .
In the appeal brief filed Friday , we are asking the federal appeals court to reverse the district court and order the school to stop segregating students by sex .
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 , better known for its impact on increasing the number of girls participating in school sports , makes it perfectly clear that students can't be excluded from participating in any education programs or activities because of their sex , yet that 's exactly what is happening at Rene A. Rost Middle School .
In addition , the Supreme Court has said that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution requires an entity such as a public school board to have an extremely persuasive justification for separating students by sex , and the principal 's faulty experiment cannot satisfy that requirement .
Most important , sex segregation , like race segregation , disserves both boys and girls .
Boys ' and girls ' brains are not dramatically different , and to generalize about student ability or learning style based on sex is to do no more than promote harmful stereotypes and limit the individual development of each child .
Moreover , as Katie Schwartzman , Legal Director of the ACLU of Louisiana said , " Boys and girls will be less prepared to succeed in the world if they do not socialize , compete and collaborate with members of the opposite sex in school .
Real life is not separated by sex any more than it is separated by race or religion . "
Two groups of researchers studying a potential link between chronic - fatigue syndrome and a virus called XMRV have reached contradictory conclusions , according to people familiar with the findings .
One group found a link , and the other did n't .
Their reports were held from publication after being accepted by two science journals — a rare move ...
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Older women hoping to keep their minds young should keep an eye on the scale -- researchers have found a link between slowing down mentally and piling on the pounds / ( kilos ) .
For every extra point gained on a scale of obesity , scores in reasoning , memory and other mental skills fell , Dr. Diana Kerwin of Northwestern University in Chicago and colleagues found .
“ What we found is that actually obesity in and of itself is an independent risk factor for declining cognitive performance , ” Kerwin said in a telephone interview .
She used data from the Women ’s Health Initiative , an ongoing national study of illness and death among older American women .
She compared women ’s body mass index , or BMI , a measure of obesity commonly used by doctors and researchers , to their results on a test that measured their mental sharpness .
The test evaluated the memory , abstract reasoning , writing , and temporal and spatial orientation skills of the group of women aged 65 to 79 .
Among the 8,745 post - menopausal women who completed the test , for each point increase in the BMI scale , scores on the mental test went down by one point , Kerwin ’s team reported on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society .
“ While the women ’s scores were still in the normal range , the added weight definitely had a detrimental effect , ” she said .
“ Even if you do have normal blood pressure and you ’re not diabetic , it still should be something that ’s looked at as an independent risk factor for your brain health . ”
Kerwin is conducting other studies to see if where the fat is on the body matters -- for instance if it is around the waist or on the hips .
But for now , she says , the important finding is that for older women with obesity , “ even if your blood pressure ’s normal , even if you ’re not diabetic , even if your cholesterol ’s normal , you should still be discussing this with your doctor . ”
BMI is a measure of height to weight and is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared .
A person 5 feet 5 inches tall becomes overweight at a BMI of 25 , or 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) , and obese at 180 pounds ( 82 kg ) , which equals a BMI of 30 .
When he was n't off winning Congressional Medals of Honor at the War of 1812 , or giving George Washington a lift at Valley Forge , Illinois Republican Mark Kirk was busy violating Pentagon rules about mixing politics with active duty service .
The Pentagon said Republican Senate candidate Mark Kirk has been cautioned twice for improperly mingling politics with his military service , but Kirk 's campaign denied any improper conduct Tuesday .
The Defense Department said Monday night that Kirk , a commander in the Navy Reserve , was warned after two incidents of political activity while he was on active duty .
Before being allowed to go on active duty again in Afghanistan , Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew to avoid all political work .
" Commander Kirk was counseled about each of his violations after they occurred and signed a statement acknowledging the limitations on his ability to participate in campaign activities while on active duty .
He was required to complete this acknowledgment before being allowed to begin active duty in December 2009 , " the Pentagon said .
“ I do n’t know what I ’ve done wrong , ” the patient told me .
She was an intelligent and articulate woman in her early 40s who came to see me for depression and anxiety .
In discussing the stresses she faced , it was clear that her teenage son had been front and center for many years .
When he was growing up , she explained , he fought frequently with other children , had few close friends , and had a reputation for being mean .
She always hoped he would change , but now that he was almost 17 , she had a sinking feeling .
I asked her what she meant by mean .
“ I hate to admit it , but he is unkind and unsympathetic to people , ” she said , as I recall .
He was rude and defiant at home , and often verbally abusive to family members .
Along the way , she had him evaluated by many child psychiatrists , with several extensive neuropsychological tests .
The results were always the same : he tested in the intellectually superior range , with no evidence of any learning disability or mental illness .
Naturally , she wondered if she and her husband were somehow remiss as parents .
One of the most common questions I get is “ What ’s the easiest and most impressive dinner I can make for friends ? ”
My response is always Roasted Chicken .
It ’s relatable , always delicious and easy to make .
There are so many different varieties — herb roasted , lemon pepper , cajun , the possibilities are left to your imagination .
You can pair it with a salad , or rice , any type of veggie , I guarantee your guests will leave with happy stomachs and a full heart !
There ’s something magical about roasted chickens — perhaps it ’s the down - to- earth simplicity , the intoxicating flavors and smells , the comfort that seems to spread to the deepest corners of your soul — okay got a little overly dramatic there , but you get the idea .
Today I am taking a page from the big boss , Oprah Winfrey , is there anything that woman ca n’t do ?
In the Oprah Magazine Cookbook I found this beautiful recipe for a Cinnamon Curry Roasted Chicken .
I made a few changes which I will note in parentheses and then came up with two sides that I felt would pair well — Coconut Basmati Rice and some Saffron Garlic Skillet Potatoes .
The flavors of the spices were out of this world , I loved the boldness of the cardamom and the spicy sweetness of the cinnamon .
O - M - G talk about flavor heaven !
The recipe was by Chef Rori Trovato —
“ It ’s a little bit sweet , a litte bit daring .
It ’s cinnamon , and it ’s probably sitting right there in your pantry . ”
Ingredients for Cinnamon Roasted Chicken : ( Makes 2 - 3 servings )
1 ( 3 - 4 lb ) roasting chicken

Take your spices and ground them in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle .
For the brine , combine the water , salt , sugar , and spices in a large saucepan .
Bring the mixture to a boil , stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar .
Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out .
Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water .
Set aside .
Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface .
Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients , because no one is a fan of salmonella !
Place the chicken in the brine , make sure it is completely immersed in the brine .
Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour , preferably overnight .
To make the chicken : Preheat oven to 400F .
Pat chicken dry with paper towels .
Place on a rack in a small roasting pan or baking dish .
Set aside .
In a small frying pan over medium heat , combine cumin seeds , black peppercorns , coriander seeds , and cardamom pods .
Swirl until lightly toasted and fragrant , 2 to 4 minutes .
Remove from heat and cool slightly ; grind using a mortar and pestle ( or a coffee grinder ) .
Mix with curry powder , cinnamon , and red pepper flakes .
Finely chop peeled garlic cloves and combine with ginger and olive oil in a small bowl .
Rub mixture over entire chicken .
Sprinkle with salt , then with spice mixture .
Place unpeeled garlic , shallots , and cinnamon sticks inside chicken cavity .
Tie legs with kitchen string .
Roast 30 minutes before basting with 1/2 cup chicken broth .
Roast 20 minutes more , then baste with remaining 1/2 cup broth .
Continue cooking until juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a knife and meat is no longer pink , about 1 hour and 15 minutes total .
Remove from oven and cool slightly .
To make the sauce : Transfer juices from pan into a saucepan and bring to a boil .
Reduce heat .
Slowly add in the yogurt , stirring constantly with a whisk so yogurt does n’t curdle .
Remove from heat .
Add most of the tomatoes and cilantro , setting some aside to garnish top of the chicken .
Serve with sauce on side .

In a food processor fitted with a 1 - millimeter slicing blade or with a mandoline or similar hand - held slicing device , slice the potatoes thin .
Working quickly to prevent the potatoes from discoloring , brush the bottom of a 9 - inch cast - iron skillet with some of the butter mixture and cover it with a layer of the potato slices , overlapping them .
Brush the potatoes with some of the remaining saffron buttermixture and season them with salt and pepper .
Layer the remaining potatoes with the remaining saffron butter mixture in the same manner .
eat the mixture over moderately high heat until it begins to sizzle , transfer the skillet to the middle of a preheated 450 °F .

Adam Ondra - born 1993 in Brno , Czech Republic
Ondra is perhaps the best sport - climber the World has ever seen .
This sinewy seventeen year - old , this Harry Potter - esque , babyfaced youngster , has gained world - wide recognition for fast repeats of the hardest routes all over Europe .
“ I have recently tried to repeat most of the important hard routes in climbing history ... ”
He started climbing when he was three years old and did his first F8a when he was just nine .
Four years later , at the tender age of thirteen , he rocked the climbing world by clipping the chains on his first F9a .
Since then he has successfully climbed 38 routes of F9a or harder .
Adam 's recent visit to the UK , where he climbed at our top sport venues of Malham and Kilnsey in Yorkshire , has been covered briefly on UKClimbing.com and other websites .
Many people already know he ticked two of Steve McClure 's F9a routes at Kilnsey ; North Star and Northern Lights .
These ascents are the first time that any route of F9a has been repeated in the UK .
Ondra 's trip was a landmark in British climbing for this reason , but importantly it serves as a good indicator of just how good Steve McClure really is .
It took the next level , the next generation of super climber , to succeed on these climbs ... but Ondra did n't cruise every route he tried .
Overshadow , Steve 's hardest route , the F9a + at Malham , held out .
Ondra tried it , but did n't tick it in his short week - long stay .
“ There is some unfinished business , so I should be back next spring .
Overshadow is waiting ... ”

ADAM ONDRA - The Exclusive Interview :
Lets get down to brass tacks .
Why is it that a 17 year - old kid from the Czech Republic is suddenly the World 's best climber ?!
It 's hard to say , but I think that there were some positive factors , like parental support , a passion for climbing and some natural talent , which just joined together well :)
You started to climb at a very young age , when exactly was that and what set the ball rolling ?
I started climbing thanks to my parents who have been going with me on the rocks since I was a baby .
Naturally I wanted to try it , so I tried my first climbing moves at the age of three or maybe four , but I started climbing more frequently at the age of six .
I felt the strongest impulse to climb when I entered my first competitions , I took third place and won a perfect metal cup .
So actually , at first , I climbed to win metal cups . :-) .
But very soon afterwards , I started to prefer climbing on the rock , which I now love the most – natural rock climbing .
THE UK :
You have recently visited the UK , hitting the crags in Yorkshire – Malham Cove and Kilnsey .
Can you give is the low down on what you did ?
During the first two days , which we spent at Malham Cove , I tried Overshadow , the F9a + by Steve McClure , and thought it could go after a proper rest .
I took a rest day , but this did n't really help .
The bottom part was okay but then I got into the crux and I felt too tired to do it .
I realised I needed some specific gaston training for it and , well , I rather gave up .
Suddenly Steve McClure appeared and we talked about the route and also about his new project left of Rainshadow , which is supposed to be even harder .
He told me about his sequence on the crux of Overshadow , which was different from the one I found .
It was a shame , as I could n't quickly try it his way after that , as I had already stripped out my rope and quickdraws .
Then we moved to Kilnsey and climbed there for the next two and a half days .
The hardest routes I sent during our trip were North Star and Northern Lights , both F9 a´s at Kilnsey .
Apart from that , I have onsighted lots of routes - 8 a 's to 8 b's at both crags and I really loved the unique and complex climbing .
Malham Cove onsights : Magnetic Fields 8 b , Totally Free II 8 b , Austrian Oak 8 b , Overnite Sensation etc
Kilnsey onsights : Full Tilt 8 b , Mandela 8 b , Ecstasy etc .
“ I found the grades quite stiff in general ... ... Buoux is probably even stiffer ! ”

What did you think about the grades of the routes in Britain ?
I found the grades quite stiff in general .
Many routes I have climbed were from the 80's , and these old routes are pretty stiff for the grade everywhere and Buoux is probably even stiffer !
Another thing is , you have to get used to climbing on those Malham sidepulls and undercuts with pretty bad and polished footholds .
What do you think of Britain and British climbing ?
From what I have seen , I liked it a lot .
I love to climb in different surroundings and on different rock , and this was definitely a lot different to what I have seen before and it was really worth trying .
Of course , we had perfectly dry cliffs and only a little rain , so fortunately we did n't enjoy the ' real misty and drizzly England ' :)
Of course lots of people are interested in your ' trad climbing potential ' , is this something you'd be interested in ?
Do you see it as very different from sport climbing ?
I would n't like to headpoint , so I do n't want to climb anything with ground fall potential from the crux .
It is a challenge , but it 's not something I 'm interested in .
If something is airy with the possibility of long falls but still pretty safe , why not try it ?!
But first I should learn how to place gear !
I would like to climb some trad multipitches in the future , because it 's much faster than drilling and placing bolts and you can avoid groundfall or death - potential falls .
[ Editors Note : Adam has repeated several routes in the Ratikon in Austria / Switzerland , which are huge multipitch ' sport climbs ' up to F8 c .
These routes were bolted on the lead and have massive run-outs , with the potential for very long falls .
They are also very long and in an alpine environment .
Although protected by bolts , they are a lot more ' trad ' than many of the UK 's trad routes .
Fantastic article on the BlackDiamond Website ]
Most climbers at Malham and Kilnsey recognised you pretty fast .
How did they behave and did they talk to you ?
If so , what was the most asked question ?
Yes , they recognised me , but I do n't mind .
All British people were very nice at the crags and were never bothering me , and I always like to talk to people , especially if we share the same passion .
People also helped with belaying me on Northern Lights and North Star , while my friend was taking pictures .
On our last day a couple at Kilnsey invited us for a cup of coffee to the nearest pub and also , they let us stay at their flat in Sheffield overnight as our flight was at 7 am and this meant we did n't have to get up so early in the morning and drive to the airport from Yorkshire .
Thanks again to Jules and Stuart .
The most asked questions were :
How long are you in the UK for ?
Do you like Malham / Kilnsey and which route would you like to climb ?
" I also want to go to Raven Tor as Hubble is a must ... "
So , now we 've done grades and climbing , let 's talk about the important stuff ... we know that Czech beers are pretty good , but we like to think a good pint of Landlord in the Listers is pretty hard to beat .
What did you think ?
We went to local pub once but I did n't have a beer ...
Not every Czech is a notorious beer - drinker and I am only 17 anyway :)
But it is funny the way you order a beer or coke in the UK - that you have to go to the bar to make an order .
In the Czech , you just sit and wait for the waitress to take your order and they also bring it to your table , it 's the lazy way :)
So , overall did you enjoy your stay in the UK and are you going to come back again ?
If I did n't enjoy it , I would n't like to come back !!
There is some unfinished business , so I should be back next spring .
Overshadow is waiting .
I also want to go to Raven Tor as Hubble is a must since it is the World 's first 8 c + .
Also Steve 's new project at Malham looks just amazing .
Besides that , I think Malham and Kilnsey offer some potential for extremely hard routes in the upper parts or extensions .
Although everybody told me that these lines are often wet .

STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES :
You seem to climb everywhere and everything and it is certainly impressive that you are travelling around and jumping on these hard routes in far flung places .
Given that all your ascents are in different countries , on different rock types and also on big walls , it seems like you 're one of the most versatile sport - climbers at the moment .
Do you even have some weaknesses in climbing , perhaps specific type of holds or moves , and conversely , what is your main strength ?
I have tried to climb as much outdoors as possible , climbing many routes in one day , mainly onsight , absolutely no working on the routes .
I think this was very important for getting the ' sense ' , how to solve tricky sequences quickly and simply .
I am at my weakest on pure power long moves , for example long moves on good pockets .
My strength is definitely kicking my feet very high and knee - dropping .
Generally I am better on crimps than slopers .
Do you feel a pressure to perform , either at home , or when you make a trip to somewhere like the UK ?
Be it from the media , sponsors , other climbers or whoever , or can you still climb for fun and enjoy it ?
Both .
But the biggest pressure comes from myself , not really from the other people around .
But I still take an enormous amount of joy from it , especially when I warm up or warm down and I just enjoy the movement .
Adam Ondra on a close but unsuccessful onsight attempt on Cry Freedom at Malham , the F8b+ from Mark Leach that took him 40 days to redpoint back in 1988 .
It is generally regarded as F8 c these days .

TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL :
Many people are waiting for you to take climbing to the next level , to bolt and climb a new ' super route ' - any thoughts ?
I have recently tried to repeat most of the important hard routes in climbing history in order to know what the new levels and steps forward might look like .
I do n't know what other people would do if they were fifteen and had so many routes to repeat whilst having a duty to go to school at the same time .
Exploring and new - routing is really time - consuming .
During the last five years , I only really explored and new - routed in my home area , but I did not drill any bolts there by myself , I just marked the rock and my friend put the bolts in for me .
The hardest of these routes is Perla vychodu F9a ( Pearl of the East ) , it 's a really beautiful line on perfect holds .
But we hear that one of your Christmas presents was a drill .
Have you had time to bolt some more projects and try them ?
I have bolted two projects so far , one remains unclimbed and the other is Tanec kuratek F9a ( Chicken dance ) , that I managed to free at the end of March .
It 's a really unique line in a narrow cave with many tricks like chimney - ing and awkward toe hooking and it's something I am really proud of .
For sure it was a good experience and has motivated me to keep bolting .
Ondra 's ascents of the two F9a's ( here he 's on North Star ) are the first repeats of a ninth grade route in the UK © Vojtech Vrzba
You plan to visit the Frankenjura with your drill soon too , do you have any crags in mind ?
The problem with the Frankenjura is that most lines on equipped crags are already bolted and remain projects , but I am not sure if they are open or closed .
I saw some unequipped crags that looked very interesting for hard climbs , but I do n't know if bolting is allowed there or not .
Is there anything in climbing you would like to try but you have n't had enough time to do so yet ?
I 'd like to bolt some hard routes from the ground up .
I 've never tried it , but if I imagine the situation , with skyhooks and a drill , it seems quite unnerving .
But I would love to try it some day to open some huge multipitch routes ground up .
TRAINING / MOTIVATION / TIPS :
You do not have any special training methods and once you said " I train more or less just by climbing ! "
How often do you train and what is your ratio of rock climbing to climbing on plastic and bouldering ?
Rock – sport climbing 85 % , bouldering 15 % .
Plastic – most of the time I train on bouldering walls , but on these bouldering walls I train endurance as well .
I only climb indoor routes around twice a month .
In winter , I climb on plastic five days a week , for two to three hours a day .
During all other seasons , I usually climb on the rock , even after school and only on plastic for two weeks before the competitions .
Do you have a regular climbing partner and who do you like to train with the most ?
More than half of the time I train alone .
If I do n't train alone , I love to climb with my sister , when we 're bouldering it works quite well , we only have to figure out two different variations on the problems .
I also train with Martin Stranik or I sometimes go to train with Tomas Mrazek , who has a really good bouldering wall in his house .
When you climb , on rocks or at competitions , are you aware of others around you ?
Do you get extra motivation from onlookers spurring you on ?
When I am in the real zone , I do n't perceive if somebody is shouting me on or not .
But to get into such a state of mind is very difficult and usually I only manage this a few times a year .
So most of the time I perceive it and sometimes it helps .
It does not make me more nervous or knock my concentration as long as somebody does n't shout " come on " from the very first move when I 'm still on easy ground .
What motivates you to climb so hard , to push yourself so far ?
Is it the sweet taste that comes from success on hard routes ?
There are so many things that motivate me .
I like the challenge , exploring , crimping hard ...
But it 's true that I am the most motivated after I have successfully accomplished my project .
In climbing , fingers suffer a lot and with your frequency of climbing it is almost unbelievable that your fingers are still okay .
Is it because of any special training or diet ?
I do n't know , you have to bear in mind that I started climbing many years ago , but for many years had not trained , just climbed .
Progression was slow , fingers and tendons were getting continually stronger and more used to holding small holds .
If somebody starts climbing at the age of twenty and gets better very fast , it 's a different story because their tendons are n't used to it .
Bad skin stops many climbers from climbing hard multiple days in a row .
How do you handle thin or sore skin on your fingers when on your climbing trips ?
Most of the time I have very thick and hard skin , which is very good on the rock , but terrible for plastic and competitions , because you never know when you 're going to slip off a hold .
When my fingers are all bloody , I have to take a rest and I use some creams such as ClimbOn ! , and Propolis Cream .
I have n't found any special thing for growing skin , everything helps just a little :)
Do you care about your diet and what is your favorite meal on a climbing trip ?
I eat a lot but I try to eat rather healthy stuff - and I naturally do n't put on weight , which is a big advantage :)
My favourite meal is pasta with various sauces before a climbing day and fish with basmati rice or couscous before a rest day .
Do you have any rituals before you start climbing ?
Putting the right shoe on first :)
And you 're sponsored by La Sportiva , but they do a very wide range of shoes , do you stick to certain models ?
Or do you swap around ?
Mostly I climb in La Sportiva Miura and Miura Velcro .
From time to time I like to try different models like the Speedster and recently also the Katana Lace Up .
But yes , I usually have four different pairs of shoes for different kinds of climbing that I take on every trip .
Overall I use about twelve pairs of shoes and five ropes every year !

Do you have time to perceive public responses on your successes and do you ever join the internet discussions ?
I usually look at the comments , but I never join the discussions .
Do you ever have moments when you ' don´t like ' climbing ?
I usually have plenty of motivation .
I sometimes hate to climb a route again if I 've taken lots of falls , but I always love to climb something different , something new .
The only time I I have no motivation is when it is more than 35 degrees , I really hate to climb when I am soaked in sweat .
Your family gives you absolute support .
Do you think that it would have been possible to achieve such a high level without their support ?
My parents have been supporting me from the very beginning and they still do .
Those achievements would have been very difficult and even almost impossible without their help – I really appreciate what they have done and are still doing for me .
On the other hand , it could have been a bit easier if we lived in Innsbruck or in Spain , for example . :)
TRAVEL & LIFE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC :
You are visiting many places around Europe during your climbing trips .
Do you have time to visit any other interesting places , cultural , historical etc , or do you spend most of the time on the crags ?
Unfortunately not very often .
I have the opportunity to meet a lot of different people and experience different ways of thinking , which is really interesting , but we usually do n't go sight - seeing because it takes a lot of time and I would n't call it a proper rest day ...
It 's too tiring :-)
There are n't that many hard routes left for you to do in central Europe , so how do you select places to go to ?
If there are some routes to climb and it looks nice on the pictures or I have some recommendations , I go there .
And thanks to Chris Sharma and Dani Andrada , there are lots of new hard routes bolted every year in Spain , which also still has huge potential .
How popular is climbing in the Czech republic and how easy is it to become a good climber there ?
It 's not very popular and conditions for climbing are n't great .
If you want to climb outdoors as kid and your parents do n't climb , it 's extremely difficult .
But it could be worse , at least we have some climbing areas .
It is quite surprising that we have had quite a few world class climbers , but they have always been strong individuals and motivated to train alone , a great example is Tomas Mrazek .
You will graduate gymnasium / secondary school soon , have you already planned what to study next or which univesity to choose ?
Do you want to study abroad ?
I do not feel it is so soon , two years are still like , plenty of time to decide . :-)
I think I will take a break from school for one or two years , just to travel around and then I 'll try to get to university .
I have no idea if I 'll study abroad or at home .
I 'm leaving it all open and I will see later .
One personal question ... how would you describe your ideal partner or relationship ?
She must be a climber and psyched to go climbing all around the world ! :)
To have a non-climbing partner does n't make so much sense for me , I would n't have time for her and she would feel I do n't care about her .
A huge thanks to Adam and Vojtech for this interview and stunning photos .
We look forward to your next visit Adam - good luck on Overshadow !

A contentious legal issue has emerged during the corruption trial of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich that has nothing to do with his guilt or innocence .
It is whether names and addresses of the jurors should be withheld from the public during the trial , a question that is popping up frequently in courthouses across the country .
...
LOS ANGELES -- Boston Celtics guard Ray Allen set a new NBA Finals record for 3 - pointers in a game with his eighth of the night in the third quarter of Game 2 against the Lakers at the Staples Center .
Allen 's 3 - pointer with 4:42 left in the third quarter Sunday night allowed him to break the mark he shared with Scottie Pippen and Kenny Smith .
" I did n't think it was easy , getting the 3's up in the air , " Allen said .
" You look up and everybody is probably thinking , ' How did this guy get open ? '
But there 's so much going on there -- big screens , misdirection plays .
I thought they did everything they could to keep me from shooting 3's , [ but we ] worked tirelessly . "
Allen connected on the first seven 3 - pointers he attempted in Sunday 's game before one rimmed out late in the first half .
Allen finished 9 - of - 14 shooting for 27 points in the first half .
Of Allen 's nine makes , six were assisted by Rajon Rondo .
He finished the night with 32 points as the Celtics beat the Lakers 103 - 94 to even the best - of - seven series at 1 - 1 .
Allen also had made seven 3 - pointers in a game against the Lakers two years ago .
Limited to 27 minutes due to early foul trouble in Game 1 , Allen never got in a rhythm , connecting on 3 - of - 8 shots , but no 3 - pointers , while finishing with 12 points .
Chris Forsberg covers the Celtics for ESPNBoston.com .

Dr. Immad Hammada and Dr. Murad Abu -Khalaf are both lecturers in electrical engineering born in East Jerusalem .
Their families have lived in the city for generations .
They both left years ago , each one separately , to study in the United States , and after graduating and consolidating their careers they want to return to live in their home town .
But their right to be reunified with their families is being denied by the Interior Ministry , as Amira Hass reported in Sunday 's Haaretz .
Hammada has been living in his city for some three years illegally , without any rights and under constant danger of being arrested and deported , while Abu - Khalaf is finding it difficult to return , even for a visit .
Judge Noam Sohlberg of Jerusalem District Court is hearing their cases against the ministry this week .
Interior Ministry regulations provide for the abrogation of the rights of Palestinian residents of Jerusalem who leave the city for a period of over seven years .
Citizens of Israel can leave the country for any length of time , and their citizenship and all their rights are theirs in perpetuity .
But when it comes to Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem , Israel applies draconian regulations whose covert intent is to bring about the expulsion of as many Palestinians as possible from their home city .
This situation is intolerable :
At a time when the prime minister speaks grandiloquently of the reunification of Jerusalem , Israel practices inequality and discriminates against the city 's Arab residents .
At a time when Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of the economic advancement of the territories , Israel prevents the Arab residents of East Jerusalem from advancing their careers abroad and returning afterward to their home city to contribute toward the development of its economy .
The screws have been tightened in recent years :
In 2008 the residents ' rights of 4,557 Palestinian inhabitants of the city were abrogated , the highest number ever .
Waiting on Judge Sohlberg now is not only the fate of two electrical engineering lecturers , but a far weightier question : Will Israel continue treating the Palestinian inhabitants of its capital as if they were foreign migrants whose rights are conditional ?
The rights of the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem must be equal to those of Jews .
All Jerusalemites have the right to live in their city , to go abroad and return as they will , without any danger posed by the authorities lying in wait for them .
The state is a central concept in the political philosophy of Anarchism .
Anarchism is often defined as being an anti-state ideology .
While this is sometimes a useful way to distinguish anarchists from other state socialists it also leads to a fair bit of confusion .
We will look at the source of this confusion with the aim of showing that anarchism is in its essence opposed to rulers and is not a naive or idealistic form of anti-statism .
What is the State
Anarchism emerges in Western Europe , in the dark times of the mid to late 1800s .
The state is , at this time , of a quite brutal character .
The welfare state is almost entirely absent .
The institutions that exist are almost entirely either military in character ( the police often not being distinguished from the military ) or designed to adjudicate conflicts amongst the rich .
While there were parliaments and courts , they served a function which is perhaps best described by James Madison :
Landholders ought to have a share in the government , to support these invaluable interests , and to balance and check the other .
They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority .
Here we see expressed in no uncertain terms the role of the state as seen by the ruling class in this period .
It is therefore not surprising that the content of anarchist writing in this period is preoccupied with the elimination of the state .
In this context , anti-statism is clearly an opposition to an institution whose purpose is to stop the majority from having a fair share in society .
The form of the state , has however , not stood still .
The massive wave of socialism that occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s had a transformative effect .
The state found itself in a position where it had to change character in order to ensure its very survival against a revolution of the majority .
Republics were made more democratic , institutions were made more egalitarian , and the welfare state was created .
This transformation , which can perhaps be called the rise of Social Democracy has important implications as to how we conceive the state .
The state of the early anarchists really is largely concerned with the coercive arm of the modern state .
This view of the early socialists is summed up nicely by Friedrich Engels :
Further , in most historical states the rights conceded to citizens are graded on a property basis , whereby it is directly admitted that the state is an organization for the protection of the possessing class against the non-possessing class .
The state , as describe here , is nothing more than a " special coercive force " ( also Engles ) meant to keep the majority from power .
Anarchists generally share Madison and Engles view of the state .
A Difference without a Distinction ?
Anarchists want a radical restructuring of society along democratic lines , a democratisation of all organs of governance and importantly the productive forces of society .
Because Anarchists speak favourably of democratic polity , or self governance , we are sometimes accused of playing linguistic games when we say we are opposed to the state .
Yet the distinction between self - governance and the state is not arbitrary .
It is a useful analytic tool that allows us to differentiate two very different states of affairs ( if you 'll excuse the pun ) .
Weber , famously described the state as a " monopoly of violence " .
In fact the monopoly on violence being held collectively by a population in order to protect themselves is not something that should be opposed .
Indeed the Anarchists during the Spanish revolution were not willing to allow the fascists to run about with armed forces in Madrid and Catalonia .
This is hardly surprising , but it has sometimes been used to show that anarchists are actually statists .
Under this definition of statism , they in fact would have to be classified as such .
This description of the state , is however of almost no value at all .
The types of situation that fit " statelessness " in this description of the state are places like Iceland in 1000 or recent Somalia .
They tend to be enormously violent , and are not generally considered desirable by anyone ( save some really strange Anarcho - Capitalist types ) .
Anarchists are not opposed to the wielding of power as long as it is done collectively , with an absence of a ruling class , and in an inclusive society .
The definition of state as given by Engles lets us clearly distinguish a situation in which we [ the working class ] are collectively guiding the development of society , from a situation of tyranny , guided by a limited " opulent " minority .
The many forms of state socialism are without this analytic distinction , and to their great detriment .
They find themselves unable to distinguish the seizure of the coercive arm of the state by a cadre of self described socialists who then declare a workers state , from the real development of a free inclusive and socialist self rule .
The anarchist definition of the state is therefore concerned with the functionality .
If it is democratic , inclusive , accumulation has been abolished and the productive forces are wielded democratically , it is a system of self - governance .
If it is not , it is still a state .
What Lies Beyond
The state in modern form is no longer merely a coercive force intent on guarding the accumulation of the wealthy , and the institutions that they hold .
It is far more democratic now than it was in the past , and has all sorts of auxiliary institutions that serve the interests of the majority including everything from mass transit to the dole .
So when anarchists say they want to eliminate the state , what can they mean ?
Are they intent on destroying our social welfare programs ?
Is the military industrial complex and health care all in the same class , both being equally reprehensible ?
Such an analysis would rightly be viewed as absurd by most people .
The mechanism of transformation of the early republics towards social democracy in the 20th century was largely the result of the majority of people organising in unions and other mass organisations and forcing concessions from the state .
They fought , through strike and other means , for the franchise , democracy , the 8 hour day , the 40 hour week , the social programs that we know today and many things besides .
It is this expression of our own power , a power of people when organised amongst themselves that we are able to build the institutions of the new society .
The mass movement of people , in opposition to the ruling class , is both the means and the ends .
It is not just the mechanism by which democracy will come into being , it is itself inchoate democracy .
The softening of the state was a transformation wrought by this power .
The knowledge of self - organisation , of how to cooperate amongst ourselves , has been heavily eroded since the 1970s .
Indeed , we face a situation where the state hopes to recede from the costly social welfare programs that were necessary concessions in former times .
Times in which radical unions and a strong working class were present .
It may succeed in doing so if the populace finds itself unable to muster forces .
What Might We Do ?
It is imperative that we work to ensure that we do n't lose further ground , but push forward until the state is truly laid to rest for good .
Concretely , this should mean retaking or remaking organisations that represent us in such that they reflect the things that matter to us now .
Democratic reforms were a big part of what socialists called for in the early part of last century .
As those were given , the call for democracy receded into the background , while calls for wages remained .
While clearly many people among the working poor , which constitutes up to a 1/3 of the population , are concerned with wages , as they should be , many wage earners are fairly comfortable .
Instead , they are worried about other issues , such as official corruption , education , the environment and human rights .
Recognising this change is important if we are to find a way to cooperate with each other to move forward .
The most powerful tool that we as wage earners posses is our work .
We are able to withdraw our labour .
If we want to see a real impact on areas such as human rights and the environment , we should not look to the ruling class to do it for us .
We should not focus our time on appeals to justice , to a ruling class which have shown themselves fixated on war and hardly lift a finger for the environment .
Instead we should be using the power we have to ensure that it takes place .
If a company is polluting , its employees could bring it to a halt .
If a company is supplying arms or material assistance to those who violate rights , they can be brought to account .
In other words , democratic assemblies of workers can help to bring about the changes we want to see , and in doing so , make the society itself more democratic .
It is up to ourselves to create these organs , or to transform what exists already into a form that this is possible .
If we do n't do it ourselves , it will not be done .
We talk a lot about the need for America to lead the world in green manufacturing , and with good reason : a strong green manufacturing sector will create good , domestic jobs and boost exports , all while helping us reduce carbon emissions and break our dependence on foreign oil .
But it ’s not just talk .
We ’re taking action to re-establish that leadership , and what ’s happening today , down in Louisville , Kentucky , is a perfect example of how we ’re going to do it .
Vice President Biden was in Louisville today to visit a General Electric facility called Appliance Park , where GE is investing $ 600 million to expand their manufacturing of energy - efficient appliances .
But they ’re not doing it alone – their investment is being supported by $ 24.8 million in Recovery
Act funds through a program called the Section 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit , or “ 48 C ” for short .
We ’ve written about this program before , because it ’s one of our favorite programs here at the Middle Class Task Force – it uses Recovery
Act dollars to spur private - sector investments in the clean energy and energy efficiency technologies we need to tackle our energy challenges .
And those investments create good jobs now , while planting the seeds for vibrant new industries in the future .
Down in Louisville , they ’re having another great effect – they ’re bringing green manufacturing back to America .
Right now , GE makes energy - efficient water heaters in China , but thanks in part to this Recovery Act program , they ’re moving production back to the states .
That ’s a big turnaround .
In fact , these energy - efficient water heaters are the first new product line at Appliance Park in the last 50 years , and the return of all this green manufacturing to the US is going to mean hundreds of new , high - quality jobs down in Louisville .
This is just one of the many success stories we ’ve heard from the 48C program , which is leveraging private - sector investment to create good , middle - class jobs and build a domestic clean energy manufacturing sector .
Our administration has proposed to build on that success by expanding the 48C program , and the Middle Class Task Force has made that expansion a priority .
We ’ve said it before , and we ’ll say it again – it ’s time for Congress to enact our proposed expansion of 48C , because programs like this are the only way we ’re going to keep getting changes like what ’s happening down in Louisville .
And that ’s how we ’re going to lead the world in green manufacturing .

PINPOINTING a precise moment when the world changes is never easy , even in retrospect .
Yet it is possible to say with relative confidence that the world of gambling was changed dramatically by events around a green felt table at Binion 's Horseshoe in Las Vegas on May 23rd 2003 , the final day of that year 's World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) .
The hand immediately preceding the final table — the last nine of the tournament 's 839 competitors who would play for $ 2.5 m — pitted Phil Ivey , one of the sharpest and most ruthless players of his time , against Chris Moneymaker , an unknown 27 - year - old accountant from Nashville .
The newcomer eliminated Mr Ivey thanks to a lucky draw on the last card dealt .
Mr Ivey , a stone - faced old - school player , declined to shake his vanquisher 's hand .
Mr Moneymaker went on to win the tournament .
His victory created what came to be called “ the Moneymaker effect ” : interest in poker soared .
Suddenly spending time playing a game on a computer looked like a road to riches .
And those riches seemed attainable .
The stars in poker , unlike those in professional sport , look very much like the spectators ; they just happen to be more successful .
In the years since Mr Moneymaker 's victory , the tournament has variously been won by a patent lawyer , a Hollywood agent and a 21 - year - old professional poker player .
It is not just professional poker that has changed out of all recognition in the past decade but all forms of gambling worldwide .
The reason has been simple : for the first time anyone who wants to gamble and has an internet connection can do so .
The desire has been there for much of recorded history .
An excavation of a bronze - age city in south - eastern Iran turned up a pair of dice dating back nearly 5,000 years .
Islam forbids gambling , but the Bible mentions casting lots or using fortune to determine an outcome .
Card - playing for money has often been depicted in art ( see detail above of Georges de la Tour 's “ The Cheat with the Ace of Diamonds ” , circa 1635 - 40 ) .
Gambling 's widespread and enduring appeal comes as much from the hope of imposing order on the fundamental randomness of the world as from the expectation of economic gain ( though that certainly has its charms ) .
Blaming a bad result on an offended spirit or a good result on divine favour is far more comforting than accepting the cold indifference of probability .
But there is a darker side to gambling with which ancient civilisations were also well acquainted .
The Rig Veda , a collection of Hindu religious hymns more than 3,000 years old , contains a section known as the Gambler 's Hymn which laments : “ Without any fault of hers I have driven my devoted wife away because of a die exceeding by one [ an unsuccessful bet ] .
My mother - in - law hates me ; my wife pushes me away .
In his defeat the gambler finds none to pity him .
No one has use for a gambler , like an aged horse put up for sale . ”
As the newly single poet above had just discovered , the numbers make most forms of gambling a mug 's game .
The odds of winning the jackpot in America 's richest lottery , Mega Millions , is one in 176 m .
EuroMillions , available to players in nine western European countries , offers slightly better odds : one in 76 m .
Roulette players , on average , will hit their number once in 36 or 37 attempts .
Poker players ' chances of being dealt a royal flush are much the same as being struck by lightning .
A majority sport
Yet hope never dies .
In 2007 nearly half of America 's population and over two - thirds of Britain 's bet on something or other .
Hundreds of millions of lottery tickets are sold every week .
The global gambling market is estimated to be worth around $ 335 billion a year ( see chart 1 ) .
Last year Las Vegas alone raked in gambling revenues of $ 10.4 billion and Macau $ 14.7 billion .
For Las Vegas , that represents a decline in revenue from 2008 .
By contrast , revenues from online gambling continue to rise .
H2 Gambling Capital , a consultancy that monitors the global gambling market , estimates online gambling revenues in 2009 at around $ 26 billion ( see chart 2 ) .
The world 's gambling centres are no longer just Vegas , Macau and Monaco ; they now also include Alderney , Gibraltar , Antigua and Malta , whose favourable tax systems make them irresistible homes for internet - based companies .
Thanks to these companies the old restrictions have started to crumble .
Government prohibition of online gambling has worked about as well as prohibition of other online content , which is to say it is observed mainly in the breach .
America remains the world 's biggest single online gambling market by far , despite the passage in 2006 of the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) — a provision tacked onto a port - security bill that prohibits the transfer of funds from a financial institution to an online gambling site .
After the ban some established sites closed down their American operations , but others filled the void .
Americans are gambling roughly the same amount online as they did in 2006 .
The move online threatens some traditional forms of gambling , such as betting on horses , but appears to benefit others , such as slot machines and lotteries .
And bricks - and - mortar expansion still continues .
The latest addition to the Las Vegas Strip , CityCenter , opened last December .
Covering 76 acres ( 31 hectares ) and costing around $ 8.5 billion , it is the largest privately funded construction project in American history .
Thirty - three American states have casinos ( many of them operated by around 200 Native American tribes ) , as do more than 20 countries across Europe .
The Las Vegas Sands Corporation , which owns the Venetian casinos in Las Vegas and Macau , opened Marina Bay Sands in Singapore in April .
Sheldon Adelson , Sands 's chief executive , believes that Asia can easily accommodate “ five to ten Las Vegases ” .
In the past ten years gambling has changed more than in the previous 70 .
The internet has forced existing businesses to adapt , opened up new opportunities and fundamentally altered the political , economic , corporate and moral climate in which these businesses operate .
This special report will trace those changes through the main forms of gambling , which sadly will mean neglecting strong but local passions such as greyhound racing , bingo , jai alai and cricket fights .
It will begin with Mr Moneymaker 's game .
The DOL reports on weekly unemployment insurance claims :
In the week ending May 8 , the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 444,000 , a decrease of 4,000 from the previous week 's revised figure of 448,000 [ revised up from 444,000 ] .
The 4 - week moving average was 450,500 , a decrease of 9,000 from the previous week 's revised average of 459,500 .
The advance number for seasonally adjusted insured unemployment during the week ending May 1 was 4,627,000 , an increase of 12,000 from the preceding week 's revised level of 4,615,000 ..

This graph shows the 4 - week moving average of weekly claims since 1971 .
The four - week average of weekly unemployment claims decreased this week by 9,000 to 450,500 .
The dashed line on the graph is the current 4 - week average .
The current level of 444,000 ( and 4 - week average of 450,500 ) is still high , and suggests ongoing weakness in the labor market .
Although declining over the last few weeks , the 4 - week average first declined to this level at the end of December 2009 , and has been at this level for almost five months .
Apple 's iPhone and Google 's Android smartphones are getting set for another epic battle next week as these two titans of the smartphone industry show off their latest devices .
First , on June 23 the Axis of Do n't Be Evil composed of Google , Verizon , and Adobe will announce the next wave of Android - based Motorola Droid devices .
Then a day later on June 24 , the Tenacious Tandem of Apple and AT&T launch the iPhone 4 , the latest iteration of the popular smartphone , in the United States ( the device will also launch internationally on June 24 in France , Germany , Japan and the U.K. ) .
Apple already sold 600,000 iPhone 4 devices in one day despite severe technical problems with ordering systems in the United States .
Motorola Droid is the most popular smartphone in the Android army , and the June 23 announcement is expected to bring significant upgrades to Motorola 's popular Android brand .
The stage is set , and the next battle is about to begin as Google and Apple compete over who will become the number one contender to compete for Research In Motion 's smartphone crown .
So , as we get ready for next week 's showdown , let 's look at some of the key areas where the two smartphone platforms will compete , as well as some quick and dirty predictions over who has the advantage in each category .
Devices
The new iPhone 4 is boasting some impressive specs , including a front - facing camera , high - definition 720 p video recording capability , 5 - megapixel rear - facing camera , longer battery life , three - axis gyroscope , and a 960 - by - 640 resolution 3.5 - inch LED display .
On the other side , the big news expected to come out of the June 23 Android announcement is the recently - confirmed Droid X . The Droid X features a 4.3 - inch display , HDMI output , and 720 p video recording capability .
The new Droid device is also said to sport an 854 - by - 480 resolution screen , and 8 - megapixel camera with flash .
The Droid X is likely to run Android 2.1 ( Eclair ) , according to Engadget .
It 's unclear whether the new Droid device will be capable of running the oft - hyped Flash Player 10.1 for mobile devices .
Both devices sound impressive , but Android appears to be missing one key feature present on the iPhone 4 : the front - facing camera .
But on the other hand , there 's already an Android device that boasts this feature on Sprint 's network : HTC's Android - based EVO 4G .
While Apple typically brings out some nice hardware every year , a new and better Android device appears on the market every few months .
Apple simply can't keep pace with the multiplicity of different Android devices being produced , with each one typically being better than the last .
Advantage : Android
Sales and Market Penetration
One Morgan Stanley analyst believes the iPhone is headed for 100 million total users worldwide by the end of 2011 .
That 's a pretty big jump from the 30 million iPhone users said to be around today .
Right now , Nielsen says that Apple owns about 28 percent of the smartphone market in the United States , while Android makes up just 9 percent of U.S. smartphone users .
Both the iPhone and Android , however , grew equally by 2 percent year - over - year during the firs t quarter of 2010 .
Earlier , NPD Group released a report saying that Android sales had outpaced iPhone sales during the first quarter of 2010 , while Gartner said that Android grew by 707 percent during that same quarter .
So Android appears to be coming on strong , but the iPhone still has a much larger share of the smartphone market despite the plethora of Android devices .
If Google wants to beat the iPhone it will have to sustain its phenomenal growth over the long term , but it 's difficult to keep up enthusiasm when you 're announcing a new Android device every few weeks .
Also , despite Google 's successes with Android , it still has n't been able to replicate the iPhone mania that occurs around every launch of a new Apple smartphone .
In fact , there 's already one brave soul camping out for the iPhone 4 in Dallas six days before the new device is released .
Advantage : iPhone
Carriers
There 's an in the United States , but if you want the iPhone you have to go with AT&T .
This has been the state of affairs since the iPhone 's launch in 2007 , and the exclusive relationship shows no sign of ending despite rumors of an iPhone on Verizon or T - Mobile , and even speculation about Sprint .
Apple can withstand the calls to move to multiple operators for the moment , but if Android keeps growing quickly Cupertino may have to consider making its device available in the United States on more than one network .
Advantage : Android
Operating System
Apple has just one operating system available for sale at a time , and until recently it made iOS updates available to almost all of its older hardware .
Android , on the other hand , suffers from a multiplicity of available devices with new and old versions of the hardware , including Android 1.6 , 2.1 and the upcoming 2.2 .
That can get to be confusing for users , since you have to figure out which operating syste m you 're phone has , whether it 's going to get upgrades , and which features you may be missing .
Apple 's approach is much simpler since it makes available ( and supports ) only two versions of the iPhone -- currently iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 -- at once .
Even better , the feature difference between the two phones is not that great and immediately obvious .
Advantage : iPhone
Apps
You would think that apps would be the biggest battleground for these two smartphone platforms , since most critics agree that available applications are what attract new users .
Both companies love to boast about how many apps each store has -- Apple has more than 200,000 and Google has some 30,000 .
But the truth is , both smartphones have reached a level that will serve the needs of most consumers .
Sure , if you 're looking for something like a specialty medical app you owe it to yourself to do the research and figure out which platform is best .
But for most users , there are plenty of apps to go around .
The key here will be whether Apple 's recent policies on banning cross- platform app - building tools will sour developers ' attitudes over the long term .
Conversely , will Google 's embrace of things like Flash and Android 's perceived openness woo more developers to work on the Android platform ?
For now , both sides appear to have an equally aggressive application library regardless of the total number of apps in each store .
Advantage : neither

Cantor : GOP will retake the House in November
By Matt DeLong
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) boldly predicted his party will retake control of the House of Representatives during an appearance Monday on CNBC .
" I think we 're going to retake the House , as Mr. Gibbs suggested yesterday from the White House . "
Cantor said .
" That 's going to change the dynamic for sure . "
He later added : " When we regain the House , because I do think that we 'll retake the majority , the president will have to deal with us . "
Cantor was referring to White House press secretary Robert Gibbs ' admission Sunday that " there 's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control . "
Though he is angling to succeed Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) as House speaker , House Minority Leader John Boehner 's ( R - Ohio ) recent midterm predictions have been a bit more reserved than those of his lieutenant .
In an interview last month with the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) stopped short of pledging to take control of the House .
Several days later , Boehner told The Post 's Dan Balz that there is a " great opportunity " for the GOP in November , but the party will face an " uphill battle . "
Update : Just in time for campaign season , Politico reports that Cantor is releasing a new book with his House colleagues Paul Ryan ( R - Wisc. ) and Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif . ) titled " Young Guns : A new generation of conservative leaders . "
The book will " outline a new direction for the Republican Party . "
One wonders what the old generation of conservative leaders thinks about that .

When Humpty Dumpty uses a word , it means just what he chooses it to mean , neither more nor less .
To people not conversant in a technical specialty , it seems that all the experts are Humpty Dumptys .
Statistics is no exception .
If you ’re a beginner at data analysis , it will seem like there is a superabundance of esoteric statistical slang .
You ’ll hear it even from friendly statisticians .
It gets worse when you start reading websites , books , and worst of all , journal articles .
If you want to see what I mean , read some of the article titles in the Journal of the American Statistical Association ( at http://pubs.amstat.org/loi/jasa).
The statisticians who write those obfuscatory tracts believe they are writing to people who know as much as they do .
This seems odd given that those authors are supposed to be the experts in what they are writing about .
Even other statisticians can’t decipher some of those articles without spending time with the reference books .
So do n’t feel like you ’re alone in a foreign country .
We stand befuddled together .
To simplify statistical jargon , think of three distinctions — statistical concepts named after someone , special words created to convey a special meaning , and common words and phrases with alternative meanings .
We ’ll leave the acronyms out of it for now .
Named Things
Statistical procedures , especially statistical tests , are often modified to accommodate some special circumstance or to have some desirable property .
When this occurs , the new procedure is commonly named after the originators .
Thus , there are statistical tests named after Dixon , Tukey , Wilcoxon , Scheffe , Kolmogorov , Fisher , Levene , Hotelling , Dunnett , and Bonferroni .
And those are just some well - known ones .
Dig into the literature , and you ’ll find scores more .
It ’s not just tests that get named .
Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics based on Bayes Theorem formulated in the 1700s by Reverend Thomas Bayes .
Kriging , the interpolation algorithm of geostatistics was named after Daniel Krige , a South African mining engineer , who pioneered the field in the 1950s .
The Normal distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution after Carl Friedrich Gauss , who introduced it in 1809 , and the Laplacian distribution after Pierre - Simon Laplace who showed that the distribution was the basis for the central limit theorem in 1810 .
There are also theoretical frequency distributions named after Benford , Weibull , Rayleigh , Cauchy , Poisson , and Bernoulli .
If someone mentions a named distribution , test , or other statistical procedure , do n’t panic .
Nobody knows everything .
Just ask what the distribution or procedure is supposed to do .
If you took an introductory course in statistics and know about probability , the Normal distribution , and hypothesis testing , you ’re in great shape for understanding most of the named stat terms you might run into .
This type of statistical jargon could be much worse .
When biologists name something after someone , they do it in Latin .
Created Words
Some statistical jargon might just as well be a foreign language because the words have no common meaning in the English language outside of statistics ( or math ) .
Examples of such words include : kurtosis , leptokurtic , platykurtic , skewness , covariance , autoregressive , variogram , logit , probit , eigenvalue , median , outlier , stationarity , winsorizing , communality , multicollinearity , and my personal favorite , homoscedasticity .
If you ’re at a bar and you hear any of these words being bandied around , slip quietly out the door and run for your life .
Any statistician who uses these words with innocent civilians without explanation either does n’t understand his or her audience or is a sadist .
Dealing with created statistical terms is straightforward ; just ask the statistician using them what they mean .
Preferably ask in a foreign language just to prove the point .
Alternative Meanings
The most confusing statistical jargon just might be words in most people ’s everyday vocabulary that have a very different statistical meaning .
For example , when you hear the word mean , your mind has to sort out the word ’s connotation .
It can signify to intend , as in say what you mean .
It can be used to associate , as in spring means flowers .
It can refer to resources or methods , as in by any means .
It can indicate character , as in she has a mean streak .
It can imply exceptional skill , as in he has a mean fastball .
And of course , in statistics , mean means average . ”
If you do n’t realize that some words in English have different meanings in statistics , you can get confused very quickly .
I ’ve had well - meaning report editors change median to medium and nonsignificant to insignificant .
Here are a few more examples :
Word Meaning to a Statistician Meaning to a Nonstatistician bagging A method for combining predictions from many data mining models
What the cashier does with your groceries when you ’re done paying blocking A technique for controlling variation in ANOVA
What the offensive line does during football season brushing Interactively selecting data points on an on - screen graph to access other information associated with the point
What you do with your toothpaste and toothbrush breakdown Splitting data into groups to calculate descriptive statistics and correlations
What happens to your car when you ’re in a hurry to get somewhere censoring Data with a real but undetermined value , usually less than or greater than all other values in a dataset .
Restricting free speech ; removing material considered to be offensive from books or other media confidence Absence of type I errors Ego stability discriminate Classify observations by a statistical model ; a good thing .
To make distinctions based on race , creed , ethnicity , age or other category without regard to individual merit ; a bad thing errors Differences between observed values and values predicted from a statistical model ; residuals Mistakes mode
The most frequently appearing number in a set of numbers A manner of acting , such as being in “ relaxation mode . ”
Monte Carlo
A simulation procedure for evaluating the properties or performance of a statistic
The quarter of Monaco known for its resorts and casinos ; a hotel in Las Vegas Normal Follows a Gaussian ( bell - shaped ) distribution Typical , routine , sane residual s Differences between observed values and values predicted from a statistical model ; errors Money made by musicians and actors when their works are replayed .
sample
An individual observation or multiple observations that are part of a population A piece , a bit , a taste .
Do n’t feel that you ’re alone in the quagmire of statistical jargon .
Like dialects of the English language , different statistical specialties have their own jargon and ways of expressing ideas .
Data mining , time - series forecasting , quality control , nonlinear modeling , biometrics , econometrics , and geostatistics are all examples of statistical specialties that use terms not used in the other specialties .
Imagine a Louisiana Cajun talking to a Pennsylvania Dutch .
They both speak dialects of English , but it might as well be Greek .

A company called Bevshots has produced a series of shots of booze under the microscope at the Florida State University 's chemistry labs .
This is Dry Martini at 1000 x magnification .
The process consist of letting a droplet of liquor dry out completely on a slide in an airtight container , and photographing the result with a 35 mm camera .
The entire process can take up to three months and as many as 200 attempts to properly capture the drink 's constituent parts .
Cocktails can have fruit and soft drinks in them which contain citric acids and complex sugars which dry out well and look great photographed .
The incredible shapes and colours of the boozy artwork are highlighted by shining natural light on top and through the bottom of the slide .
Just like images of snowflakes , each drink is different .

Updated June 1 , 2010
31 May 2010 : An American solidarity activist was shot in the face with a tear gas canister during a demonstration in Qalandiya , today .
Emily Henochowicz is currently in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem undergoing surgery to remove her left eye , following the demonstration that was held in protest to Israel ’s murder of at least 10 civilians aboard the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in international waters this morning .
21 - year old Emily Henochowicz was hit in the face with a tear gas projectile fired directly at her by an Israeli soldier during the demonstration at Qalandiya checkpoint today .
Israeli occupation forces fired volleys of tear gas at unarmed Palestinian and international protesters , causing mass panic amongst the demonstrators and those queuing at the largest checkpoint separating the West Bank and Israel .
“ They clearly saw us , ” said Sören Johanssen , a Swedish ISM volunteer standing with Henochowicz .
“ They clearly saw that we were internationals and it really looked as though they were trying to hit us .
They fired many canisters at us in rapid succession .
One landed on either side of Emily , then the third one hit her in the face . ”
Henochowicz is an art student at the prestigious Cooper Union , located in East Village , Manhattan .
The demonstration was one of many that took place across the West Bank today in outrage over the Israeli military ’s attack on the Gaza freedom flotilla and blatant violation of international law .
Demonstrations also took place in inside Israel , Gaza and Jerusalem , with clashes occurring in East Jerusalem and Palestinian shopkeepers in the occupied Old City closing their businesses for the day in protest .
Tear gas canisters are commonly used against demonstrators in the occupied West Bank .
In May 2009 , the Israeli State Attorney ’s Office ordered Israeli Police to review its guidelines for dispersing demonstrators , following the death of a demonstrator , Bassem Abu Rahmah from Bil ’in village , caused by a high velocity tear - gas projectile .
Tear - gas canisters are meant to be used as a means of crowd dispersal , to be shot indirectly at demonstrators and from a distance .
However , Israeli forces frequently shoot canisters directly at protesters and are not bound by a particular distance from which they can shoot .
Israeli occupation forces boarded the Mavi Marmara , one of six ships on the Freedom Flotilla at 5 a .m. this morning , opening fire on the hundreds of unarmed civilians aboard .
No -one aboard the ships were carrying weapons of any kind , including for defense against a feared Israeli attack in international waters .
At least 9 aid workers aboard the ship have been confirmed dead , with dozens more injured .
The assault took place 70 miles off the Gaza coast in international waters , after the flotilla was surrounded by three Israeli warships .
The Freedom Flotilla , carrying 700 human rights activists from over 40 countries and 10,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid , was headed for the besieged and impoverished Gaza Strip .
The Israeli blockade on Gaza , combined with the illegal buffer zone , has put a stranglehold on the territory .
42 % of Gazans are unemployed , and food insecurity hovers around 60 % according to figures from the Palestine Centre for Human Rights .

Graduating from college is a momentous occasion .
You ’ve accomplished a great deal throughout your years of education , so take time to be proud of yourself .
But now you can expect dramatic changes after you graduate .
It can be overwhelming to navigate the changes to your life after graduation from college .
You should keep living frugally , start saving money , start paying off debt , and even begin planning for retirement with a Roth IRA , to name a few .
Let ’s take a look at these tips about life — and money — for college graduates and their parents .
New Graduates : Some Financial , Money and Career Advice for You
First of all , every college graduate should follow a few tried - and - true financial guidelines as they venture out of school and into the next phase of life .
Start Paying Off Credit Card Debt
If you have any credit card debt , you should begin to pay that off aggressively , preferably as soon as possible .
Credit cards often carry some of the highest interest rates around , so any balance you keep will drastically increase the amount you ’ll pay in the long run .
If you find that you ca n’t manage paying off your credit cards in full each month , it might be wise to quit using them entirely , unless it ’s an absolute emergency .
It ’s good to learn the discipline of spending within your means , and if credit cards make it harder to do that , stop relying on them .
Pay off your remaining balances as quickly as you can .
High - interest debt will seriously hold you back from all other financial goals and make it tough to get ahead .
Make a Plan to Pay Off Student Loan Debt
Student loan debt is often seen as “ good ” debt because you use it to further your education and career prospects .
Plus , the interest rates tend to be lower than those of credit cards .
However , you do n’t want to keep them around forever , so make a plan to repay your student loans ASAP .
After graduation , you have a grace period of 6 months or so ( sometimes 9 months ) , when you are n’t required to begin making loan payments yet .
This is meant to give graduates time to find employment and get settled .
But if you ’re already making money , go ahead and start paying down your loan principal right away .
Find out the total amount you owe and your loan interest rate .
Use online calculators to figure out how quickly you can pay off the loans .
Pay attention to the interest : how much would you pay in total interest , based on various repayment schedules ?
Even during the grace period , interest begins to accrue on your loan balance ; that ’s one reason to pay it off promptly .
If you have credit card debt , then during your student loan grace period , by all means , focus on the credit card debt .
But then figure out how you can work towards becoming completely debt - free .
The longer you are paying student loans , the less money you ’ll have available from your paycheck to save and invest for the future .
So do your best to focus on getting out of student debt as quickly as possible .
It may be painful for a few years , but you ’ll be so glad to get the debt off your shoulders .
Pay Off Debt App with Jackie Beck
Once you ’re motivated to pay off your debt , you might need a little help with strategizing .
The Pay Off Debt app with Jackie Beck lets you organize your debts and customize your debt payoff strategy .
Whether you decide to use the debt snowball , debt avalanche , or another method you create , this app enables you to set everything up with ease .
With the Pay Off Debt app , you can examine different scenarios of how various payment amounts or methods will impact your timeline to debt freedom .
An amortization table is provided for each debt balance , so you can view how much is going to principal versus interest .
Perhaps the app ’s most valuable feature is its focus on motivation .
It provides progress updates , space to add photos representing why you want to be debt - free , and a “ Paid ” icon to inspire you with each final debt payment .
Check out the Pay Off Debt app here .
Start an Emergency Fund and Savings Plan
Job security can be a fleeting thing .
It ’s not Mom and Dad ’s responsibility to bail you out when you mess up or if you lose your job .
So be sure to start saving money as soon as you can .
Everyone needs an emergency fund to carry them through a job loss , a medical issue , a car repair , or other unexpected expenses .
It ’s never been easier to set up a savings account — you can just do a quick Google search and find top online high - yield savings accounts .
Signing up takes just a few minutes .
Decide how much you can save every paycheck , and arrange to do it automatically .
Seriously , automation is the key here .
Once you have your employment lined up , start figuring out how much you can save .
It may depend on how much you ’re making , but 15 % would be a great goal to start with .
Once you get a few months of work in , you may find that you can gradually bump up that savings percentage without even missing it .
Automating your savings means you set it up once and forget it .
Pretend that money is n’t even there , and live on what ’s left in your checking .
Your savings will grow and soon you ’ll have a solid emergency fund .
Then you can even start saving for big life expenses and fun things .

Live Like a College Student
Between graduation , moving out , interviewing , starting employment , and more all in a short time period , this transition can be chaotic .
One smart choice you can make right now , which you wo n’t regret , is to keep on living like a college student .
Resist the urge to increase your spending and succumb to lifestyle inflation .
When you ’re just starting out in the “ real world , ” it may be tempting to reward yourself and spend like crazy .
But it ’s smart to hold off on expensive choices this first year or two post - grad .
You do n’t need brand - new furniture or a luxury car or a fancy apartment right off the bat .
Do n’t let people convince you that you ’re not a true “ adult ” if you do n’t start spending like crazy .
The actual mature thing to do is manage your expenses and live within your means .
Keeping to the lifestyle of a broke college student after graduation will do great things for you .
You ’re already used to living a pretty frugal life anyway .
Take this time to realize how little you actually need to get by and to be happy .
There ’s always time to upgrade your lifestyle later on .
The “ broke college student ” phase is also a great time to start paying off debt because you ’re already living on a bare - bones budget .
It ’s much harder to scale back your lifestyle and spending later on , when you may have more responsibilities like a family to support .
Make a Budget
If you ’ve never created or used a budget before , have no fear .
There are many different ways to budget , but the essential thing is to make a plan for where your money will go each month .
If you have a set salary , budgeting is pretty simple .
Just write down your income each month ( old - school with paper and pen , or digitally ) .
If your pay varies , just make your best guess on income .
Next , write down how much you anticipate spending in all of the important categories .
Fixed expenses are pretty easy to calculate — those are bills like your rent , car payment , student loans once those kick in , etc .
Other expenses are variable , like utilities and food , but you can usually estimate these fairly accurately .
Then be sure to add in other typical spending categories like clothing and entertainment , but remember that these can be kept very frugal .
Total up how much you earn each month ( minus taxes ) .
Total up how much you expect to spend each month , then compare the two figures .
If you ’ve got income left to spend , figure out where that can go , whether it ’s to savings or something else where you ’d like more wiggle room .
However , if you ’re short on money by the end of the month , you need to figure out areas where you might cut your spending .
Again , this is where living like a college student can be helpful .
Try out frugal tips for eliminating unnecessary or wasteful spending .
It ’s important to keep in mind that budgeting is imperfect and ongoing .
Your funds may vary month to month , and how well you stick to the budget may vary as well .
Just be sure to review your budget each month and make adjustments for the next month .

New Graduates : Making the Transition from College to Workforce
Much of what we ’ve mentioned already is important in the college - to - workforce transition .
You know you should keep living frugally , start saving money , and start paying off debt .
Of course , there is so much advice floating around when you graduate from college .
It may be confusing to discern which parts of that advice applies to your particular situation .
Older adults in your life really do have your best interests at heart , and often they ’ll frame advice as what they wish they ’d done differently .
They ’re trying to spare you the pain they went through due to financial and career mistakes .
Here ’s some financial and career advice for several common post - grad situations .
If You Do n’t Have a Job Yet
This can be really scary !
Some people are lucky and already have a job lined up before graduation day .
But what if you do n’t have a job yet , and you do n’t know what to do next ?
First of all , try to relax , but do n’t turn to retail therapy or something financially foolish .
You want to keep a level head and make smart decisions even while you ’re anxious about the job search .
Focus on your job search .
Spruce up your resume , talk to career experts or a career coach , and pound the pavement to find the right job for you .
As said before , minimize your expenses .
If you ’re not sure when you might find work , consider living at home temporarily to save money .
You might keep eating Ramen for a few months to save on food costs .
Give up your car if you do n’t need one .
Look for whatever ways you can find to cut expenses .
Find some sort of work .
Remember , your first job out of college does n’t have to be “ the ” job .
Most people change jobs , even career fields , multiple times throughout their career .
Some jobs will be temporary , and it ’s okay to take something just to pay the bills as you keep searching .

If You ’re Working an Interim Job
Again , there ’s nothing wrong with an interim job — whatever will help you manage your financial responsibilities while you look for a better job .
Do n’t feel ashamed of taking a job that does n’t ignite your passion ; you just need to pay the bills .
As always , trim your budget and live frugally .
An interim or temporary job likely is n’t bringing in a big salary , so keep things simple and limit your spending .
Save a little bit , no matter how small .
You might not be ready for investing yet , so just focus on building up a starter emergency fund and getting yourself in the habit of saving .
That ’s the only way you can eventually stop living paycheck to paycheck .
Finally , even if you do n’t love your current job , do it with excellence and pride .
It ’s always important to be a good employee .
That means showing up on time , working hard , and making yourself valuable and trustworthy .
That extra effort could mean a glowing recommendation in a few months , helping you land a better job in the future .
If You ’re Launching Your Career
Maybe you ’re graduating with a fabulous job offer in hand , and you ’re ready to launch your career !
Congratulations !
Celebrate and be proud of that accomplishment .
Now , be responsible and set up plans for your money .
You ’ll want to start right away with budgeting , allowing yourself room to pay off debt , save money , and invest for retirement .
Even with a great job and a nice salary right out of the gate , it still is wise to hold off on major spending for a few months .
Limit your spending , especially on luxuries , while you transition into your new job .
Remember that many companies operate under a “ last hired , first fired ” approach , so when you ’re new , you ’re more vulnerable to potential layoffs .
So do an awesome job for your employer and be conservative in your spending , at least for a few months or a year .
Make a spending plan , or a budget , so you can ensure you meet all of your obligations and save for the future .
Try not to inflate your lifestyle too much too quickly , but keep your expenses reasonable .
Start investing towards retirement right away .
How much you can invest depends on how much debt you have , but you should go ahead and set up a 401 ( k ) and possibly a Roth IRA as well .
Certainly , if you ’re eligible for a 401 ( k ) with a company match , start investing enough to receive the full match as soon as you can .
Open a 401( k )
The 401 ( k ) is an amazing tool we can use in the U.S. to prepare for retirement .
Not everyone is eligible for one , but if you are , one of the best pieces of financial advice for new graduates is to open a 401( k ) .
The 401 ( k ) is a great hub of any retirement plan .
Employers in certain fields , like education , may provide a 403 ( b ) , which works similarly to a 401 ( k ) .
Whatever your job is , it ’s a good bet to start investing a portion of every paycheck into one of these accounts .
When interviewing for jobs , one key question you need answered is whether they offer a 401 ( k ) plan .
If they do , find out if you ’ll be automatically enrolled or if you need to initiate that yourself .
This is a priority , but be sure to focus more of your income on debt repayment and saving an emergency fund at first .
But even if you can only spare $ 5 a paycheck for a while , it ’s still smart to set up a 401 ( k ) as soon as you can .
Why ?
Because establishing the habit of investing is crucial .
Once you have an account started , it ’s very easy to gradually increase your contributions along with your income .
Another key motivation for starting a 401 ( k ) is for the tax benefits .
These accounts reduce your tax liability ( your contributions are tax - deductible ) .
In 2020 , employees can contribute up to a maximum of $ 19,500 to a 401( k ) .
The money is subject to federal tax when you withdraw it , but it can grow for decades tax - free .
Of course , the benefit of 401 ( k ) s you ’ve probably heard about is the employer match !
If you ’re among those fortunate enough to have an employer - sponsored match , you absolutely should take advantage of it .
You invest a portion of your income directly into the account , and your employer matches it up to a certain amount , often around 6 % .
If you ca n’t quite afford to put away enough to reach their maximum match , start with a smaller amount and increase your percentage of contributions at least until you can earn their top match .
This match is essentially free money , so you do n’t want to leave it on the table .
Open a Roth IRA
Another great option for retirement savings is a Roth IRA .
If you ’re earning income and do n’t have a bunch of credit card debt to worry about , it ’s time to open a Roth IRA .
In 2020 you can contribute up to $ 6,000 of your pay to a Roth IRA .
Let ’s imagine that you put $ 5,000 a year into a Roth , right off the bat from age 22 .
You continue investing the same amount for the next 40 years at just a 6 % rate of return .
When you retire at age 62 , you ’ll end up with over $ 820,000 in the account ( after having only put in $ 200,000 of your own money ) !
That ’s a fairly conservative estimate , too .
You might save the maximum amount per year , which would increase quite a bit over the course of your working career .
The rate of returns can vary .
But you can see how time is on your side ; that ’s why starting your retirement fund early is so crucial .

Clean Up Your Online Presence
A good piece of career advice for new college grads is to examine your online presence .
You may have done an inventory of your online presence during your college application process , but that ’s been four or five years now .
You should take a couple of hours to clean up your online presence for potential employers , landlords , and others who may have influence on your life .
This simply means taking stock of things like your social media history .
What sorts of things are on the record in your social media accounts ?
You may need to close out those accounts if possible , or go through and weed out any harmful information ( stuff you would n’t want your grandma , or a potential employer , to know ) .
Get yourself a professional email address , if you have n’t already done so .
This sends a message to anyone you connect with , and you want that message to be a positive one .
Parents : How You Can Best Help Your New Graduates
If you ’re a parent of a young adult who has recently completed their college degree , congratulations !
Give yourself a pat on the back .
Parental support is a huge factor in helping a child succeed throughout their education .
Now , as a proud parent , you may wish to bestow an awesome gift on your grad , and that ’s a wonderful sentiment .
But be careful not to waste money on a gift that will quickly be forgotten .
Check out these suggestions of ways to best help a new graduate .
Some of these are intangible gifts , and they can have a major impact on your child long after the graduation ceremony .
These gift ideas may apply to others besides parents — relatives , godparents , and family friends might want to pitch in as well .
Clear Boundaries
Nope , you ca n’t wrap this one up with a bright shiny bow .
But setting clear boundaries after your student nabs their diploma will be a great gift .
You ’ve got to establish a new set of boundaries that fit your family ’s circumstances .
You ’re still a parent and always will be .
But your role will change after your child has graduated college .
Hopefully , you already loosened the reins when Junior went away to college .
But now that your child has graduated , another step in the shift of dynamics will take place .
You can offer advice , but you ’re not in charge anymore .
No matter what decisions your child is making , it ’s important to recognize that he or she is a capable adult .
Allowing your child to move back home temporarily can be an awesome gift .
Many new graduates move in with Mom and Dad after commencement , perhaps for just the summer , perhaps for even a full year .
If you and your graduate decide that their living with you is the right plan , it ’s essential to set clear boundaries .
Establish some ground rules .
What do you expect your graduate to contribute to the household ?
They should contribute something , whether in the form of rent , chores , or other assistance .
How can they expect you to treat them ?
Remember they ’re an adult now , so you have to find mutual respect .
When your college grad does move back home , it ’s generally a good idea to plan on it being a temporary situation , maybe a few months to a year , just to help them find work and save up some extra money .
There ’s nothing like standing on your own two feet , after all .
Professional Clothing
Many graduates are heading off into the corporate world for their first real job .
A fantastic gift that actually helps graduates is a professional suit for interviews or a first job .
Some students are in the habit of living in athletic gear 24 / 7 .
You might take your graduate shopping and even to a tailor to purchase a suit or other professional wear that will fit perfectly .
It ’ll be a great gift to help bolster their self - confidence as they begin interviewing for job positions .
First impressions matter , and a great first impression improves their chances of getting hired .
Budgeting Help
For many of us , budgeting conjures up ideas of stress and anxiety .
As a trusted adult in the graduate ’s life , you can likely offer up some assistance with budgeting .
This might be as simple as purchasing a great personal finance book or online course as a gift .
Or sit down with them a few times to discuss their potential budgeting plans and help them through the process — especially if they ’ve never tried budgeting before .
Lunch With an Influencer
A neat gift idea for a new college graduate is to arrange a meeting , such as a luncheon , with someone with connections or influence within their chosen career field .
Many graduates go through their entire college career without ever sitting down with someone who actually works in their potential career field .
You could really make an impact by putting your student in touch with a professional to share their experiences .
Help them set up the meeting , pay for lunch , and let your student learn from all this influencer ’s wisdom .
The Gift of Financial Planning
We all know how vital it is to create a solid plan for your finances and start saving for retirement as early as possible .
While many 22 - year - olds are not quite ready or interested in hearing it , adults should still make the effort to offer them guidance .
Helping them plan out their finances is one of the best gifts that actually helps new graduates .
Perhaps you could simply have a few focused conversations with your graduate about their plans for the future .
What long - term goals do they hope to accomplish ?
How can you help them to get there ?
If you know of a fantastic financial advisor , this might be the perfect time to introduce him or her to your graduate .
Give this young adult in your life a great start by showing them the ropes of financial planning .

Matching Retirement Contributions
Here ’s another possibility for a smart and useful graduation gift : match their retirement contributions for a certain amount of time .
While you are not allowed to contribute directly to another person ’s 401 ( k ) or IRA ( unless you ’re married to that person ) , that would n’t stop you from contributing — in cash .
For six months or a year , you might offer a matching cash incentive to the graduate .
In other words , whatever amount they put away in a retirement account during that time , you set aside the same amount for them in a high - interest savings account .
Then , at the end of that time period , you can transfer the stash ( including interest ) to the recipient .
While a new graduate probably wo n’t be putting away huge chunks of their first paychecks ( especially if they have hefty student loans to repay ) , your gift could teach them the habit of investing in retirement .
This way , they do n’t get used to taking home their full paycheck and they get a running start into a great retirement plan .
One caveat : make sure to be aware of the current gift tax and the annual limit .
Giving above the annual limit — which is currently $ 15,000 — means the excess may be subject to federal taxes .
You might stipulate to your graduate that you ’ll match their contributions up to a certain amount .
You would n’t want to get into an awkward situation if they invested far above the amount you ’re prepared to give !
Pay Car Insurance or Other Large Expense Temporarily
If you ’d like to assist your graduate in another manner , this might be another fun way to designate a cash gift .
Offer to pay their car insurance premium .
Or maybe help them with the security deposit on their first apartment .
You could also make a gift of their first several months of student loan payments .
Whatever you think would be appreciated the most by your graduate , why not offer a gift towards one of these large expenses ?
Yes , you could also just write a check for any amount you like and assume it ’ll be put to good use .
But most of us enjoy giving gifts that are a little more specific , which is why it ’s neat to make one of these kinds of monetary gifts to a new grad .
Wishing Graduates the Best
College graduation is an awesome accomplishment .
But the transition from college to full adulthood and employment can be a rocky one .
Following these strategies and guidelines can help you as a new graduate .
Getting on solid financial ground will pay off big - time as you move into your career and the next chapters of your life .

India 's law minister has said that the case against those responsible for the Bhopal gas leak in 1984 is not closed .
Veerappa Moily said that US citizen Warren Anderson , then CEO of Union Carbide , the plant owner , still faces charges for the disaster .
The comments come amid outrage by campaigners over convictions by Indian courts , which handed out two - year jail sentences to eight people .
A US official said he hoped the verdicts would bring " closure " .
The leak at the Union Carbide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal is considered the world 's worst industrial accident .
Official figures show at least 3,000 people died at the time and as many as 15,000 have died since .
Campaigners put the death toll as high as 25,000 and say the horrific effects of the gas continue to this day .
The convictions of the eight former plant employees , all Indian , were the first since the accident - with campaigners saying India dragged its heels over the case .
' Absconder '
Amnesty International described the sentences as " too little , too late " .
Image caption Campaigners say they want Mr Anderson to stand trial
The BBC's Soutik Biswas in Delhi says an arrest warrant for Mr Anderson was issued by an Indian Court in 2003 , but it was never acted upon .
Mr Anderson , who lives in New York , was not named in the verdicts after the Indian court described him an " absconder " .
Mr Moily said : " As far as Anderson is concerned , the case is not closed .
" The CBI has filed chargesheet .
The courts then frame charges .
" There is one person here that has not responded to the summons or replied to the charges .
He has absconded and was declared a proclaimed offender , " he told the Press Trust of India news agency .
It is not clear why India has not tried Mr Anderson - the only US citizen accused - in absentia , or sought to extradite him from the US .
' Closure '
Meanwhile , the US state department has refused to comment on Mr Anderson 's possible extradition .
BHOPAL'S DEATH TOLL Image caption Thousands of people were affected by the gas leak in December 1984 Initial deaths ( 3 - 6 December ) : more than 3,000 - official toll
Unofficial initial toll : 7,000 - 8,000
Total deaths to date : over 15,000
Number affected : Nearly 600,000
Compensation : Union Carbide pays $ 470 m in 1989 Source : Indian Supreme Court , Madhya Pradesh government , Indian Council of Medical Research Bhopal voices : ' Justice denied ' ' Travesty ' : Indian papers react
US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Robert Blake said he hoped the sentencing would " bring some closure to the victims and their families " .
" I do n't expect this verdict to reopen any new inquiries or anything like that .
On the contrary , we hope that this is going to bring some closure , " he said .
The eight Indians were convicted of " death by negligence " .
One was convicted posthumously , while the others are expected to appeal .
Satinath Sarangi , an activist campaigning on behalf of Bhopal victims , told the BBC that Mr Anderson and other US executives from Union Carbide should be brought to India to face justice .
" The charges that have been [ laid ] on the Indian accused have essentially been the charges that you would put for a traffic accident .
This is indeed a very sad day for us . "
' Unacceptable '
Amnesty International also called on the Indian and US governments to take legal action against US executives of Union Carbide .
" While the Indian employees have now been tried and convicted , the foreign accused have been able to evade justice simply by remaining abroad , " said Audrey Gaughran , an Amnesty director .
In 1989 , Union Carbide paid $ 470 m ( £ 282 m ) in compensation to the Indian government in an out - of - court settlement .
Dow Chemicals , which bought the company in 1999 , says this settlement resolved all claims against the company .
In a statement released on Monday , the group said that " all the appropriate people from UCIL ( Union Carbide India Limited ) - officers and those who actually ran the plant on a daily basis - have appeared to face charges " .

The most striking feature of the site is the remains of an exceptionally large dwelling that the scientists describe as a " terraced house " , in some ways like those found in many modern suburbs .
The original find was made three years ago while archaeologists were carrying out a field inventory of medieval period remains in the area .
The house now being excavated was built and occupied some 2000 - 3000 years before the start of the present era .
The foundations measure 45 x 20 metres .
" This is very exceptional in many respects .
For a start it is awfully big .
This dwelling has three rooms .
The foundations of each of them are larger than a basic modern cottage , " says dig director Teemu Mökkönen of the University of Helsinki .
In terms of design , the same type of dwellings have also been discovered in North Ostrobothnia and Russian Karelia .
" Then there are the material cultural remains associated here with this really massive house that are unique .
There is no other site like this one , " notes Mökkönen .
The material being found at the dig shows connections to other nearby areas , such as asbestos , a major technical innovation at the time from the inland Saimaa region of Finland , and the remains of ceramics from Estonia .
Students taking part in the excavation have uncovered large amounts of these materials scattered around the house .
A trombe wall is a type of wall designed to act as a solar thermal collector .
The original trombe walls were simply thick walls ( to provide a thermal mass ) fronted with a piece of glass to trap solar radiation .
Modern trombe walls have air vents that help warm air circulate , heating the area behind the wall ( generally the interior of a house ) more effectively .
The first trombe wall was patented in 1881 by Edward Morse ; his first wall was actually just a slab of slate placed in front of an existing window .
They were not put into general use until reintroduced by the French engineer Felix Trombe in 1964 .
Trombe worked with the architect Jacques Michel to build a house heated by passive solar power .
While the design did not take the world by storm , it at least put the idea into the public eye .
The trombe wall is an improvement on the basic design of high thermal mass walls .
Building materials such as cob and adobe have long had the benefit of being good insulators .
The thickness and materials of the walls both keep the sun 's heat from warming the interior of the building too quickly during the day , and hold heat to radiate out when the sun sets .
Today trombe walls may be made with stone , cob , adobe , metal , or water tanks used as a thermal mass .
The air between the glass and the wall can get quite hot ; the most effective way to actively heat your house is to design your wall with air vents at the top and bottom of the inter - glass spaces , allowing heat to flow into your house .
As the air within the space heats , it rises up though the vent at the top , drawing cold air up from the bottom , which is heated in its turn .
This same process could work in reverse during the night ( as even double - paned glass loses heat much more quickly than does a wall ) , so trombe walls are often fitted with one - way flaps on the lower vents , so that the air flow can not go in reverse .
They may also be filled with some form of insulation , reducing the amount of heat lost at night at the expense of daytime heat gain .
Trombe walls are generally placed so that they get lots of sun in the winter , but not too much in the summer .
This means placing them on the south side of the house , with overhanging eaves to block summer sun .
They may also be covered in the summer , or have upper vents that can be opened to the exterior , putting heat back out into the big blue room .
Walls are often painted a dark color to increase the amount of heat produced .
As the green movement gains in popularity , trombe walls are starting to gain some popularity .
They have the advantage of being highly adjustable to a person 's income -- you can fit a trombe system with a thermostat to automatically open and close flaps and shutters , or you can build a simple wall on your own , and adjust it manually .
While they can be a great help in reducing energy bills , many locations do not have enough winter sun to heat a house comfortably without some other heat source .
A SUGGESTED SURVIVAL LIST

In An Emergency , Could You Survive ?
This column was initially released last December .
Without a doubt , this has been one of my most requested columns .
So , in response to the large number of readers who have asked me to re-release this column , I do so today .
And in doing so , I have added some new material to the original column .
One does not have to be a prophet to know that we are on the precipice of some potentially catastrophic -- or at the very least , challenging -- days .
In fact , most of us are already in challenging days , and some are already enduring catastrophic events .
That is , if one would call being out of work , losing one 's home , facing life - threatening medical conditions without any prospect of medical insurance , several families being forced to live in one house due to homes being foreclosed , etc. , catastrophic .
The potential for an escalation of cataclysmic events , however , is very real .
Only a " blooming idiot " would call someone who attempts to prepare for " the day of adversity " a Chicken Little now .
Anyone who does not see the storm clouds on the horizon is n't paying attention .
For example , can one imagine what would happen if terrorists nuked a major American city or cities ?
( Once again , I encourage readers to go get the videos of the CBS TV series " Jericho " to get an idea of how quickly life , and even civilization , could change . )
Imagine if there was another 9/11 - type event .
What would happen if some form of Zimbabwe - style inflation hit the US ?
What would happen if anything disrupted the distribution of Welfare checks , or food to local grocers ?
Imagine a Hurricane Katrina - style natural disaster in your town .
I think people everywhere are beginning to awaken to just how vulnerable we all really are .
As a result , people from virtually every walk of life have recently been asking my thoughts on how they should prepare .
Therefore , I will attempt to share with my readers some of the counsel I have given these folks .
First , a disclaimer .
I am not an economist ; I am not a survival expert ; I am not a firearms expert ; I am not an attorney ; I am not a physician .
In fact , I am not an expert in anything !
For several years , however , I have tried to learn from others .
I am an avid reader .
My work has allowed me to travel extensively .
I have had the privilege of sitting at the feet of -- and learning from -- many of America 's most learned , most trained , and most qualified " experts " in a variety of fields .
What I write today , I have learned from others .
I 've formed my own opinions and priorities , of course , but everything I 'm sharing has been said , or written about , before .
But if I can share something in today 's column that will help someone be better prepared for the days to come , then my goal will have been achieved .
Location :
First , analyze your living conditions .
Where do you live ?
Do you live in an urban or rural environment ?
Is it a big city or small town ?
Do you live in an apartment or condominium ?
How close are your neighbors ?
Do you even know your neighbors ?
Would you trust them if the electricity was off and they were hungry ?
Could you grow your own food , if you had to ?
How easily could you secure your home ?
If you live in a cold weather environment , how long could you stay warm without electricity ?
These are the kinds of questions you need to ask yourself now .
Over the past several decades , masses of people have migrated into large metropolitan areas .
More people live in urban areas than at any time in American history .
While this may be well and good for times of prosperity , it is an absolute nightmare in any kind of disaster .
Does anyone remember what New Orleans looked like after Hurricane Katrina came through ?
Can anyone recall what happened in downtown Los Angeles during the 1992 riots ?
Needless to say , any inner-city environment could become a powder keg almost instantaneously , given the right ( or wrong ) circumstances .
And the bigger the city , the bigger the potential problems .
If you live in the inner city , I suggest you consider moving to a more rural location .
Obviously , now is a very good time to buy property ( especially rural property ) , but the downside is , selling property is not as favorable .
If you can afford it , now is a great time to buy a " safe house " outside the city .
If you are fortunate enough to have family or some true friends nearby , you might want to put your heads -- and some resources -- together in preparation for serious upheaval .
Obviously , a team of prepared people is much better than being alone .
If you must stay in your urban location , have some commonsense plans in hand in the event of a major disaster .
Get to know your neighbors : find out whom you can trust and whom you can't .
Keep some extra gasoline on hand , in case you need to get in your car quickly and leave .
Have several exit routes planned ahead of time , in case roads are blocked .
Have a " bug- out " bag containing essential ingredients to live on for 3 or 4 days .
If leaving is not an option , have a plan to secure your home as best you can .
You 'll need to think about things such as food , water , medicine , warmth , self - defense , etc .
But at this point , to do nothing is absolute lunacy !
Provisions :
During a major disaster , food will quickly disappear .
Living for over 3 decades on the Gulf Coast , I can tell you with absolute certainty that whenever disaster strikes ( usually an approaching hurricane , for us ) , food and provisions at the store sell completely out in a matter of a few hours .
People panic , and within hours , you cannot find food , bottled water , ice , generators , batteries , candles , etc .
In a matter of hours , every gas station in the area will be completely out of gas .
Not days .
Hours !

Furthermore , almost all disasters include a complete loss of electricity .
The water supply is compromised .
Bottled water becomes more valuable than bank accounts .
Dehydration becomes a very real and present danger .
I remember witnessing a man offer an ice vendor $ 100 for an extra bag of ice during Hurricane Ivan .
My wife and I went 2 weeks ( 14 days ) without electricity in the aftermath of that hurricane .
Believe me , I got a taste of just how precious bottled water , ice , batteries , generators , fuel , etc. , can become .
I suggest you have a supply of food and water to last at least 2 weeks .
A month would be even better .
Personally , I can live a long time on tuna fish or peanut butter .
You can purchase MREs from a variety of sources , as well as " camp - style " packaged food from stores such as Academy Sports & Outdoors .
Of course , bottled water is available everywhere during normal times .
Stock up !
Plus , I suggest you have some water purification tablets or a Katadyn water filter on hand .
And , if you are able , prepare to grow your own food .
Canning food is another very helpful hedge against deprivation .
If your parents were like mine , this was standard operating procedure .
Get a generator .
Keep a supply of fuel on hand .
Stay stocked up on batteries , candles , portable lights , first aid supplies , and personal hygiene items -- especially toilet paper .
Trust me , during times of intense and prolonged disaster , toilet paper could become more valuable than money .
I also suggest you never run out of lighters or matches .
You never know when you 'll need to build a fire , and during a prolonged survival situation , fire could save your life .
If you live in a cold weather climate , you probably already have some sort of wood stove or fireplace .
Obviously , you need to take stock of your clothing .
Do you have clothes suitable for extended outdoor activity ?
What about boots ?
During a disaster , you would trade your best suit from Neiman Marcus for a good pair of boots .
Do you have gloves ?
Insulated underwear ?
What about camouflage clothing ?
These could become essential outerwear in the right conditions .
Plus , any " bug - out " bag will need to include spare clothing .
Communication and medical provisions are also a high priority in any kind of emergency .
How will you communicate with your loved ones when the phones ( including cell phones ) go down ?
A preordained rally point ( or safe house ) might be something to think about .
And what about medical supplies ?
Do you have enough to take care of routine ( and not - so - routine ) emergencies ?
What about your prescription drugs ?
How long could you function if you were cut off from your druggist for any length of time ?
Think about it now .
And one more suggestion , while we 're on this subject : the best resources in the world are of little use if one is physically incapable of making good use of them .
In other words , GET IN SHAPE .
During any kind of emergency situation , physical exertion and stamina become immensely important .
Commodities :
I suggest you have at least some cash on hand .
Just about any and all disasters will result in banks being closed for extended periods of time .
That also means credit card purchases being suspended .
You need to have enough cash to be able to purchase essential goods ( if they are even available ) for an undetermined amount of time .
Of course , some survival gurus insist that during any cataclysmic climate , precious metals will become the only reliable currency .
But when most of us are trying to feed our families and pay our bills , it is difficult to get excited about buying gold and silver .
Obviously , I would never recommend that anyone jeopardize the present on the altar of the future .
My parents made it through the Great Depression with canned goods and garden vegetables ; gold and silver were certainly not a priority with them .
On the other hand , a little gold and silver could go a long way in a prolonged emergency -- if you can afford it without jeopardizing present needs .
In fact , in a disaster , what is considered a valuable commodity can change rather quickly , as the barter system takes a life of its own .
What is valuable is determined by what you need and how badly you need it .
In a prolonged disaster , simple things such as toilet paper , canned goods , ammunition , and clothing could become extremely valuable ; while cars , video games , televisions , etc. , could be reduced to junk status .
In antiquity , wars were fought over things such as salt .
Speaking of cars , remember that during a prolonged " national emergency " that might involve some sort of nuclear attack or widespread civil unrest , an Electromagnetic Pulse ( EMP ) might be employed ; in which case , most every late model vehicle would be completely inoperable .
Accordingly , if one can keep an older , pre-computer - age vehicle in good working order , he or she might be driving the only non-government vehicle capable of going anywhere .
Self - Defense :
Needless to say , during any kind of disaster , your safety and protection will be completely up to you .
If you really think that the police are going to be able to protect you during an upheaval , you are living in a dreamworld .

In both the New Orleans and Los Angeles disasters , police protection was non-existent .
Lawless gangs quickly took control of the streets , and people were left to either defend themselves or swiftly become the helpless prey of violent marauders .
In fact , in New Orleans , some of the policemen actually abandoned their oaths to uphold the law and joined with the criminals , turning their weapons upon the public .
Face it , folks : in any kind of disaster , you must be able to defend yourself , or you and your family will be meat for these animals of society that will quickly descend without mercy upon the unprepared , unsuspecting souls around them .
This requires that you be armed !
It also requires that you be skilled enough to be able to efficiently use your arms .
Therefore , I strongly suggest that you purchase firearms sufficient to keep you and your family safe , and also that you practice sufficiently to know how to use them .
Now , when it comes to a discussion of which firearms are preferable for self - defense , the suggestions are as varied as the people who proffer them .
These are my suggestions :
I believe every man ( along with his wife and children of adequate age ) should be proficient with the following weapons : a handgun in .38 caliber or above , a .22 rifle , a center - fire hunting rifle , a semi-automatic battle rifle , and a shotgun .
My personal preference for a self - defense handgun is either a .45 ACP 1911 ( either Colt or Kimber ) or a .40 S&W .
In the .40 caliber , my favorite is a Glock 23 .
In the 1911 , I like the Commander size configuration .
I also like the Glock 21 , 30 , and 36 in .45 caliber .
My wife prefers to carry a Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver in the snub - nose , J - frame configuration .
But this is primarily due to the reduced weight of these weapons for carry purposes .
If needed , she could make a good accounting of herself with a Glock 19 in 9 mm .
If you are someone who has never owned and seldom fired a handgun , I recommend you buy a Glock .
They are as simple as revolvers to operate , reliable , and almost indestructible .
Plus , they provide increased magazine capacity , and are safe .
They are also very easy to disassemble and clean .
Of course , in dangerous game territory , you will need the power of a .45 Long Colt , .44 Magnum , or even a .454 Casull .
These calibers are not for the limp - wristed , but when one is facing a brown bear or mountain lion , it is what one will need to survive .
Plus , when your life is on the line , you 'll never feel the recoil .
For a .22 rifle , I really like the Ruger 10 / 22 .
For a hunting rifle , my suggestion is either a .270 or .30 - 06 caliber bolt - action rifle .
I prefer the Remington Model 700 BDL or Browning X - Bolt , but there are several fine weapons in this configuration and caliber by numerous manufacturers .
In dangerous game territory , a Marlin .45 - 70 could be a lifesaver .
For a battle rifle , I suggest an AR - 15 - style weapon ( I prefer Bushmaster ) in .223 caliber or a .308 Springfield M1A .
For a shotgun , I suggest a 12 - gauge pump .
Here I prefer a Winchester Model 1300 , which is not made anymore .
So , you 'll probably have to choose between Mossberg and Remington .
For ladies , however , a 20 - gauge shotgun is probably a better choice , and at " bad breath " range ( where a shotgun shines , anyway ) , it is just as lethal .
Whatever you choose , practice with it to the point that you are able to use it proficiently .
And be sure you stock up on ammunition .
A gun without ammo is reduced to being either an expensive club or a cumbersome paperweight .
Go to your local independent sporting goods store ( I do n't recommend the large national chain stores to do your firearms shopping ) and get to know your hometown firearms dealer .
Most of these people are kind and helpful folks who will be more than happy to assist you in finding exactly what type of firearm is suitable for you and your family .
If you live in the Pensacola , Florida , area , a visit with Rick Bankston at Buck and Bass on Pine Forest Road is highly recommended .
He is a fine Christian gentleman and very knowledgeable in all things gun .
His phone number is 850-944-5692 .
Give him a call .
Spiritual Power :
I firmly believe that man is created to have fellowship with his Creator - God .
I really do n't know how people can face the uncertain future that we currently face without the spiritual knowledge , wisdom , comfort , and power that is made available through Jesus Christ .
I believe the maxim is true : " Wise men still seek Him . "
I strongly suggest that you seek to possess a personal relationship with God 's only begotten Son .
In truth , spiritual preparation is far and away the most important preparation of all .
Accordingly , be sure to pack a copy of God 's Word in your survival gear .
That we are facing challenging days is a certainty .
Exactly what that means is yet to be determined .
I trust that some of my suggestions will help you be better prepared for what lies before us .
Plus , here is an excellent online Survival Blog chock - full of great suggestions and resources for all things survival .

Chippers and pep-peps around the globe have cause to mourn today : Tim And Eric Awesome Show , Great Job regular Richard Dunn died this morning , according to tweets from the show 's creators .
A major presence on the Cartoon Network series since the first season , Dunn played everything from a doddering old dad to the host of a Goth cable - access show .
Part of his appeal came from the sense that he was , unlike some of the other regulars , really in on some of the jokes .
A quick look at his website reveals that Dunn actually had bit parts in a bunch of movies , too , including The Wedding Singer and The 40 - Year - Old Virgin — and he had a millisecond cameo on Parks And Recreation last year as the " 110 - year - old man . "
Below , you 'll find him hosting Dunngeon .
The United States will contribute $ 400 million in development aid to the Palestinian territories and work with Israel to loosen its embargo on Gaza , President Barack Obama said Wednesday .
Obama 's announcement came after White House talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
The money will be used to build housing , schools , water and health care systems in both the Palestinian Authority - controlled West Bank and Gaza , which is ruled by the Palestinian Islamic movement Hamas .
Obama called the situation in Gaza " unsustainable , " and said the United States would work with its European allies , Egypt and Israel to find a " new conceptual framework " for the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
" We agree Israelis have right to prevent arms from coming into Gaza , " Obama said .
But he said " new mechanisms " were needed to allow more goods to reach the territory - and he repeated that the long - term solution was a permanent deal creating " a Palestinian state side - by - side with an Israel that is secure . "
“ The one thing about this method that we ’re about to go into — it will and should measure the majority of the flow , ” he said .
Mr. Dudley said that the original estimates by the government and BP officials of 5,000 barrels a day were based on satellite pictures and that the current estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels was “ issued without an actual flow measurement . ”
If the leak is not contained or slowed and continues at the higher estimated flow rate of 19,000 barrels a day until Aug. 20 — four months after the accident — it could amount to close to 2.3 million barrels spilled into the gulf .
After more than a month of diagnostic tests and the pumping of tens of thousands of barrels of drilling fluids — and everything from golf balls to shards of rubber — into the broken blowout preventer , engineers are still debating about what they think may be the inner contours of the five - story stack of pipes and how to best contain its leaking gashes .
In the end , all the mysteries of what went wrong and caused one of the greatest environmental calamities of history may not be known until the well is finally killed and the ill - fated blowout preventer is brought up from the bottom of the sea .
The final plugging of the well will have to wait until August , when the two relief wells are scheduled be completed .
Those wells are being drilled diagonally to intersect with the runaway well and inject it with heavy liquids and cement .
Work could be slowed by storms in what is expected to be an active summer hurricane season .
Officials from BP and the administration announced on Saturday that the top kill was a failure and had been abandoned , and that engineers were once again trying to solve the problem with a containment cap .
A similar operation was tried nearly four weeks ago , but it failed because a slush of icy water and gas , known as hydrates , filled the large containment device , blocking the escaping oil from entering it .
This time , engineers will pump hot sea water around the new , smaller device to keep hydrates from forming , and there will be far less space between the cap and the well for any hydrates that do form to flow in .
BP officials expressed optimism on Sunday about the new operation , though one technician working on the project warned that there were concerns that hydrates could again stymie the containment effort .
The technician and outside experts also warned that by cutting the riser , the engineers may increase the flow of escaping oil .
Hi , how are you this morning ?
I ’m still trying to come to grips with the fact that my city was turned into a war zone over the weekend …
I suspect that people all over Canada have seen the iconic image of that burning police cruiser on their nightly newscast .
Here ’s some video you may not have seen …
On Friday morning this outspoken young man questioned the legality of a mandatory bag search before he being allowed to enter a public park .
As I wrote on Friday an emergency law was passed here giving police the power to do this — but only near the security perimeter of the G - 20 summit .
I ’m not entirely sure what the law states as I ’m still waiting for it to be officially published .
This video has generated a lot of discussion amongst my Facebook friends .
What do you make of it ?
I ’ve included this video for two reasons : ( 1 ) to show the vicious behaviour of these plainclothed police officers , particularly the one in the poster frame , and ( 2 ) because at around 46 seconds ( there ’s a pause in the video ) you can see a black bloc protester slip safely behind the police line .
Was this person working undercover to observe and report , or were they planted to incite violence and justify a response in kind from the police ?
That second thing has happened in this country before …
G20 – Cops Charge Protesters at Queen and Spadina , After “ O Canada ” from Torontoist on Vimeo .
I admit to having next to no context for this one , I just find it disturbing and sad that police would attack what seems like a peaceful crowd the moment they finish our national anthem .
This also happened a few blocks from where I live .
I do n’t know what else to say really , except that I ’ll never look at a police officer in this city the same way again …

Following a gruelling campaign and a massive public outcry , the West Australian Government has called off the planned aerial killing of wild horses at Lake Gregory in the Kimberleys .
As oil continues to gush from a BP wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico , critics say the company has quietly broken ground on a controversial project in B.C. 's Rocky Mountains .
Opponents of the Mist Mountain project say they were surprised to find that BP Canada , an arm of the BP group of companies , began construction earlier this month on an exploratory well for its coalbed methane project near Fernie , B.C .
The company was granted permission to conduct the experimental drilling in the pristine area in southeast B.C. just a few days after the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill .
And the disaster unfolding in the gulf since then has renewed concerns about the BP subsidiary 's plans in the Rockies .
" This is just a reaffirmation of what we 've always known and what everyone has known about BP is that they 've had the worst environmental record of all oil companies in the world , even before the Gulf disaster , " said Ryland Nelson , of the group Wildsight , which opposes the project .
But Hejdi Feick , the director of communications for BP Canada , said British Columbians can be reassured that the company is a good corporate citizen .
" We are absolutely committed to doing this right , " she said Tuesday .
" We have been very open and accessible over the last three years . "
That is little comfort for Nelson , who said BP had promised to consult with the public every step of the way yet he only learned construction was underway when he went to the site Monday .
Nelson said the contractor on site told him they hope to bring in drilling equipment by the end of the month and start drilling this summer .
" Here they are , they 've been working for nearly two weeks and nobody knew anything about it , " he said .
The provincial government awarded tenure to BP Canada for the Mist Mountain project last December , over the objections of conservationists and First Nations on both sides of the border , as well as the Fernie town council .
Those critics say there is not enough environmental oversight for the project , which they believe will impact water and wildlife in the Rocky Mountain ecosystem .
The coalbed methane extraction includes reinjecting polluted water back into the ground , a process conservationists worry will contaminate ground water .
Feick said the company has been forthcoming with all information , including that it planned to start test drilling this summer .
" This is certainly not news to the folks there , " she said .
" We 've already gone as far as inviting some of the key groups to come and tour the site when we are drilling so they can have a sense of what that entails and what it means , what it looks like , that sort of thing . "
Critics including Ryland say because BP 's application was for a single well , the company avoided a thorough B.C. Environmental Assessment review , but Feick said the company has done three years of environmental studies and all the reports are available on the company website .
Graham Currie , a spokesman for the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission , said the commission did an extensive review of the project and concluded that direct impacts to wildlife habitat , environment and the forest land base would be minimal .
Currie said the review is a rigorous environmental assessment , but he could n't say how it compared to the B.C. Environmental Review process .
He said there was no thought of reviewing BP 's application , given the actions of its parent company surrounding the Gulf of Mexico disaster .
" No .
We have made an extensive review here , we have granted a well authorization , " he said .
" We are satisfied with our process . "
Ryland said the project threatens one of the most important wildlife corridors in North America .
The well will be drilled in the area between Banff National Park and Waterton - Glacier International Peace Park , which stretches between Alberta and Montana , a corridor for grizzlies , wolverines and other mountain - dwelling wildlife .
" This special place needs special consideration when considering major developments like this , " he said .
Windows / Mac / Linux : Mozilla today released the first beta build of Firefox 4 , complete with a new look , new features , and support for more HTML5 specs .
Here 's a quick screenshot tour of how it 's shaping up :
The big changes come in the form of an interface overhaul and some updated support for HTML5 features .
In this release the new - and - improved Firefox skin is only complete for the Windows release , so Mac and Linux users , you 'll have to wait a bit .
The highlights from the release notes with images ( our notes in italics ) :
Advertisement
On Windows Vista and Windows 7 the menu bar has been replaced with the Firefox button
Advertisement
You can search for and switch to already open tabs
The stop and reload buttons have been merged into a single button on Windows , Mac and Linux .
Handy , since many of us have been consolidating those buttons since Firefox 3
The Bookmarks Toolbar has been replaced with a Bookmarks Button by default ( you can switch it back if you 'd like ) .

Crash protection for Windows , Linux , and Mac when there is a crash in the Adobe Flash , Apple Quicktime or Microsoft Silverlight plug-ins .
Native support for the HD HTML5 WebM
More responsive page rendering using lazy frame construction
That covers pretty much everything that stands out in Firefox 4 so far , though a couple of feature tweaks that are n't specifically highlighted in the release notes that we particularly like include :
The new add - ons manager , which loads in a tab of its own instead of a separate window .

LONDON : A USB coffee cup warmer could be a potential thief and steal personal data from your computer , say engineers .
A glitch in how the Universal Serial Bus ( USB ) works , could make many of the devices attached to your computer , like mouse , keyboard and even the printer , vulnerable to what is called the " hardware trojan " .
Until now , hardware trojans were considered to be modified circuits .
For example , if hackers manage to get hold of a microchip when it is still in the factory , they could introduce subtle changes allowing them to crash the device that the chip gets built into .
Computer engineers John Clark , Sylvain Leblanc and Scott Knight at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston , Ontario , wondered if a hardware trojan attack could be carried out by other means .
They calculated that the easiest way to introduce a hardware trojan might be via a computer 's USB ports .
The trio found they could exploit a weakness in USB 's plug - and - play functionality .
The USB protocol trusts any device being plugged in to report its identity correctly .
But , for example , if one finds out the make and model of a target user 's keyboard , and swap it with a compromised device that reports the same information - even if it is not a keyboard , the computer wo n't realise .
The team designed a USB keyboard containing a circuit that successfully stole data from the hard drive and transmitted it in two ways -- by flashing an LED , Morse - code style , and by encoding data as a subtle warbling output from the sound card .
They could have chosen more efficient methods to transmit the data , such as email , but Leblanc said that their main goal was to see if they could steal data without anyone noticing .
" We 've shown any USB device could contain a hardware trojan , " New Scientist quoted him as saying .
Security software , if it checks USB devices at all , tends to look only for malware on USB memory sticks .
" This work opens many cans of worms .
A USB device cannot now be trusted - it may have hidden processing capabilities , " said Vasilios Katos , a computer scientist at the Democritus University of Thrace in Greece .
Leblanc agreed with him , saying : " You could mount a hardware trojan attack with a USB coffee - cup warmer .
" The study has been published in Future Generation Computer Systems .
Home Depot had a skid of Cedar 2×4s that I ’m pretty sure were mis-labeled for around $ 2.50 a piece , so I bought 10 of them with no real purpose .
While grilling out this weekend , I noticed I needed a table to sit dishes and grilling utensils on .
This is what happened next :)
I made the plan for this myself , based on how much wood I had on hand .
It ’s roughly 34 ” tall to match the height of my grill surface for easy food transfer on / off , and the table surface is roughly 32 × 22 ” .
Construction is of cedar 2 ×4s for the legs and tops and cedar 1 ×4s for the aprons .
End boards are notched in to the legs for aesthetics only - everything else is pocket hole construction from the bottom so there are no visible screws or nails .
It ’s probably WAY overbuilt with 2 ×4s used for the table surfaces , but I had them on hand and I wanted the table to have plenty of weight - there are no trees near my house on top of a hill and it gets very windy in the back yard .
Cedar is a very light wood , so using the 2×4s really helped in the “ do n’t blow away ” department .
Some may notice that there is no overhang on the ends of the table - I did that so I could a ) add hook boards for grilling tools later and b ) build another to get more counter space if needed in the future and butt them up .

A couple of days ago , I gave a talk at Boston Haskell about a shiny new speculative evaluation library , speculation on hackage , that I have implemented in Haskell .
The implementation is based on the material presented as " Safe Programmable Speculative Parallelism " by Prakash Prabhu , G Ramalingam , and Kapil Vaswani at last month 's PLDI .
I 've uploaded a copy of my slides here :
* Introducing Speculation [ PowerPoint | PDF ]
This package provides speculative function application and speculative folds .
Speculative STM transactions take the place of the transactional rollback machinery from the paper , but transactions are not always required in pure code .
To get a feel for the shape of the library , here is an excerpt from the documentation for one of the combinators :
spec :: Eq a => a -> ( a -> b ) -> a -> b
spec g f a evaluates f g while forcing a , if g == a then f g is returned , otherwise f a is evaluated and returned .
Furthermore , if the argument has already been evaluated , we skip the f g computation entirely .
If a good guess at the value of a is available , this is one way to induce parallelism in an otherwise sequential task .
However , if the guess is n't available more cheaply than the actual answer , then this saves no work and if the guess is wrong , you risk evaluating the function twice .
Under high load , since f g is computed via the spark queue , the speculation will be skipped and you will obtain the same answer as f $! a .
ASCII art time - lines of how this can speed up evaluation are available in both the slides and the documentation linked to above , but assuming an otherwise serial problem , you effectively wager otherwise idle CPU time and the time to generate your guess on the quality of your guess .
Note that numSparks # feature request that was mentioned in the slides has already been implemented in GHC HEAD , and support shall be added to improve the performance of the speculative STM transactions under high load as mentioned in the slides .
We 've been wondering how a keyboard would look in the Rock Band universe : a row of colored buttons would make it hardly different than the guitar peripheral , while a real keyboard would ... be just as hard to play as a real keyboard .
Well , it looks like someone smarter than us has tackled the problem , implementing a Hannah Montana - style " Best of Both Worlds " solution .
The keyboard spans two octaves of for - serious white and blacks , but there 's a row of colored labels above those keys .
How narrowly you 're required to hit the " real " key corresponding to the note in the song is based on what difficulty level you choose -- on the easier levels you just have to smash into the correctly colored neighborhood .
Oh , and for those hoping to play this keytar - style ?
the keyboard is designed to work on a lap or strapped over a shoulder .
Check out the video below the fold to see it in action .
Minority Whip Cantor Bets Against U.S. Bonds
Created : June 18 , 2010 12:40 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
A great catch from The Wall Street Journal :
[ Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) ] , the Republican whip in the House of Representatives , bought up to $ 15,000 in shares of ProShares Trust Ultrashort 20 +
Year Treasury ETF last December , according to his 2009 financial disclosure statement .
The exchange - traded fund takes a short position in long - dated government bonds .
In effect , it is a bet against U.S. government bonds — and perhaps on inflation in the future .
Nice !
Here ’s a more thorough description of the bond product , from Reuters .
ProShares UltraShort 20 + Year Treasury ( the Fund ) , formerly ProShares UltraShort Lehman 20 +
Year Treasury , seeks daily investment results that correspond to twice ( 200 % ) the inverse ( opposite ) of the daily performance of the Barclays Capital 20 +
Year U.S. Treasury Bond Index ( the Index ) .
The Index includes all publicly issued , the United States Treasury securities that have a remaining maturity greater than 20 years , are non-convertible , are denominated in United States dollars , are rated investment grade ( at least Baa3 by Moody ’s Investors Service or BBB - by Standard & Poor ’s ( S&P ) ) , are fixed rate , and have more than $ 250 million par outstanding .
The Index is weighted by the relative market value of all securities meeting the Index criteria .
The Fund takes positions in securities and / or financial instruments that , in combination , should have similar daily return characteristics as – 200 % of the daily return of the Index .
The Fund ’s investment advisor is ProShare Advisors LLC .
But it appears that Cantor is not a very canny investor .
The fund is down 31 percent this year .
OAKLAND , CA — Raiders owner Al Davis enthusiastically praised free agent quarterback JaMarcus Russell at a press conference Thursday , calling the first overall pick in the 2007 draft an exciting playmaker and a perfect fit for the team 's offense .
" Obviously JaMarcus Russell has had some troubles on and off the field , but I 've seen nothing that indicates he could n't find a home with the Raiders and reinvigorate his career , " Davis said .
" We 'd be extremely fortunate to acquire a quarterback like Russell , a player who can beat you with his arm or his feet , to help us overcome our recent disappointments at that position . "
Davis told reporters that the Raiders were currently negotiating a deal with Russell that included more than $ 22 million in guaranteed bail money .

Michelle Obama today used her first visit to the Gulf coast devastated by the BP oil spill to urge Americans to support the local economy by spending their summer holidays there .
However , after extolling the " thousands of miles of beautiful beaches " untouched by the spill and urging people to " do a few things [ to ] help this community " , America 's first lady headed back to Washington to prepare for a family holiday to a national park in Maine at the weekend .
Conservative blogs , were quick to attack the Obamas for a " do as I say , not as I do " attitude , pointing out that the first family will have taken three holidays since the oil spill began in April , none of them in the Gulf region .
The first saw them visit Asheville , North Carolina , as the Deepwater Horizon rig was sinking into the Gulf of Mexico .
In May , Barack Obama was criticised for taking his family on a private trip to his hometown , Chicago , over the Memorial Day weekend instead of honouring fallen soldiers in a traditional service at Arlington National Cemetery , in Washington .
Michelle Obama urged support for the Gulf coast in a speech at the Panama City Beach welcome centre .
Hoteliers along the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida have seen bookings plummet since the oil spill crisis began .
As a writer and photographer covering the oil spill in the Gulf , I 've been frustrated by the well - documented efforts by BP and the U.S. Government to limit media access to the damage .
The restrictions tightened last week , when the Coast Guard announced rules that prevent the public -- including news photographers and reporters -- from coming within 20 meters ( about 65 feet ) of any response vessels or booms on the water or beaches .
Violate the " safety zone " rule and you can be slapped with a $ 40,000 fine and prosecuted under a Class D felony .
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen defended the buffer , saying it is " not unusual " to enact measures for " marine events " or " fireworks demonstrations . "
Allen spokesperson Megan Molney wrote in a July 4 email : " These 20 - meter zones are only slightly longer than the distance from a baseball pitcher 's mound to home plate .
This distance is insignificant when gathering images . "
Perhaps Molney has never shot video or taken a photograph .
But those of us working here know that the real impact -- and , one fears , the real goal -- of the so - called safety zone is to make it difficult to document the impact of the spill on the land and the wildlife .

Lawmakers to BP : Put up $ 20 billion
The cost of cleaning up the oil spill in the Gulf balloons each day , so Senate Democrats want BP to sock away $ 20 billion for safe keeping .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- BP : Kick up $ 20 billion to pay for the recent oil spill in the Gulf region .
And make it snappy .
That 's the message Senate majority leader Harry Reid and members of the Senate Democratic Caucus sent to BP CEO Tony Hayward in a letter on Monday .
" Establishment of this account would serve as an act of good faith and as a first step towards ensuring that there will be no delay in payments or attempt to evade responsibility for damages , " the letter said .
But it maybe hard for BP to comply :
The London - based company only had about $ 7 billion in cash as of March 31 , according to its most recent financial statement .
London - based BP ( BP ) , which held a board meeting on Monday , is weighing whether to issue its $ 2.4 billion second quarter dividend , which is set to be paid out in August .
BP said on Friday it has not made any decision regarding the payment and that the matter " will be decided sometime between now and July 27 . "
( See correction , below . )
A spokesman for Reid said that the proposal has not yet specified whether the $ 20 billion would be requested as a lump sum or by installment payments .
Regardless , the senators want to ensure another Exxon situation is n't forthcoming .
Their letter pointed out how Exxon failed to live up to its initial promises to make reparations .
" After the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled more than 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound , damages totaled more than $ 7 billion ; although Exxon continued making massive profits after the accident , it fought liability at every step and ultimately paid far less than the billions of dollars worth of damages it had caused many , many years later . "
The special account would be managed by an independent third party , according to the letter , and would pay for clean up costs and lost compensation to individuals and businesses affected by the oil spill .
BP has taken some heat for spending millions of dollars on television ads to tout their commitment to the clean - up efforts in an effort to restore their bruised and battered public image .
The senators said that putting cash up would be a good start to restoring the company 's face .
" Although creating this account at this level in no way limits BP 's liability , we believe it will do more to improve BP 's public image than the costly public relations campaign your company has launched . "
All Democratic senators signed the letter with four exceptions : Mary Landrieu , D - La. ; Kent Conrad , D - N.D. ; Robert Byrd , D - W.V. ; and Jeff Bingaman , D - N.M. Notably , Jeff Bingaman is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources .
And Mary Landrieu is the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the senator from the state most affected by the oil spill .
Senator Landrieu agrees that BP should put money into an escrow account , but she thinks Congress needs to think very carefully about what amount is appropriate for the Gulf and for BP .
" An escrow account should be established , but it must be done in a way that ensures BP remains viable enough to pay every penny of what they owe to those who have been affected by this horrific spill and tragedy , " Landrieu said in a prepared statement .
" The worst - case scenario is BP declaring bankruptcy before our citizens are compensated for the tremendous damage the company has inflicted on our fragile coast and economy . "
As the Senate Democrats send a letter off to BP , Obama is making his fourth visit to the Gulf region since the April disaster .
On Tuesday , he 'll return to Washington , D.C. , to deliver an 8 p.m. ET televised address on the oil spill .
The senators have requested a response from BP by Friday .

Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated which quarterly dividend is in question .
( Back to story . )
By the end of next year , the Transportation Security Administration hopes to have nearly 1,000 full - body scanners to screen passengers at airports across the country .
Two are already operational at Los Angeles International Airport .
But a group of doctors and professors from UC San Francisco are raising new concerns about the safety of the technology in one type of full - body scanner built by Torrance - based Rapiscan Inc .
To reveal weapons hidden under a traveler ’s clothes , the scanner relies on “ backscatter technology , ” which uses the ricochets from low - level X - rays to create what looks like a nude image of the person .
Health concerns have been raised in the past by activists and bloggers .
In contrast , the latest safety questions are being raised by professors of biochemistry and biophysics and experts in imaging , cancer and crystals .

The experts , including John Sedat , David Agard , Dr. Marc Shuman and Robert Stroud , wrote to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy .
They said they fear that the scanners may expose the skin to high doses of X - rays that could increase the risk of cancer and other health problems , particularly among older travelers , pregnant women and people with weak immune systems .
They asked that the White House assemble an independent panel to look into the concerns .
But officials at the Department of Homeland Security say there is no need to worry .
Dr. Alexander Garza , the assistant secretary for health affairs and chief medical officer for the department , said he travels often with his wife and three boys and has no fear about putting his family through the airport scanners .

“ The risk is so low it ’s almost negligible , ” he said .
Plus , he said , passengers can forgo the scanner and instead undergo a full - body pat - down search .
Southwest Airlines rejects PETA ad
If you ’re feeling self - conscious about TSA officials seeing your body in the scanner , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals suggests you go vegan .

PETA submitted an ad last month for Southwest Airlines ’ in - flight magazine that shows a woman ’s torso , clad only in skimpy underwear , emblazoned with the words “ Be proud of your body scan : Go vegan . ”
The point , according to a PETA spokesman , is that vegans who forgo meat and other animal products often have a better physique and wo n’t be embarrassed to go through a full - body scanner at the airport .
Southwest Airlines rejected the ad .
“ It was not about the content , ” said Southwest spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger .
“ It ’s about the image .
It ’s not a good fit for our publication . ”

PETA Senior Vice President Dan Mathews suggested another explanation : “ The airline may have canned it because the company is based in Dallas , the heart of the beef belt . ”
Hotel reservations canceled over Gulf oil spill
It ’s no surprise that tourists planning to frolic on the beaches along parts of the Gulf of Mexico might consider canceling travel plans there because of the expanding oil spill .
But even business travelers , with plans to hold meetings and conferences along the gulf , are abandoning the region .

In a survey of hotels throughout the Gulf Coast taken last week , 42 % of hotels said they had seen groups cancel reservations because of the oil spill , up from 35 % from two weeks earlier , according to the Knowland Group , a Virginia sales and marketing firm that conducted the survey .
And 56 % of hoteliers are blaming the media , which they say has exaggerated the impact of the spill , according to the survey .
“ The media is making it out to be worse than what it really is , ” a Panama City , Fla. , hotel representative said in the survey .
But there has been a silver lining , at least for the hotels .
In the same survey , the hotels said they have seen an increase in last - minute bookings related to the spill , including new guests from the petroleum industry , environmental groups and the media .

What you see below is just the latest posting of Ruben Bolling ’s excellent work , although this comic was actually written in 2007 .
It was great then , and with Toy Story 3 dominating box offices right now , it ’s become exceedingly relevant again .

JONESTOWN , Guyana — Carlton Daniels was sweating as he sliced through the jungle with his cutlass .
He pointed at some bushes and said a chimpanzee named Mr. Muggs had once lived there in a cage .
Then he emerged in a clearing , proclaiming , “ Welcome to the People ’s Temple Agricultural Project . ”
Better known as Jonestown , where more than 900 Americans committed suicide or were murdered one night in 1978 at the behest of the cult leader Jim Jones , the site yields few signs of remembrance .
Rains , termites and scavengers have laid waste to its buildings .
Vines camouflage its rusting vehicles , including an old flatbed truck and a tractor .
But while nature seems intent on erasing the utopian experiment that went tragically awry here , some enterprising souls in Guyana , South America ’s only English - speaking nation , have another idea .
They want Jonestown reborn as a tourist destination and are even getting some tepid help from the government , which spent more than 30 years largely trying to live it down .
Indranauth Haralsingh , director of the Guyana Tourism Authority , came here late last year to put up a plaque saying , “ In memory of the victims of the Jonestown tragedy , November 18 , 1978 , Jonestown , Guyana . ”
President Obama just formally announced that energy giant BP will finance a $ 20 billion fund to compensate people whose livelihoods have been damaged by the devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Obama also said BP has voluntarily agreed to set aside $ 100 million to help oil workers who have been displaced since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 and killed 11 people .
Kenneth Feinberg , a lawyer currently overseeing executive pay issues for the White House , will be in charge of the compensation fund .
A three - person panel will mediate any disputes .
Feinberg also oversaw payments to 9/11 victims for the federal government .
" This is about accountability and at the end of the day that 's what every American wants and expects , " Obama said in the State Dining Room .
Obama said BP is committed to ensuring that economic claims will be processed and paid out in a timely manner .
According to a White House fact sheet , BP will contribute $ 5 billion a year for four years into an escrow account .
BP is providing assurance that their financial obligations will be met by setting aside $ 20 billion in U.S. assets .
After Obama 's announcement , BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg apologized to the American people .
He said the company 's board has decided to stop paying out dividends this year .
" I do thank you for your patience that you have in this difficult time , " said Svanberg , talking to reporters gathered outside the White House .
" Through our actions and our commitment we hope over the long term that we will regain the trust you have in us . "
Svanberg also said : " Words are not enough .
We will be judged by our actions . "
The compensation fund and money for oil workers were announced after a White House meeting between administration officials and BP executives , including Svanberg and CEO Tony Hayward .
The " constructive " meeting , as Obama described it , ran longer than the White House expected and pushed back Obama 's remarks by more than two hours .
" Today was a good start , " Obama said .
" This should provide some assurance to small business owners that BP is going to meet its responsibilities . "
Obama said he spoke privately with Svanberg about keeping the people of the Gulf in mind as the company continues to deal with fallout from the spill .
" I emphasized to him that for the families I met with down in the Gulf ... this is not just about dollars and cents .
A lot of these folks do n't have a cushion . "
During his Oval Office address last night , Obama vowed to hold BP accountable for what he described as their " recklessness " in the Gulf .
" We will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long as it takes , " Obama said last night .
A panel of federal scientists now estimates the oil spill is leaking between 1.47 million gallons and 2.52 million gallons a day .

LUXEMBOURG VILLE , LUXEMBOURG —
In an effort to quiet criticism of U.S. military policy , 50,000 U.S. troops invaded and soundly defeated the non-oil - rich Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Monday .
" Once again , the U.S. claims victory over a rogue nation , " said President Bush after the 45 - minute war .
" The people of Luxembourg , although prosperous and living in peace , have suffered under the tyranny of a monarchy for centuries .
And allow me to point out that Luxembourg has not one drop of crude oil . "
Troops will return home Friday , following the public hanging of Grand Duke Henri de Luxembourg .

== == " In 1994 , Bill C - 212 was introduced to officially declare hockey as Canada 's national sport .
Opposition came from supporters of lacrosse who wanted to recognize the traditional and cultural significance of this sport .
Consequently , Bill C - 212 was amended to recognize both sports .
Thus , on May 12 , 1994 , Canada 's National Sport Act ( Bill C - 212 ) became law , reading : " To recognize hockey as Canada 's National Winter Sport and lacrosse as Canada 's National Summer Sport " .
While hockey 's popularity is unquestionable - especially in Canada , lacrosse is still enjoyed by Canadians and has gained popularity in the United States , England , Ireland , and Scotland . "

Were you recently notified by your ISP or blogging platform that you have been sued for copyright infringement for your online activity ?
Were you informed that your ISP would be providing your identity to the lawyers for the person or entity that has sued you shortly ( usually within 30 days ) unless you took action to stop this from happening by filing a motion to quash or to dismiss the case ?
If so , this page is to help you find counsel to assist you in sorting out your options .
Attorneys who are interested in joining this list should contact info@eff.org with the subject line " Subpoena Defense Attorney Addition . "
Please note that we do not screen or evaluate the attorneys on the Subpoena Defense Resources list .
Each person contacting a lawyer from the list should make their own independent evaluation of whether the referred attorney is the right one for the particular case .
In most states you can check with the State Bar website for the current status and record of lawyers in that state , but you should make your own judgment about which attorney is right for you .
What ’s going on ?
A series of lawsuits have been filed across the U.S. against thousands of individuals accused of having illegally uploaded and downloaded movies in violation of copyright law .
Some of these are independent films such as “ The Dallas Buyers Club ” and some are for pornographic films .
The plaintiffs in the lawsuits have obtained IP addresses they allege are associated with infringement , and have received permission from the court to issue subpoenas to Internet Service Providers ( " ISPs " ) to obtain the name and address of subscribers associated with those IP addresses .
What Should I Do ?
If you are a target , you probably have questions about how to proceed and may wish to seek legal counsel .
Because individual cases are unique , EFF recommends that defendants contact an attorney who practices regularly in either the state where the lawsuit was filed or their home state for a consultation .
Because so many people need legal help , and usually on a very short time frame , the following attorneys have offered to assist those targeted to understand their options .
Some of the attorneys listed on this page may be able to represent you in states other than the ones they are listed under .
Fees are negotiable on a case by case basis .
These attorneys may , if necessary , file a motion to quash or otherwise intervene on behalf of subpoena targets who retain them as counsel .
The attorneys on this list are not affiliated with the Electronic Frontier Foundation in any way and by offering their names EFF does not intend to give any individual endorsement of them .
If you wish to move to quash or dismiss , you ( or your attorney ) must file a motion with the court .
Also be aware that contacting the court or the plaintiff 's counsel yourself risks publicly exposing your identity , which would make the subpoena moot .
Lastly , your ISP will not file for you , and simply sending a copy to your ISP is not enough to protect your identity .
If possible , it is usually best to retain counsel to assist .

Let me see if I have this straight : in the last few days members of the GOP have savagely screwed the unemployed , protected the bankstas , trashed Thurgood Marshall , implied rape and incest is part of God 's plan , defended BP , threatened to either end social security or screw over 20 million plus people who have paid into the system for at least 20 years by making them wait until age 70 to see their benefits , and screwed homeless veterans with children .
That about it , or is there more ?
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Andy Gallacher explains BP 's new plan
BP has delayed a key test on a newly installed well cap aimed at stopping the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
BP and US Coast Guard officials said further analysis was needed before pressure testing could begin .
If it proves successful , the well will be kept " shut in " and the leak halted until relief wells plug it entirely .
The blown - out well has been spewing oil into Gulf waters since April .
The US administration has sent BP and other parties a new bill for the clean - up .
The administration says the latest bill is for $ 99.7 m ( £ 65.8 m ) .
The oil giant has already fully paid the last three bills totalling $ 122.2 m ( £ 80.6 m ) for costs related to response and clean - up of the spill , according to the Obama administration .
' No promises '
The test in the Gulf of Mexico , which was supposed to begin on Tuesday , will determine whether BP 's new cap can contain the oil .
Coast Guard chief Admiral Thad Allen said the extra analysis would continue into Wednesday .
This latest move to stop the oil comes a day after the containment cap was placed on the leaking well .
The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions BP statement
Work on the permanent relief well solution continues .
BP Vice - President Kent Wells said no promises could be made about whether the new cap would work .
" It 's not simple stuff .
What we do n't want to do is speculate around it , " he said .
Shutting in the well would provide a temporary solution to the leaking oil .
BP is continuing work on the relief well that is expected permanently to stop the oil .
If the test goes as planned , it will mark the first time since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April that the leaking oil has been stopped .
During the tests , BP will be monitoring the pressure of the oil in the well .
High pressure will mean the oil has been contained inside the wellhead .
But if the tests showed there was low pressure , Mr Wells said , this might indicate that oil was leaking elsewhere in the well .
He added that if pressure was low the cap would not be kept shut and ships on the surface of the Gulf would continue collecting oil .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL
In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface .
However , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL
When engineers removed the LMRP cap on 10 July , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more .
However , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer ( BOP ) .
This allowed them to conduct a series of tests to see if the flow of oil could be stopped using the newly installed equipment .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL During the test the three ram capping stack has been closed and all sub - sea containment systems collecting the oil temporarily suspended , effectively blocking the flow of oil from the well .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL
Once the tests have been successfully completed , BP will resume collecting oil .
The Helix Producer ship was recently connected to the BOP to provide another collection route in addition to the Q4000 rig .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
The testing will involve closing three separate valves that tightly fit together , stopping the oil from entering the Gulf .
BP expects no oil will be released from the well during the test process , but the company remains cautious .
" The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions , and its efficiency and ability to contain the oil and gas cannot be assured , " it said in a statement .
If the cap is unable to take the pressure , a pipe will be connected to the cap to take oil to the ships .
Intercepting the leak
Whatever happens , the well will still need to be plugged , which BP says may not happen until mid-August .
The first of two relief wells has another 30 ft ( 9 m ) to drill before intercepting the leaking well , Mr Wells said .
He expects BP to complete the drilling by late July .
BP will then attempt to plug the blown - out well with mud and cement .
By Monday , between 89 m gallons ( 337 m litres ) and 176 m gallons of oil had leaked into the Gulf , according to government estimates .
US President Barack Obama has labelled the oil spill the country 's worst - ever environmental disaster .
BP says it has spent $ 3.5 bn ( £ 2.3 bn ) on the response effort so far .
The HTC Desire will be getting Android 2.2 in Q3 this year , along with the HTC Wildfire and HTC legend .
Hot on the heels of the news that the Nexus One will be getting an over - the - air firmware upgrade this week , mobiles blog Recombu spoke to HTC about the next generation of the mobile OS coming to its handsets .
" We are working hard with our partners to update the HTC Sense experience on Froyo and distribute it to our customers as fast as possible , " said the spokesman .
" We expect to release updates for several of our 2010 models including Desire , Legend and Wildfire beginning in Q3 . "
Competitive Android
HTC 's Android phones have become major players , with the Desire in particular proving to be a key competitor to the Apple iPhone .
With the iPhone 4 now arriving and Apple 's iOS4 bringing new functionality to many of its phones , Android 2.2 and its extended functionality are increasingly necessary .
" [ Android 2.2 ] provides some great new features including support for making your handset a portable hotspot and support for Adobe Flash within the browser , " explains Google .

KANSAS CITY , Mo. — The Show Me state is headed for a showdown over a move to rein in the adult - entertainment industry at a time when every job counts — even those of strippers .
Last month , the Republican - controlled legislature passed one of the nation 's toughest state laws aimed at strip clubs and other adult - entertainment venues .
It would ban nude dancing and the serving of alcohol in adult cabarets , force strip clubs to close at midnight and forbid seminude dancers to touch patrons .

Shoulda has long been one of our most useful and popular open source projects , and it continues to serve us well as we use it daily .
However , there have been some changes over the past year in the way that we use Shoulda , and these changes have led to some decisions about its future .
In our post about the Rails 3 roadmap , we briefly covered the changes we made in Shoulda 2.11 as well as our intentions for Shoulda 3 .
However , we wanted to go over these changes in depth and explain some of our motivation .
Shoulda has two main components : a test context framework , and a set of helpers for testing Rails applications .
The context framework was written because we found the method - based style of Test : : Unit tedious , but certain objections were raised to the way RSpec was implemented , and we had existing test suites that could not easily be converted to RSpec .
The Rails helpers were written in the form of Shoulda - based “ macros ” for convenience .
While this approach worked great for those of us using Test : : Unit , this meant that the Rails helpers were only accessible in Shoulda - based test suites despite relying on very little in Test : : Unit or the Shoulda context framework .
In order to bring Shoulda ’s Rails helpers to a wider community , they were rewritten as a set of RSpec - compatible matchers , and the existing “ macros ” were rewritten to use them .
As things in the Cucumber and RSpec community started to pick up , we found more and more that Test :: Unit users were n’t getting the latest and greatest .
Most of the new assertion libraries we found were written as RSpec expectations , and several improvements to RSpec ’s context and matcher DSL made it look too appealing to ignore .
We tried out RSpec on a few projects , and found that we really did n’t have to give anything up - Shoulda ’s macros were fully supported as matchers - and we found ourselves enjoying RSpec more than Test : : Unit .
It was at this point that we decided that Shoulda ’s future would focus on RSpec .
However , we were n’t going to ditch Test :: Unit .
We had many existing projects that used Test : : Unit and Shoulda , and we certainly did n’t want to abandon the fantastic Shoulda community .
After several experiments , we decided not to convert our existing Shoulda test suites to RSpec , largely because they did n’t take advantage of all that RSpec had to offer and did n’t come out any better in the end .
This meant that we wanted to keep the context framework functioning .
However , we also found ourselves reluctant to spend time and effort on a context framework that we did n’t want to use .
Therefore , we needed to come up with a way to keep the matchers working with Test :: Unit and make sure the context framework continued to function reasonably , but prevent the overhead of maintaining compatibility with two frameworks .
Rails 3 presented another challenge .
Although some of the existing matchers just worked , the general strategy for testing them had to change with Rails 3 , and some matchers required conditional forks in the implementations and tests .
This was more complicated in the existing macro test suite , and maintaining two test Rails roots for backwards compatibility could potentially slow us down and make it harder to add new features .
We preferred the unit - style tests in place for the matchers , and wanted to avoid the rails_root - style test going forward if possible .
After refactoring all of the macros to use matchers , we found that the macros all followed a basic pattern : convert a number of hash options into RSpec ’s “ fluid ” syntax , and then create a test that performed one assertion based on a matcher .
Based on this discovery , we changed Shoulda ’s should method so that it could accept a matcher instead of a test name :
# macro style should _have_many :users should_ensure_length_at_least :name , 3 should_not_allow_values_for :isbn , " bad " should_set_the_flash_to / thank you / i should_not_assign_to : user # matcher style should have_many ( : users ) should ensure_length_of ( :name ).is_at_least( 3 ) should_not allow_value ( " bad " ) . for ( : isbn ) should set_the_flash .to( / thank you /i ) should_not assign_to( : user )
Converting to this syntax would mean that we no longer needed to support both a set of macros and a set of matchers - all matchers essentially function as macros .
In fact , this includes most non-Shoulda macros .
We currently support both syntaxes , but you ’ll receive a deprecation warning for the older macro style .
We ’ll also be removing the macros entirely starting with version 3 , so now is definitely the time to start embracing matchers .
We ’re committed to using RSpec , so we do n’t want to spend time adding features to Shoulda ’s context framework .
However , we need it to continue to function for our older test suites , and we understand that some users still prefer the lighter weight Test : : Unit framework .
Therefore , we plan on separating Shoulda ’s context framework into a separate library starting with version 3 .
The contexts will still function as always , but we have no plans to further improve this aspect of Shoulda .
There are a lot of changes here , but they ’re not too hard to understand :
Shoulda is now Rails 3 compatible !
Shoulda is focusing on the RSpec / Shoulda combination and will primarily support that combination of tools , moving away from Test : : Unit
Shoulda ’s “ macro ” methods are deprecated in favor of using the new should / matcher syntax
Shoulda ’s context framework is moving into a separate library
We ’re looking forward to Rails 3 and RSpec 2 , and we hope you ’re looking forward to Shoulda 3 .
Some reports in the media attempt to downplay the significance of the release of oil from the Deepwater Horizon accident by arguing that natural oil seeps release large volumes of oil to the ocean , so why worry ?
Lets look at the numbers .
This is a guest post by Dr. Cutler J. Cleveland .
Dr. Cleveland is currently a Professor in the Department of Geography and Environment at Boston University , with joint appointments in the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies and the Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer Range Future .
Dr Cleveland has a thorough piece on the Deepwater Horizon situation at the Encyclopedia of Earth .
Natural seeps can be thought of as natural springs from which liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons ( hydrogen - carbon compounds ) leak out of the ground .
Oil seeps are fed by natural underground accumulations of oil and natural gas .
Satellite images have identified hundreds of areas where oil is likely to seep from the Earth 's crust into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico .
These seeps occur over a wide range of the 615,000 mi² ( 1.6 million km ² )
Gulf .
A 2003 study by the National Research Council and a 2009 report by oil spill expert Dagmar Schmidt Etkin indicate that between 560,000 and 1,400,000 barrels per year ( 1,534 to 3,835 barrels per day ) seep into the Gulf of Mexico from natural sources .
Dozens of natural seeps have been identified off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas , some in the region of the Deepwater Horizon site .
These natural seeps are quasi - continuous or chronic inputs that represent a " background " rate of oil input that have been in existence for hundreds or thousands of years .
As the term " seep " implies , the rate of release from these sources of oil is much smaller than human spills that often release large , concentrated pulses of oil .
One of the largest and most intensively studied seepage areas lies off Coal Oil Point , in Santa Barbara County , California .
Individual seeps in this area release an estimated 80 to 100 barrels ( 3,360 to 4,200 gallons ) of oil per day ; Deepwater Horizon is releasing 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day ( Figure 1 ) .
The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico .
By May 30 , the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil , compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period .
Natural seeps are not constantly active ; the volume of oil released can vary considerably throughout the day and from day to day .
As a result , only a small area around the source is actually exposed to " fresh " non-degraded oil , which is its most toxic state .
Marine and coastal organisms and ecosystems presumably have adapted to the natural rate of oil input .
Indeed , most organisms living in the regions near natural oil seeps have no special adaptations to the oil .
Researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and the University of California / Santa Barbara studied natural seeps off the coast of California .
They found that as the oil moved upwards in the water column , a wide range of microbes consume the oil and produce intermediate products , and that those intermediate products are then converted by another group of microbes to natural gas and other compounds .
Their research suggests that oil from natural seeps normally stays in the water for between ten hours to five days .
Oil that does make it to the surface from natural seeps can spread out very widely .
One gallon of oil can spread out to cover more than a full square mile , forming an extremely thin film on the surface , about one - hundredth of a millimeter thick .
Under these conditions , the oil is not hazardous .
Some of the oil in that thin sheen evaporates within seconds or minutes after it reaches the surface .
A sudden , concentrated and massive pulse of oil from an event such as the Deepwater Horizon disaster presents a fundamentally more acute stress to marine and coastal systems .
The amount , rate and spatial concentration of crude oil released from such an event overwhelm the natural mechanisms of oil dispersal and breakdown , producing the significant ecological effects that we observe .

Lost decade :
The new threat to the U.S. economy
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The risk of a double - dip recession is getting a lot of attention , but even that grim prediction could prove a little too optimistic .
Disappointing job reports , weakness in housing and consumer spending and problems in world financial markets have raised concerns about the U.S. economy stalling out later this year .
Now some economists are starting to talk about an even worse fate : a prolonged period of very weak growth , a so - called " lost decade . "
" The probability of a lost decade is significantly greater than a double dip , " said Sung Won Sohn , economics professor at Cal State University Channel Islands .
" We do n't have too many engines of growth functioning right now -- housing , consumer spending , exports are all sputtering .
I have a hard time seeing where we can get 3 % economic growth back . "
A lost decade , or something like it , could feel like a never - ending recession to many Americans , as the economy does not grow fast enough to recoup lost jobs , and investments like homes and stocks continue to lose value .
The most famous lost decade occurred in Japan in the 1990s .
From 1992 through 1999 , the Japanese economy grew by less than 1 % a year .
It has yet to fully recover from the economic weakness and falling prices it suffered during that period .
There are a number of similarities between conditions in Japan in the 1990's and the United States today .
Japan had a real estate bubble inflate and then burst , resulting in banks choked with bad loans on their balance sheets and a cutback in lending .
The Bank of Japan did what it could to spur the economy , including cutting its key interest rate to near 0 % and pumping money into the economy through asset purchases , just as the Federal Reserve has done over the last two years .
But those steps had limited effectiveness .
And Japan suffered through bouts of deflation , in which falling prices caused businesses to cut production and employment , a scenario all too familiar to U.S. workers .
Deflation has been relatively rare in U.S. history , with no significant examples since the Great Depression .
But with inflation nearly non-existent , some Federal Reserve policymakers said at their June meeting that they were worried about the threat of deflation .
Sohn puts the chance of a prolonged period of weak growth as high as 40 % , with the chance of a double dip only 20 % - 25 % .
" If I had a choice I would much rather have a double dip and be done with it .
A lost decade is much more dangerous , economically , socially and politically , " said Sohn .
The growth produced during U.S. recoveries has been trending lower over the last 40 years or more , according to Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of Economic Cycle Research Institute .
He believes underlying changes in the economy will cause that trend to continue .
Achuthan said he 's worried that with increased volatility , recessions are likely to become more frequent , causing the economy to lose more ground in upcoming recessions than it is able to recover from during growth periods .
" That 's how you lose a decade , " he said .
" You get stuck in an era when you spend more time in recession than expansion . "
James Hamilton , professor of economics , University of California San Diego , said much of past economic growth was built upon unsustainable deficit spending , by both governments and households .
Huge , persistent trade deficits also provided a drag on the U.S. economy .
It will require some painful structural changes to free the economy from those constraints .
" The pattern for growth we had been relying upon was unsustainable , " he said .
" These are long - term challenges . "
While he believes a double - dip recession will be avoided , weak growth is the best we can hope for , at least in the next few years .
Plenty of economists believe there are significant differences between Japan in the 1990s and the United States today , and that another lost decade is unlikely .
They point to Japan 's shrinking population compared to the growing U.S. population , as well as Japan 's dependence on exports , rather than internal consumption , to drive the economy .
" You can draw some parallels , but while history can rhyme , it rarely repeats , " said Carl Riccadonna , senior U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank .
But while he does n't expect a U.S. lost decade , even Riccadonna is not expecting strong growth .
" We 're definitely looking at a subpar recovery , " he said .
Mormonism as a subject of scholarly interest was for many years explored by Latter - day Saint researchers and a small number of non-Mormon scholars , but now the field is attracting more academic attention .
Chairs in Mormon studies have recently been established at Utah State University and at California ’s Claremont Graduate University .
An additional chair is under consideration at the University of Wyoming , while Mormon - related courses are offered at other universities , including Harvard Divinity School , University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill , University of Richmond , Vanderbilt University , Utah Valley University , Arizona State University and others .
In addition , seminars and symposia exploring various aspects of Latter - day Saint history and doctrine have been held at Princeton University , at the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. and internationally at the University of Durham in Great Britain , New South Wales Parliament in Australia and National Taiwan University in Taipei .
Laurie Maffly - Kipp , associate professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina , describes her individual efforts to offer a Mormon - themed course in 1999 .
“ Though my area of study was the history of the American West , I only spent one class period on the Mormon experience but had been invited to present the Tanner lecture at the Mormon History Association meetings in 2000 .
In preparation for the lecture , I began to do research at the Church archives and at BYU .
I enjoyed it so much that I just kept at it and initiated the course here . ”
The course , “ Mormonism and the American Experience , ” is now offered each semester at UNC .
Beyond these official offerings , Mormonism is also “ gaining greater notice as a topic of conversation in American religious history and American history classes , ” says Patrick Mason of the University Notre Dame and currently on appointment at American University in Cairo .
Also to be noted is the increase in scholarly publications related to various aspects of Latter - day Saint history , culture and doctrine .
Such a movement , according to Jan Shipps , professor emeritus of history and religious studies at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis , was pioneered by the University of Illinois Press and editor Elizabeth Dulaney , which at one time held as many as 22 Mormon - themed titles .
Other significant academic imprints publishing related works include the presses at Columbia University , UNC and Oxford University .
As the broad field of religious studies was conceived in 1965 through legislation and private endowments , analysis of established religion gained academic attention , but Mormonism was not , at that point , seriously included .
“ It was like a doughnut , ” Shipps suggested .
“ People walked all around it but they would n’t take a bite . ”
Shipps is often credited with making the case that Mormonism be defined as “ a new religious tradition rather than a longtime footnote to American history , ” she says .
“ Shipps ’ studies conclude that Mormonism is , while legitimately Christian , still distinctive in its history and makeup , that it is qualitatively a new world religion , ” adds Philip Barlow , who occupies the newly created Arrington Chair of Mormon Studies at Utah State University .
“ The study of Mormonism can be like going back in a time machine to the second century and studying Christianity as it emerged from Judaism into a new religious tradition .
Only in Mormonism , we have far richer records and materials and people to study . ”
The “ scramble ” to implement curricula in Mormon studies , as described in a recent Boston Globe article , seems less a horse race , but more a plodding , long - term effort carried out by historians , professionals in numerous fields , and the institutional Church itself .
In recent years , the works of numerous scholars have “ built upon the foundational work of Mormon historian Leonard Arrington and scholars associated with Arrington , but they have also produced significant new work that connects Mormonism to religion more broadly and also to American history .
In that sense , they have helped propel the study of Mormonism into the mainstream of scholarship , ” suggests Sarah Barringer Gordon , professor of constitutional law and professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania Law School .
Barlow describes this body of scholars as “ among the best in America who have treated the subject of Mormonism with profound knowledge and insight . ”
The Utah State professor suggests additional reasons for the surge of interest in the scholarly examination of the Mormon faith .
“ Part of this new academic interest is proportionate to perceptions of Mormonism ’s cultural impact : the 2002 Winter Olympics , the Mitt Romney presidential candidacy , distinctive LDS voting patterns , the movement ’s growth and its spread internationally , ” adds Barlow .
In addition , an “ increasing number of scholars find Mormonism inherently fascinating : the most colorful , controversial and complex history — and it is accessible … information kept by world champion record keepers . ”
The available records and information concerning The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints provide historians and scholars – including those outside the faith – with helpful resources and challenging academic opportunities to explore the ever expanding field of religious studies .
“ Mormon Studies shares growing interest in other newer and smaller religious movements , and , of course , with larger worldwide traditions that often were not studied in depth in American colleges and universities , ” Barringer Gordon added .
“ American scholars ( and their students ) have become more interested in religion , and they have matched that interest with a commitment to studying a diversity of faiths . ”
Let the battle for the best seat begin .
Canadian coffee addicts just got one more reason to camp out for unreasonably long periods of time at their local Starbucks : free Wi-Fi .
Starting on Canada Day , more than 750 Starbucks locations across the country will offer free Wi -Fi , the company said Wednesday .
More than 100 of those locations are in Toronto .
Services will be provided by Bell Canada .
In the past , purchasing a drink or food item earned customers two hours of access .
The new system does not require a password or user name and will be unlimited .
In mid-June Starbucks announced free Wi-Fi would be coming to the U.S. and hinted the offer would be extended to Canada .
Following the first announcement , Kenneth Hardy , professor emeritus of marketing with the Richard Ivey School of Business , said Starbucks has the problem of dealing with the evolution of their customer base , from the espresso - sipping , leisurely , chatty customer to those who want a grab - and - go experience .
“ The second group that has come in over the last five or six years at least is more of a ‘ get my coffee and run , do n’t want to chat with the barista ’ type , ” said Hardy , who is a director of Williams Coffee Pub .
Offering free Wi-Fi is a way to lure that first crowd back , he said .
But , one challenge would be making sure customers did n’t linger too long over their laptops , preventing people who want to come in and sip a quick latte from finding a seat .
When the potential predicament was posed to Starbucks , Adam Brotman , vice president Starbucks Digital Ventures , sent a response via email .
“ We 've found that customers who bring laptops to Starbucks have averaged about an hour of Wi-Fi use during a visit , and we do n't expect that free access will make people linger longer , ” said Brotman , adding that all of the stores have different flows of traffic and they do n’t expect those flows to be disrupted .
In recent years , Starbucks has been hit by the recession and overwhelmed by rapid expansion .
Competitor McDonald ’s Corp. , which has been making strides in the coffee world , already offers free Wi-Fi at 11,500 U.S. locations .
Hardy said the need to distinguish Starbucks as a leisure destination is compounded in Canada , where the market is dominated by low - cost options like Tim Hortons .
“ Starbucks had been hurting so I think they need it , ” he said .
“ It takes the edge off being a four - buck cup of coffee .
At least you get your Wi-Fi . ”

This is Smokey .
I have wanted another meezer since I was a kid ( MANY moons ago ! ) , and finally got the chance when a local family was having a litter .
We brought him home last week , at about nine weeks old .
He was shy at first , but it did n’t last long .
The second night , he slept on my arm , snuggled up to my face , and has slept there each night since .
He ’s a real love , and I ’m so glad that he ended up choosing me .
On May 25 , 2010 , at approximately 17:30 CDT , the RITT logged oil collection at a rate of 8,000 barrels of oil per day , as measured by a meter whose calibration was verified by a third - party .
Based on observations of the riser , the team estimated that at least 10 % of the flow was not being captured by the riser at the time oil collection was logged , increasing the estimate of total flow to 8,800 barrels of oil per day .
Factoring in the flow from the kink in the riser , the RITTI Team calculated that the lower bound estimate of the total oil flow is at least 11,000 barrels of oil per day , depending on whether the flow through the kink is primarily gas or oil .
From Skandi ROV 2 10:55 pm 4th June ( The Skandi Rov 1 has the picture from the other side , also of the bottom of the cap ) .
Animation of an oil well jet pump .
There is a competing design here ( shorter video too )
BP announced plans to provide a daily morning update on how much crude is being collected by their oil drillship Enterprise as the oil company struggles to contain the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
And given that I was calling the cap the 7th generation LMRP when it was ( as the big 4 on the side of the yellow structure showed ) neither , means I need to take my own message to heart .
In this post I am going to talk about the seal under the cap .
There are four ports on the top of the cap , that continue to allow the oil that is flowing into the cap to flow back out while the cap was initially positioned , and to reduce the flow according to BP 's plans , until the system has been checked out to ensure there are no unforeseen problems .
BP only slowly raised the flow rate up the pipe when they first started using the Riser Insertion Tool ( RIT ) starting out with a flow of around 1,000 barrels / day and then ramping it up , at the time reporting that flow ramped up first to 2,000 bd and then up to 4,000 bd .
However they later rescinded the latter number and dropped the maximum flow level to around 2,200 barrels a day .
Oil and gas have started flowing up to the drillship at the top of the riser where the oil is separated and stored , and the gas is being flared .
( This was taken during the flare from the RIT operation ) .
However the flow out of the RIT was monitored , and higher rates have now been reported With the full flow now being emitted through the single confluence of the riser and BP flows at the top of the remaining riser section on the BOP , a full estimate of the leak will , no doubt , not be long in being announced .
The high volume of flow means that there needs to be cautious progress in capturing all the oil and gas and sending it up the DP .
However there is still a little communications conflict , since there were some reports that the taps bypassing the oil / gas would be closed later today , however at 10:43 pm the Enterprise ROV 2 was still showing an open port .
Oil was also leaking out of the bottom of the cap , which is , even when almost all the oil is being recovered , likely to be a good thing in small quantities , somewhat less than this .
Why is this ?
Well the way in which the Shear was used to cut the end of the riser and DP means that it is likely to be impossible at the present time to get a good strong seal around the chamber between the flow into the cap from the BOP and that out into the DP up to the LMRP .
When a stream enters a chamber through one port , and exits through another , both of relatively small size , then the jet will create a vacuum in the chamber , which pulls fluid from the surroundings into the chamber and carries it , with the jet fluid into the second port .
I am going to embed a short video of a commercial down - hole video and am not endorsing anything but the animation shows you how the jet pump works .
( And the flow in the Gulf is easier than that shown here ) .
The reason that it is critical in this operation is that the fluid outside the cap is seawater .
If the jet pumping action were to become too efficient as all the oil flowed from one passage to the other , then the “ jet pump effect ” would draw cold seawater into the chamber and the problem of hydrate generation and blocking of the flow path would be back to block the cap , as it did top hat .
By not getting all the flow into the second pipe it should be possible to drop the suction in the chamber to the point that a little oil still leaks out ( treated with dispersants ) but the majority goes up the well .
Getting this right should prove an interesting exercise .
( But is n’t calculating this what the “ best and the brightest ” – Dr. Chu ’s team - are there to do ? )
And it is not nearly as simple as it might at first appear , being able to capture almost all the oil , without getting the jet pump effect bringing in the seawater that would stop the flow .
Flow control is achieved , simplistically , with a valve at the top of the riser on the Enterprise .
By adjusting the flow the valve effectively controls the pressure at the top of the riser and thus also at the bottom .
Incidentally in other circumstances jet pumps are neat tools .
One of my students developed a high pressure one for use in lifting high - level radioactive waste out of nuclear waste storage tanks ( you want to minimize water use , and do this by upping the driving jet pressure ) .
Worked like a charm , when used in the real tanks .
They are also used as remote inexpensive pumps in mines , lying in depressions where water can collect .
The water collects , a float valve lifts and the jet flows , sucking the water away .
As the water disappears , the float drops and the jet switches off .
Oh , and for those who have ideas on how to deal with any part of this problem , the Government is stepping up the ways in which you can get funding .
The process goes through the Federal Business Opportunities Webpage where there is a Broad Agency Announcement on the subject .
It would be more fruitful to contact them .
UPDATE : BP are slowly increasing the amount of oil taken up the drill pipe from the cap on the BOP .
They have announced that they will give an update on the daily flows measured .
Although Toby and Bendal in comments have stated that BP have raised the flow rate up to the Enterprise to 6,000 bd , from the 1,000 bd initially ( which included 3 hours when the system was shut down ) so far I ca n’t find a reference for this , so I would appreciate the help of readers in finding where these numbers are being posted so that I can make them available to the general readership , who often do n’t read the comments .

A Pill for Psychological Pain ? . . .
“ The idea — that a drug designed to alleviate physical pain should reduce the pain of social rejection — seemed simple and straightforward based on what we know about neural overlap between social and physical pain systems .
To my surprise , I could n’t find anyone who had ever tested this idea , ” [ psychologist C. Nathan ] DeWall said .
Psych Sci
Studies suggest that the similar linguistic descriptions of social and physical pain extend beyond metaphor , and demonstrate overlap in the neurobiological systems underlying physical pain and social pain ( DeWall & Baumeister , 2006 ; Eisenberger , Lieberman , & Williams , 2003 ; Way , Taylor , & Eisenberger , 2009 ) .
In the present experiments , we examined one functional consequence of the hypothesis that social and physical pain rely on shared neurobiological systems — whether acetaminophen , a common physical pain reliever , also reduces social pain .

Eisenberger , Lieberman , and Williams ( 2003 ) , writing in Science , described a game they created to expose individuals to social rejection in the laboratory .
The authors measured the brain activity in 13 individuals at the same time as the actual rejection took place , and later obtained a self - report measure of how much distress the subject had experienced .
Distress was correlated at r=.88 with activity in the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) .
Acetaminophen has a relatively short half - life , lasting approximately 4 hr , which means that it is unlikely that acetaminophen had a cumulative effect in our experiments .
Our finding that acetaminophen reduced hurt feelings over time could be due to a combination of not feeling hurt and having a greater ability to reappraise the rejection experience .

Did you consider the negative consequences of acetaminophen ?
Did your IRB have anything to say about this ( there was NO info in the paper on institutional approval or the signed consent procedure with participants ) ?
How did you decide on your dosing regimen ?
Why 3 weeks , when the half - life is only 4 hrs ?
Instructions say " do not use for more than 10 days without doctor 's permission . "
Was an MD involved in the study ?
What do you know about the mechanism of action ?
For more info , see Acetaminophen from Frank J. Dowd .
And most critically , why did you choose acetaminophen , rather than aspirin , ibuprofen , or naproxen ?
Related to this , why did the first version of the manuscript have " Tylenol " in the title ?

Furthermore , many studies have shown that being rejected can trigger aggressive and antisocial behavior , which could lead to further complications in social life ( DeWall , Twenge , Gitter , & Baumeister , 2009 ; Warburton , Williams , & Cairns , 2006 ) .
If acetaminophen reduces the distress of rejection , the behavioral consequences of rejection , such as antisocial behavior , may be reduced as well .
Indeed , our fMRI results showed that acetaminophen diminished reactivity in the dACC and amygdala , brain regions that have been linked to aggression ( Denson , Pedersen , Ronquillo , & Nandy , 2009 ; Eisenberger , Way , Taylor , Welch , & Lieberman , 2007 ) .
It would therefore be worthwhile to explore whether acetaminophen reduces the aggressive consequences of social rejection .
... applauded the investigators ' research efforts .
" It is particularly difficult to get research funding to study old , cheap , unpatented , over - the - counter drugs , so I congratulate the authors on doing this , " he said .
Dr. Charlton , who [ was ] editor - in - chief of Medical Hypotheses and professor of theoretical medicine at the University of Buckingham , United Kingdom , agreed that different sorts of pain are often related , so there is good reason to assume that acetaminophen or paracetamol may benefit those who suffer any type of pain of unpleasant feelings , including some types of depression .
However , he noted that the same effect would likely apply to aspirin , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , and opiates , " about which there is more evidence , " he said .

It 's not just for headaches anymore !
The active ingredient in TYLENOL ® ( acetaminophen , also known as paracetamol ) has been shown to ease the pain of social rejection .
Would n't it be great if you could pop an over - the - counter medication to lessen the hurt of being excluded from that grad student party ?
Of being ostracized by all your old friends ?
Even disowned by your family and becoming homeless ?
The journal article , which was promoted by press release six months ago , has finally appeared online ( Dewall et al. , 2010 ) .
An excerpt from the December 2009 press release is below .
Perhaps because there 's no clear mechanistic basis for such an idea ?
The authors themselves never proposed one either .
One might expect that a psychopharmacological experiment with a drug that can cause serious liver damage would be conducted with a specific hypothesis in mind and some basic knowledge about how the drug is thought to work , but we did n't see that here .
Granted , that would not be typical fare for .
So instead the rationale given by Dewall et al. ( 2010 ) is partially linguistic , partially based on a neuroimaging study ( Eisenberger et al. , 2003 ) : The " shared neurobiological systems " are thought to be located in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , a brain structure that contains discrete regions responsive to physical pain ( Kwan et al. , 2000 ) .
Interestingly , externally applied vs. self - administered thermal pain activate anatomically distinct areas of the ACC ( Mohr et al. , 2005 ) .
Furthermore , it is not at all clear whether the same regions of ACC represent social pain and the affective components of physical pain .
In a study designed to dissociate expectancy violations from social rejection , the dorsal ACC was activated when expectations were violated , while ventral ACC ( quite distant from the physical pain regions ) was activated by social rejection ( Somerville et al. , 2006 ) .
At any rate , participants in the Eisenberger et al. ( 2003 ) study took part in a computerized ball - tossing game while being scanned .
Initially , two fictitious players included the scanned subject in the game , but then started to exclude him / her .
This was the “ social exclusion ” condition , which was compared to the inclusion condition .
But it happens to be the case that this paper was singled out as one of the worst of the " voodoo correlation " violators by Vul and his colleagues , since it reported a statistically unlikely value based on a non-independent analysis :
A correlation of r=.88 between dACC activity and self - reported distress is implausibly high ...
But I 'll stop here , and point to Lieberman , Berkman , and Wager 's ( 2009 ) reply to Vul et al .
That brings us to the present study by Dewall et al. ( 2010 ) .
In Experiment 1 , 30 participants ( 24 women , 6 men ) took one 500 mg acetaminophen pill immediately after waking up and another 500 mg an hour before going to sleep ( 1,000 mg per day for 3 weeks ) .
The other 32 participants ( 24 women , 8 men ) took the same dosing of placebo for 3 weeks .
Each evening , subjects filled out the the Hurt Feelings Scale ( the " today " version ) to report how much social pain they had experienced that day .
Despite the fact that the half life of acetaminophen is 4 hours , it took about 10 days for the drug group to report significantly lower hurt feelings than the placebo group .
The difference on day 21 was greatest ( p < .005 ) .
However , the difference in change - over - time slopes between the two groups was only marginally significant ( p ≤ .10 ) .
The explanation of the time course for these effects was unclear :
In Experiment 2 , the dose was upped to 2,000 mg acetaminophen per day for 3 weeks .
Instructions were given to refrain from drinking entirely , since alcohol can potentiate liver damage when taken with acetaminophen .
In 2009 , an FDA panel made a recommendation to lower the maximum daily dose from 4,000 mg ( to an unspecified value ) .
The panel also endorsed limiting the maximum single dose of the drug to 650 mg , down from the current 1,000 mg dose ( which was given in Exp. 2 ) .
At the end of the three week period , the cyberball exclusion fMRI study was run .
The acetaminophen group showed less activity in dACC in response to social exclusion , but they didreport lower hurt feelings .
Hmm .
As an aside , here 's another puzzling observation .
If it 's been claimed that " social exclusion hurts " ( Macdonald & Leary , 2005 ) , then why does the experience of social exclusion result intolerance for physical pain andpain thresholds ( DeWall & Baumeister , 2006 ) ?
Next , I have a series of questions for the authors : I was also alarmed by the wild extrapolation from exclusion in a laboratory video game to purported increases in aggressive violence : I 'm sure the 24 women in the placebo condition felt like committing mass murder after being excluded from a game of cyberball .
Better put them on TYLENOL ® .
The Medscape article on the study had prominent kudos from Bruce G. Charlton , MD , who :
One last question arose when I checked funding for the study :
The grant number was misreported , it 's MH065559 , not MH - 65999 .
And funding from the Gulf Atlantic Group , Inc. ??
Trying to trace that entity has been like navigating a maze , an endless series of shell corporations : http://haverlandprince.com/http://www.texpacfunding.com/http://www.gainagroup.com/http://pcigroupltd.com/But maybe it 's really Gulf Atlantic Funding Group Inc ? -- no , that 's mortgages .
OR how about : Gulf Atlantic Group Incorporated in Tallahassee , FL ( where one of the authors is located ) ?
Or maybe it was just another typo ... Original name of the article was : DeWall C. N. , MacDonald , G. , Webster , G. D. , Masten , C. , Baumeister , R. F. , Powell , C. , Combs , D. , Schurtz , D. R. , Stillman , T. F. , Tice , D. M. , & Eisenberger , N. I. ( in press ) .

Dear Reader ,
Back in March I had the opportunity to work on a project for Microsoft that is now coming to light .
I was tasked with writing a PHP wrapper for the Bing API that Microsoft has been building .
I ’ve written API wrappers before and it is either a fun experience or it is a nightmare , depending on whether the API is easy to work with .
I am pleased to report that the Bing Search API is well thought out and very easy to work with .
For PHP developers , I am hoping that what I am about to show you makes it even easier .
QuickStart
Ok , if you do n’t care for the rambling , here is everything you need to get going .
The steps are easy .
Grab the code and put it somewhere in your include path .
Get an application key .
( They are free )
Write you a quick index .
php that looks something like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 < html > < head > < title > Cal's Bing Search QuickTest </ title > < body > <?
PHP function __autoload ( $ className ) { $ fileName = strtr ( $ className , ' _ ' , DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ) . " .php " ; include $ fileName ; return ; } $ apiKey = '' ; $o = new Msft_Bing_Search ( $ apiKey ) ; $o -> setQuery ( ' zend framework ' ) -> setWebCount ( 10 ) -> setSite ( ' calevans.com ' ) -> setSource ( ' Web ' ) -> setSource ( ' Image ' ) -> setAdult ( ' Off ' ) ; $ raw = $o -> search ( ) ; echo " < h2 > Raw</h2 > " ; echo " < textarea cols= ' 100 ' > " . $ o -> get Url ( ) . " </textarea >< br /> " ; if ( $o -> getFormat ( ) == ' json ' ) { $ result = json_decode ( $ raw ) ; } else { $ result = htmlspecialchars ( $ raw ) ; } echo " < h2 > Images </h2 > " ; foreach ( $ result -> SearchResponse -> Image ->
Results as $ value ) { printf ( '' , $ value -> Url , $ value -> MediaUrl ) ; } echo " < br / > " ; echo " < h2 > Links < / h2 > " ; foreach ( $ result -> SearchResponse -> Web ->
Results as $ value ) { printf ( '%s < br /> ' , $ value ->
Url , $ value -> Title ) ; } ? > </ body > </html > < html > < head > < title > Cal's Bing Search QuickTest </ title > < body > <? PHP function __autoload ( $ className ) { $ fileName = strtr ( $className , '_' , DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ) . " . php " ; include $ fileName ; return ; } $ apiKey = '' ; $o = new Msft_Bing_Search ( $apiKey ) ; $o-> set Query ( ' zend framework ' ) ->setWebCount(10 ) ->setSite('calevans.com ' ) ->setSource ( ' Web ' ) ->setSource ( ' Image ' ) -> setAdult ( ' Off ' ) ; $ raw = $ o -> search ( ) ; echo " < h2 > Raw </h2 > " ; echo " < textarea cols= ' 100 ' >" .$o->getUrl ( ) . " </ textarea >< br /> " ; if ( $o -> getFormat ( ) =='json ' ) { $ result = json_decode ( $raw ) ; } else { $ result = htmlspecialchars ( $raw ) ; } echo " < h2 > Images < / h2 > " ; foreach ( $ result->SearchResponse ->
Image ->
Results as $ value ) { printf ( '' , $ value -> Url , $value -> MediaUrl ) ; } echo " < br /> " ; echo " < h2 > Links < / h2 > " ; foreach ( $ result->SearchResponse ->
Web -> Results as $ value ) { printf ( ' %s < br /> ' , $ value -> Url , $value -> Title ) ; } ? > </ body > </html >
If it works , you should see something that looks like this .
That is a simple example that will get you going and allow you to play with the code .
Of course you have to get your API key first .
Lines 13 , 16 , and 18 above are the ones you are going to want to play with .
13 being an API key ; without that it wo n’t work .
16 is the search term , I know I have a couple of Zend Framework related posts on my blog so I used that .
Line 18 is the domain limit .
I only want to search for Zend Framerwork on my blog .
Tinker with those a while and see what results you come up with .
Oh , you may have notices the autoLoader from lines 6 - 11 .
Feel free to remove that if you like but you will have to add in all the requires for the classes , subclasses and Exceptions .
If you put the library in your path , the auto - loader will take care of making sure you have access to them all .
The API
The Bing API is very straightforward and most importantly , consistent in design .
These two facts make it very easy to work with .
Actually , there are several options that my wrapper does n’t yet implement , For this first version , I stuck with the basic Search API but they have separate sub -APIs for Phonebook , News , Translation and others .
I hope that future version of this wrapper will implement those .
The Wrapper
There are 37 methods in the wrapper and the vast majority of those are housekeeping methods like getters and setters .
The heart of the wrapper is the search ( ) method .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 /** * Attempts to execute the currently - specified search * * @return string
The results from the query * @throws Msft_Bing_Search_Exception */ public function search ( ) { if ( empty ( $ this -> appid ) ) { throw new Msft_Bing_Search_Exception ( ' Empty AppId ' ) ; } if ( empty ( $ this -> sources ) ) { $ this -> sources [ ] = ' web ' ; } $ this -> url = $ this -> buildUrl ( ) ; if ( $ stream = @ fopen ( $ this -> url , ' r ' ) ) { $ output = stream_get_contents ( $ stream ) ; fClose ( $ stream ) ; } else { throw new Msft_Bing_Search_Exception ( ' Problem opening stream ' ) ; } // print all the page starting at the offset 10 return $ output ; } // public function search ( ) /** * Attempts to execute the currently - specified search * * @return string
The results from the query * @throws Msft_Bing_Search_Exception */ public function search ( ) { if ( empty ( $ this -> appid ) ) { throw new Msft_Bing_Search_Exception ( ' Empty AppId ' ) ; } if ( empty ( $ this -> sources ) ) { $ this -> sources [ ] =' web ' ; } $ this ->url = $ this -> buildUrl ( ) ; if ( $ stream = @fopen ( $ this - > url , 'r ' ) ) { $ output = stream_get_contents ( $ stream ) ; fClose ( $ stream ) ; } else { throw new Msft_Bing_Search_Exception ( ' Problem opening stream ' ) ; } // print all the page starting at the offset 10 return $ output ; } // public function search ( )
As you can see , we check to make sure we have a appId and throw an exception if we do n’t .
Then , if you ’ve not set which sources to check ( web , image , spell are currently implemented ) we set a default of web .

Demand for Internet addresses continues to grow in 2010 , though it 's not uniform across all Top Level Domains ( TLD ) .
According to a new report from VeriSign , the first quarter closed with a total of more than 193 million registered domain names .
The Q1 tally represents an increase of 6 percent , or 11 million domain names , over the first quarter of 2009 .
A year ago , the .cn county code Top Level Domain ( ccTLD ) for China was gaining fast and looked like it might overtake .com .
In 2010 , that 's not quite the case , as overall demand for ccTLD registrations slowed , and VeriSign is reporting that .cn was actually on the decline .
According to VeriSign 's report , the first quarter saw .cn slip from second place behind only .com to fourth place .
In descending order , VeriSign 's top 10 list of TLDs in the first quarter was : .com , .de , .net , .cn , uk , .org , .info , .nl , .eu and .ru .
The firm explained the decline in the .cn domain as a byproduct of new policies to help ensure that domains are legitimate .
" Many of these are low - priced promotional names that have now come up for renewal at a higher price , " Pat Kane , vice president of naming services at VeriSign , told InternetNews.com .
" The .cn registration decline was also based on the CNNIC ( China Internet Network Information Center ) registry 's implementation of the real names directive from the Chinese government primarily around verifiable ' whois ' data . "
While .cn registrations declined , VeriSign reported that .com and .net registration hit 99.3 million names in the first quarter , an increase of 7 percent on a year - over - year basis .
The first quarter of 2010 also marked a significant milestone for .com as the domain celebrated its 25th anniversary .
" .com has been a platform for Internet innovation over the past 25 years , and we expect .com will continue to play a central role for the innovators , entrepreneurs and companies who will shape the Internet over the next 25 years , " Kane said .
From dark horse to fiery steed , Spain were changed for ever by Euro 2008 .
Thanks to Fernando Torres 's goal against Germany and Cesc Fàbregas 's penalty against Italy , la selección finally won a major tournament – and a new identity .
A new mentality .
This Time , England 's 1982 song , could have been written for them .
Declaring themselves favourites is nothing new but this time , more than any other time , Spaniards actually believe it .
" If we 'd said four years ago that Spain would win the European Championships and go into the World Cup with a real chance of winning it , you 'd have said we were mad , " Torres admits .
" But not now . "
As one headline put it : " Spain come into this World Cup as genuine favourites . "
The " unlike every other World Cup " went without saying .
After Spain defeated France in Paris in the spring , one columnist wrote : " Hands up any of you who did not go to bed last night with the feeling that no one can stop this team .
Step forward those of you who do n't think that , barring some major accident or a coincidence of strange events , we 're coming back from South Africa with the Cup under our arm .
Too optimistic ?
No , just realistic . "
Realistic might be pushing it , but it is not just the Spanish saying so .
The coach , Vicente del Bosque , has constantly fled the favourites tag , like it was some kind of plague - infected rat hell - bent on biting him .
It is , he insists , a " terrible trap " .
But however hard he runs , however cleverly he hides , there is no avoiding it .
" Everyone , " notes Torres , " is talking about us .
Whenever coaches or players are asked for their favourites , they mention Spain .
We 've earned that .
In the past we talked about being favourites when maybe we were n't – this time we really are . "
Much of that is due to sheer talent .
This generation of players is , quite simply , better than those before .
Raúl is often declared the finest Spanish footballer ever , certainly their best goalscorer .
Yet David Villa is now only seven behind him .
Having played 46 games fewer .
If Torres is fit , Fàbregas does n't get in the side and few complain .
Mikel Arteta never gets in the squad and no one has even noticed .
As Thierry Henry puts it : " They have Villa and Torres ; they have Xabi Alonso and Cesc , Iniesta and Xavi , and Silva .
It 's incredible . "
Euro 2008 underlined the depth of talent and also enhanced it , changing perceptions , strengthening the selección .
Without it , attitudes coming into South Africa would surely be very different .
The chances too .
No one here will forget Torres putting the ball beyond Jens Lehmann .
That goal on 29 June 2008 ended a 44 - year wait .
Spain , along with England , were the ultimate underachievers .
Now England stand alone , contemplating a four - decade drought .
But , says Torres , the moment Spain won Euro 2008 – the moment that not only changed their history but their future too – happened a week earlier , when Fàbregas 's penalty beat Gianluigi Buffon in a shoot - out .
That was the turning point .
Spain had got through a quarter‑final .
And against Italy too , the side they had not beaten in a competitive match for 88 years , the one they love to hate , the country with all the qualities – said through gritted teeth – that Spain lack : luck , competitiveness , effectiveness .
They had done it on penalties , after a goalless draw and on 22 June , the date they had lost on penalties three times running .
They had overcome a mental barrier : before Euro2008 , the band Pignoise , led by the former Real Madrid player Álvaro Benito , wrote a tournament song .
It was called ' Let 's Get Beyond the Quarters ! '
At last Spain had done .
David Villa says , " owed us . "
Now it no longer weighs them down .
Had Spain lost to Italy their early - tournament brilliance would have been lost in a familiar fog of depression .
Instead , everything they do was reinforced , vindicated .
Primarily , the adoption of a ball - playing game .
For years Spain sought an identity ; now it is unshakable , embedded , resistant .
Natural .
" Spain play with incredible ease , " Arsène Wenger says .
The ball belongs to them .
" Watching them on TV is lovely , " Henry says , " but playing against them is infuriating : you never get possession . "
The clarity and stability , the contentedness , is startling .
Debates are few – the outcry for Víctor Valdés to be included as third - choice keeper when most countries struggle to find a first spoke volumes about the strength of the squad and was at least in part provoked by club sectarianism and boredom .
But for Euro 2008 , things might have been different .
Style is fine but there 's no security blanket like success .
Each victory reinforced the model , a virtuous circle ; very occasional poor performances are not enough – at least not yet – to leave people questioning it .
After Spain 's disappointing 1 - 0 win over South Korea on Thursday , a result that once would have had them panicking , the county 's best - selling newspaper simply stated : " Now 's not the time to sound the alarms but to keep the faith in a team that has earned it . "
Earn is not the half of it .
The style works .
The stats are uncontestable .
At the end of the previous friendly , against Saudi Arabia , the defender Carlos Marchena broke the world record , surpassing Garrincha by going 50 internationals unbeaten .
Spain won 10 out of 10 in World Cup qualifying – the first team ever to do so – and have lost only one of their last 47 matches .
They have won 36 of their last 37 .
Including beating Italy , Argentina , France and England .
Twice .
During the France match , the St Denis fans started olé - ing the opposition 's every touch .
" Spain have confirmed that they 're one of the great favourites for the World Cup , " the France coach , Raymond Domenech , said afterwards .
" They have exceptional talent , sacrificed for the collective good .
They play without haste and yet they do so with intensity and intent .
Their circulation of the ball is spectacular and the final pass from midfield is like a penalty for anyone else . "
Asked how he would handle them in South Africa , Domenech shrugged .
" Luckily , we wo n't play Spain until the final so I do n't need to think of that just yet , " he said , adding quickly : " If we get there . "
If we do .
He , like so many others , did n't doubt that Spain would .
To make a 2 - tone necklace , cut a long piece of rope and wrap two different colors of embroidery thread around its own bobbin .
Tie a starter knot along with the two colored threads you are using , leaving at least 3 inches of slack , Tape down the slack to a flat surface or safety pin it something that will help keep it in place ( feeling nostalgic yet ? ) .
Lay the color that is n’t being used ( shown here in purple ) in your left hand , along with the rope , and hold them taut .
Take the active color ( shown here in red ) in your right hand , pass it over the rope , loop it under and back through the opening .
Pull up and to the right to tighten .
Repeat the knots until you are ready to switch colors .
( Click images to enlarge )
To alternate colors , simply put the inactive color ( red ) in your left hand and the new active color ( purple ) in your right .
Repeat the steps .
Once you ’re done knotting , add a few nuts and / or washers to the necklace .
Undo the large starter knot and tie both open ends together , creating your very own friendship necklace !
Trim any extra rope and tread .
Continue making necklaces at different lengths , using any color combination … in our opinion , the more the better !
Easy enough , right ??

Now a German Jewish organization , Jewish Voice for Peace in the Middle East , is planning an aid flotilla to Gaza !
Please send them money .
There are over 250,000 Jews in contemporary Germany , and more Jews immigrated to Germany in 2005 than to Israel .
Four - fifths of them are Russian Jews who prefer Berlin to Beersheva .
And , there are some Israelis among them who have similar preferences .
In further evidence of how Israel can actually be bad for Jews , the Israeli government lobbied Germany in 2004 to restrict Jewish immigration .
But there are now more Jews in Germany than there were in 1939 before the Holocaust .
( True , there are not more than in the Weimar Republic , but that is where the trend line is going despite Israeli attempts to foment discriminatory immigration policies toward Jews . )
The Lost Rivers of the Garden of Eden - Found
The quest for pinpointing the exact location of the Biblical Garden of Eden and the four rivers almost rivals the quest for the location of fabled Atlantis .
And the theories that abound are almost as numerous as the interpretations of the seven days of Genesis .
Before tackling this question let 's review what is written in Genesis about the four rivers :
10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
11 The name of the first is Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ; 12 And the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
13
And the name of the second river is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
14
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria .
And the fourth river is Euphrates .
( Genesis 2:10 - 14 KJV )
The Bible says that a single river flowed " out " of Eden and then does something that most rivers DO NOT do ; specifically , split into four separate " heads " or rivers that flowed downstream , all fed from a common single river source .
Almost all rivers start from a single source or are fed by multiple sources ( tributaries ) .
For example , the Ohio River actually begins where two rivers ( the Monongahela and Allegheny ) flow together at Pittsburg , Pennsylvania .
The Ohio River terminates when it flows into the Mississippi river as one of that river 's many tributaries .
So the names of rivers are an arbitrary thing , usually denoting only a portion of a greater complex stream system , with one stream flowing into another , which in - turn , may flow into yet another .
This pattern of rivers , as observed in nature , is just the opposite of what the Bible describes about the rivers of Eden .
For that reason , nobody has been able to look at modern maps of the regions mentioned in Genesis and figure out exactly where the Garden of Eden was , at least by the present topography of the lands of the Middle East .
Only one river of the four , the Euphrates , is known by the same name in modern times .
It presently originates in the mountains of Turkey and terminates when it merges with the Tigris River near the Iraq / Kuwait border region .
Many have speculated that the Tigris is the river Hiddekel .
This has led to speculation that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in Turkey .
This is assumed because the present headwaters of the Euphrates River originate in Turkey , as do the headwaters of the Tigris .
Others have proposed that the other end of the Euphrates River , where it meets the Tigris , may be the true location .
This requires interpreting the Tigris river as one of the other three ( the Hiddekel ) , then interpreting a tributary confluence of rivers as a river " head " ( which it is not ) , and then locating at least two more rivers ( or old river beds ) as the other missing two .
Having done so , they then claim that the Garden of Eden was near present day Kuwait .
This is a convenient solution , but not one supported by the literal wording of the Bible or the geological and geographical realities of what a river " head " means , i.e. headwaters or source of origin .
You will notice that the present day headwaters of both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers originate in Turkey very close to each other in mountainous terrain .
Logically , one would assume that if two of the rivers started there , the other two must have done so , as well , if Turkey was the location of Eden .
Neither the Pison nor Gihon rivers are ever mentioned again in the Bible .
However , the Hiddekel River is :
" And in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ; "
( Daniel 10:4 KJV )
This reference by the prophet Daniel comes from a vision he had while with the children of Israel during the Babylonian Captivity .
This would put Daniel somewhere in the area of present - day Iraq and would make the present - day Tigris river a fairly good candidate for the " Hiddekel " river spoken of by the prophet , as it is the only other great river known in that region today .
But the Bible says that this river " that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria " and a historical map of the location of Assyria , shows that the Tigris actually goes southeastward .
Keep in mind that the geographical area known as " Assyria " is not so easy to pin down .
Although the Assyrian Empire was centered near Nineveh , the actual empire also extended into what is also present - day Syria and Palestine .
However , lacking a better candidate , and knowing that the prophet Daniel was in that geographical area at the time of his visions , the Tigris appears to be the best possible modern - day candidate for the Hiddekel River .
We now must search out the probable locations of the other two rivers .
It is here that the theories that the Garden of Eden was either in Turkey or Kuwait starts to lose credibility .
First , let 's identify the geographical region of the Pison river .
The Bible says : " Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold " and gives us two good clues .
There is a recently discovered " Fossil River " that runs from the western mountains of Saudi Arabia towards Kuwait .
This old river course is now nothing more than a dry riverbed .
It 's old path was detected by satellite imaging .
Many have speculated that this may be the ancient Pison , as it has been dry since about 3,500 to 2,000 BC .
Although Saudi Arabia could marginally qualify for the land of Havilah , the fossil riverbed that flows across it had its origins in the mountains bordering the eastern side of the present day Red Sea , south of Israel .
It should be pointed out that those mountains are mirrored by another range of mountains on the western side of the Red Sea .
The Red Sea is a tectonic spreading zone and part of the Great Rift system that runs from northward in Turkey , down to the Dead Sea , along the length of the Red Sea and then southward deep into the African continent .
Obviously , when that mountain range was split by the Rift the source waters of the proposed Pison river would have dried up .
But this proposed river path may be somewhat of a " red- herring " because it does not seem to naturally " fit " the overall pattern .
An even better fit may be for the river to have flowed down into what today is the Gulf of Aden south of present day Yemen ( southern tip of Arabia ) .
Yemen has both gold and onyx , which matches : " ... the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
And the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone ... " and the eastward trending fault branch from the Afar triangle , which is south of Yemen would have been a natural riverbed in the days prior to Noah 's flood ( when sea levels were lower than today ) .
If this fossil - river ( referred to as the ' Kuwait river ' ) was indeed the Pison River , it does not correspond with the present - day headwater source of the Euphrates or Tigris up in Turkey .
What 's more , the geography of the last remaining river , the Gihon , further complicates the problem .
The Gihon is spoken of as : " Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia " which is the African land area west of the Red Sea and southward .
Of course , the political boundaries of what we call Ethiopia today were certainly different in Biblical times , but the general area is correct .
And if a river formerly flowed down what is now the Red Sea basin and southward into Africa at the Afar Triangle , it would certainly fit the description of a river that " compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia . " ( Genesis 2:13 )
All four of these rivers have one thing in common :
All are connected to the Great Rift system .
And that is the key to the mystery .
Two of the rivers of Eden were to the north of Israel , the active remnants of which presently originate out of Turkey to the north .
The two other rivers of Eden were to the south of Israel .
The geographical " center " of these four points of flow is neither Turkey nor Kuwait ; the center is somewhere near the general region of present day Israel and Jordan .
The Bible itself lends further credence to Israel ( or someplace nearby ) as the location of the Garden of Eden .
If you run the name " Eden " through a search of the Bible , among several references the following ones provide some insightful clues :
" 3Behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
4 The waters made him great , the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants , and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field .
5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
7 Thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches : for his root was by great waters .
8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him : the fir trees were not like his boughs , and the chesnut trees were not like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
9I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied him . "
( Ezekiel 31:3 -9 KJV )
In this passage the Bible says that the Assyrian was in Lebanon .
Spiritually speaking , the " trees " in this passage refer to men and leaders .
Cedar trees are mentioned elsewhere in the Bible as references to Lebanon ( Judges 9:15 , Psalms 29:5 & 104:16 , Song of Solomon 5:15 , Isaiah 2:13 , Jeremiah 22:23 and more ) .
Notice also in the last of the passage that the Spirit associates the trees with " Eden " that " were in the Garden of God . "
Lebanon , although not a part of modern political Israel , was a part of the Biblical lands ruled by the Kings of Israel in times past .
From this we can infer that the Garden and the source of the rivers of the Garden was somewhere close to the land of Lebanon .
Assuming this postulation is correct , that the source of the four rivers was somewhere near Lebanon , and that the rivers all had a connection to the Great Rift system , the interconnection of the river systems would need to be somewhat like the map below :
What roughly emerges , when all four rivers are connected to trace of the Great Rift fault system , is a complex river network emerging from a common point of origin that flows both north and south , with each north and south extension splitting into two separate streams , for a total of four rivers .
That adds up to four separate heads .
But the so - called Kuwait River , which has been proposed as the lost river Pison , still does not seem to match well with the common denominator of the others - the Great Rift and branching fault systems .
Based on the description of its path in the Bible which says , " compasseth the whole land of Havilah " and knowing from the geology of present day Yemen that onyx can be found there , then this part of the verse , " where there is gold ;
And the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone " suggests an alternate path for the River Pison , to the south of Yemen , as we mentioned previously .
So , When all factors are considered ( Bible text and geology ) , I believe the paths indicated by the dotted lines on the large map below are the probable paths where the four - rivers of the Garden of Eden actually flowed .
And a southern path around Yemen puts the fourth river squarely into the basin of the Great Rift system , flowing east from the upwelling Afar Triangle .
These paths meet the requirements of the Biblical text because the single river water source ( " head " ) , originating from high ground somewhere in or near present day Israel , would have originated or flowed down into the Rift Valley basin .
Those waters would then need to have been diverted to flow both north and south along the path of the Rift zone , with both the north and south forks each splitting a second time when intercepting other fault zones , to produce a total of four rivers , with four heads .
The chart below is an overview of the known fault systems across the Middle East region ( south of the Red Sea excluded ) :
Keep in mind that the course of rivers around and through the vicinity of the Great Rift fault system may have changed or dried up because of block faulting all along the Rift zone since the times of Adam and Eve. Certainly Horst and Graben faulting along the Rift could , and would , change the surface topography .
Horst and Graben faulting is defined as " elongate fault blocks of the Earth 's crust that have been raised and lowered , respectively , relative to their surrounding areas as a direct effect of faulting .
Horsts and Grabens may range in size from blocks a few centimeters wide to tens of kilometers wide ; the vertical movement may be up to several thousand feet . "

But when did this happen ?
The most likely time frame would be in the years immediately following Noah 's Flood .
Keep in mind that the Bible says there was a significant geologic event that happened 101 years after Noah 's Flood - The " Earth was divided " ( see : Genesis 10:25 & 1 Chronicles 1:19 ) .
The Bible also describes what was probably tectonic / volcanic activity in the Rift valley in Abraham 's days ( the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah - See Genesis 19:28 ) .
Imaging of the Dead Sea indicates that , at one time , the river bed of what is now the Jordan River once flowed across the land surface that is now at the bottom of the Dead Sea .
This further suggests that there was Horst and Graben faulting at the southern end of the present Dead Sea , which abruptly terminated the former flow of that river southward and formed the current Dead Sea .
And that stream was probably the feeder channel to the ancient Gihon and Pison Rivers , which ran down the floor of what is now the Red Sea into Ethiopia and through the Rift basin south from the Afar Triangle .
Supporting coincidental evidence for this is the fact that fish species down in the African Rift valley river and lake systems are very similar to those found in the Jordan River system :
Note :
The aquatic life of the African lakes and rivers belongs to the so - called Ethiopian zoogeographical region .
According to Annandale , the explanation of the Ethiopian affinity of the fish fauna of the Jordan is that the Jordan formed at one time merely part of a river system that ran down the Great Rift Valley .
The Jordan was one branch of this huge river system , the chain of lakes in East Africa represents the other ; and together they opened into the Indian Ocean .
See R. Washbourn , The Percy Sladen Expedition to Lake Huleh , 1935 , Palestine Exploration Fund , Quarterly Statements , ( 1936 ) , p. 209 .
( Source website : The Great Rift and the Jordan )
Now , returning to the general area of Lebanon as the Biblical location of the Garden of Eden and the water source for the four rivers , let us take a look at the present - day geology and topography of that area .
This map shows a great deal of block faulting in the area of Lebanon just north of modern - day Israel .
You will note from the topographical relief and surface features that , had waters once flowed north out of Lebanon , they would naturally flow into the Euphrates Fault system river basin .
So , at the time of the Garden of Eden , the main headwaters of the Euphrates could have come from that direction .
If the water flow at that time continued northward along the path of the Great Rift , it would intersect the present - day Tigris river basin system , as well .
That would mean that the present - day head - waters of both rivers , that currently originate in Turkey , may have in older times been only tributaries to both rivers , not the main water source .
Below is a satellite image of the entire area .
41G-120-0056 Dead Sea Rift Valley , Israel and Jordan October 1984
Seen from an altitude of 190 nautical miles ( 350 kilometers )
The prominent bodies of water along the Rift zone in this photo are the Dead Sea ( bottom ) and Sea of Galilee ( top ) .
They are connected by the Jordan River which flows south .
Before the Earth was divided by the Rift , the elevations along Great Rift floor were certainly different .
What you are looking at in the satellite photo is " ground zero " of what was once the Garden of Eden .
Here is another important point to remember .
The Bible says that the river flowed out of Eden , but nowhere does the Bible give a geographical size for what constituted the actual area of Eden .
Therefore , the actual source of the waters could have been south of Lebanon .
More specifically , those waters could have originated in or near Jerusalem in present - day Israel , or even up welled from a massive spring under the sea of Tiberius , but the river originated here and , from here , branched out north and south along the Rift , then branched out again further north and further south .
Evidence for the Israel / Lebanon region as the location of Eden and the lost river finds considerable support in the Bible , in the fact that God considers the land of Israel as His Holy land .
It was upon one of the mountains in the " land of Moriah " ( Genesis 22:2 ) where Abraham was told to sacrifice his son ( a type of the Lord 's sacrifice of Jesus ) .
Solomon was told to build the Temple " at Jerusalem in mount Moriah " ( 2 Chronicles 3:1 ) and Jerusalem was where the Lord Jesus was actually crucified .
By extension , we can assume that when God sacrificed an animal to cover Adam and Eve with its skin ( Genesis 3:21 ) , that animal was a Lamb ( Revelation 13:8 ) .
Therefore , we can be certain from the typology that Adam and Eve , and the center of the Garden of God , were somewhere at or very near geographical Jerusalem .
And so was the source of the River .
Now , what exactly do those spiritual realities have to do with the location of the river of Eden ?
In the future , when the Lord Jesus Christ establishes His Kingdom and Righteous Temple in Jerusalem , the Bible speaks of a river flowing from below the Temple .
The prophet Ezekiel spoke of seeing this in a vision :
1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house ; and , behold , waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward : for the forefront of the house stood toward the east , and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house , at the south side of the altar .
2 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ankles .
Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees .
4 Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
5 Afterward he measured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed over .
6 And he said unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen this ?
Then he brought me , and caused me to return to the brink of the river .
7 Now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
8 Then said he unto me , These waters issue out toward the east country , and go down into the desert , and go into the sea : which being brought forth into the sea , the waters shall be healed .
9
And it shall come to pass , that every thing that liveth , which moveth , whithersoever the rivers shall come , shall live : and there shall be a very great multitude of fish , because these waters shall come thither : for they shall be healed ; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh .
10
And it shall come to pass , that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth nets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
11 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed ; they shall be given to salt .
12
And by the river upon the bank thereof , on this side and on that side , shall grow all trees for meat , whose leaf shall not fade , neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed : it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months , because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary : and the fruit thereof shall be for meat , and the leaf thereof for medicine .
( Ezekiel 47:1 - 12 KJV )
The above passage is speaking of the future days on the one - thousand year reign of the Lord Jesus Christ in Jerusalem ( Revelation 20 ) , and a reconfiguration of the land after the regeneration of the heavens and Earth following the Great Tribulation ( see : Jeremiah 4:23 - 28 & Isaiah 65:17 - 25 ) .
At that time , once again , the land will be like the Garden of Eden ( but not quite exactly , from a geological viewpoint ) .
What Ezekiel wrote about ( above ) should not be confused with the eternal future time of the new heaven and Earth that comes after the Great White Throne Judgment ( Revelation 20:11 ) .
" And I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
And I John saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband . "
( Revelation 21:1 - 2 KJV )
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
In the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
( Revelation 22:1 - 2 KJV )
The difference between the earthly Jerusalem of Ezekiel 's description , with a river flowing out from below the house of the Lord ( the Temple ) during the one - thousand - year reign of the Lord ( Revelation 20 ) , and the river flowing out from the " throne of God " in the New Jerusalem that John wrote about , is that there is NO TEMPLE in the New Jerusalem .
" And I saw no temple therein : for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it . "
( Revelation 21:22 KJV )
The Jerusalem and river described in Ezekiel 47:1 - 12 , and the New Jerusalem and river described in Revelation 22:1 - 2 , are two different places in two different times , though very similar in their descriptions , yet different in important ways .
In summary : The Bible tends to indicate that the river from the Garden of Eden originated in the Holy Land , and from there became four heads .
A forensic study of the region 's geology tends to support the theory over the alternatively proposed locations of Turkey or Kuwait .
What we have not shown is a geologic model for the source of these waters originating from the area of Jerusalem .
Keep in mind , however , that Jerusalem sits just west of the Great Rift Valley .
It is quite possible that the legendary river of Eden originated from a massive artesian aquifer , the source of which has long since been disrupted by block faulting along the Rift .
We know for a scientific fact that there is a considerable amount of " fossil " water under the Middle East in the deep - rock sandstone aquifers of the region such as the Nubian sandstone aquifers and equivalent formations .
Also keep in mind that in the days of Adam and Eve a " mist " went up and watered the face of the Earth within the Garden ( Genesis 2:6 ) .
Fountains of waters ( underground waters under pressure gushing upwards ) would certainly be a logical source for the generation of such a mist and would be a logical feed - source for such a river .
Certainly , we cannot exclude this possibility .
Although the modern - day geology and topography of the Middle - East does not readily reveal the exact location of the Garden of Eden and the four rivers source , guidance by faith from the Holy Bible and a forensic study of the region 's geology and topography reveals the matter .
The available data appears to suggest that present - day Israel was the central location of the Garden of Eden .
In the next chapter we begin our study about the dynamics of Noah 's flood .

Ann Arbor , Mich .
“ IF our laws were broken ... we will bring those responsible to justice , ” President Obama pledged on Tuesday , in announcing an investigation of the events leading to the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig .
His words may have been , in part , political damage control ; efforts to contain the spill remain dire .
But federal prosecutors have been working behind the scenes for weeks to determine whether BP , Transocean ( the owner of the rig ) and Halliburton ( the company that did the cementing job on the deep - ocean well ) should be charged with crimes .
Now , it ’s up to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to ensure that the legal response to the calamitous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is better than the emergency response .
If the spill had resulted from a hurricane or lightning strike , or if it had been an unavoidable accident  an equipment failure that happened without warning  it would n’t warrant criminal prosecution .
Increasingly , however , it appears that there was negligence or worse in the events leading to the explosion of the rig .
News reports have described warning signs that went unheeded and deviations from standard industry practice : Gas was seeping into the well .
The blowout preventer was leaking .
Concerns were raised about the well casing .
There were signs of trouble with the cement in the well .
Mud circulation was limited .
A final concrete plug was not properly installed .
And when disaster struck , the blowout preventer failed .
This part five of a six part introduction to c2hs .
Today , we explain how to marshal data to and from C structures .
An important note .
There is a difference between struct foo and foo ; c2hs only considers the latter a type , so you may need to add some typedefs of the form typedef struct foo foo in order to get c2hs to recognize these structs .
Get .
The Haskell FFI has no knowledge of C structs ; Haskell 's idea of reading a member of a struct is to peek at some byte offset of a memory location , which you calculated manually .
This is horrid , and hsc2hs has #peek to relieve you of this non-portable drudgery .
c2hs has something even simpler : you can specify {#get StructName -> struct_field #} and c2hs will replace this with a lambda that does the correct peek with the correct type : ( \ptr -> do { peekByteOff ptr 12 :: IO CInt} ) ( in the IO monad ! )
Note the following gotchas :
You will need to manually convert the resulting primitive C type into a more friendly Haskell type , and
The left hand side of the expression is a type or a struct name , not the Haskell variable containing the pointer / struct you want to peek at .
That will usually go to the right of the lambda .
The get directive is actually more general than just struct access : it can dereference pointers ( * StructName ) or access a member without dereferencing ( StructName.struct_field ) .
Set .
The opposite of get , set lets you poke values into arbitrary memory locations .
Unlike get , the value passed in is required to be a pointer ( and the syntax uses periods ) .
{#set StructName.struct_field #} expands to ( \ptr val -> do {pokeByteOff ptr 12 ( val : : CInt ) } ) ; the pointer is the first argument and the value is the second .
You also need to marshal the input value manually .
Defining Storable .
If you 're not individually getting and setting fields in the struct in an opaque pointer , creating a Storable instance is a good thing to do .
However , since all of the lambdas that get and set create are in the IO monad , composing them can be slightly tricky .
Judicious use of monadic lifting and applicative instances can make the code a lot simpler , however :
data StructName = StructName { struct_field1'StructName :: Int , struct_field2'StructName ::
Int } instance Storable StructName where sizeOf _ = {#sizeof StructName #} alignment _ = 4 peek p = StructName <$> liftM fromIntegral ( {#get StructName->struct_field1 #} p ) <*> liftM fromIntegral ( {#get StructName ->struct_field2 #} p ) poke p x = do {#set StructName.struct_field1 #} p ( fromIntegral $ struct_field1'StructName x ) {#set StructName.struct_field2 #} p ( fromIntegral $ struct_field2'StructName x )
The odd naming convention in StructName is to account for the fact that different structures can share field names , while Haskell field names may not .
Note .
c2hs recently got support added for an alignment directive , which computes the alignment for a C datastructure .
Unfortunately , as of 0.6.12 , this has not yet been released to the general public .
Request .
The paper describing c2hs states the following : “ [ Marshaling of compound C values to Haskell values ] is more generally useful ; however , often we do not really want to marshal entire C structures to Haskell . ”
Unfortunately , current incarnations of c2hs do not offer any optional functionality to reduce the drudgery of writing the “ straightforward ” Storable instance , which would be absolutely lovely .
bindings - dsl and GreenCard appear to fare better in this respect .

Call and fun : marshalling redux
Composition
Caffeine – 1,3,7 - trimethylxanthine , to give it its chemical name – is a member of a group of naturally occurring substances called methylxanthines .
These compounds are similar in structure to adenosines , naturally occurring molecules in our bodies which aid the onset of sleep .
In its natural context , which is in tea and coffee plants , caffeine can kill or paralyse insects and is thus an effective natural pesticide .
The beginning of the buzz
The earliest recorded caffeine consumers were in China in the 10th century BC , when philosophers believed tea- drinking was " an indispensable ingredient to the elixir of life " .
Coffee - quaffing originated in Yemen in the 15th century .
The exact amount of caffeine present in a drink depends on its growing conditions and preparation .
While tea naturally has more caffeine gramme for gramme than coffee , there is less tea per cubic centimetre of cup , leading to its weaker stimulant properties .
For the record , in a 5 oz cup of filter coffee , there is between 100 mg and 150 mg of caffeine .
The same sized serving of tea holds 35 - 45 mg .
Meanwhile , a 12 oz serving of cola contains just 40mg .
Doctors say at least 100 mg is necessary to properly increase our alertness .
( A study published by Bristol University last week argued that caffeine can't make irregular users more alert ; a cup of coffee in the morning , the research suggested , only counteracts the effects of withdrawal that have built up overnight . )
How does it work ?
Adenosine bonds to receptor cells in the brain to calm the activity of the central nervous system , thus triggering tiredness .
There is also evidence to suggest that it decreases blood flow in the brain .
Caffeine molecules bind to these receptor cells but have no active effect on the nervous system .
However by doing so they take the place of adenosine molecules that could make a difference .
This process is known as " competitive inhibition " and effectively delays the onset of fatigue , increases alertness and improves people 's ability to sustain attention .
Half - life
The amount of caffeine peaks in the bloodstream between 15 and 45 minutes after ingestion .
Its half - life – the time it takes for its level to halve – is between five and six hours .
In pregnant women the half - life can increase to 18 hours .
This is because unborn babies can only metabolise it very slowly .
Caffeine half - life in women on the pill is around 11 hours , and in smokers it decreases to three .
Recent studies have linked smoking to high caffeine intake , citing this swift reduction in levels as one of the main reasons .
Regulating intake
Daily caffeine intake varies between cultures and countries .
The average intake in the Western world is around 200 mg a day .
An excessive amount is around 500 mg a day , which can cause health problems , such as anxiety .
Different people have different sensitivities : for some even small amounts can cause adverse reactions .
However , most people can control their caffeine consumption , limiting its interference with the natural process that tries to keep us awake .
Caffeine intake is normally highest when alertness is reduced – early in the morning , after prolonged work or after lunch – and is reduced at times when high alertness is undesirable e.g. before going to sleep ) .
Potential ill effects
The effects of caffeine have been exhaustively studied .
Over 2,000 articles have appeared in scientific journals the last two years alone .
Research suggests that sensitive groups , such as children , could experience ill - effects from high - caffeine energy drinks ( though much more research is needed to produce conclusive evidence ) .
However , long - term , habitual consumption could lead to better mental functioning in old age .
Indeed , ingesting significant quantities of caffeine may result in fewer errors , injuries and accidents at work and in leisure time .
Researchers at London 's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published evidence earlier this month that showed caffeine helped improve workers ' memory and concentration .
For people working overnight , consuming caffeine had a similar effect to taking a power nap .
Identical results were seen irrespective of whether those studied drank coffee , an energy drink , took a caffeine pill or ate food with a high caffeine content .
And while the effects of caffeine on reproductive health and the metabolism – obesity , blood pressure , diabetes – have been investigated , there appears to be little evidence that moderate caffeine consumption can cause far - reaching ill effects .
A neat feature of Wireshark is the ability to decrypt SSL traffic .
This post is about why you might want to do it , how to do it , why it works , and how to decrease the chances of other people being able to decrypt your “ secure ” traffic .
Why decrypt SSL ?
Aside from the obvious malicious uses , decrypting SSL has uses such as :
Debugging applications that run over SSL ( HTTP , SMTP , POP3 , IMAP , FTP , etc ) .
Feeding a decrypted traffic stream to an IDS .
Having the best signatures in the world wo n’t help if all your sensors see is encrypted traffic .
Learning about SSL .
What better way to understand something than to take it apart and put it back together again ?
I ’m running the 2012 Brighton Half Marathon in aid of Help for Heroes – please sponsor me if you can by clicking the link to the right :
How to decrypt SSL with Wireshark
Step one – set up an SSL - protected server to use as a testbed
To illustrate the process , we ’re going to use OpenSSL to generate a certificate and act as a web server running HTTP over SSL ( aka HTTPS ) – it ’s quite straightforward .
To begin with , we need to get ourselves a self - signed certificate that our HTTPS server can use .
We can do this with a single command :
openssl req - x509 - nodes - newkey rsa:1024 - keyout testkey.pem - out testcert.pem
OpenSSL will ask you for some input to populate your certificate with ; once you ’ve answered all the questions , the output of this command is two files , testkey.pem ( containing a 1024 bit RSA private key ) and testcert.pem ( containing a self signed certificate ) .
PEM ( Privacy Enhanced Mail ) format files are plaintext , and consist of a BASE64 encoded body with header and footer lines .
You can look at the contents of your key and certificate files in more detail like this :
openssl rsa - in testkey .pem - text - noout ( output here )
openssl x509 - in testcert.pem - text - noout ( output here ; more info here )
We need to perform one tiny tweak to the format of the private key file ( Wireshark will use this later on , and it wo n’t work properly until we ’ve done this ) :
openssl rsa - in testkey.pem - out testkey.pem
Now we ’re ready to fire up our HTTPS server :
openssl s_server - key testkey.pem - cert testcert.pem - WWW - cipher RC4 - SHA - accept 443
The - key and - cert parameters to the s_server command reference the files we ’ve just created , and the - WWW parameter ( this one is case sensitive ) causes OpenSSL to act like a simple web server capable of retrieving files in the current directory ( I created a simple test file called myfile . html for the purposes of the test ) .
The - cipher parameter tells the server to use a particular cipher suite – I ’m using RC4 - SHA because that ’s what ’s used when you go to https://www.google.com.
The RC4 - SHA cipher suite will use RSA keys for authentication and key exchange , 128 - bit RC4 for encryption , and SHA1 for hashing .
Having got our server up and running , we can point a browser at https://myserver/myfile.html and retrieve our test file via SSL ( you can ignore any warnings about the validity of the certificate ) .
If you ’ve got this working , we can move on to …
Step two – capture some traffic with Wireshark
Fire up Wireshark on the server machine , ideally with a capture filter like “ tcp port 443 ” so that we do n’t capture any unnecessary traffic .
Once we ’re capturing , point your browser ( running on a different machine ) at https://myserver/myfile.html and stop the capture once it ’s complete .
Right - click on any of the captured frames and select “ Follow TCP stream ” – a window will pop up that ’s largely full of SSL - protected gobbledegook :
Step three – configuring Wireshark for decryption
Close the TCP Stream window and select Preferences from Wireshark ’s Edit menu .
Expand the “ Protocols ” node in the tree on the left and scroll down to SSL ( in newer versions of Wireshark , you can open the node and type SSL and it will take you there ) .
Once SSL is selected , there ’s an option on the right to enter an “ RSA keys list ” .
Enter something like this :
10.16.8.5,443,http,c:\openssl-win32\bin\testkey.pem
You ’ll need to edit the server IP address and path to testkey.pem as appropriate .
If this has worked , we ’ll notice two things :
Wireshark ’s SSL dissector can look into otherwise encrypted SSL packets and dissect the protocol inside :
We can right - click on any of the captured frames that are listed as SSL or TLS and select “ Follow SSL stream ” :
Nice 🙂
You can read about this step in the Wireshark Wiki here .
Why it works
So , why does this work ?
Our test server , in common with a very large proportion of HTTP - over - SSL webservers , is using RSA to exchange the symmetric session key that will be used by the encryption algorithm ( RC4 in this case ) .
Below is an extract from RFC2246 :
F.1.1.2. RSA key exchange and authentication With RSA , key exchange and server authentication are combined .
The public key may be either contained in the server ’s certificate or may be a temporary RSA key sent in a server key exchange message .
After verifying the server ’s certificate , the client encrypts a pre_master_secret with the server ’s public key .
The server can of course decrypt the pre_master_secret passed to it by the client ( by using the server ’s private key in testkey . pem ) , and subsequently both the client and the server derive the master_secret from it – this is the symmetric key that both parties will use with RC4 to encrypt the session .
But the server is n’t the only one with the private key that corresponds to the public key in the server ’s certificate – Wireshark has it as well .
This means it is able to decrypt the pre_master_secret on its way from the client to the server , and thereafter derive the master_secret needed to decrypt the traffic .
How to prevent decryption
There are at least two methods to approach this :
Method one – Protect the server ’s private key
Protection of one ’s private key is at the core of any system using asymmetric keys .
If your private key is compromised , the attacker can either masquerade as you or they can attempt to carry out decryption as outlined above .
Keys stored in separate files like the ones above are particularly vulnerable to theft if access permissions are not set strictly enough , or if some other vulnerability allows access .
Certain operating systems like Windows and Cisco ’s IOS will try to protect the keys on your behalf by marking them as “ non-exportable ” .
This is meant to mean that the OS wo n’t divulge the private key to anyone under any circumstances , but clearly there comes a point where some software running on the box has to access the key in order to use it .
This simple fact can sometimes be exploited to export non-exportable keys – a practical attack is described in a past edition of Hakin9 magazine .
You can download it for free ; here ’s a quote from the article :
The Operating System ( Windows XP in this case ) does not let you export the private key of a certificate if it is marked as non-exportable .
However , the OS must have access to read the private key in order to use it for signing and encrypting .
If the OS can access the private key and we control the OS , then we can also access the private key .
Method two – Do n’t use RSA for key exchange
As we ’ve seen , the RSA key exchange is susceptible to interception if one is fortunate enough to have the server ’s private key .
By using a flavour of Diffie - Hellman for key exchange instead , we can rule out any chance of an attacker feasibly decrypting our SSL traffic even if they are in possession of the server ’s private key .
With your existing server certificates and keys , run the server like this and get your browser to fetch https://myserver/myfile.html again :
openssl s_server - key testkey.pem - cert testcert.pem - WWW - cipher AES256 - SHA - accept 443
We ’ve changed the cipher from RC4 to 256 bit AES – this step is just to prove that Wireshark can decrypt AES as well as RC4 .
Now , to break the decryption , alter the cipher suite to use Diffie - Hellman instead of RSA for key exhcange :
openssl s_server - key testkey.pem - cert testcert.pem - WWW - cipher DHE-RSA -AES256-SHA - accept 443
If you ’re using a browser other than IE ( my IE8 does n’t seem to support DH with RSA certificates ) , Wireshark is totally unable to decrypt the HTTP traffic , even though it is in possession of the server ’s private key .
A DH key exchange is by design resistant to eavesdropping , although can be susceptible to a man - in - the - middle attack unless both parties identify themselves with certificates .
It ’s also , as we ’ve seen , not universally supported by common SSL clients .
But at least it rules out the possibility of some wiseguy with Wireshark sticking his fins where they ’re not wanted !
Automatic inline SSL decryption
I have made some improvements to the viewssld package , which allows inline SSL decryption on your Snort / Sguil / etc boxes .

Dr. Tom Shanks , from the Department of Physics , and graduate student Utane Sawangwit , both from the University of Durham ( in Durham , England ) , studied data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) .
As the WMAP website states , ' The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) is a NASA Explorer mission that launched June 2001 to make fundamental measurements of cosmology -- the study of the properties of our universe as a whole .
WMAP has been stunningly successful , producing our new Standard Model of Cosmology .
WMAP continues to collect high quality scientific data . ' The WMAP data was taken from analyses of the heat left over from the Big Bang - - what is called remnant heat .
Previous data taken from the WMAP concluded that the universe is made up of 4 % normal matter , 22 % of dark matter , and 74 % of dark energy .
And , astronomers are not in agreement with these percentages .
However , according to the June 11 , 2010 Royal Astronomical Society ( BAS ) article ' Durham astronomers ' doubts about the ' dark side ' ' , the astronomers ' data suggests that , ''¦ dark matter and dark energy are not present after all . '
 The BAS article also contends that based on the research performed by Shanks and Sawangwit : ''¦ the conventional wisdom about the content of the Universe may be wrong , ' which makes ''¦ the standard model of the Universe open to question . '
Page two concludes with comments from the two authors .
The conclusions of their study were published in a letter to the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
Their work also appears in the article '
Beam profile sensitivity of the WMAP CMB power spectrum ' within the ArXiv.org website , and in the UKADS article ' Cross - correlating WMAP5 with 1.5 million LRGs : a new test for the ISW effect .
" Sawangwit is quoted in the RAS article , He states , " If our result is repeated in new surveys of galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere then this could mean real problems for the existence of dark energy .
" The article continues with : ' If the Universe really has no ' dark side ' , it will come as a relief to some theoretical physicists .
Having a model dependent on as yet undetected exotic particles that make up dark matter and the completely mysterious dark energy leaves many scientists feeling uncomfortable .
It also throws up problems for the birth of stars in galaxies , with as much ' feedback ' energy needed to prevent their creation as gravity provides to help them form . ' Dr. Shanks concludes the RAS article with : " Odds are that the standard model with its enigmatic dark energy and dark matter will survive -- but more tests are needed .
The European PLANCK satellite , currently out there collecting more CMB data will provide vital new information and help us answer these fundamental questions about the nature of the Universe we live in .
" Please read the before - mentioned RAS article in more detail for further information on the composition of the Universe .
Is it wrong or right ?
Does dark matter and dark energy exist or not ?
STRATFOR'S George Friedman correctly writes that the Gaza Freedom Flotilla " achieved its strategic mission .
It got Israel to take violent action against it .
In doing so , Israel ran into its own fist . "
To extend and repeat what I wrote yesterday , I think another big point you have to take away from this episode is that employing a bit of violence in your protest , enough to provoke a murderous reaction , is more effective than eschewing violence altogether .
Five of the six ships taken over by Israeli commandos put up no resistance .
They did n't make the news .
The sixth , the Mavi Marmara , had about 600 passengers on board , and of those , 570 or so appear to have stayed below deck as the commandos arrived .
They did n't make the news either .
The other 30 went up on deck .
As is clear in video of the clash released over the past day , they attacked the commandos as they landed one by one , beating them with metal pipes and chairs , trying to strip their body armor and guns , and throwing them over the side of the ship .
This led the commandos to respond with live ammunition , ultimately killing at least nine protestors .
That made the news .
It 's difficult to fathom some of the decisions taken by the Israel Defense Forces in planning the interdiction .
Why board the ship rather than disabling and towing it ?
Why use helicopters to rappel onto the deck one by one , vulnerable to the mob ?
If the intent was to surprise and overwhelm the passengers , why not break off the attempt when it was clear they were not surprised or overwhelmed ?
If the intent was to provoke violence among the protestors and win a propaganda victory , why not board the ship in daylight hours and invite the international media along ?
The shooting that ensued once the soldiers were on board , however , is not hard to understand .
The soldiers were armed with paint - ball guns and pistols , and clearly had come planning on a crowd - control exercise ; a massacre could have been more easily accomplished by firing from the helicopters .
They fired on protestors because they were outnumbered and under attack .
Avital Leibovich , an IDF spokeswoman , has been widely ridiculed for saying the soldiers faced " a lynch " , but that is in fact what the video looks like : soldiers on the ground being beaten with pipes by an angry mob .
But here 's the thing : the violence employed by those 30 protestors is what achieved the Freedom Flotilla 's goals .
No metal pipes , no Israeli shooting .
No Israeli shooting , no dead protestors .
No dead protestors , no recall of the Turkish ambassador or emergency UN Security Council meeting .
The protestors who swung those pipes risked their own ( and others ' ) lives ; some of them are probably dead now .
And , unlike the ones who joined arms below deck and sang " Kumbaya " , they succeeded in weakening the international negotiating position of Israel vis-a - vis the Palestinians , placed the Gaza blockade on the international agenda , and may ultimately topple the Israeli government .
Lesson : if you 're willing to die for your cause , punch a soldier in the face and try to get him to shoot you .
It 'll get you a lot further than stuffing flowers in gun barrels .

That dry , dusty moon overhead ?
Seems it is n't quite as dry as it's long been thought to be .
Although you wo n't find oceans , lakes , or even a shallow puddle on its surface , a team of geologists at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , working with colleagues at the University of Tennessee , has found structurally bound hydroxyl groups ( i.e. , water ) in a mineral in a lunar rock returned to Earth by the Apollo program .
Their findings are detailed in the journal Nature .
" The moon , which has generally been thought to be devoid of hydrous materials , has water , " says John Eiler , the Robert P. Sharp Professor of Geology and professor of geochemistry at Caltech , and a coauthor on the paper .
" The fact that we were able to quantitatively measure significant amounts of water in a lunar mineral is truly surprising , " adds lead author Jeremy Boyce , a visitor in geochemistry at Caltech , and a research scientist at the University of California , Los Angeles .
The team found the water in a calcium phosphate mineral , apatite , within a basalt collected from the moon 's surface by the Apollo 14 astronauts .
To be precise , they did n't find " water " -- the molecule H2O .
Rather , they found hydrogen in the form of a hydroxyl anion , OH - , bound in the apatite mineral lattice .
advertisement
" Hydroxide is a close chemical relative of water , " explains coauthor George Rossman , Caltech 's Eleanor and John R. McMillan Professor of Mineralogy .
" If you heat up the apatite , the hydroxyl ions will ' decompose ' and come out as water . "
The lunar basalt sample in which the hydrogen was found had been collected by the Apollo 14 moon mission in 1971 ; the idea to focus the search for water on this particular sample was promoted by Larry Taylor , a professor at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville , who sent the samples to the Caltech scientists last year .
" The moon has been considered to be bone dry ever since the return of the first Apollo rocks , " Taylor notes .
However , there are lunar volcanic deposits interpreted as having been erupted by expanding vapor .
Although carbon dioxide and sulfur gases have generally been thought to dominate the expanding vapor , recent evidence from the study of the these deposits has suggested that water could also play a role in powering lunar volcanic eruptions .
The discovery of hydroxyl in apatite from lunar volcanic rocks is consistent with this suggestion .
The idea of looking for water in lunar apatite is n't new , Boyce notes .
" Charles B. Sclar and Jon F. Bauer , geoscientists at Lehigh University , first noted that something was missing from the results of chemical analyses of apatite in 1975 , " he says .
" Now , 35 years later , we have quantitative measurements -- and it turns out , they were right .
The missing piece was OH . "
The Caltech team analyzed the lunar apatite for hydrogen , sulfur , and chlorine using an ion microprobe , which is capable of analyzing mineral grains with sizes much smaller than the width of a human hair .
This instrument fires a focused beam of high - energy ions at the sample surface , sputtering away target atoms that are collected and then analyzed in a mass spectrometer .
Ion microprobe measurements demonstrated that in terms of its hydrogen , sulfur , and chlorine contents , the lunar apatite in this sample is indistinguishable from apatites from terrestrial volcanic rocks .

" We realized that the moon and the earth were able to make the same kind of apatite , relatively rich in hydrogen , sulfur and chlorine , " Boyce says .
Does that mean the moon is as awash in water as our planet ?
Almost certainly not , say the scientists .
In fact , the amount of water the moon must contain to be capable of generating hydroxyl - rich apatite remains an open question .
After all , it 's hard to scale up the amount of water found in the apatite -- 1600 parts per million or 0.16 percent by weight -- to determine just how much water there is on the lunar landscape .
The apatite that was studied is not abundant , and is formed by processes that tend to concentrate hydrogen to much higher levels than are present in its host rocks or the moon as a whole .
" There 's more water on the moon than people suspected , " says Eiler , " but there 's still likely orders of magnitude less than there is on the earth . "
Nonetheless , the finding is significant for what it implies about our moon 's composition and its history .
" These findings tell us that the geological processes on the moon are capable of creating at least one hydrous mineral , " Eiler says .
" Recent spectroscopic observations of the moon showed that hydrogen is present on its surface , maybe even as water ice .
But that could be a thin veneer , possibly hydrogen brought to the moon 's surface by comets or solar wind .
Our findings show that hydrogen is also part of the rock record of the moon , and has been since early in its history . "
Beyond that , Eiler continues , " it 's all a great big question mark .
We do n't know whether these were igneous processes , " -- in which rocks are formed by solidification of molten lava -- " or metamorphic " -- in which minerals re-crystallize or change in change in chemistry without melting .
" They 're both on the table as possible players . "
In addition to Boyce , Eiler , Rossman , and Taylor , other authors on the Nature paper , " Lunar apatite with terrestrial volatile abundances , " include Research Assistant Professor Yang Liu from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville ; Edward Stolper , Caltech 's William E. Leonhard Professor of Geology , and Yunbin Guan , manager of Caltech 's ion microprobe laboratory .
Their work was funded by grants from NASA 's Cosmochemistry Program , the National Science Foundation , and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation .
Class of 2010 told to consider flipping burgers or shelf stacking to build skills as they also compete with last year 's graduates
Graduates are facing the most intense scramble in a decade to get a job this summer , as a poll of employers reveals the number of applications for each vacancy has surged to nearly 70 while the number of available positions is predicted to fall by nearly 7 % .
The class of 2010 have been told to consider flipping burgers or stacking shelves when they leave university as leading firms in investment banking , law and IT are due to cut graduate jobs this year .
Competition in the jobs market is fiercer now than for the first " post - crunch " generation of students , last year , when there were 48 applications for each vacancy .
The number of applicants chasing each job is so high that nearly 78 % of employers are insisting on a 2.1 degree , rendering a 2.2 marginal and effectively ruling out any graduates with a third , according to the survey published tomorrow .
The Association of Graduate Recruiters polled over 200 firms including Cadbury , Marks & Spencer , JP Morgan and Vodafone and found the number of applications per vacancy had risen to 68.8 this year , the highest figure recorded .
In the most hotly contested sector – makers of fast - moving consumer goods such as food , confectionery and cosmetics – there were 205 applications for each job .
Carl Gilleard , the association 's chief executive , said graduates needed to be more flexible in their career choices .
" They need both short - term and long - term career goals because you 're graduating in a very tough climate .
It does n't mean you should be put off applying for the profession of your choice .
" Any employment is better than no employment [ even ] if it 's about flipping burgers or stacking shelves rather than being sat at home feeling sorry for yourself and vegetating .
There are lots of other skills required and valued , like people skills : you could be on a counter in a store .
It 's all about building up your skills base .
The big fear is that some people just drop off the bottom of the scale – because confidence goes very rapidly . "
Gilleard warned that employers were raising the bar on degrees , and graduates with a 2.2 or worse faced being filtered out by automated applications .
" There are dangers in that .
You can miss out on some very good candidates . "
He said it was too early to say whether this trend would lead to graduates with a 2.2 being excluded from the job market altogether .
In 2008 , when the economy was buoyant , just 57 % of employers insisted on a 2.1 or higher .
Last year that rose to 60 % .
" We need to wait for 2011 to see if this is a trend , " he said .
Graduate salaries are frozen at an average of £ 25,000 , the first time in the survey 's history that starting salaries have remained stagnant for two consecutive years .
But there is some positive news ; the survey noted a revival in banking , the insurance sector and accountancy where vacancies were predicted to rise this year .
Apprenticeships , which are likely to expand under the coalition government , might provide an alternative career path for some students , the survey noted .
Gilleard acknowledged there was snobbery about apprenticeships , but said the children of the middle classes should not assume they had to get a degree to succeed .
" I think many middle class parents are actually questioning , is this [ a degree ] the right route that my son or daughter should follow .
" Too many young people go [ to university ] because it 's expected of them , and they do n't think it through from a personal perspective – what will it be like , apart from having a good time . "
As applications for university places continue to soar , the government has urged universities to publish statements revealing the help they offer to get their students ready for work .
Responding to the survey , the minister for universities , David Willetts , said : " The job market remains challenging for new graduates , as it does for others .
" But a degree is still a good investment in the long term , and graduates have a key role to play in helping Britain out of the recession .
We are committed to making it easier for current graduates to find work .
That is why I have just asked all universities to provide statements on employability for their students . "
The president of the National Union of Students , Aaron Porter , urged the government to invest in creating jobs and training : " We are concerned that the savage cuts to the public sector will create further unemployment , and will make the lives of graduates tougher in an already difficult jobs market . "
For the fourth year in a row , demand for university places has hit a record high .
At the end of May , there were over 640,000 applications for places this autumn – an increase of nearly 14 % on last year .
As universities face an increased challenge in selecting the best candidates , there is some scepticism about the new A* grade , being awarded for the first time this summer in an attempt to distinguish the cream of the crop .
Fewer than a third of university admissions officers believe the A* grade would be crucial in selecting the most able students , according to a separate survey published today .
While over half of the 40 admissions officers surveyed believed grade inflation made it harder to pick the best candidates , fewer than a third thought the A* was " essential " .
The survey was commissioned by a network of international schools which favour a rival qualification , the international baccalaureate .
Nearly 100,000 marijuana plants were found growing at four illegal farms in the San Bernardino National Forest , authorities said Tuesday .
Investigators on Thursday found almost 59,000 marijuana plants growing in a canyon above Arrowhead Springs and more than 5,000 plants in a canyon near Rim Forest .
The next day , they discovered more than 32,000 plants in Lytle Creek Canyon and 3,000 in the Miller Narrows area .
No arrests have been made , said officials with the San Bernardino County Sheriff 's Department and the U.S. Forest Service .

More than 22,620 Texas secondary students who stopped showing up for class in 2008 were excluded from the state 's dropout statistics because administrators said they were being home - schooled , according to Texas Education Agency figures .
But that 's where the scrutiny of this growing population seems to end , leaving some experts convinced that schools are disguising thousands of middle and high school dropouts in this hands - off category .
While home - schooling 's popularity has increased , the rate of growth concentrated in Texas ' high school population is off the chart :
It 's nearly tripled in the last decade , including a 24 percent jump in a single year .
“ That 's just ridiculous , ” said Brian D. Ray , founder of the National Home Education Research Institute .
“ It does n't sound very believable . ”
Texas ' lax documentation and hands - off practices make it impossible to know how many of these students are actually being taught at home .
It also opens the door to abuse of the designation , which could help school districts avoid the sanctions that come with high dropout rates , experts said .
“ This is just a bad practice on the part of these schools , ” said Robert Sanborn , CEO of Children at Risk , a Houston advocacy group .
“ Schools are beginning to use the home - schooling designation as a way to encourage students to leave or indeed for some school districts to looks like they have fewer dropouts . ”
In some states , parents are required to file sworn affidavits when they withdraw their children .
Many states also require families to submit curriculum , attendance records or test scores when they opt to home - school .
In Texas , the Texas Education Agency requires a “ signed statement from a parent / guardian or qualified student ” or “ documentation of an oral statement by the parent / guardian or qualified student made within 10 days of the time the student quits attending school in the district , signed and dated by an authorized representative of the district ” noting that they intend to attend home - school .
Even that standard is n't met in many cases .
A 2008 audit of one of the Houston - area districts with the highest number of home - schooled high schoolers — Clear Creek ISD — concluded that only 167 of the 276 students had sufficient documentation from parents to meet the state 's definition .
Information was lacking in the other 109 cases .
School forms revised
“ Clear Creek ISD has reviewed its withdrawal process and identified areas of improvement , ” spokeswoman Elaina Polsen said .
The TEA also reviewed withdrawal rates in Cypress - Fairbanks ISD , where some high schools reported as many as 80 home - school withdrawals in a single year .
That audit also revealed insufficient evidence in many cases , Cy - Fair spokeswoman Kelli Durham said .
“ What was determined was a problem systemically , ” she said .
Instead of asking parents to fill in the blank on why their child is leaving , the form now asks parents to check a specific box .
The reasons more closely align with the state 's codes , leaving less up to the interpretation of school employees , she said .
TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson said electronic monitoring is triggered when districts report unusually high numbers in a certain category .
She said she did n't know of any district that had been sanctioned for abusing the home - school withdrawal code .
Other districts defy the typical demographics of home - schooling .
The U.S. Department of Education found that roughly 77 percent of home - schoolers are Anglo .
Most are also the children of college educated , middle class parents .
More than one - third of parents cited providing “ religious or moral instruction ” as the primary reason for their decision to home - school .
Alief 's 4,150 - student Elsik High — a school where 95 percent of students are minorities and 70 percent are poor — had 65 students leave in 2008 to be home - schooled .
Houston CAN
Academy , a public charter school , reports that 93 of its mostly poor , minority students left to be home - schooled .
That 's roughly 20 percent of the school 's enrollment .
Vulnerable to fraud
Yet , a review of Houston - area figures shows that home - school withdrawal rates remain minuscule at middle schools in the region , raising a red flag among experts .
If withdrawals were increasing for religious reasons , that should be apparent across grade levels , Ray said .
The Texas Home School Coalition estimates that more than 300,000 Texas children are home - schooled , with an annual growth rate around 7 percent since the mid-1990s .
Leaders also estimate that between 2 and 3 percent of all Texas students are educated at home .
Once families withdraw from public school , there is no follow - up .
“ It 's parental choice , ” the TEA 's Culbertson said .
Even the state 's biggest proponents of home - schooling admit that the structure is vulnerable to fraud .
“ That seems to me to be a loophole , ” said Tim Lambert , president of the Texas Home School Coalition .
The problem is not among legitimate home - schoolers , but among public school officials trying to run off problem students , Lambert said .
“ We call it dumping , ” he explained .
Some advocates complain that Spanish - speaking and special - needs student are especially vulnerable to being pushed out of public schools .
Resistance to controls
But advocates adamantly resist any efforts to tighten regulations on home - schoolers .
The best answer , Lambert said , is to tighten the regulations on public schools who mark these so - called “ leaver codes ” when students withdraw .
Sen . Florence Shapiro , R - Plano , and HISD Superintendent Terry Grier are among the officials who were unaware of the large increase in home - schooling withdraws from Texas high schools .
They agree that the figures need to be scrutinized .
“ Home - schooling is something I 'm 100 percent behind , ” Shapiro said .
“ When it becomes a scapegoat for dropouts , when it becomes a bucket to not have to list this type of student , I 'm absolutely adverse to that .
I think it 's wrong . ”
Shapiro , chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee , said she plans to delve deeper into the figures .

Image caption Chalk has now been placed over the purple paint
Vandals have targeted the ancient Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire by spraying part of it purple .
Officers from Thames Valley Police were called to the 3,000 - year - old chalk monument at about 2200 BST on Thursday .
They found the head and eye of the horse had been sprayed with purple paint .
A banner that read " fathers 4 justice stop the secret family courts " was recovered from the scene .
New Fathers 4 Justice and Real Fathers for Justice both denied responsibility .
Police and members of the National Trust have been working to re-chalk the monument .
They should 've picked a legitimate target like a court house not an historic monument which should be protected for our children Real Fathers for Justice spokesman
Sgt Steve Clark said : " The monument has been pretty much restored now and is back to how it should look .
" This was a mindless act of criminal damage on an ancient monument and I would urge anyone with information about the incident to come forward and speak to us as soon as possible . "
Richard Henderson , the National Trust 's general manager for Oxfordshire , said : " We are appalled by this act of mindless vandalism to one of the country 's most famous ancient monuments .
" It is particularly sad as only last weekend members of the public helped re-chalk the horse as part of a traditional community volunteering event . "
Image caption Volunteers had only re-chalked the horse a week ago
The White Horse at Uffington is the oldest dated chalk figure in the country and forms part of a landscape of ancient sites .
The original group called Fathers 4 Justice was closed down in 2008 .
A group called the New Fathers 4 Justice formed shortly afterwards .
A spokesman for the New Fathers 4 Justice , calling himself Captain Equality , denied any responsibility for the attack , saying : " Fathers have started using the name for their own protest but we do n't condone vandalism , it 's not our style . "
A rival group calling themselves the Real Fathers for Justice who claim to have been operating since 2005 , also distanced themselves from the stunt .
A spokesman said : " They should 've picked a legitimate target like a courthouse not an historic monument which should be protected for our children .
" This is criminal damage and nothing 's going to be achieved by that . "
At first glance , last year ’s 10 gigawatts of wind installations in the U.S. make it seem like the market is in good shape .
But those numbers do n’t tell the real story of the difficulties the wind industry is facing .
In 2009 , financing was the big issue for the industry .
There simply were n’t enough financial players healthy enough to put money into projects .
The grant program created under the stimulus package helped move a number of projects forward , beefing up the installation figures for last year .
But today , financing is n’t necessarily the main problem ; it ’s demand .
Due to a number of factors exacerbated by the dismal economy , some developers are simply unable to take advantage of the stimulus dollars available .
Only 540 MW of wind capacity were installed in the first quarter of 2010 , down from 2,800 MW in the first quarter of 2009 .
“ Demand for wind is simply not at the level where a lot of these companies that are making these investments woud like it to be , ” says Matt Kaplan , a senior analyst with IHS Emerging Energy Research .
The first major factor in the slowdown is the drop in electricity consumption .
With lower demand for electricity , utilities do n’t have to procure as much renewable electricity under their state targets .
This has impacted a number of project owners who sell power on the competitive wholesale market .
Secondly , natural gas prices have fallen about 65 % since 2008 , from $ 11 per MMBtu to around $ 4 per MMBtu .
Given that wind competes directly with natural gas , this makes the resource much less competitive .
And with more shale gas reserves being tapped in the U.S. , prices will stay low in the coming years .
Finally , the lack of a long - term national target for renewables in the U.S. is causing major component and turbine manufacturers to reconsider investments in the country .
As a result , job growth in manufacturing will likely fall flat again this year .
The reduction in demand for wind means that prices for turbines are coming down .
Utilities are watching the equipment prices and waiting to sign power purchase agreements , wondering if prices will continue to fall .
Meanwhile , more competition in manufacturing – particularly from asian players – is forcing turbine suppliers to focus heavily on differentiating their products in an increasingly crowded field .
“ It ’s a tough market out there …[ but ] we keep focusing on technological innovation , ” says Mike Revak , director of Siemens ’ American wind division .
“ Clearly we do n’t sit idly by …staying on the cutting edge of technology gives us a competitive position . ”
Revak says that Siemens wo n’t see installations of its turbines drop much in the U.S. this year .
But if the demand picture stays they way it is today , sales will certainly be impacted into 2011 .
Revak believes that a federal renewable energy target could not only increase demand for wind , it could also help make the industry more competitive during challenging times like today .
“ Without that that long term policy , you ca n’t drive down the cost of wind .
You ca n’t have the innovation along the supply chain , ” says Revak .
“ With that support we can make the investments and improvements to make wind more competitive with all energy . ”
So what does all this mean for the wind industry this year ?
Matt Kaplan of IHS Emerging Energy Research predicts a 40 % to 60 % drop in installations .
Things could potentially turn around over the next 12 - 18 months .
With a long - term national target in place and an increase in demand for electricity , wind might be able to make a good comeback .
Clearly , despite the short - term retraction , many of the largest companies in the world are still very bullish on wind .
And some executives , like Sonia Bonfiglioli , CEO of the leading components manufacturer Bonfiglioli , believe that the downturn will eventually be a good thing for the industry .
“ Renewables faced a lot of speculation … from this crisis the real businesses will survive .
I ’m convinced that this will move toward a real industry with competent businesses and people , and no doubt it will grow , ” says Bonfigioli .
The big unknown is exactly when the growth will pick back up .
It ’s still uncertain how quickly the industry can rebound , given all the factors working against it .
To hear more analysis on this issue , listen to this week ’s podcast linked above .
For Tennessee ( PDF ) , the report found that the coal industry contributed just over $ 1 million to the state budget - less than one - tenth of one percent of the state 's total revenue in 2009 .
That benefit was overwhelmed by the costs imposed by the industry , including state subsidies , regulation , road repair and mine reclamation costs .
The bottom line was an approximate net economic loss of $ 3 million for the people of Tennessee in 2009 .
Though coal brings in a bigger percentage of state revenues in West Virginia ( PDF ) , the end result matches that of Tennessee ; the $ 600.7 million in total revenues coal brought to West Virginia was about $ 97.5 million less than it cost the state to support the industry .
" It should be no surprise - coal is not king in the West Virginia economy , even though our decision makers act as if it is , " said Jim Sconyers , chair of the West Virginia Sierra Club .
" It is a total outrage that the long - suffering West Virginia taxpayer is forced to pay millions of dollars so the filthy rich coal companies can destroy our roads , mountains and communities . "
And so we learn that even beyond the human and environmental health damage the coal industry does , the economic damage is there as well .
More reports like these are coming , and one has already been done on Kentucky .
( PDF )
We know Tennessee and West Virginia , and all the other states where Big Coal is trying to be king , can do better with clean energy .
We do n't need to sacrifice our health , our economy and our environment to power our nation .
It seems that Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) would agree , perpetual war is making you poor .
To begin rectifying the situation , he ’s joined with Congressman Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) in co-sponsoring the “ War is Making You Poor Act , ” which would limit defense spending to $ 548.9 billion : the exact figure alloted in the fiscal year 2011 budget .
The act also seeks to utilize an additional $ 159.3 billion set aside for “ discretionary ” operations abroad to relieve the full federal income tax burden on every American ’s first $ 35,000 earned per year , or up to $ 70,000 per year for married couples .

According to Detroit publication MLive , Conyers , who chairs the powerful House Committee on the Judiciary , is adding his name to the roster of support .
“ I believe that the thing we need to do is to take that $ 159 billion that the President has set aside Ã¢â‚¬â€œ weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not saying he has to stop the war , weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not giving a cut - off date for the war Ã¢â‚¬â€œ weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re simply saying you need to fund that out of the base budget of $ 549 billion , ” Grayson said of his bill .
“ And we take 90 percent of that and give it back to the American people . ”
He ’s also launched an online petition in support of the “ War is Making You Poor Act ” .
At time of this writing it had accrued over 45,000 signatures .
Surprisingly enough , even some conservatives see the legislation as a potential positive .
“ Each troop we send to Afghanistan costs the public $ 1 million per year , ” National Review‘s E.D. Kain noted .
“ That Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s $ 1 million siphoned out of the U.S. economy and shipped overseas to the mountains of Afghanistan and the Iraqi deserts .
As Veronique de Rugy pointed out in 2008 , for years many of these costs were hidden , not even included in the PentagonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s defense budget .
This obscures not only the real cost of war , but the costs of all the extraneous programs our tax dollars end up going toward in the name of national defense . ”

He goes on to call Grayson ’s bill “ a good start ” toward slashing America ’s massively bloated defense budget .
“ The costs of the war have been rendered invisible , ” Grayson said on the floor of the House .
“ There ’s no draft .
Instead , we take the most vulnerable elements of our population , and give them a choice between unemployment and missile fodder .
Government deficits conceal the need to pay in cash for the war .
“ We put the cost of both guns and butter on our Chinese credit card .
In fact , we do n’t even put these wars on budget ; they are still passed using ’ emergency supplemental ’.
A nine - year ’ emergency ’ .

“ Let ’s show Congress the cost of these wars is too much for us . ”
The bill , H.R. 5353 , is currently before the House Armed Services and Ways and Means committees .

For the last two years , the Shanghai Commission for the Management of Language Use has been trying to clean up English - language signs and menus to rid them of their malapropisms , like these examples .
Bring Hunter of Africa ’s Witch Children to Justice !
As if Africans do n’t already face enough problems , insane religious zealotry is compounding the suffering of the most vulnerable .
In the Congo , the Central African Republic and Sudan are between 1 - 4 million Azande .
This tribe is heavily superstitious even by African standards .
In their world view there is no such thing as chance , “ acts of God ” or even of a devil doing mischief .
Instead failing crops , bad weather , illnesses and death are blamed on practitioners of witchcraft .
The Azande feel that people are born with a ( heritable ) substance in the belly ( some also claim the elbow ) that can magically cause bad stuff to happen to people .
This “ black magic ” is just a part of daily life .
People may not even realize they are inadvertently letting their negative vibes harm others .
“ Sorry old chap , but I was only trying to fart !
I did n’t mean to kill your chicken ! ”
So why is this problematic ?
By some estimates as many as 40 % of cases in court are prosecutions for witchcraft .
As in early Salem and in silly Monty Python films , merely an accusation can land a person in court .
Just as in other unenlightened times in history , children and marginalized members of society - in this case pygmies - are often the ones blamed for hexing their neighbors or changing into an animal form .
Because the laws actually give credence to the accusers , even lawyers s believe in shapeshifting and death curses .
How do you know she is a witch ?
She turned me into a newt !
A person not wanting to appear guilty of the charges must avoid nervousness at the trial .
Fidgeting or looking at the wrong person at the wrong time might give a judge enough reason to presume guilt .
Since there is n’t usually any evidence , the judge becomes the final arbiter of guilt , based on his own opinion of whether or not the defendant “ looks guilty . ”
The actual penal code for the “ practice of charlatanism and sorcery ” allows for a fine and up to ten years in prison .
For once being desperately poor is a good thing , for the town ca n’t afford to maintain a jail , thus giving the accused a bit of a break .
There is no rest for the wicked in other parts of Africa .
Take superstition and add a healthy dose of Christian fundamentalist zeal , mix it with a brush of insanity and sprinkle with power and you have Nigerian witch hunter Helen Ukpabio .
As inane and backward as the penal code of the Azande sounds , by making witchcraft illegal there is a civil recourse .
Even a stint in jail and a heavy fine is better fate than what awaits a witch discovered by Helen Ukpabio .
The ministry actively seeks confessions from people , encouraging parents to find their own children guilty .
After branding a person as a witch , Ukpabio “ delivers ” them from their sins .
By her own confession the renegade evangelist has “ delivered ” over 20,000 witches in this way .
Nwanaokwo Edet , 9 , whose father forced him to drink acid days after the family ’s pastor denounced the child as a witch , lying in a hospital bed in Akwa Ibom , Nigeria .
He died from his injuries one month later .
Ukpabio has garnered fame and notoriety for herself by advocating the torture and abuse of children .
Her book , Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft condemns children to this fate by claiming that toddlers who cry in the night , or are “ always feverish with deteriorating health , he or she is a servant of Satan . ”
Her instructional film End of the Wicked , shows how the devil captures children ’s souls .
If the acting by the “ devil ” seems a bit over the top , the film has seen some success in persuading some parents that kids with genuine health problems or typical childhood behaviors are possessed .
Does it occur to this insane woman that with malaria endemic and hunger rampant in most of Africa , delirium and ill health are a way of life for many poor children ?
If it does , it takes a back seat to her lust for glory and acclaim .
And of course , the money .
Getting an exorcism is n’t cheap .
The documentary Saving Africa ’s Witch Children follows Gary Foxcroft , founder of Stepping Stones Nigeria , a charity for children displaced and disfigured by the extreme tactics of the witch hunters .
These poor kids , stigmatized by Ukpabio as witches , are subjected to horrific “ exorcisms ”
They are
splashed with acid , buried alive , dipped in fire — or abandoned roadside , cast out of their villages because some itinerant preacher called them possessed .
After the documentary was released , international attention focused on Nigeria .
To their credit , other Nigerian Christian organizations denounced the witch hunters , “ condemning the falsehood , exploitation and inherent deception in modern - day Nigerian Pentecostalism which sees the gospel used to deceive the gullible . ”
The legal system seems just as uninterested in prosecuting her as it does prosecuting pedophile priests .
Ms Ukpabio could improve her reputation through re-distributing all of the wealth amassed through this cruelty to children and aiding the societies damaged by her actions .
Instead she uses her wealth and influence to counter - sue - everyone from the government trying to outlaw witch hunts to documentary filmmaker Gary Foxcroft , labeling her opponents as racist , or “ anti-African ” .
She claims that the Children ’s Rights and Rehabilitation Network , the school for abandoned children run by Sam Itauma and featured in Foxcroft ’s documentary , is “ a 419 scam “ .
Although one “ Bishop ” , Sunday Ulup - Ayawas was arrested and charged with murder after confessing to killing over 100 accused child witches , Helen Ukpabio remains free and unrepentant , never attempting to ameliorate the plight of stigmatised children .
Even more galling is that American churches continue to support her mission !
She was in Houston speaking at a revival for Glorious Praise Ministries just last week .
Bad enough that America ignore the pleas of a starving nation , but to aid and abet a monster like Helen Ukpabio in her misguided mission is criminal .
No person or group has the right to compromise the future and comfort of innocent children on the platform of some obscene religious doctrine .

After I graduated from high school , I was making good money painting houses , my girlfriend was cool with a rockin ' little bod , and I partied almost every night .
But after a year or so , I started to wonder : " If someone wrote a book about my life , would anyone want to read it ? "

I wanted discipline and training , but I did n't want to give up my hard - rockin ' lifestyle .
Where , I wondered , could that elusive combination of rigid authoritarian structure and unbridled monster power chords be found ?
Then I saw a commercial for the U.S. Navy .
That 's when I knew what to do with my life .
And guess what ?
The U.S. Navy fucking kicks ass , dude .
From the time we 're awoken at 06:00 by System Of A Down or Disturbed till we drift off to sleep to an instrumental guitar version of " Taps " performed by Zakk Wylde , it 's a nonstop rock block .

How do I even begin to describe the constant barrage of adrenaline - fueled , over - the - top kick - assitude that is the U.S. Navy ?
Every day is like a rapid - fire montage sequence of high - tech action and thrill - ride imagery that makes your fuckin ' head spin .
One minute , I 'm crouched on the deck of an aircraft carrier barking something into a helmet - mounted headset that you can't even friggin ' hear because the music 's so loud .
Next , I 'm dashing through the Mojave under the weight of a large pack and jumping out of a helicopter into the ocean wearing some kind of James Bond one - man submersible scuba suit .
If I 'm not roarin ' down the high seas with the wind in my hair and 800 pounds of rad-ass Batman shit strapped to my uniform , I 'm standing at perfect attention in my dress whites , fucking whippin ' a sword around like I 'm a goddamn samurai master .

Even basic training was an edgy , quick - cut mosaic of running and climbing and shooting and learning and Pantera riffs .
There was this rad obstacle course we did twice a day carrying sandbags , and when you did it , it was like you could feel yourself morph from an average guy into one of the sword - carrying knights of old .
I may not have slain actual dragons , but when I came out , I looked just like Iron Man , and my father was very impressed with the changes that he saw in me .
Serving aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Linkin Park , which is just about the most hardcore carrier in the fleet , I spend the morning working on high - tech projects like blowing up long - range sea targets with giant artillery guns .
In the afternoon , it 's firing missiles , Tomahawks , and torpedoes into the sea .
And my nights ?
Getting valuable intel off our way - advanced radar screens .
That 's when I do n't dart off in a super - fast motorboat in full frogman gear to train in underwater demolition and special ops , emerging from the water at sunrise .

But there 's also these quieter moments that really put things in perspective .
Usually , it 's when me and my multiethnic buddies are coming back from a long , kick - ass day , and we experience an unspoken moment of camaraderie .
The music shifts to a power ballad , and we take a minute before the American flag to gaze in silence at the epic sunset .
When I glance at my friends ' chiseled faces and see their quiet pride and masculinity , I realize that I made the right choice .
Sometimes , we 're joined by a flying eagle , but the eagle is n't a pet of ours , it just kind of appears superimposed behind us like 50 feet tall when things get patriotic .
I gotta admit , though , as much as the Navy rocks out with its cocks out , I 'm not sure if I 'll be making a permanent career out of it .
Sometimes , when I 'm flying around in my F / A - 18 Hornet , I imagine myself morphing out of my action gear into a three - piece suit heading up my own Fortune 500 company which I built on the skills the Navy taught me .

When I get shore leave and go home to visit my family and old friends , they can't hide their pride .
As the background music slows to a stately march , my normally hard - as - nails dad salutes me and shakes my hand with tears in his eyes .
I 'm sure glad that I did n't join the Marines .
All those guys seem to do is climb sheer mountain faces with their bare hands .

Finally , we answer what is for many the most burning question of all :
What ’s for dessert ?
The Big Peach

For all the Underground Gourmet knows , there may be more fried - chicken specialists in Brooklyn these days than there are in the entire South .
Among the newcomers , Peaches HotHouse ( 415 Tompkins Ave. , at Hancock St. , Bedford - Stuyvesant ; 718-483-9111 ) is where we go whenever we want to breathe fire through our nostrils and watch steam shoot out each other ’s ears , the inevitable consequence , we discovered , of requesting the Nashville - style fried chicken extra hot ( $ 12 ) .
Cayenne pepper is the purported culprit , but as your lips numb , your tongue swells , and even your kneecaps begin to sweat , you wonder whether this fiendish concoction has been brined in rocket fuel and dry - rubbed with gunpowder .
We ’re also quite partial to the fried chicken and biscuits at the divey Commodore ( 366 Metropolitan Ave. , at Havemeyer St. , Williamsburg ; 718-218-7632 ) , where it comes three crisp and juicy thighs to a plate ( $ 9 ) .
But the dish not to miss here is a grilled pimiento - and - poblano sandwich called an “ adult cheese ” ( $ 6 ) , crusty and tangy and perhaps more tastefully mature than the clientele .
Of course , the big news in deep - fried poultry this year was the long - awaited return of Pies - N - Thighs ( 166 S. 4th St. , at Driggs St. , Williamsburg ; 347-529-6090 ) , a rural - hip country kitchen keeping the bewhiskered and plaid - clad locals afloat in crisp - skinned , moist - fleshed chicken , which we found most enticing tucked jauntily into a world - class biscuit ( $ 5 ) .
In an informal , if not piggy , state - fair - style sampling of all the endearingly homespun pies , the silky - textured banana - cream gets the Underground Gourmet blue ribbon .
The country - fried crawl continues apace to Carroll Gardens , where you might want to wipe the chicken grease off your hands and mouth before entering the spiffy premises of Seersucker , the self - professed home for “ cleaned - up ” southern cooking ( 329 Smith St. , nr. President St. ; 718-422-0444 ) .
Accordingly , the best dish there is eaten with silverware instead of your fingers , and it ’s a luscious chicken and dumplings at that : a bowl of tender meat and soul - soothing dumplings , crowned with a crunchy tuile of chicken skin ( $ 18 ) .
We also quite liked the snack tray ( $ 15 ) , a church - picnic - style spread of deviled eggs , country - ham pâté , pickled okra , and pimiento cheese .
Wash it down with some sweet tea or , even better , a glass of Red Hook rosé on tap .
Some New Noodles

Noodle eating continues to be all the rage among the cheap - eats populace , and the recent expansion of Flushing favorite Xi’an Famous Foods to two Manhattan locations has only increased the ecstatic slurping sounds you hear around town .
Xi’an ’s Savory Lamb Cumin Hand - Pulled Noodles ( $ 5 ) , dressed with spoonfuls of several invigorating sauces plus red-chile oil , tahini , and a mingling of cumin - laced bits of lamb , is the Underground Gourmet ’s all - time favorite budget noodle dish , but the equally lip - smacking Liang Pi Noodles , served cold with luscious , spongy , Wheat Thins–size squares of sauce - soaking gluten ( $ 4 ) , are the way to go in hot weather .
Both pretty much define the meaning of the term al dente ; they ’re rough and ragged , chewy but tender , with a profoundly satisfying mouthfeel .
Note that the Chinatown branch ( 88 E. Broadway , nr. Forsyth St. ; no phone ) is standing room only , accommodating three hunched slurpers max , while the brand - new and comparatively palatial East Village outpost ( 81 St. Marks Pl. , nr. First Ave. ; no phone ) has about ten seats .
Judging by the way the neighborhood has pounced on this welcome arrival , though , your chances of scoring one are n’t so good .
Seats are also at a premium up in Hell ’s Kitchen at the new Totto Ramen ( 366 W. 52nd St. , nr. Ninth Ave. ; 212-582-0052 ) , a spare ten - stool soup kitchen from the team behind the excellent Yakitori Totto and Soba Totto .
( Its instant popularity has induced management to convert another of its holdings , Yakitori Torys , into Hide - Chan Ramen [ 248 E. 52nd St. , nr. Second Ave. ; 212-813-1800 ] , specializing in tonkotsu , or pork - bone , broth . )
The popular choice among the starchy - food enthusiasts here is the Totto Spicy Ramen , made with a deeply flavored chicken - based broth and some good , springy noodles delivered daily from Soba Totto across town .
Ramen is like kryptonite to the hapless vegetarian , with its super - porky broths and wheels of processed pink fish cakes known as narutomaki , but the no-judgment menu here includes a kelp - based broth , in regular and spicy models , that the omnivorous U.G. heartily endorses .
Tortilla Town
Photo : Julia Gillard
The best thing to happen to New York Mexican lately has been Tortilleria Nixtamal , a Corona , Queens , microfactory ( and great taquería in its own right ) , whose tender , fresh tortillas , made from lime - treated corn ground into masa , have been proliferating on menus around town .
The second best ?
Cascabel ’s chorizo taco , a smoky , crumbly , boldly seasoned gem ( $ 8.50 for two ; 1542 Second Ave. , nr. 80th St. ; 212-717-7800 ) .
But back to those tortillas : Look for them to appear soon at both Tacombi , the vintage VW bus parked in a Nolita garage where chef - partner Aarón Sanchez is spending the summer catering special events and feeding Facebook fans , and Casa Mezcal , the Lower East Side mezcalería whose kitchen is still in Con Ed limbo .
Until then , get your fix at Dos Toros ( 137 Fourth Ave. , nr. 13th St. ; 212-677-7300 ) , a counter - service joint with Bay Area aspirations , lively homemade salsas , and flavorful flap - steak carne asada tacos ( $ 3.67 ) .
You ’ll also find Nixtamal ’s tortillas at the Loading Dock in downtown Brooklyn ( 170 Tillary St. , nr. Gold St. ; 646-355-7518 ) , a raw , rustic space where one Choncho ( a.k.a. Forrest Cole ) has made a name for himself with the deep - fried , deftly garnished fish tacos he also sells at Brooklyn Flea ( $ 5 ) .
In the East Village , Nixtamal also distributes to La Lucha ( 147 Ave. A , nr. 9th St. ; 212-260-0235 ) , the Mexican - wrestling - themed taquería modeled after its ilk in Mexico City , where everyone apparently goes to feed before the big bouts .
Somehow , even without the benefit of Corona - crafted tortillas , several other worthy Mexican menus have made their debuts .
Hecho en Dumbo , for one , abandoned its Brooklyn birthplace for a new home in Noho ( 354 Bowery , nr. Great Jones St. ; 212-937-4245 ) , where the tortillas , incidentally , are made in - house from dried - corn masa ( the next best thing ) , and where the cosmopolitan Mexico City–style cuisine shines in dishes like chile - dusted jícama - and - pineapple salad with watercress dressing ( $ 6 ) .
Sue Torres , the new consulting chef at the Rusty Knot ( 425 West St. , at 11th St. ; 212-645-5668 ) , makes her own masa for snacks like chalupas topped with chicken or vegetables ( $ 5 ) .
They ’re great bar food , and so is the happy - hour special at Fonda ( 434 Seventh Ave. , nr. 15th St. , Park Slope ; 718-369-3144 ) , the cozy new venture of Roberto Santibañez , former Rosa Mexicano bigwig .
From 5 to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Friday , an order of Rosa Mex–worthy guacamole for two — fastidiously prepared to order in a molcajete and served with warm tortillas , chips , and salsa — will run you five bucks , with $ 3 beer and wine .
The neighborhood has clearly discovered it , as empty bar stools vanish fast .
And in Williamsburg , locals have warmly embraced the crew at Cariño ( 82 S. 4th St. , nr. Berry St. ; 718-384-8282 ) , reunited after their last place of employ , Bonita , closed down last summer .
The liquor license is still pending , but in the meantime , it ’s a fine place for a mellow brunch of chilaquiles topped with two eggs , any style , slathered with salsa verde ( $ 12 ) .
Going Local
There are those among us who grow vegetables on the roof , only eat beef from cows that once frolicked contentedly on New York State pastures , and have n’t bought a banana since the last century .
And where do they go for dinner ?
Roman ’s ( 243 DeKalb Ave. , nr. Vanderbilt Ave. , Ft. Greene ; 718-622-5300 ) , for one , the Italian - accented sibling of Williamsburg ’s pioneering Diner and Marlow & Sons .
The menu changes constantly , a policy that infuriates creatures of habit but that the Underground Gourmet finds refreshing , especially when it brings such surprises as the season ’s first sweet Maine shrimp , or a flurry of fava beans , whipped into a purée or adorning a bowl of spaghetti ( $ 12 ) .
Card - carrying locavores also find sustenance at Northern Spy Food Co. ( 511 E. 12th St. , nr. Ave. A ; 212-228-5100 ) , a cozy East Village nook that celebrates local products in unexpected dishes like upstate - freekeh risotto enriched with mascarpone ( $ 12 ) .
At Brooklyn Heights ’s Iris Cafe ( 20 Columbia Pl. , nr. Joralemon St. ; 718-722-7395 ) , the coffee is Stumptown , the turkey salad is made from antibiotic - free gobblers lovingly raised on Pennsylvania ’s Koch ’s Farm , and the caramel sticky buns are baked in - house .
And then , on opposite ends of the culinary spectrum : Eat ( 124 Meserole Ave. , nr. Leonard St. , Greenpoint ; 718-389-8083 ) , where the overindulged U.G. goes to detox on farm - fresh fare like carrot - turnip - spelt salad and rhubarb tonic , and Bark Hot Dogs ( 474 Bergen St. , nr. Flatbush Ave. , Park Slope ; 718-789-1939 ) , Brooklyn ’s preeminent source for Slow Food fast food , from lard - basted , Rochester - made boutique franks to New Jersey –strawberry milk shakes .
The Dan -Dan Diaspora
If you ’ve noticed a surge of late in Sichuan food , you can thank ( or blame , depending on your spice tolerance ) Wu Liang Ye . Despite the business ’s recent retrenchment , with shuttered branches in Yorkville and Murray Hill , it ’s impossible to overstate the role the onetime powerhouse has played in the recent boom .
John Zhang , the Grand Sichuan pooh - bah , got his start at Wu before launching his own mini-empire .
And this year , front - and - back - of - the - house fugitives from the WLY organization have dispersed throughout the borough , materializing in spiffy new establishments like the wood - beamed Wa Jeal ( 1588 Second Ave. , nr. 82nd St. ; 212-396-3339 ) , where the friendly young manager , a Wu alum , sagely guides newcomers to signatures like half a tea - smoked duck hacked into crisp - skinned , meaty hunks ( $ 15.95 ) , and Chef ’s Ma Paul Diced Fish & Crispy Tofu , with crispy but tender cubes of flounder and bean curd afloat in a glistening chile - oil lake ( $ 15.95 ) .
There have also been unconfirmed reports of Wu folks spotted ten blocks south , at Szechuan Chalet ( 1395 Second Ave. , nr. 73rd St. ; 212-737-1838 ) , where hand - scrawled thank - you notes from the local populace attest to the Sichuan–via–New Jersey chef ’s prowess with regional specialties like Cheng Du chilled noodles with spicy sesame vinaigrette ( $ 4.95 ) and double - cooked fresh bacon with spicy capsicum ( $ 13.95 ) , long strips of savory pork belly mingled with green peppers and leeks .
In the increasingly Sichuan - saturated Thirties , the onetime Wu Liang Ye outpost has become Mapo Tofu ( 338 Lexington Ave. , nr. 39th St. ; 212-867-8118 ) , but many of its former employees have wound up at Lan Sheng a few blocks west ( 60 W. 39th St. , nr. Sixth Ave. ; 212-575-8899 ) , where the kitchen has entered into cutthroat culinary competition with the veteran Szechuan Gourmet up the street , deploying weapons like dan dan noodles ( $ 5.50 ) and chile - pepper - bombed Chongqing chicken ( $ 12.95 ) .
Despite evidence to the contrary , there ’s more on the Sino - food front than Sichuan peppercorns and mapo tofu .
There are , for instance , the unfamiliar Shangdong and Dongbei specialties that have been infiltrating Flushing , at places like the year - old M&T ( 44-09 Kissena Blvd. , nr. Cherry Ave. ; 718-539-4100 ) , and the supremely comforting bo zai fan — or , as the 301 - item menu modestly refers to it , World Famous Rice in Casserole , topped with everything from squab to eel ( $ 8.95 ) — at A Wah , the Cantonese Chowhound favorite just south of the Manhattan Bridge ( 5 Catherine St. , nr. Division St. ; 212-925-8308 ) .
Perpetual Pizza Boom
Photo : Julia Gillard
The Underground Gourmet ’s favorite new pizza can be found in hipster Greenpoint at Paulie Gee ’s ( 60 Greenpoint Ave. , nr. West St. ; 347-987-3747 ) , the midlife career reinvention of Paul Giannone — until last March , a Neapolitan pizzaiolo trapped in the body of a disgruntled New Jersey software - quality - assurance engineer .
His story is as inspirational as his pie :
In recent years , fantasizing about living a better , pizza - centric life and maybe even opening his own pizzeria , Giannone built an oven in his suburban backyard , perfected his dough - stretching technique , and , for reasons known only to him , started inviting food bloggers over for dinner .
Finally , encouraged by the ecstatic response , he found a restaurant location and made the leap to full - time pie man , and it ’s not too much to say that the software - quality - assurance industry ’s loss is the pizza world ’s gain .
Light and airy with a fine , fleeting microlayer of crispness , Paulie Gee ’s pizza ( starting at $ 11 ) is in the same pristine Neapolitan class as the pies he idolized at Kesté , Motorino , and the late Una Pizza Napoletana .
The man also has a healthy obsession with high - quality ingredients and a Jim ( Co. )
Lahey –like genius for toppings , most apparent , perhaps , in a rotating roster of seasonal specials like the U.G. ’s current favorite : sweet Italian sausage mingled with fresh mozzarella and kale that Giannone buys from Greenpoint ’s Rooftop Farm ( $ 17 ) .
If you think that ’s too much to spend for a ball of dough , search between the cushions of your couch and then head over to the new East Village Motorino outpost in the old Una Pizza Napoletana space for lunch ( 349 E. 12th St. , nr. First Ave. ; 212-777-2644 ) .
From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays , a pizza ( Margherita , marinara , Brussels sprouts , or soppressata piccante ) , plus your choice of salad or dessert , will run you just $ 12 .
You ’ll find another bargain a few blocks away at Totale Pizza ( 36 St. Marks Pl. , nr. Second Ave. ; 212-254-0180 ) , the somewhat baffling collaboration between former Una Pizza Napoletana understudy Gregory Ryzhkov and an owner of the $ 1 slice specialist 2 Bros.
Pizza down the block .
Why should this merger befuddle the U.G. ?
Because if you remember anything about Ryzhkov ’s old UPN boss Anthony Mangieri — as uncompromising a pizzaiolo as ever turned a pie around the oven ’s hot spot — it ’s hard to imagine a trusted former associate of his divulging trade secrets to the enemy .
It ’s like a Peter Luger waiter going into business with the owner of Tad ’s Steaks .
Of course , when all is said and done , all you need to know is that the Naples - style pizza here is well charred , nicely balanced , and made with good — presumably non –2 Bros . — ingredients , although it does suffer slightly from a crust that ’s too stiff and unyielding .
Still , with prices that range from $ 7 to $ 13 per pie , compared with the former UPN’s $ 21 , who ’s complaining ?
Uptown in Hell ’s Kitchen , at the streamlined Zigolinis Pizza Bar ( 675A Ninth Ave. , nr. 47th St. ; 212-333-3900 ) , the U.G. has tracked down two more finely pedigreed pizzaioli .
Here you ’ll find executive pie man Luigi Olivella , whose commendable Neapolitan work you may know from No. 28 , L’asso , and the late Isabella ’s Oven .
At his side , on occasion , is Giuseppe Paciullo , who once manned the pizza station with equal parts apparent boredom and technical wizardry at the excellent Zero Otto Nove in the Bronx .
The $ 12 Margherita pie is soft and supple , charred and chewy , with discrete puddles of sweet mozzarella and a judicious swirl of tomato sauce .
And let ’s not forget Totonno ’s in Coney Island ( 1524 Neptune Ave. , nr. W. 16th St. ; 718-372-8606 ) , not exactly new , having shoveled its first load of coal into the oven some 86 years ago , but back in the game after being sidelined by a fire for nearly a year , and run once more with an iron fist by Louise “ Cookie ” Ciminieri , granddaughter of the restaurant ’s Neapolitan immigrant founder .
The Open Market
If you bake it , pickle it , ferment it , scoop it , grill it , or frost it , they will come .
At least that ’s the way it looks every weekend afternoon at the Brooklyn Flea and Hester Street Fair , every Sunday at Fulton Stall Market , once a month at New Amsterdam Market , and even in the posh environs of the Cooper Square Hotel garden , where Faustina chef Scott Conant recently started hawking his private - label tomato sauce and $ 5 bags of Stromboli ( 25 Cooper Sq. , at 5th St. ; next date July 31 , 1 to 7 p.m. ) .
New York , it ’s safe to say , is swept up in market fever , fueled by career - changing cooks and cupcake - happy hobbyists catering to the insatiable appetite for the artisanal , the handmade , and the quaintly packaged .
The Brooklyn Flea , a culinary destination after just two years , is still the place to go for Salvatore Bklyn cannoli , and brands - in - the - making like the Good Batch stroopwafels .
On New Amsterdam Market days ( monthly July and August , weekly September 12 to December 19 ) , the Underground Gourmet likes to leg it down to the Seaport and slurp up some Bent Spoon sorbet , or tuck into something sustainably beefy or porky from Marlow & Daughters ( chili come fall , we hope ) , while stocking up on exotica like Finnish ruis bread and spelt linguine .
Over at Hester Street Fair in the Seward Park Co-op , there ’s a sort of perverse pleasure to be had in chasing a pulled - pork sandwich with a vegan sandwich cookie .
But our favorite edible expedition of late has been to the Red Hook Mercado ( Mercadito would be more accurate ) , an intimate , lushly landscaped lot out in the Brooklyn boonies , where itinerant foodies and windswept locals commune over pupusas and sopes griddled up by moonlighting vendors from the nearby ball fields ( 410 Van Brunt St. , nr. Van Dyke St. ; Saturday and Sunday noon to 9 p.m. ) .
Asian New Wave

Whatever you think of the word fusion , there ’s no denying that some of the most delicious food comes from the artful collision of cultures and flavors .
Just ask Jean - Georges Vongerichten or David Chang .
Or try a Kim Dog at Mrs. Kim’s ( 160 Franklin St. , at Kent St. , Greenpoint ; 718-389-8881 ) and see for yourself .
The juicy house - ground pork sausage , slicked with gochujang ketchup ( a paste made from red chiles and fermented soybeans ) and garnished with kimchee on a soft toasted roll , is but one of several fruitful collaborations between a Korean owner and two American chefs , and makes an excellent chalkboard special ( $ 10 with a pint of beer ) .
Kimchee , seemingly the new salsa , is also a staple at Purple Yam ( 1314 Cortelyou Rd. , nr. Rugby Rd. , Ditmas Park ; 718-940-8188 ) , where Filipino chef Romy Dorotan tucks it into a Korean - meatball hero on a purple yam bun ( $ 8 ) .
Pan -Asian explorations animate his menu , a border - crossing document that features dishes as traditional as vinegar - braised chicken adobo ( $ 16 ) and as unexpected as one evening ’s crimson steamed dumplings ( $ 7 ) , stuffed with beets and tofu and served with yogurt , a combo that conjured Kiev more than Manila .
King Phojanakong calls the Thai -Filipino fusion he first introduced at Kuma Inn “ Asian - American , ” and of all the small plates on offer at his Brooklyn sequel , Umi Nom ( 433 DeKalb Ave. , nr. Classon Ave. , Bedford - Stuyvesant ; 718-789-8806 ) , we steer you toward the grilled mackerel ( $ 11 ) , a slender specimen garnished with a salad of cherry tomatoes and jícama in a lively garlic - chile - lime dressing .
Asian - American would also be an apt description of Zak Pelaccio ’s genre - busting barbecue at Fatty ’ Cue ( 91 S. 6th St. , nr. Berry St. , Williamsburg ; 718-599-3090 ) , the Malaysian - flavored roadhouse frequented by the Underground Gourmet whenever the craving strikes for Pullman toast with ’ cue drippings ( a.k.a .
Master Fat , $ 4 ) , or a late - night smoked - brisket - and - smoked - Cheddar sandwich with chile jam ( $ 10 ) .
The U.G. has also been known to bulk up on Haus Baos ( $ 4.50 ) at Baohaus ( 137 Rivington St. , nr. Norfolk St. ; 646-684-3835 ) , where chef - owner Eddie Huang reinterprets the red-cooked pork of his Taiwanese - American youth with Angus skirt steak and a marinade that combines cherry cola and Chinese sorghum liquor .
Burger Binge
Funny to think that fourteen years ago , this magazine admitted , rather resignedly , that New York was not a great “ burger town . ”
Not like L.A. , say , or Houston , or even Oklahoma City .
Funnier that while we are now indisputably and unrelentingly a great burger town , all the Underground Gourmet ’s ingrate foodie friends say they are sick and tired of burgers .
But there are still some unjaded eaters who appreciate a Pat La Frieda patty , and to accommodate them , a fresh new crop of burger shops have sprung up within the past year .
Chief among them is the stylish , publike Black Market ( 110 Ave. A , nr. 7th St. ; 212-614-9798 ) , where you can get a cocktail called a Tompkins Square Swizzle or a plate of broiled kale seasoned with Parmesan to go along with the excellent La Frieda–blend house cheeseburger .
This six - ounce dynamo has a nice crumbly texture and a good salty flavor , and comes with a pile of first - rate fries for $ 12 .
A few blocks west but still flying slightly below the burger radar is the nine - month - old Mark ( 33 St. Marks Pl. , nr. Second Ave. ; 212-677-3132 ) , a lively little burger bar with a crackerjack staff that flips a textbook - perfect two - ounce slider with fried onions and American cheese .
They go for $ 2 a pop , but if you break the house slider - eating record ( currently eighteen ; standard competitive - eating rules apply ) , you not only eat for free but also get your name emblazoned in colored chalk on a menu board above the griddle .
Speaking of sliders , the juicy little flavor bombs ( $ 3 ; $ 3.50 with cheese ) at Saint Anselm in Williamsburg ( 355 Metropolitan Ave. , nr. Havemeyer St. ; 718-384-5054 ) are unsurpassed , and it ’s no wonder : Owner and New Jersey native Joe Carroll modeled them faithfully after the ones he was raised on at White Manna .
When the U.G. craves something more substantial and is in no mood for squashing slider - eating records , we go to Bill ’s Bar and Burger in the meatpacking district ( 22 Ninth Ave. , at 13th St. ; 212-414-3003 ) and fork over $ 8.50 for the new seven - ounce short - rib - blend model .
For sheer beefy flavor , it outdoes even Bill ’s much - lauded five - ounce “ smashed ” burger , but order it on an English muffin , as the de facto house bun is no match for this thing ’s lavish juices .
At the cubicle - size Fresh - N - Fast ( 111 E. 23rd St. , nr. Park Ave. S. ; 646-454-9144 ) , a new In - N - Out knockoff located just a short burger - eater ’s waddle away from the Madison Square Park Shake Shack , we like the $ 5.99 double cheeseburger dressed with nothing more than the house special sauce .
Unlike Bill ’s bun , F - N - F ’s squishy potato variety is a team player that melds quickly with the three - and - a - half - ounce patties and cheese into one delicious , harmonious whole , prompting the eternal question :
Is it worth skipping the Shack ’s Great Depression–era soup - kitchen line for ?
Well , not quite , but hope springs eternal :
Although the place was deserted and thoroughly lacking in non-U.G. customers the other night , the red - bow - tied counterman insisted we take a vibrating pager just like the ones at Shake Shack , as if , at any moment , he were expecting a mob .
Continuing on our burger - town tour to Queens , the Astor Bake Shop ( 12 - 23 Astoria Blvd. , at 14th St. , Astoria ; 718-606-8439 ) is , for all appearances , a bright and breezy patisserie , but one with hidden depths .
Remember Mitchel London ’s Burger & Cupcakes concept ?
This place is kind of like that , but in addition to cupcakes there are tarts , croissants , éclairs , sticky buns , a superb almond - cornmeal cake , and , behind a white subway - tile kitchen partition , a burger - making station .
The one to get is the six - ounce Astor burger ( $ 8.75 ) , another La Frieda–brisket - blend patty with chile - infused mayo and all the fixings .
And wrapping things up in Crown Heights , there is Dutch Boy Burgers ( 766 Franklin Ave. , nr. St. Johns Pl. ; 718-230-0293 ) , a retro- dinerish spot in a onetime Dutch Boy paint shop , where you can get a bulky seven - ounce bacon - blue - cheeseburger ( $ 8.50 ) and wash it down with a Blue Marble ice - cream shake .
Meatless in Manhattan ( and Brooklyn )
Photo : Julia Gillard
The falafel joint is a natural habitat for frugal vegetarians , and this year has seen the arrival of two nifty new additions to an increasingly crowded ( and corporate ) field .
Soomsoom Vegetarian Bar ( 166 W. 72nd St. , nr. Amsterdam Ave. ; 212-712-2525 ) is kosher , Israeli , and so perpetually packed that the salad - bar scrum can get scarier than the produce department at Fairway .
The falafel are crisp , the pitas fluffy , and free garnishes like pickled turnips and paprika - dusted kohlrabi fresh and plentiful , but for the Underground Gourmet ’s money , the thing to get is the excellent sabich sandwich ( $ 6.80 ) , crammed with velvety fried eggplant , potato chunks , and a hard - boiled egg .
Out in the industrial wilds of East Williamsburg , Yummus Hummus ( 55 Waterbury St. , nr. Meserole St. ; 347-984-6202 ) materializes like a mirage in the culinary desert .
The owners built the rough - hewn nook from scratch , and the same philosophy applies to the food : Everything is made in - house , from the breakfast blueberry scones to the flat , chewy ( and , as it cools , rather tough ) pita .
In a brave , some might say blasphemous , approach , falafel are baked , not fried .
But the hummus is as it should be — creamy , rich , anointed with oil and tahini .
It ’s good as is , better crowned with an entire head of oven - roasted garlic from which you squeeze the butter - soft cloves ( the Baked Bulb ) , and best of all in the Hummus Hot rendition ( $ 7.50 ) .
Incendiary , drizzled with yogurt - jalapeño harissa , and studded with crumbled feta , it would n’t be out of place at a Sichuan restaurant in Flushing .
When in Curry Hill , hungry herbivores are directed to Bhojan ( 102 Lexington Ave. , nr. 27th St. ; 212-213-9615 ) , a rather elegant new restaurant on the strip .
The $ 16 dinner thalis — traditional meals served on a metal tray , the rice - and - bread - equipped center ringed with eight bowls of dhal , salad , raita , chutney , and curries — can easily feed two , but be prepared to pony up a $ 6 sharing fee .
The rest of the extensive menu , like the thalis , reflects the vegetarian cooking of Punjab and Gujarat , and includes a wide assortment of street snacks like tangy , crunchy chaat and Indian - style sandwiches .
For a sly American take on an Indian - style sandwich , we recommend the Clean Slate at Saltie ( 378 Metropolitan Ave. , nr. Havemeyer St. , Williamsburg ; 718-387-4777 ) , an exuberant , open - face assemblage of hummus , quinoa , pickles , yogurt , and herbs on house - baked naan ( $ 9 ) .
The Small - Plate Debate
And now let ’s revisit the hot - button topic of portion control .
Some are for it , some against .
But has n’t it been scientifically proved that appetizers generally trump main courses ?
And did n’t Michael Pollan tell us to eat less , anyway ?
Even in the realm of cheap eats , the Underground Gourmet has always prized quality over quantity — as should anyone , we might argue , who does n’t inhale Nathan ’s hot dogs for a living .
And with more and more fine - dining chefs scaling back their tariffs , if not their technique , quality has never been better .
This is immediately evident at Traif ( 229 S. 4th St. , nr. Havemeyer St. , Williamsburg ; 347-844-9578 ) , chef - owner Jason Marcus ’s tongue - in - pork - cheek rebuke to Jewish dietary law .
But there ’s more to Traif than bacon and shrimp :
The changing menu features offbeat salads , like a recent combo of dark - roasted carrots , orange segments , arugula , feta , and grapes ( $ 6 ) , and barbecue - braised short - rib sliders served with attention - grabbing sweet - potato fries ( $ 8 ) .
With prices like that , you do n’t expect shot - glass amuses and dainty mignardises , like a juicy pineapple cube adorned with pomegranate molasses and lime zest , but Traif delivers both , as well as an appealing wine list and serious Schott Zwiesel stemware .
Like Traif , the Vanderbilt ( 570 Vanderbilt Ave. , at Bergen St. , Prospect Heights ; 718-623-0570 ) offers front - row seats — counter stools , really — to the open kitchen , where ambitious young cooks painstakingly compose salads and tweak garnishes , and even the smallest of small plates seems complex .
A broccoli “ hors d’oeuvre ” is thinly sliced , flash - fried , seasoned with Korean chile powder and lemon juice and dusted with Pecorino ( $ 5 ) .
The charcuterie is all housemade and plated as elegantly as Bar Boulud’s .
And while you might think it adequate to coat a sweet - fleshed mackerel fillet with piment d’espelette , sear it perfectly on the grill , and balance it somehow on a puck of diced Israeli - salad - style vegetables , the Vanderbilt crew does n’t consider the dish complete without a pitcher of tomato broth to pour on top ( $ 15 ) .
Similar flourishes are on display at 6th Street Kitchen ( 507 E. 6th St. , nr. Ave. A ; 212-477-4649 ) , Chris Genoversa ’s homespun conversion of the former OG , primarily in specials like an ethereal corn custard , accessorized with chanterelles and mâche ( $ 12 ) .
The place has already gained a following for its chorizo sliders ( a small - plate motif , it seems ) , and a calm , civilized ambience that makes it an East Village oasis .
Even more transporting is Robataya ( 231 E. 9th St. , nr. Second Ave. ; 212-979-9674 ) , specializing in the theatrical Japanese practice of grilling items to order and passing them to sake - swilling customers on long - handled wooden paddles , not unlike feeding time at some high - class zoo .
Of the raw material on display , the Japanese sweet potato ( $ 5 ) benefits beautifully from this treatment , as do tender morsels of duck and Kobe beef .
But one should n’t neglect the non-grilled dishes , served paddle - less — in particular , a pot of Hinohikari rice for two , accessorized with nori , duck morsels in miso , and spicy cod roe ( $ 10 ) , and a decidedly non-locavore salad of Japanese cucumber , Oxnard ’s Nagatoshi Farm tomato , Sendai miso , and a hillock of boutique Japanese salt that management should hide before City Hall confiscates it .

Why pie , why now ?
Not only is it the ultimate recessionary dessert , delivering homespun comfort in an uncertain time , it aligns perfectly with the handcrafted , DIY Zeitgeist of the day .
That , and it ’s so damned delicious .
Especially when it ’s one acquired from crust mavens Emily and Melissa Elsen , the South Dakota–bred sisters behind Four & Twenty Blackbirds ( 439 Third Ave. , at 8th St. , Gowanus ; 718-499-2917 ) , like their signature salted caramel apple , or a recent blueberry - cherry number oozing sweet - tart juice ( $ 4.50 ) .
And should you find yourself in the vicinity of Bed - Stuy ’s snug Pilar Cuban Eatery ( 393 Classon Ave. , nr. Greene Ave. ; 718-623-2822 ) , you ’ll want to follow up your perfectly pressed Cuban sandwich with a slice of guava - and - cream - cheese pie ( $ 4.50 ) .
Do n’t let the thing ’s flat , unassuming mien fool you — a flakier , more buttery crust cannot be found .
When in South Brooklyn , we like to swing by the Red Hook Lobster Pound not just for a Connecticut - style lobster roll but also to grab one of Margaret Palca ’s spectacular whoopie pies ( $ 3 ) , an eerie flashback to our Devil Dog–dependent youth ( 284 Van Brunt St. , nr. Visitation Pl. ; 646-326-7650 ) .
The Underground Gourmet has also fallen hard for First Prize Pies , a new venture launched by amateur baker Allison Kave , who so far sells only online and to two new restaurants : Fatty ’ Cue , where her brother Corwin is executive chef , and which usually has two varieties on hand ( pray that one is the fudgy , toasted - marshmallow - fluffed s’mores , $ 6 a slice with “ local cream ” ) , and Brooklyn Farmacy ( 513 Henry St. , at Sackett St. , Carroll Gardens ; 718-522-6260 ) , an old apothecary lovingly restored into a general store and soda fountain .
In addition to seasonal slices of First Prize Pies ( peach , at the moment ; $ 4.50 ) , the Farmacy traffics in egg creams that do the borough proud ( $ 2.50 ) .
Ostensibly , Stuffed Artisan Cannolis ( 176 Stanton St. , nr. Clinton St. ; 212-995-2266 ) purveys just one thing — in up to 75 different rotating flavors , as outré as “ Girl Scout ” ( Samoa cookie , specifically ) and root - beer float .
We were , admittedly , skeptical at first , but the proof is in the unfailingly crisp pre-piped shell and lush ricotta fillings ( $ 2 for a mini , or 3 for $ 5 ) .
Popbar ( 5 Carmine St. , at Sixth Ave. ; 212-255-4874 ) , another revolutionary advance in dessert science , is clearly a franchise in the making .
The concept : a customizable gelato ( or sorbetto or yogurt ) on a stick , crumbed to your precise specifications with nuts or granola , say , and dipped , half - dipped , or even double - dipped in chocolate ( $ 5.50 ) .
Street sweets are fine , do n’t get us wrong , but sometimes you want something a little more sophisticated — something like goat - cheese cheesecake with blackberries and rosemary caramel ( $ 6 ) , made by a team of former Le Cirque pastry cooks at DessertTruck Works ( 6 Clinton St. , nr. Houston St. ; no phone ) , the brick - and - mortar outgrowth of the popular sweetsmobile .
Speaking of elegant plated desserts , Spice Market alum Pichet
Ong offers them up three for $ 20 in a tapas - style tasting at Spot Dessert Bar ( 13 St. Marks Pl. , nr. Third Ave. ; 212-677-5670 ) , where our current favorite , the yuzu eskimo , layers Oreo “ soil , ” yuzu ice cream , and passion - fruit foam .
We love his Chinese walnut cookies , too ( $ 1.95 ) — lumpy , crunchy biscuits also on offer at his other consulting gig , Nolita ’s Village Tart ( 86 Kenmare St. , at Mulberry St. ; 212-226-4980 ) .
And finally , this would n’t be a complete survey of New York ’s new sweetscape without a reverent mention of Güllüoglu ( 982 Second Ave. , at 52nd St. ; 212-813-0500 ) , whose legendary expertise with phyllo dough , sheep ’s - milk butter , and nuts has made the 139 - year - old Turkish brand the uncontested baklava world champion .
Its new Manhattan café stocks the full flaky line , including varieties like chestnut , walnut , and especially Turkish pistachio , the pride of Gaziantep .

Not a peg or guy rope in sight - inside are shops , cinemas and even a beach
The world 's tallest tent has opened to the public in the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan .
Designed by the British architects Foster & Partners , the Khan Shatyr Entertainment Centre in the capital Astana is 150 m ( 490 ft ) high .
It opens on the day the city celebrates 13 years as the capital and President Nursultan Nazarbayev his 70th birthday .
The centre has a huge indoor leisure park , designed to be protected from the region 's harsh climate .
Khan Shatyr : A ' world within '
The tent is made from three layers of ETFE , a special see - through plastic that allows daylight to wash the interiors while sheltering them from weather extremes
Air is pumped in between the layers inflating them into enormous pillows , giving the tent covering the appearance of a large quilt
The aim is to provide the city with a range of civic , cultural and social amenities sheltered all year round , whatever the weather
In winter , a key challenge is to prevent the formation of ice on the inside of the tent using temperature control and directing warm air currents up the inner fabric surface
The government of Kazakhstan decided to move the capital north to Astana from Almaty in the country 's southeast corner because of Almaty 's susceptibility to earthquakes and its proximity to the Chinese border Foster & Partners
Standing on a 200 m concrete base , Khan Shatyr is the city 's highest structure and the world 's tallest tent .
Inside , visitors will find shops , restaurants and cinemas - even an artificial beach and a running track .
Astana experiences extreme changes in temperature , from 30C in the summer to - 30C in the winter .
The giant tent , which took four years to build , is designed to withstand harsh weather and maintain a comfortable temperature inside .
It is made from three layers of ETFE ; a special see - through plastic that allows daylight to wash the interiors while sheltering them from weather extremes .
It is the latest in an extraordinary building programme that has transformed Astana since it became the Kazakh capital 13 years ago .
Jewish groups , working with congressional leaders , are pressing to designate one of the main organizers of the humanitarian flotilla that sought to break Israel ’s blockade of Gaza as a terrorist group .
Image by GETTY IMAGES Not Welcome : Rep. Eliot Engel says those on the flotilla should be banned from enter - ing the United States .
With a boost from Senate leaders , the Jewish groups are lobbying the administration to sanction Insani Yardım Vakfı , the nonprofit sponsor of the ship Mavi Marmara .
Nine Turkish passengers , including one dual - nationality American , were killed on the Gaza - bound Turkish vessel when Israeli commandos seized control of it in international waters , leading to a clash between the commandos and some of the passengers .
Many questions about what happened on board the ship remain in dispute , and calls for an international investigation have led Israel to sponsor a panel with two international observers that will examine some aspects of the affair , though not what happened on the boat .
But meanwhile , New York - area Congress members and the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater New York are also urging the administration to deny visas to passengers on the Mavi Marmara who have been invited to speak in the United States about what they experienced .
“ The people who were on that flotilla should not be allowed to come to the United States and spill their propaganda and hatred and terrorist rhetoric , ” said Rep. Eliot Engel , a New York Democrat .
Rep. Jerrold Nadler added : “ It is the responsibility of our government to ensure that terrorists , and those who support terrorist activities , not be allowed to enter the United States . ”
The twin efforts make up the latest twist in the battle to define the outcome of the high - seas confrontation , which has provoked international condemnation of Israel amid charges by Israel and its supporters that some on the boat were terrorists who sought out the clash to ambush and kill the commandos .
David Letwin , a spokesperson for Al Awda NY , which plans to bring three Mavi Mamara passengers to Brooklyn June 17 to speak publicly , denounced the effort to deny them visas as “ a smokescreen . ”
‘ This has nothing to do with terror , ” he said .
“ It has to do with powerful politicians in this country trying to silence any criticism of what ’s going on in Israel . ”
In various press reports , Insani Yardım Vakfı , the Istanbul - based Islamic charity known by its Turkish acronym , IHH , has strongly rejected allegations that it is linked to terrorism .
Efforts to reach the group for comment on the current push to get it placed on the U.S. terrorism list were unsucessful .
The Anti-Defamation League , in a June 8 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , pointed to both the IHH and a coalition of which it is a part , the Union of Good , as groups that should be viewed as terrorist entities alongside Hamas , Hezbollah and Al - Qaeda .
“ In light of the extensive connections and significant fundraising activities made by these groups to Hamas , a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization , we would urge the State Department make these two organizations subject to the same restrictions as Hamas , ” the group wrote Clinton .
In a similar letter , the American Jewish Committee called on the State Department to investigate alleged ties between the IHH and the terror groups Hamas and Al - Qaeda .
In Congress , the demand to investigate the Turkish group came in letters to President Obama from both chambers .
“ We recommend that your administration consider whether the IHH should be put on the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations , after an examination by the intelligence community , the State Department , and the Treasury Department , ” stated the Senate letter , sponsored by Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
The House letter did not call directly for an investigation but points out ties the IHH had with Hamas , which is recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist organization .
Pressure to launch an investigation of IHH has been mounting ever since the May 31 Israeli raid on the flotilla .
Reports on the violent nature of the resistance on board the Mavi Marmara triggered an outpouring of information alleging connections between the IHH and acts of terror over the years .
But some passengers aboard the ship , including journalists unconnected to IHH or the Free Gaza Movement , its partner in the venture , maintain that it was the Israeli commandos who fired the first shots , using rubber or plastic bullets and stun grenades as they boarded from speedboats and helicopters .
Pro-Israel activists have been pushing for the IHH ’s designation as a terror group in open statements and in closed - door conversations with lawmakers and administration officials ever since the clash .
For Jewish groups , going after the IHH is one of three main goals set forth in the aftermath of the incident , alongside gaining U.S. support for Israel ’s attempts to avoid an international investigation and fighting Israel ’s public relations war in American media .
But the strict requirements for designation as a terror organization — and thin evidence proving direct ties between the Turkish group and acts of terror — could make the first goal a lengthy and perhaps impossible undertaking .
The administration has yet to respond to calls to designate the IHH a terror group , although a State Department spokesman told the Forward : “ We are aware , however , that the IHH has met with senior Hamas officials in Turkey , Syria and Gaza over the past three years . ”
The State Department official did n’t say that IHH ties to Hamas were sufficient reason for designating IHH as a terror group .
But in a June 3 press briefing State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that such ties were “ obviously a great concern for us . ”
The IHH was established in 1992 to provide relief to Muslims in Bosnia .
It has since grown to become one of the largest Muslim charities , helping causes in 100 countries from Africa to Haiti .
In 1996 the IHH was mentioned in a CIA report as one of 15 groups that employed members who had ties to terror groups .
But no action was taken against the IHH at the time .
The key to getting a group on the State Department ’s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations ( FTOs ) is , according to a government official , proving that it “ engages in terrorist activity or terrorism , or retains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism , ” and that the group ’s activity “ threatens the security of United States nationals or national security of the United States . ”
Once a group is designated as an FTO , it is illegal for individuals in the U.S. to provide the group with material support of any kind .
Individuals who do so can be criminally prosecuted .
The group ’s representatives are not allowed admission to the U.S. , and American financial institutions must freeze any funds belonging to the group .
There are currently 44 organizations on the State Department list , which includes groups such as Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah as well as Israel ’s Kahana Chai , Ireland ’s Real IRA and Peru ’s Shining Path .
Groups advocating the designation of the IHH as a Foreign Terrorist Organization are looking at two key elements that they believe help their cause .
The first is the IHH ’s affiliation with the Union of Good , an umbrella organization of Islamic charities .
In 2008 the U.S. Treasury Department designated the Union of Good as one of the “ potential fundraising fronts for Foreign Terrorist Organizations . ”
A Treasury press release stated that the Union of Good was created as a front for raising funds for Hamas .
The group , however , was not added to the State Department list .
Evidence dealing directly with the IHH has focused almost exclusively on testimony given by French counterterrorism magistrate Jean - Louis Bruguière during the 2001 trial of Ahmed Ressam , who was convicted of planning an attack on Los Angeles ’ international airport as part of the “ millennium plot . ”
Bruguière , the first judge appointed to head French counterterrorism efforts , said in his testimony : “ The IHH is an NGO , but it was kind of a type of cover - up . ”
He claimed that the IHH helped jihadist terror groups obtain forged documents , recruit terrorists and smuggle weapons .
But in a June 2 interview with the Associated Press , Bruguière , who retired in 2007 , could not say whether the IHH was still tied to terror organizations .
“ They ’d have a hard time designating IHH as an FTO , ” said Jonathan Schanzer , a former Treasury Department intelligence analyst who dealt with combating terror funding , referring to the State Department .
In an interview with the Forward , he said , “ Such a designation would not get approved without a fight . ”
Schanzer , currently vice president of the neoconservative - oriented Foundation for Defense of Democracies , explained that the State Department terror list is comprised of the “ best - known terror organizations ” and requires evidence of direct involvement in terror .
However , including the IHH on the lesser - known Treasury Department list could be “ more suited , ” according to Schanzer , and no less effective .
Like the State Department list of terrorist groups , the Treasury Department ’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists includes groups and individuals judged to be involved directly in terror .
But it sets a lower threshold by also including groups that “ assist in , sponsor , or provide financial , material , or technological support for , or financial or other services ” to support terrorism .
The Treasury Department ’s sanctions against such groups are limited to freezing their assets and blocking their bank accounts .
Still , once a group gets included on either list , financial institutions around the world often refuse to deal with it .

Have Seattle Cops Become More Ethical ?
A recent report from the Office of Professional Accountability , the Seattle Police Department office that investigates allegations of officer misconduct , shows that although more people are contacting the OPA , officer complaints went down in 2009 compared to previous years .
Asked if there are fewer complaints because there ’s simply less crime ( 2008 was a 40 - year low for crime ) or whether Seattle Police are doing a better job , OPA Director Katherine Olson says it was not an easy statistic to explain or even analyze .
“ I think everyone agrees that the personnel for the Seattle Police Department are hardworking , passionate and ethical individuals — the Police Accountability Review Panel says so up front , and that ’s certainly my experience , ” Olson says .
“ It ’s a fairly small group of officers who actually receive complaints and an even smaller subset of those who engage in professional misconduct .
It really depends on what kind of work or contact they are having with citizens .
Some officers just have a lot more contact with citizens — maybe they are working on a Friday or Saturday at 2:00 a.m . "
But Estela Ortega , who heads the newly formed Community Coalition for Law Enforcement Accountability and is executive director of El Centro de la Raza , says that the finding about officer complaints should be taken with a grain of salt .
“ My sense is that it is n’t going to be a good barometer , ” she says .
“ We have a lot of good police officers on the force , but there ’s a certain percentage that have not had a positive relationship with communities of color .
I hear complaints of how people were pushed around or subject to racist slurs .
Often people do n’t complain because they do n’t feel confident that anything comes out of it . ”
Ortega also mentions the June 2009 incident where Seattle police officers were caught on tape beating a mentally - ill inmate who was resisting arrest .
The officers were later exonerated .
The OPA found that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that anything they had done was outside their line of duty and training .
“ People see that and are fearful of complaining , ” Ortega says .
“ A lot of people do n’t even know how to complain or where the OPA office is .
I doubt that everyday people in communities of color will actually go and complain .
There needs to be a place where people feel more comfortable going to report an incident . ”
Seattle police are currently investigating an unrelated incident caught on video in April that shows officers kicking a Latino man while threatening to " beat the Mexican piss " out of him .
In 2007 and 2008 , 20 percent of officers received complaints .
That number fell to 15 percent in 2009 , of which the “ majority were exonerated or otherwise found not responsible for the misconduct alleged , ” the report says .
The report shows that the West Precinct gets more complaints than the South Precinct , something Olson says could be attributed to the level of police activity in those parts of the city .
The largest kind of complaints involves the use of excessive force .
According to the report , contacts with the OPA continue to rise , steadily increasing by about a 100 a year to 1442 in 2009 .
“ This could be because people are calling in not just to complain but also commend officers for their work , ” says Olson .
The OPA also closed significantly more cases last year — 198 — as compared with earlier years .
Although there were fewer officers named in complaints , the report shows that there were slightly more cases that resulted in sustained findings .
“ But we are talking about a very small number , so it ’s difficult to draw conclusions , ” Olson says .
A majority of the cases had to do with criminal law violations — where officers were involved in off duty misconduct , DUI violation or domestic violence .
Seattle City Attorney Peter Holmes says that it was possible more people were n’t complaining about police misconduct because the OPA did n’t have a high enough profile on the public ’s mind .
“ We want people to know about OPA , that they can go there if they want to — that ’s probably better than increased tension on the streets , ” he says .
He also echoes Ortega ’s concerns about access and language issues .
Holmes says that during his tenure as chair of the OPA Review Board ( OPARB ) — the civilian body that oversees police investigation process — from 2003 to 2008 , the number of complaints against police officers had varied from 25 to 10 percent .
More after the jump .
A disturbing finding in the report is that allegations of failure to use video and audio recording system in Seattle Police cars were increasing .
“ Sometimes there is no video — it raises the question whether the officer forgot to turn it on , did it malfunction or was it deliberate , ” says current OPARB Chair Patrick Sainsbury .
The OPA currently has a small number of complaints — 16 — related to the failure to use recording devices in police cars .
Sainsbury says it would be purely speculative to try and guess why the number of complaints had gone down .
“ In general , just because crime has gone down policing has n’t gone down , ” he says .
“ It ’s not just making complaints about the police — a lot of Latinos come from a place where they do n’t trust complaining to the police because of immigration issues , ” Sainsbury says .
OPARB ’s 2009 Community Outreach Report includes testimony from the Latino community who said that the Seattle Police did not takie their complaints seriously .
“ There is a perception among police that Latinos float around or get deported , so they do n’t take them seriously , ” Sainsbury says .
Sainsbury adds that there was a lot of discussion about an education - based discipline model at the last National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement ’s ( NACOLE ) conference , something Seattle has yet to implement .
“ Instead of suspending officers for seven days without pay , the education - based model gives them a training project to do in their spare time related to what they are in trouble for , ” he says .
NACOLE ’S 16th annual conference will be held in Seattle from Sept 20 to 23 .
Councilmember Tim Burgess , who presented the 2009 OPA Complaint Statistics Report to the Seattle City Council June 7 , supports the education - based model .
He stressed it was important to flush out the difference between “ well - intentioned mistakes ” and “ true misconduct . ”
Although the SPD uses the traditional model of officers investigating other officers , it has a civilian review board , a civilian auditor , and a civilian director , who is up for reappointment this year .
Retired Judge Terrence Carroll is filling in as interim auditor since May after Judge Michael Spearman resigned from the position to join the State Court of Appeals .
As for decreasing video recording , Holmes says it could simply be a training issue .
His office is working with SPD to ensure that the video recordings made are being catalogued properly .
“ We have some improvements to make in retrieving the video and audio , ” he asays .
“ Video is an important evidentiary tool , we have to rely on these recordings and turn them over to the defense council . ”
Both Olson and Holmes say they are hopeful that the new Seattle Police Chief would have a good working relationship with the OPA director .
“ The new chief will have to be respectful and supportive of the OPA , ” says Olson .
“ I hope he will continue an open door policy which ensures that I can go to him and he can come to me with any questions . ”
Thanks in large part to BP and the government 's inept handling of the Gulf Coast oil spill , we 're going through one of the worst ecological disasters in American history .
But there are some things we can do to help .

Get Informed
BP 's been touting figures measuring the spill at 5,000 barrels per day — scientists who have studied video and satellite images estimate that there is actually 26,500 barrels of crude spewing in to the Gulf each day , with some saying it could be as high as 100,000 barrels .
BP suggests that 11,550,000 gallons of oil ( roughly equivalent to the amount of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez ) have been released from the well since the beginning of the crisis .
Realistic estimations indicate that there have been at least 54,894,000 gallons spilled , or at least 5.2 Exxon Valdez — and there could be that much flowing into the Gulf every five days .

Donate
There are several groups accepting donations .
The folks over at The Venture Bros. are selling off production drawings with proceeds going to The Colbert Nation Gulf of America Fund .
The Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana , the Audubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation are focusing their efforts on the ecological and environmental effects of the BP oil spill .
The Louisiana Bucket Brigade , a watchdog and monitoring organization , is asking for help to continue their work in the Gulf .
Images of oil soaked and dying wildlife are heartbreaking , but it 's important to keep in mind how deeply the crisis is affecting coastal communities that rely on the ocean .
The Greater New Orleans Foundation and Oxfam offer support to communities who were previously sustained by the fisheries and tourism destinations now poisoned with crude .

Volunteer
For those who live near the Gulf , there are several volunteer groups looking for help .
Networked Organisms and Habitats ( NOAH ) is asking for reports on where and how the spill is affecting wildlife .
Locals with training can also sign up with the Oil Spill Volunteer or the Oiled Wildlife Care network and assist with beach and wildlife cleanup , though be sure you 're aware of the potential risks associated with working around crude before you venture out .
The Grassroots project is taking donations for kite - camera kits volunteers can use to image various portions of the coastline .

Despite ominous news reports of cars careening out of control , there 's no substitute for data .
And now it looks like many reported cases of so - called " sudden acceleration " in Toyotas are actually due to driver error .
That 's the preliminary conclusion coming from investigators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) who analyzed dozens of event - data recorders , or " black boxes , " from Toyota models that had crashed .
Black box : Accleration , not braking
The recorders showed that despite drivers ' claims that they were pressing the brakes as hard as they could , in fact the accelerators were floored and the brakes were never applied .
That is exactly what happened in the March crash of a 2005 Toyota Prius in the New York City suburb of Harrison , N.Y .
There , a 56 - year - old housekeeper swore she was braking as hard as she could when the car raced across a busy road , slamming into a stone wall .
In that case , the NHTSA statement all but used the words driver error , saying that the car 's onboard computer systems " indicated there was no application of the brakes , and the throttle was fully open . "
We 've seen this before
The latest conclusions , reported by the Wall Street Journal but not officially confirmed by the agency , involved data recorders selected at random by the agency , not Toyota [ NYSE : TM ] .
The NHTSA has not yet issued a formal statement , saying it will wait to complete a longer study before commenting .
But the conclusions are not unexpected among auto - safety experts .
Few believe that " sudden acceleration " in the Prius or any other car is possible .
Back in 1989 , the agency concluded that drivers were also at fault in so - called " sudden acceleration " cases involving Audi 5000 sedans .
That was three years after a notorious documentary .
Misfiring neurons
But how can a driver believe she is braking when in fact she has the accelerator floored ?
The University of California - Los Angeles professor Richard Schmidt , who teaches psychology , writes , " The trouble , unbelievable as it may seem , is that [ it ] is very often caused by drivers who press the gas pedal when they intend to press the brake . "
The culprit is " noisy neuromuscular processes , " in which a limb does something slightly different from what the brain has asked it to do .
In this case , the driver 's foot may extend at a different angle than the body expects .
Compounding the problem
Panic then exacerbates the situation , with drivers pressing even harder on their " brake " pedals .
Which of course keeps the accelerator floored and often leads to a crash .
That said , a handful of cases may have been due to oversize or improperly fitted floor mats in Toyota and Lexus vehicles .
The company is now working through millions of vehicles to shorten and modify their accelerator pedals to alleviate the potential for such a problem .
That was the conclusion of the investigation into a notorious crash last August , in which a California Highway Patrol officer and three other passengers were killed when their Lexus accelerated out of control , crashed , flipped over , and burned .
That case is the only one out of more than 3,000 complaints in which the NHTSA has concluded the vehicle was at fault .

For some reason today I 've just had the runs off and on .
Nothing major , just when I need to go , I need to go .
So I was at Target waiting by the dressing rooms while I waited for my daughter to try on and pick out a new swimming suit .
We had been there a while already when the urge hit me so I figured that we'd be out of there soon enough and we'd be on our way .
I have a thing about public bathrooms and will only use one if there 's no other choice .
Five minutes pass and suddenly I realize that my first plan of waiting til we went home was folly and I needed to go ASAP .
My daughter was still in the dressing room getting into a swiming suit and my son was waiting with me doing a " gotta poop " dance with me as it felt like a bullet train was making its way through my intestines .
I decided to call my wife who was looking at some stuff on the other side of the store and tell her to hurry on over and watch the kids while I went and took care of my business .
She said she 'd come over right away .
Another five minutes pass my daughter comes out in a swimsuit that did n't fit right , I had beads of sweat forming on my forehead and things had gotten into a crisis state .
I called my wife again , " WHERE ARE YOU ?!!! " .
She was there in two minutes .
I pointed towards the kids and left running for the bathroom , almost positive I 'd poop in my pants in just a few seconds .
I passed the cashiers who all gave me wierd looks as I darted past them to the bathrooms .
Running into the bathroom there were two stalls , the handicapped one , and the normal one .
I decided to take the handicapped one as , like everyone else , I will take the extra space when I can get it .
I turned and shut the door with a slam and proceeded to start " The Move " .
Conissuers of poop stories will know what I 'm talking about .
Just as I 'm about to sit down the door of the stall swung wide open .
Instinctively I launched myself forward while trying to stop the swining door and close off the stream of poop .
But it was too late , Chuck Norris himself could n't stop the onslaught of poop shoot forth from my bottom as I tried to close the door .
It took me two tries to get the door shut before I actually pooped where I was meant to .
I had left streaks of poop in some kind of sick Jackson Pollack painting on the ground .
I began to laugh , the irony of all this happening at a place with the name of " Target " was not lost on me .
I tried to clean it up , and got most of the fecal matter off the ground with TP .
But there were still long yellowish brown streaks on the floor .
I 'm sorry Target .

How to submit letters Commentary writer Karl Giberson apparently is so rattled by the New Atheism that he cannot quote accurately ( " Atheists , play well with others , " On Religion , May 24 ) .
In the Forum piece , he says of me : " Tufts University philosopher and leading atheist Daniel Dennett no doubt finds all this mystifying , since he thinks seminary education should ultimately terminate one 's faith : ' Anybody who goes through seminary and comes out believing in God has n't been paying attention , ' he told The Boston Globe . "
As the Globe article made clear , I was quoting a joke made by a pastor .
If this were an isolated incident , I would n't bother responding , but faith fibbers like Giberson are polluting the media with their misrepresentations of the New Atheism .
We New Atheists do n't need to tell lies to get our points across ; the truth is damning enough .
Our critics seem to have decided that telling the truth is just not a strong enough weapon to ward off the threat they see us posing .
They should reflect that their willful misrepresentations dishonor the faiths they are defending .

Murphy 's choice
In the debate about fictional TV news anchor Murphy Brown and values , no one ever talks about Jake Lowenstein .
Who 's that ?
For those of you who have forgotten , Jake Lowenstein is the absent father of Murphy 's baby , Avery ( " Was Dan Quayle gasp ! right ? "
The Forum , May 18 ) .
In the sitcom , Brown was very happy to have reconnected with her long - ago love , and was excited about settling down and being a family with this man she thought she knew and upon whom she thought she could rely .
Dan Quayle and many others characterized having a baby as a cavalier decision on her part , as though she put no more thought into it than she would taking in a stray cat .
But it was Jake who decided that fatherhood did n't fit into his plans , and he took off to resume his globetrotting lifestyle .
Brown did n't casually choose this on her own , nor did she " get herself " pregnant as it's often phrased .
Let 's not forget that he left her to raise their child on her own .

This is a leaning tower of spork .
You can then launch foons over it .
Get a bunch of friends together and make a plenty foons .
Then start launching them at each other , the objective is to collide foons in mid-air .
Note :
The more foons in the air the better , try to launch 5 - 10 at a time for a challenge .

Popular Windows BitTorrent client uTorrent just released its first stable 1.0 client for Mac yesterday , but most users are skeptical about leaving Mac favorite Transmission ( which recently reached the 2.0 milestone ) .
Here 's how the two stack up against one another .
Advertisement
Where uTorrent Shines
u Torrent 's Mac version is pretty young , but the developers sure know how to make a useful , lightweight client .
Here 's what it 's got going for it so far .
Advertisement
Performance
Very surprisingly , uTorrent is just as lightweight as Transmission when Transmission works properly , and much more so when Transmission starts eating up resources for no reason .
Even with the new , speed - oriented version of Transmission , I 'm still noticing a lot of random jumps in CPU usage on one of my machines — sometimes it 'll be fine , and take up less than 2 percent , and others it 'll be up to 50 percent and stay there for a good long while .
Note that this does n't seem to be as widespread as it used to be , but it 's still pretty rampant on my system , and a few other users are having this issue too .
It must be interfering with another app , though I could n't figure out what .
It 's also worth noting that I have n't seen any of the egregious memory leaks that Transmission used to have , so RAM usage was about equal for me .
But this section is about uTorrent , after all , so here 's the lowdown : this thing is light .
It may not look like it with that giant window full of downloads and statistics , but on my machine uTorrent hovered around 4 or 5 percent of CPU usage , and only took up a mere 50 MB of RAM .
It 's not quite as light as Transmission ( which can sometimes get down to 1 percent CPU usage ) , but it 's certainly lower than something like Vuze — and the difference is usually negligible .
Note that if you are n't having problems with Transmission , the two are , for all intents and purposes , equal in the realm of performance .
Transmission users having resource problems should definitely give uTorrent a shot , but if Transmission works fine for you , performance alone is no reason to switch ( although by the same token , it is n't reason enough alone to stay with Transmission either ) .

Interface ( for Stats - Hungry Users )
Click on the image for a closer look .
If you find yourself with a high number of transfers at any given time , you may find uTorrent 's UI more to your liking than Transmission's .
uTorrent sports a pretty nice 3 - pane interface , one large pane giving you a list of your transfers and some simple stats like percent completed , speed , and active peers , and the other providing a number of tabs with pretty much any other stats you could possibly want .
In Transmission , you have to open these up in a separate window , which is n't ideal if you 're likely to be constantly checking them .
And , if you have a lot of transfers , it 's nice to have them all condensed so you can see and manipulate them all at once , as well as narrow them down by status in the sidebar ( whereas Transmission 's list takes up a bit more space if you have a lot of transfers ) .
Advertisement
Where Transmission Keeps
It in High Gear
Of course , the open source Transmission has been around for awhile , and it's had time to build up a pretty impressive set of advanced features .
Here are the ones that 'll keep you coming back to Transmission :
Advertisement
Advanced File Management Features
One thing still missing from uTorrent is the ability to sort files into different download locations automatically by group , as well as group certain files together in the UI .
Transmission does this pretty well , allowing you to filter transfers by tracker , comment , torrent name or name of any enclosed file .
Thus , you could filter torrents that contained movie files ( by filtering files that contained .avi , .mkv , etc. in their file names ) into your Movies folder and music files into your Music folder , for example .
You can also color - code and sort them from within the UI , which is pretty handy .
Advertisement
Interface ( for Minimalists )
Of course , group sorting is just about as customizable as Transmission 's UI gets .
This is n't to say that the UI is bad ; a lot of users ( including me , most of the time ) prefer it .
Its window can be as large or as tiny as you want , and without a bunch of statistics and sidebars taking up space it can sit quietly in the corner and not bother you .
In fact , you can even close the window entirely if you do n't care about monitoring your individual torrents , since Transmission 's dock icon shows your upload and download speed at any given time .
Plus , if you ever do want to view more statistics on your speed , swarm , or individual files , you can do so by clicking the info button .
Again , it 'll pop up in a new window , but if you only need it once in a while , that 's probably preferable for you .
If you 're more of a minimalist as far as UIs go , Transmission has a pretty clear edge .
Advertisement
Web Client
This is one of those features that is a make - it - or - break - it deal for lots of users : you can monitor your transfers from a web UI with Transmission .
The web UI looks pretty great , too , with a very similar interface to Transmission 's app window , allowing you to open new torrents for download and view in depth statistics on each transfer .
Furthermore , you can password - protect the web UI for your home computer 's instance of Transmission , as well as only allow certain IP addresses to access it .
If you want to monitor your usage from work , vacation , or anywhere else , Transmission is the only choice here .
Advertisement
Speed Limit Mode
If you have specific times of the day that you 'd rather not give all your bandwidth to Transmission , you can enable speed limit mode , which is a separate set of speed preferences than the defaults .
Thus , you could set your defaults as whatever you want ( whether unlimited or limited ) , and then set speed limit mode to limit them even further .
You can enable speed limit mode at any time with the click of a button , or schedule it to turn on and off at specific times of the day ( so you give all your bandwidth to Transmission when you 're asleep , for example ) .
You can always edit your speed preferences in uTorrent , but again , Transmission is king when it comes to automating the process .
Advertisement
Proxy Servers
If you are on a firewalled network , such as one at your work or school , you can sometimes use a proxy server to bypass the firewall that is likely blocking BitTorrent usage .
Transmission supports this , allowing you to specify the server , port , and any authentication you need to access it .
uTorrent does not yet have this feature .
Advertisement
Where They 're on the Same Playing Field
Advertisement
Performance
Yes , I know this was already in another category — but like I said before , if you are n't having any problems with Transmission leaking CPU usage , the two are pretty comparable in terms of performance .
When Transmission was working the way it should for me , it fluctuated between 1 and 4 percent CPU usage , with around 40 or 50 MB of RAM , the same as uTorrent .
The bottom line is this :
If you 're having issues with Transmission still , the performance edge goes to uTorrent .
If you 're not , it 's mostly a tie .
Advertisement
Connection Preferences
Most of the other connection preferences like encryption , automatic port randomization and mapping , PEX , and DHT are available in both clients .
These have become staples as of late in most clients , so it 's not that surprising , but worth mentioning since if it was missing in one , that would require you to go back to manually mapping those ports , which would be quite an inconvenience ( I do n't even think I remember how to do it ) .
Advertisement
The Bottom Line
If you need some more advanced features like a web interface , or you like to automate the whole process as far as sorting files or scheduling speed limits , Transmission is the clear choice .
If not , though , it 's pretty open to your personal preference .
Minimalists will like Transmission 's non-intrusive UI , and obsessive , stats - hungry downloaders will like uTorrent 's 3 - pane , multi-tab interface to keep an eye on things .
Also , keep in mind that uTorrent is still a baby on the Mac .
The more mature Windows version does have a lot of the features we list as missing here , such as a web UI or a speed limit mode , so we hope that eventually these will make it to the Mac version as they continue to develop it .
Advertisement
Of course , this list is n't completely exhaustive , and everyone has their own features that are essential to their download process .
So if we 've left out your favorite feature , be sure to share which client you like best and why in the comments .
When Lady Dona St Columb becomes exasperated with her high and fancy lifestyle in King Charles II ’s court in London she takes her children and moves out to her husband ’s second home , Navron , in Cornwall .
Eager for an escape , some peace and quiet , she spends much of her time lazing around in the gardens and playing with her children in a manner that would have been considered quite inappropriate for the times .
When she hears that there has been a spate of burglars in the nearby estates and that the perpetrator is some kind of pirate , she is more concerned that her husband does not come to ‘ protect ’ her than she is about her safety .
More prominent in her mind is to solve the mystery of where her servant William disappears to at night , and who his illusive Master is .
When she re-traces William ’s steps down to the creek one day , all the mysteries are solved as she is kidnapped , taken on board ‘ La Mouette ’ and brought face to face with the Captain .
The French captain is able to offer Dona everything she never knew she wanted ; a life of passion , excitement and freedom , as well as , of course , teaching her about birds and fishing .
During the course of their tryst , Dona learns that real passionate love can exist , and that there can be complete ‘ compatibility ’ between two people .
She masquerades as the Frenchman ’s cabin boy and accompanies him on a voyage to steal a ship from one of the men intent on bringing him down , whilst her children are left in Navron under the care of their nurse .
But just as Dona thinks life could n’t get any better she is brought back to reality by the arrival at Navron of her husband and his friend Rockingham , ready to fight the pirates .
As the Frenchman hatches his one last plan to truly embarrass the Noblemen , will he be successful ?
and what will Dona decide when she has to make the ultimate decision of whether she is ready to leave with him or stay faithful to her husband and children .
Douglas Brinkley rips British Petroleum for its terrible safety record leading up to this recent disaster in the Gulf Coast .
I agree completely with this statement by Brinkley .
BRINKLEY :
The problem is , we have had a lot of drill , baby , drill , and it 's spill , baby , spill .
People have been telling American people that offshore drilling is dangerous .
What we have heard is , oh , well , it 's changed .
There 's new technology .
We 're now green .
British Petroleum 's logo said they 're for beyond petroleum .
What 's new - energy about this ?
It 's dirty oil devastating communities in Louisiana and killing some of our richest wildlife areas .
Some of these wildlife places Theodore Roosevelt saved .
President Roosevelt went down there .
It 's a damn shame it takes something like this disaster to get people talking rationally about the subject instead of the ridiculous " drill baby drill " crap we first heard from Sarah Palin .
Digby had what I think was the best one liner in response to Palin -- How 's That Oily Drilly Thing Working Out For Ya ?*.
Entire transcript via CNN .
GUPTA : You heard it there .
And , earlier , we got an e-mail from a prominent critic of offshore drilling and BP .
To say it got our attention does n't do it justice .
It certainly got us the man who wrote , historian Douglas Brinkley , a spot on the program tonight , his latest book , " The Wilderness Warrior : Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America . "
Thanks for joining us .
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY : Well , thanks for having me , Sanjay .
GUPTA : You just heard from President Obama there .
And he's also said that BP is ultimately responsible for funding the cost of the response and the cleanup .
As we know , it 's something known as the Oil Pollution Act .
But that does n't mean the administration had judged the firm as negligent .
And they were specific about that .
Are -- are they negligent ?
Is this firm negligent ?
BRINKLEY : Well , we 're going to find out .
It really looks like it .
First off , BP has had a horrific response .
They have -- they -- they did deal with the fact that you had a blast .
They 're not talking about the environmental endgame here .
They have basically gone undercover and started doing a blame game on the oil rig company , instead of taking frontal responsibility for this .
You know , British Petroleum , in 2006 , had the worst cracked pipes in the North Slope of -- of Alaska .
The EPA and the FBI have been breathing down BP 's necks .
So , this looks like you are going to be hearing the word British Petroleum in an ugly way right now .
And it 's not the flower symbol of their logo .
It 's been a company in the last few years that have been cutting a lot of corners when it deals with safety issues .
GUPTA : You 're pretty fired up about this .
And I -- we told them you were going to be talking to us tonight .
And we have a statement from them as well .
And I want to read it to you , David , and get your response .
BRINKLEY : OK .
GUPTA : " When BP plans any activity , drilling or otherwise , in addition to all the required permitting for our plans , we also carry out full environmental impact assessments , examining our planned activities in detail , looking at their potential impacts on the environment , and doing all we can to minimize them .
The detailed planning includes plans for response to any unexpected incidents . "
I guess that 's what they 're talking about now , David .
What 's your reaction to that statement ?
BRINKLEY : It 's -- it 's Doug .
But all have you to do is look at Alaska and what they have done up there and what happened in 2006 .
They also , here in Texas , 2005 , had the Texas City -- British Petroleum -- blowup , where people died .
British Petroleum is going to be responsible for 10 national wildlife refuges run by U.S. Fish and Wildfire , of a cornucopia of wildlife , beautiful beaches , salt marshes , sandy barrier islands .
It 's a home of black skimmers .
It is largest tern colony in the United States .
And it 's -- to be not stepping forward and talking about the wildlife cost , what 's going to happen to the economy in Louisiana now , and to be doing the kind of mealy - mouthed statement you just read tells me that British Petroleum is -- is going to be in deeper trouble and as the days come , because they 're not facing the consequences of what the company 's responsible for .
GUPTA : You know a fair amount about this industry , Doug .
And , you know , one thing , when you talk about the rigs , you talk about the company itself , BP's CEO , Tony Hayward , has laid blame on Transocean , saying , basically , it 's their rig , it 's their equipment , it 's their people , their systems , their safety processes .
I mean , does he have a point in that at all ?
BRINKLEY : Of course .
And they 're also hired by British Petroleum .
Both of them are going to be culpable for this .
The problem is , we have had a lot of drill , baby , drill , and it 's spill , baby , spill .
People have been telling American people that offshore drilling is dangerous .
What we have heard is , oh , well , it 's changed .
There 's new technology .
We 're now green .
British Petroleum 's logo said they 're for beyond petroleum .
What 's new - energy about this ?
It 's dirty oil devastating communities in Louisiana and killing some of our richest wildlife areas .
Some of these wildlife places Theodore Roosevelt saved .
President Roosevelt went down there .
GUPTA : Yes .
BRINKLEY : He camped there .
And we 're going to be -- you 're going to be seeing devastation to wildlife in the coming days almost unimaginable .
GUPTA : We have seen -- you have written about this .
Seen pictures certainly of him in that area as well .
A lot more on this , I 'm sure , in the days to come .
Thanks so much for joining us , Douglas Brinkley .
Appreciate it .
BRINKLEY : Thank you .
No problem .
Update : Brinkley appeared on CNN the following night and ripped Sarah Palin for being a mouthpiece for the oil industry in Alaska .
Flusswasser zu warm Atomkraftwerken droht der Hitzestopp
Deutschland stöhnt unter tropischen Temperaturen - und auch die Atomkraftwerke kämpfen mit den Folgen der Hitzewelle .
Erwärmt sich das Kühlwasser aus Rhein , Neckar und Elbe noch weiter , droht am Wochenende die Zwangsabschaltung .

Here 's reason number 7,082 why Amanda Palmer is awesome :
The Dresden Dolls frontwoman is celebrating her victory over Roadrunner Records with an EP of Radiohead covers played on ukulele .
The songs were recorded in Australia after she learned how to play the mini-guitar " as a joke " to do a memorable cover of Radiohead 's " Creep " at a pal 's benefit for Iranian punk musicians , the clip of which went viral .
The EP is titled Amanda Palmer Plays The Popular Hits of Radiohead on Her Magical Ukulele , and has a kitschy album cover to match .
Tracks include " Idioteque " ( the first single , available now via Bandcamp and posted below ) , " Creep " , " No Surprises " , " High and Dry " , " Fake Plastic Trees " and a version of " Exit Music ( For a Film ) " for piano and string quartet recorded live at The Sydney Opera House .

Idioteque ( Amanda Palmer Cover )
Unhappy at being treated “ increasingly badly ” at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1985 and as a result eager to begin an institute of his own within which to continue his research , 26 - year - old computer scientist Stephen Wolfram looked to ex-colleague and physics Nobelist Richard Feynman for advice .
Feynman ’s honest , humorous , and less than encouraging response can be read below .
Needless to say Wolfram did n’t heed his advice and the next year founded UIUC ‘s Center for Complex Systems Research ; then , in 1987 , he formed Wolfram Research , the company responsible for releasing Mathematica in 1989 and , more recently , Wolfram Alpha .
A much - needed transcript follows .
Many thanks to Keeley .

Princeton , NJ 08540 Dear Wolfram : 1 . It is not my opinion that the present organizational structure of science inhibits “ complexity research ” – I do not believe such an institution is necessary .
2 . You say you want to create your own environment – but you will not be doing that : you will create ( perhaps ! ) an environment that you might like to work in – but you will not be working in this environment – you will be administering it – and the administration environment is not what you seek – is it ?
You wo n’t enjoy administrating people because you wo n’t succeed in it .
You do n’t understand “ ordinary people . ”
To you they are “ stupid fools ” – so you will not tolerate them or treat their foibles with tolerance or patience – but will drive yourself wild ( or they will drive you wild ) trying to deal with them in an effective way .
Find a way to do your research with as little contact with non-technical people as possible , with one exception , fall madly in love !
That is my advice , my friend .

Officials from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria say they fear they will not come close to the $ 17 billion target they set for their next donors ’ meeting in September .
The other , more welcome , distraction has been the exciting results of a South African clinical trial in which a vaginal gel with an antiretroviral drug protected 40 percent of the women using it .
This is the first good news about microbicides in decades of work .
A gel women can use secretly has long been sought , since many men disdain condoms and many women want to get pregnant .
The Vienna Declaration is only the second time that the International AIDS Society has issued such a document .
The last was the 2000 Durban Declaration , which reaffirmed that H.I.V. was the cause of AIDS .
It was a response to the government of South Africa , the conference ’s host , which at the time denied that the virus caused disease and refused to buy medicine for its citizens .
Outside of Africa , almost a third of all H.I.V. infections stem from drug injections .
The declaration contends that arresting drug users forces them into hiding , spreading the epidemic .
It backs “ science - based public health approaches " proved in clinical trials , which can include everything clean needle swaps , 12 - step recovery programs and methadone .
Dr. Evan Wood , an AIDS policy expert at the University of British Columbia and the chief author , cited Portugal ’s approach .
According to a 2009 report by the libertarian Cato Institute , in the decade since Portugal legalized possession of up to 10 days ’ worth of any drug , including cocaine and heroin , its AIDS rate dropped by half , overdose deaths fell , many citizens sought treatment , drug use among young people fell and drug tourism did not develop .
The institute called the policy “ a resounding success . ”
The declaration is largely aimed at countries of the former Soviet Union .
In Russia , for example , close to 1 percent of its adult population is infected .
Nonetheless , the country forbids all methadone - type treatments , and the national health plan offers only abrupt detoxification , which has a high failure rate .
The most frequent victims — prisoners and people not living in their assigned residence areas — are the least likely to get AIDS drugs , and activists say markups vastly inflate the prices of medications bought cheaply by foreign donors .
We were reminiscing about our croissant taste - off last year , when a ridiculous plan was hatched and quickly spun out of control .
Doughnuts .
Let ’s see where the well - known favorites stack up against Seattle ’s mom and pop shops .
We retrieved doughnuts from all ends of the city and convened on Father ’s Day morning for a taste - off of epic proportions .
If you thought four dozen croissants was excessive , try eleven dozen doughnuts in the same room .
Perhaps it was an ambitious plan .
The Contenders
Family Donut Shop .
An unassuming strip mall shop in the Northgate area is where those in the know stop for their sugar - rush , whether it ’s a fritter , cruller , or a basic raised .
Frost Doughnuts .
Open for less than a year , this is the youngest doughnut shop in our taste - off , offering sophisticated creations out of their boutique shop in Mill Creek .
The shop is so popular that they are rumored to be looking for a second location closer to Seattle .
King Donuts .
They sell teriyaki and doughnuts next to a Maytag Laundromat in Rainier Beach .
Needless to say , we were curious to see what kind of doughnuts are baked in a place like this .
Teriyaki doughnuts while you wait for your last load to finish spinning ?
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts .
The Original Glazed Krispy Kreme was popular across the country before they opened three stores in the Seattle area , including the SODO location where we picked up fresh glazed doughnuts for our taste - off .
Mighty - O Donuts .
Organic vegan doughnuts might make you imagine a tofu ring covered in glaze , but you would be hard - pressed to identify their doughnut as vegan in a line - up .
While the bakery is situated in Wallingford , you can also find these doughnuts in high - end area grocery stores like Whole Foods and Madison Market .
Original Bakery .
Open for decades , this neighborhood favorite in West Seattle is our oldest taste - off contender .
They sell no - frills doughnuts and other home style bakery items to go with your coffee at this friendly family - owned shop .
Top Pot Doughnuts .

Pot ’s “ hand - forged ” doughnuts are in such demand that they ’ve now got six brick - and - mortar shops , along with an Airstream mobile unit , plus a presence at our own Qwest field and in Starbucks across the country .
The doughnuts for this taste - off came from their original location in north Capitol Hill .
Lara Ferroni ’s homemade doughnuts .
How do homemade doughnuts stack up against the very best doughnut shops in Seattle ?
Lara made us a few batches from her soon - to - be- published Doughnuts cookbook , which is scheduled to hit bookstores this fall .
No fancy , professional bakery equipment here ; just a stovetop pot and thermometer .
We should note for our taste test that only two of the twelve people judging knew that there were homemade doughnuts in the mix , so the doughnuts were judged as if they were from a professional bakery .
The Judges
Six couples , three kids , two babies , plus one on the way gathered after some self - imposed carb fasting .
Those with voting rights were our hosts Kye Soon Hong and Eric Vigessa , along with Catherine Reynolds and Ken O’Hara , Laurie and Matthew Amster - Burton , Rebekah Denn and David Dickey , Michael and Robin Bruchas , plus yours truly .
Revealing the results
The Ranking Method
This was a blind taste taste , with an arbitrary letter assigned to each doughnut for identification .
Each person independently stack ranked them , from their most to least favorite .
A doughnut was given one point when it was the top of someone ’s list , a second choice doughnut received two points , all the way on down the list .
So if there are seven doughnuts , the best possible score is 12 ( i.e. when everyone ranks it top on their list ) and the worst possible score is 84 ( all twelve people rank it 7th on their list ) .
The Categories
We decided that the only way to make a fair comparison between shops was to compare the same kind of doughnut from each place .
However , it was tough to whittle the playing field so that we could avoid each person having to eat dozens of different doughnuts on a single morning .
( I know , you ’re asking , how is that a bad thing ? )
To focus our attention on the doughnut recipe , we stuck with the quintessential plain cake and glazed raised doughnuts as our categories .
This meant we ’d only have to try around a dozen different doughnuts , which should be no problem , right ?
But then we got tempted by all of the other doughnut possibilities .
Apple fritter ?
Buttermilk bar ?
Bismark ?
How could we ignore each doughnut shop ’s specialty ?
In the end , we decided a third category might be disastrous , but we would allow a specialty doughnut flavor from each shop , which people could taste , but these doughnuts would not be part of the judging .
The Plain Cake Doughnut
A plain cake might not be the doughnut that you choose when you ’re distracted by chocolate , maple glaze , sprinkles , and jelly .
But it ’s an important doughnut because it tells you a lot about the bakery .
What is the flavor of the oil they use for frying ?
Is the cake dense or light ?
What kind of crumb ?
Is it fried with a crunchy or soft exterior ?
And besides , sometimes a plain doughnut is all that will do for dunking into your coffee .
And in case you ’re wondering , no , Dunkin ’ Donuts was not a participant in our taste - off , since they closed all west coast outposts a couple years ago .
Krispy Kreme was the only one of our contenders that did n’t participate in this category , because let ’s be real here : which doughnut do you buy when you go to Krispy Kreme ?
7th place : A majority ranked Mighty - O ’s doughnut dead last , due to the off - flavor ( excessive baking soda and the taste of corn oil ? ) and lack of crunch to the crust .
With a uniform texture throughout , it was uninteresting and bland , garnering a score of 74 .
6th place : Top
Pot was all over the map , landing everywhere except in the number one spot on the stack rankings .
But the median score was 5 , giving it an overall rating of 53 .
The texture on this doughnut was bready with no crunchy crust , and some felt that it was oily , with a strong nutmeg or clove flavor .
5th place :
With only a point advantage over 6th place ( 52 ) , Frost had a score distribution similar to Top Pot .
This is a very sweet doughnut that seemed bland to some , and like Mighty - O and Top Pot , it had a soft exterior with no crunch .
4th place :
The rankings for Family Donut ran the gamut .
It might have placed better if it had n’t been fried in slightly rancid old oil , since it was crunchy with a good open crumb .
Overall , it received a score of 48 .
3rd place : Homemade doughnuts did well in our taste - test , yielding two first - place votes and an overall score of 46 .
The crust was crisp , which was an important criteria for most in the cake category , and there was a good crumb with a subtle nutmeg flavor .
2nd place :
The sweet , cakelike doughnut from King Donuts made it into the top two slots in half of our stack rankings .
Its score was 35 .
The nutmeg was well balanced and while many liked the texture and crunch , a few felt that it was a bit too fluffy .
1st place : Original Bakery was the clear winner with a majority voting the cake doughnut as their favorite .
The crunchy crust and light interior made this the perfect doughnut for many .
This doughnut had a slightly unique ( some called it citrusy ) flavor to it , unlike the customary nutmeg flavor .
Was it cinnamon ?
However , there were a few who did n’t go for the non-traditional flavor of this doughnut , resulting in a score of 28 .
Raised Glazed
Raised dough is a canvas for many people ’s favorite doughnuts : jelly - filled , maple bars , bismarks , and the ever - classic raised glazed .
This category was harder to judge than the cake category .
A few people mentioned that they thought only the top few cake doughnuts were worth eating , whereas they would be happy eating any of the raised doughnuts , including the lower ranked ones .
The rankings here were based more on subtle nuances , although the highest ranked tended to be doughnuts that had an airy soft interior with a touch of crunch on the edges .
Mighty - O does n’t make a raised glazed , so did n’t participate in this category , and we were unfortunately unable to include Top Pot ’s ring for this tasting .
Next time .
6th place : Homemade doughnuts did not fare as well in this round as in the previous round .
Raised doughnuts can be tricky to make without professional equipment like a proof box , and some felt that they tasted a bit yeasty and not as sweet as the others .
The overall score was 69 .
5th place : Half ranked the Frost Doughnut fifth on their stack ranking , but the rest placed it higher .
The resulting score of 44 put it marginally behind the next couple doughnuts .
This doughnut was more cakey than the higher ranked doughnuts , and some felt that it , too , was yeasty .
4th place :
With a very sweet dough , Krispy Kreme ’s Original Glazed doughnut was no one ’s favorite , rating an overall score of 42 .
It was uniformly soft and had a shiny thick glaze .
And yes , our Krispy Kremes were eaten at room temperature , just like all the other doughnuts .
3rd place : Family Donut had four first place votes , but the rest of the votes spanned the entire range , pulling it down to a score of 39 .
This doughnut was fairly sweet and if it did n’t have a slight old - oil flavor similar to their raised , it might have placed higher .
2nd place : Half of the people placed Original Bakery ’s doughnut in their top two , and a couple said this was a clear winner above the rest .
This sweet doughnut had a strong nutmeg flavor and a bit of a crunch to the edges that people liked .
The overall rating was 35 .
1st place : The King Donut was far and away the favorite , with nearly everyone placing it into their top three , and five ranking it their favorite .
It came in with a score of 23 .
The doughnut had a good all - around flavor and sweetness , plus a great soft texture .
With so many favoring this doughnut , it makes me wonder if their teriyaki is as good .
Specialty Doughnuts
As a way to showcase the best of each bakery , everyone brought in a specialty doughnut to taste .
The red velvet from Frost was beautiful and with cream cheese frosting to boot .
Mighty - O ’s raspberry lemon poppy seed was soft and tangy .
Lara supplied cute sugared twists and doughnut holes that were the perfect small bites .
And we could see why the bismark from Original Bakery has a loyal following .
I even tried my own hand at doughnuts , using Lara ’s German chocolate recipe , and for my first homemade doughnuts ever , I was pretty pleased with the results .
Since they were easy to make , and I saved the used fry oil in my fridge , I ’d like to try her banana doughnuts next .
Or maybe the ricotta fritters .
Then there were the apple fritters .
Nobody knew who was bringing which specialty doughnuts , so we did n’t plan to have four different apple fritters .
But perhaps it should n’t be much of a surprise , with this being a classic favorite .
So we set up the plates for a spontaneous third taste - off .
Apple Fritter
One of our judges almost defected from her job when she heard that she would need to judge another round , but she rallied for the last four doughnuts .
There seemed to be two camps to the apple fritter lovers : some like the crunchy edges and others prefer the soft inside .
Since the fritters were each very different from one another , this resulted in voting being pretty scattered among the fritters , with one clear favorite .
4th place :
The fritter from Top Pot Doughnuts was very traditional - looking in shape , with quite a bit of soft interior and a thick coating of glaze .
The edges were somewhat crunchy , and several thought the whole thing was too sweet .
As with every doughnut in this category , the votes spanned the whole range , although the Top Pot fritter was last on half our rankings .
The overall score was 34 .
Tie for 2nd place :
The two fritters taking second could not have looked and tasted more different from one another .
The one from King Donuts was a regular - shaped soft puffy square , with lots of apple bits , while the one from Frost Doughnuts was a crunchy maze of crazy - shaped dough drizzled with caramel .
Nearly everyone gave these two fritters a 2nd or 3rd place ranking , leaving them with a tied score of 31 .
1st place :
The flattest fritter with the crunchiest edges was from Family Donut Shop .
This one was a deep caramel - colored brown , and preferred by a majority of our judges , coming in with a score of 24 .
Our conclusion was that doughnut judging is a lot more difficult than croissants .
With so many variations on even the standard recipe , not to mention the toppings and flavors that we did n’t even touch , the type of doughnut you like and consider the “ best ” may very well be quite different from mine , or our judging here .
But we did discover two things .
One : there are a lot of good doughnuts hiding in nooks and crannies of this city , certainly more than we tasted on this morning .
Any suggestions for other favorites we should try ?
And two : we will never again try to taste 22 different doughnuts in a single morning .
The carnage
What should we taste - test next ?
Cupcakes ?
Baguettes ?
When I first came to Marina , I knew where I wanted to be in life , I just did n’t know how to get there .

Boing Boing reader Andrea Dickson says ,
My local NPR station had this story on Friday afternoon , in which Puget Sound area convents are being investigated by the Vatican , based on what appears to a survey of the nuns ' opinions .
I think this is a great way for the Catholic Church to follow up on its recent spate of PR brilliance .
These nuns work to end human trafficking : heaven forbid they be considered " feminists " or " activists " or somehow less than " obedient . "
Snip from the KUOW story :
The Archdiocese of Seattle says the Adrian Dominicans in Woodway , the Renton Sisters of Providence and the Tacoma Dominicans are on the list .
Sister Joyce Cox is the Archbishop 's Delegate for Religious .
She says it 's not clear what this latest development — or the entire investigation — means .
Cox : " Ordinarily visitations are made because there is something of great concern , or some place of scandal or not having integrity to the origins of our life . "
(…) The Seattle - area communities were chosen for visits after investigators reviewed responses to questionnaires sent out to every women 's order .
The Vatican 's 20 - page questionnaire asks about the extent of communities ' obedience to the Church and their handling of nuns who dissent .
Apple recently launched an HTML5 showcase on its official website with several demos that are intended to highlight some of the advanced Web development capabilities that are made available by emerging standards .
The showcase has attracted criticism from standards advocates , however , because it pops up a message telling users that they will need to download Safari in order to view the demos .
Some of the demos legitimately require Safari because they use Apple - specific Web features that are still at extremely early stages of the standardization process , but most of the demos will function properly in Chrome and Firefox .
Apple 's clumsy browser detection mechanism and careless attitude about the distinction between Safari features and actual standards has raised some troubling questions for the Web community .
It 's worth noting from the start that the underlying idea of Apple 's HTML5 showcase is not itself controversial .
In fact , the Mozilla Hacks blog and Google 's Chrome Experiments gallery both serve similar purposes .
All three sites have some demos and content that rely to an extent on nascent technologies that are not yet supported across multiple browsers .
It 's also important to understand that browser - specific features are a necessary and important part of the Web 's evolution — most new features that become standards are originally implemented in some experimental form by one of the major browser vendors .
The problem is that Apple 's showcase lacks sufficient disclosure and clarity regarding the level of cross - browser support and industry acceptance for individual features .
Some of the language on the showcase page is misleading , and the message that it displays to non-Safari users is detrimental to the long - term goals of the HTML5 standards effort .
Telling users that they need one specific browser in order to view HTML5 content downplays the availability of HTML5 support in other modern browsers and wrongly inflates the perception that HTML5 is fragmented .
It 's also troubling because it sets a bad example for third - party Web developers regarding best practices for browser detection .
Oddly enough , Apple has a whole separate version of the showcase on its developer website that exhibits none of these offensive characteristics .
The more appropriately named " Safari Technology Demos " page has the same demos , but does n't categorically block alternate browsers .
I was able to test the demos in Chrome and found that most of them worked as expected .
This alternate page is accessible by clicking the " Developers " link at the bottom of the HTML5 showcase .
This alternate version of the showcase is much closer to how it should be done .
I do n't think that anybody objects to Apple having a Safari Technology Demos page that shows off a mix of emerging Web standards and Safari features .
But it 's not appropriate to conflate browser - specific functionality and open standards in the manner that the HTML5 showcase page does .
Mozilla evangelist Chris Blizzard voiced his concern about the issue in a recent blog entry .
He characterizes Apple 's HTML5 showcase as a misguided marketing stunt and explains why it is detrimental to the browser ecosystem .
He says that the browser block on the demos is a " F**k You " to the people who make and run other standards - compliant browsers .
He also voices some criticism of Google , which he says has made similar mistakes in promoting its Native Client technology and other nonstandard features .
" Apple 's messaging is clearly meant to say ' hey , we love the web ' but the actual demos they have and the fact that actively block other browsers from those demos do n't match their messaging .
It 's not intellectually honest at all , " Blizzard wrote .
" HTML5 is in a dangerous place since everyone wants to own it , but everyone is in a different place in terms of support or even what it means .
I ca n’t promise what other organizations will do , but I can at least say what I will do in the future .
At Mozilla , intellectual honesty matters and it matters to me personally .
So I do n’t think you ’ll see us do things like this in the future . "
Indeed , Mozilla has a reasonably good track record when it comes to accurately conveying the standardization status of Web technologies .
This is particularly evident in the Mozilla Hacks blog , where posts consistently include appropriate disclosure in cases where nonstandard or Mozilla - specific technologies are discussed .
The real power of HTML5 is that it is vendor - neutral technology that anyone can implement and support with their own authoring tools .
Apple should change its HTML5 showcase page to reflect the true spirit of the standard : interoperability and cross - browser support .
ROUEN , France Ã¢â‚¬â€ 
A prisoner who killed his cellmate and devoured his lung with fried onions put France ’s troubled prison system under critical new scrutiny Tuesday .
Thirty - nine - year - old Nicolas Cocaign is on trial for the murder of Thierry Baudry , whom he punched , stabbed with a pair of scissors and suffocated with a rubbish bag before cutting him open with a razor blade .

After removing a rib , Cocaign pulled out a lung , which he mistook for his victim ’s heart , ate part of it raw and then fried the rest of it with onions on a makeshift stove in his cell , prosecutors say .
The court will hear findings from a report however into a string of “ failures ” at the jail in the northwestern city of Rouen where Cocaign was at the time of the cannibal killing in January 2007 .
On the first day of the trial , Cocaign testified that authorities ignored his appeals for psychological help even though he had a long history of mental illness .
“ No one was listening to me , ” the bearded and heavily tattooed detainee told the court .
“ I made several appeals for help , saying I was a man capable of being dangerous .
I took action , and then they took me seriously . ”
The prison director , Yves Bidet , will take the witness stand on Tuesday after a coroner confirmed the circumstances of Baudry ’s death by multiple stab wounds and strangulation .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Everything that Nicolas Cocaign said has been confirmed by our observations and the autopsy , ” said chief coroner Pierre Bohers .
The Baudry family lawyer suggested that conditions at the Rouen jail were also to blame for the gruesome murder .
Cocaign allegedly committed the crime following a dispute with Baudry whom he accused of plugging up the toilet with rolls of paper .
ADVERTISEMENT
Three men shared the small cell where the murder took place and severe overcrowding has been regularly cited as a problem in French jails .
“ How was it bearable for three people to share a cell of 11 square metres ? ” said lawyer Etienne Noel , representing the Baudry family .

The “ cannibal ” trial opened a week after a separate tribunal ruled in favour of 38 inmates and former inmates who complained of degrading conditions at the Rouen jail , which opened in 1864 .
The administrative court ordered the French state to pay compensation of between 350 and 17,500 euros ( 430 to 21,500 dollars ) to the plaintiffs after finding that most of the cells did not have proper sanitation nor ventilation .
With one of the highest suicide rates in Europe , French prisons are also regularly criticised by the Strasbourg - based European court of rights for failing to provide basic needs .
ADVERTISEMENT
Mental health experts are to testify during the trial this week as to whether Cocaign was sufficiently sane to face criminal charge for his acts .
A verdict is expected on Thursday .
Born in 1971 , Cocaign was abandoned by his 21 - year - old homeless mother and cared for by the state until he was adopted aged three .
From the age of six he was already under the care of a psychologist .
Reports from his childhood suggest he had difficulty telling right from wrong and his mental difficulties worsened when he was allegedly raped , aged 13 .
After this he developed “ violent sexual compulsions ” .
He was convicted of drug possession when he was 22 and later hospitalised on several occasions with mental illness .
He complained to the court that he was not given drug treatment after release , despite asking for it .

“ My compulsions were still there , so … ” he said .
Cocaign was serving time for several rape convictions and other violent offences .
Image caption GM crops are much less widespread in Europe than in the US
A genetically modified ( GM ) variety of maize banned in the EU has been sown accidentally across Germany .
The NK603 variety has been planted in seven states .
The seed supplier , US firm Pioneer Hi-Bred , called the level of contamination " minute " .
It is not clear how the mistake occurred , but it could cost farmers millions of euros , as crops will now have to be destroyed .
The EU is currently reviewing its tight rules on the cultivation of GM crops .
Pioneer Hi-Bred , based in Buxtehude near Hamburg , says NK603 has been planted on " just under 2,000 hectares ( 4,940 acres ) " of land .
The environmental group Greenpeace put the area as high as 3,000 hectares .
Bavaria , Baden - Wuerttemberg and Lower Saxony are among the states where it has been sown .
Information delayed
Supporters of GM crops argue that they deliver higher yields and resistance to pests , requiring less fertiliser and pesticides .
Opponents say more scientific data is needed , arguing that their long - term genetic impact on humans and wildlife could be harmful .
They also say GM crops can enter the food chain inadvertently if they are naturally cross-pollinated with non-GM varieties .
Greenpeace says that officials knew about the contamination in early March , but that because of bureaucratic delays farmers are only now being warned .
" This is the biggest GM crop scandal in Germany to date , " said a Greenpeace agriculture expert , Alexander Hissting .
Ploughing up fields
In the affected fields , up to 0.1 % of the crop is contaminated with NK603 - equivalent to 100 contaminated plants per hectare , Greenpeace says .
Pioneer Hi-Bred disputes that figure .
Company spokesman Mike Hall told the BBC that the level of NK603 detected in the " conventional seed " was 0.03 % .
" It 's highly unlikely that it 's a GM trace .
Anything below 0.1 % could be a false positive , impossible to quantify scientifically , " he said .
" In the past when they found trace amounts we removed the seed from the market .
In this case they told us after it had been planted . "
Stefanie Becker , spokeswoman for Lower Saxony 's Environment Ministry , said that " fields will have to be ploughed up before the maize blooms - it is still possible to halt the uncontrolled spread [ of the GM variety ] " .
She said her ministry did not get details about the distribution of the GM maize until last Friday .
" We have the distributors ' names , and through them the farmers will be informed , " she told the BBC .
Ms Becker said the contamination affected about 2,000 hectares and originated from two sacks of seeds .
It is not yet clear how the seeds got mixed up , she said .
EU divided
So far the EU has allowed only two GM crops to be cultivated - Monsanto 's MON 810 maize and a type of potato harvested for starch .
But Germany , like some other EU countries , banned MON 810 last year .
EU member states are divided over GM crops .
Commercial GM planting takes place in Spain , Portugal and the Czech Republic .
But France , Germany , Austria and Greece are among several states that have banned MON 810 .
The GM maize that has spread in Germany " is not harmful to human or animal health " , Ms Becker said .
The European Commission is overhauling the rules on GM crops and will present new proposals next month allowing member states more freedom to allow or ban GM varieties .
Countries would be allowed to set their own technical standards for GM farming , including buffer zones to prevent cross-pollination .
The new rules will still require approval by EU governments and the European Parliament .
Today the ACLU , the ACLU of Connecticut and the Electronic Frontier Foundation once again took a stand against warrantless cell phone tracking , in a friend - of - the - court brief submitted to a federal judge in Connecticut .
Cell phones are not just communications devices , they 're tracking devices .
Your cell phone provider can generate a continuous stream of location information , and many providers store this information for months or even longer .
This data is law enforcement 's best friend .
It 's also a highly sensitive portrait of a cell phone user 's life , tracing their movements wherever they go for an indefinite period of time .
The proper way to reconcile these two interests is to require the government to get a warrant and show probable cause before tracking .
That is what we argued in our brief today .
We hope the judge gives serious weight to the privacy interests at stake and rule that a warrant is required .
There is an especially interesting wrinkle in this case .
The government got tracking information , not just for the criminal defendant , but for 179 other people .
Although the details are still unclear , because the government 's surveillance application is apparently under seal , it appears that to figure out who was involved in the crime , the government took the dragnet approach of getting location information for this vast number of people .
We 've heard rumors of this approach before — when law enforcement tracks everyone in what it calls a " community of interest " — but this is a rare public confirmation that it takes place .
This sort of mass , generalized surveillance is worrying because it raises the prospect that many , many innocent people are tracked .
This needle - in - a - haystack approach to government scrutiny of our private lives cannot be what the framers of our Constitution envisioned .
Courts and Congress should put a stop to this .
Congress is currently considering reforming the electronic surveillance laws , and this " community of interest " approach should be at the top of its list of practices to be ended .

WASHINGTON 
When it comes to the deficit , Ben S. Bernanke has a story , and he ’s sticking to it .
Mr. Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , warned on Wednesday that “ the federal budget appears to be on an unsustainable path , ” but also recognized that an “ exceptional increase ” in the deficit had been necessary to ease the pain of recession .
In nearly two hours of questioning by the House Budget Committee , however , Mr. Bernanke gave potential succor to members of both parties , while refusing to side with either of them .
To Republicans , he offered warnings about the fiscal perils of an aging population and the potential threat of soaring long - term interest rates .
To Democrats , he made it clear that persistently high unemployment was a drag on growth and said that additional short - term stimulus spending might be needed .
All the while , Mr. Bernanke refused to endorse any particular spending cuts or tax increases , or even specify the balance between the two .
And he was not subtle about his strategy .
Simple Teriyaki Burgers
The weather is perfect for grilling teriyaki burgers .
A while back , we were lamenting about how overly sweet and artificial some bottled teriyaki sauces were .
With the exception of one that we liked on our teriyaki burgers , most were too sugary and processed tasting .
With the grilling season underway , we wanted some teriyaki variety to our bbq menu and it was always a struggle to search for a bottle that did n’t look like a gob of sugary , sticky brown sauce .
We needed to think outside the bottle and needed to be quick about it because guests were coming over in a few hours .
Mission : think fast and work fresh .
How difficult was it to make a homemade , fresh teriyaki glaze for our burgers ?
Not at all .
It was one of the easiest sauce recipes we ’ve ever created and ca n’t believe our bbq ’s went without it .
Homemade Teriyaki Sauce
We originally shared a version of this teriyaki sauce on our Bountiful Cookbook .
We wanted to let everyone see just how simple this homemade sauce can be and you ’ll never go back to a bottle again .
Homemade teriyaki sauce is customizable to your palate of sweetness , tartness and stickyness , or all three .
The addition of some extra brown sugar highlights the fruity sweetness of the pineapple and a bit of extra vinegar elevates the teriyaki to extra tang .
This wonderful recipe can be made with a fresh pineapple or a can of good quality canned pineapple .
Glaze it on beef , chicken or vegetable and poking some sticks in the for teriyaki skewers !
Choose your strategy , flavor profile and taste .
Do what your want because it ’s YOUR sauce , your bbq and your celebration of grilling .
Best Mango Salsa !
To accompany our burgers , we added some fresh and fruity mango salsa , which turned out great !
Even the mango salsa is great on its own with a bag of tortilla chips or topped on some fish tacos .
There ’s so many amazing foods to dive into this Summer , we ca n’t wait to figure out how to eat all this Summer inspiration before the season ends .
Happy Eating !

• A local , slice - of - life story from a Monitor correspondent .
Every day , a few hours before sunset , when shadows become longer and the heat less intense , black men in bright red and yellow jerseys gather near the Olympic Stadium to play soccer .
The men are from Africa – mostly Nigeria and Ghana – and they have formed their own team in Cambodia ’s capital .
The number of soccer players from Africa here has skyrocketed in the past three years , says May Tola , the spokesman for the Football Federation of Cambodia .
While the reasons behind the spike are unclear , Mr. Tola says it took place around the time the Football Federation started charging for tickets , and athletes ’ salaries were raised from $ 20 to $ 30 per month to between $ 70 and $ 300 per month .
In the past , most aspiring African soccer players went to Europe .
With that market now saturated , players are chasing opportunities across Southeast Asia .
“ Cambodia is like a steppingstone for African players , ” Tola says .
Jeff Emeka - Eke , from Ghana , makes $ 450 per month – enough to send some money to his mother .
But for others , the situation is different .
Recruited from Africa by agents , the number of aspiring African players in Cambodia now far exceeds the spots available on professional teams , which set quotas for non-Cambodians .
In order to keep their ball skills sharp , the Africans formed their own amateur team .
But besides no pay , there are other risks .
In May , Nigerian Wilson Mene collapsed during a game and died .
His death brought much needed regulatory reforms to the fore .
“ Many clubs take advantage [ of the fact ] that they can get these African players for close to nothing , ” says Gabriel Ken Gadaffi , the president of Cambodia ’s Nigerian Community Association .
“ It is not fair . ”
In response , the federation will require medical certificates and formal contracts , starting next season , in order to play in the league .

How to handle input data tolerances and how to track error propagation while performing the calculations ?
" If it ca n't be quantified , then it 's not engineering , but only a guess . "
Vern Lindberg
Error in science and engineering does not equal a mistake .
Rather , it represents the inevitable uncertainty that happens because of empirical measurements and cannot be perfectly corrected .
All measurements in practice and even in principle have some error associated with them ; no measured quantity can be determined with infinite precision and zero deviation .
Without proper error analysis , no valid scientific conclusions can be drawn .
In fact , wrong results can happen if error analysis is ignored .
We tend to use the words accuracy and precision interchangeably but in science and engineering they are clearly distinguished .
Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the expected value .
Using an archery target analogy where an arrow represents a measurement and the bulls - eye represents the expected or accepted value , accuracy corresponds to the distance between the arrows and the bulls - eye .
Using the archery analogy , precision is the distance between each arrow , irrespective of where they lie on the target with respect to the bulls - eye .
The grouping of arrows could be tightly clustered but a long way from the bulls - eye .
Mathematically , accuracy is the maximum error we introduce because we truncate the digits .
Therefore , accuracy refers to the number of significant digits in a number .
On the other hand , precision is the number of digits available to represent the mantissa ( the part of the number after the decimal point ) .
But beware !
It is possible to have high precision with poor accuracy .
As an example , lets perform basic multiplication and division operations on real numbers ( shown in blue color ) .
We will assume that all the initial values contain significant digits only .
Column a ) shows step - by - step operations without consideration of margin of error of intermediate values .
The column b ) calculations are made according to set of rules for approximate calculations adopted by scientific community ( see rules 2 and 4 below ) :
Even this simple 4 step example proves how illusory can be the precision of the inaccurate value obtained while ignoring error propagation through computations .
ARCAD online short circuit calculator carefully handles input data tolerances and tracks error propagation through massive computations associated with short circuit analyzes .
Listed are some of the rules for approximate calculations adopted by the calculator :
When quantities are being added or subtracted , the number of decimal places ( not significant digits ) in the answer should be the same as the least number of decimal places in any of the numbers being added or subtracted .
In calculations involving multiplication and division , the number of significant digits in an answer should equal the least number of significant digits in any one of the numbers being multiplied or divided .
When finding the square root of a number , the result has the same accuracy as the number
When doing multiple - step calculations , keep one more significant digit than required by rules above in intermediate results .
This digit is dropped off the final result .
In this manner , phenomenon known as " round - off error " is effectively avoided .
If one of the original factors has more significant digits than the other , round the more accurate number to one more significant digit than appears in the less accurate number .
The extra digit protects the answer from the effects of multiple rounding .
In conventional error propagation theory , errors always increase when quantities are added , subtracted , multiplied , divided or operated in any other fashion .
In other words , errors always combine in the worst possible way .
The online short circuit calculator 's hard - coded error propagation rules take into consideration the fact that error in one variable happens to cancel out some of the error in the other variable and so , on average , the total error will be less than the sum of the errors in its parts .
It is proved that the results calculated using the rules above contain significant digits only .
Expressing Errors
There are two common and acceptable ways to display errors :
Absolute error :
Half the smallest significant digit Relative error : Error = ( measured - expected ) / expected
Consider for example number 5 x 101 .
There is only 1 significant digit for the least precise input value .
That significant digit is in the 10's column .
Therefore , half that significant digit ( i.e. , 10/2 = 5 ) can be assigned as the absolute error i.e. , 50 +/- 5 would be an appropriate way to express the error for that quantity .
This corresponds to 5/50 or approx 10 % .

Chicago Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville may have won the Stanley Cup ... but looks like his friends had bowls -- not cups -- on their minds .
After the ' hawks won the Cup Wednesday -- for the first time in 49 years -- some fans celebrated with a good ole fashioned tp party at coach 's house .
TMZ Sports got these pics of Quenneville on clean - up duty .
We 're told all and all he was a good sport .
THE FACTS
This time of year , allergies and the promise of air - conditioning tend to drive people indoors .
But for those who can take the heat and cope with the pollen , spending more time in nature might have some surprising health benefits .
In a series of studies , scientists found that when people swap their concrete confines for a few hours in more natural surroundings  forests , parks and other places with plenty of trees  they experience increased immune function .

Stress reduction is one factor .
But scientists also chalk it up to phytoncides , the airborne chemicals that plants emit to protect them from rotting and insects and which also seem to benefit humans .

With the news that the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously decidedthat the FCC 's indecency policy — for fleeting expletives — is vague and unconstitutional , we 've compiled a celebratory reel featuring our favorite uncensored moments of women cursing on live TV .
US President Barack Obama has called on his party and supporters to back a " new future " of clean energy .
Visiting areas affected by the BP oil spill , he said the full resources of government were being used , with 17,500 National Guard soldiers available .
BP 's US head , Lamar McKay , is to return to Congress shortly for further questioning .
Oil has been spewing into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig it leased exploded and sank in April .
This week , the BBC is assessing the impact of the Louisiana oil spill .
To see the scale of the new deep water drilling rigs in one of the world 's biggest and deepest off - shore fields , join BBC World News in Brazil on Tuesday with Paulo Cabral .
Full coverage of the oil disaster
The company has put the cost of the clean - up to date at $ 1.6bn ( £ 1bn ) .
Mr Obama has been touring Mississippi , Alabama and Florida , on his fourth visit to the region since the spill .
He promised Americans living on the Gulf of Mexico that their beaches would be restored to pristine condition , vowing that he would bring full force to bear on BP to pay for the damage from oil pollution .
He is due to put his demands to BP executives when he meets them face to face for the first time on Wednesday .
On Monday , the company 's share price once again fell sharply , dropping 9 % in London and New York .
Directors also met to discuss whether to suspend dividend payments to shareholders , amid pressure from the US government .
BP placed a containment cap on its damaged oil well earlier this month ; by last week , it was collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day .
The US Coast Guard estimates a daily leak of about 35,000 barrels .
' Environmental 9/11 '
Mr Obama visited the Mississippi town of Gulfport before moving on to Theodore in Alabama .
" We are confronting the largest environmental disaster in our history , with the largest environmental response and recovery effort in our history , " he said there .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
The moral pressure on [ BP ] will only grow by the end of this week Mark Mardell , BBC North America editor Read Mark 's thoughts in full
The government had held preliminary conversations with BP about how to deal with compensation claims and expected that a mechanism would be agreed soon , he added .
He announced measures to protect the Gulf seafood industry , and pledged that beaches in the area could and would be returned to their pristine condition within one or two years .
Earlier , in a statement aimed both at paid - up Democratic Party members and at millions of individuals who backed his 2008 presidential bid online , the president asked his network to lend their name to a campaign to change the way America produces and consumes its energy .
" Beyond the risks inherent in drilling four miles beneath the surface of the Earth , our dependence on oil means that we will continue to send billions of dollars of our hard - earned wealth to other countries every month - including many in dangerous and unstable regions , " he said .
" In other words , our continued dependence on fossil fuels will jeopardise our national security .
It will smother our planet .
And it will continue to put our economy and our environment at risk .
" We cannot delay any longer , and that is why I am asking for your help . "
His remarks followed comments in which he said the ongoing oil spill would change the way the US thinks about energy forever - comparing the effect of the disaster on the environment to the way 9/11 shaped US security policy .
Next steps
While Mr Obama has visited Louisiana a number of times since the start of the crisis , on his latest trip he was touring areas of the other affected states .
He was scheduled to spend the night in the region before returning to Washington on Tuesday .
On Tuesday night the president will make a prime - time TV address to the nation in which he is expected to outline the next steps his administration will take over the spill .
Speaking in Gulfport , Mr Obama said he empathised with those suffering financially from the oil spill , adding that the White House was still gathering facts and stories in order to press BP into awarding adequate compensation .
" There 's still a lot of opportunity for visitors to come down here .
There are a lot of beaches that have not been affected and will not be affected , " the AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
" If people want to help , the best way to help is to come down here and visit . "
Mr McKay is due to attend a hearing on Tuesday of the House of Representatives committee on energy and environment along with senior officials from other oil companies .
When he and other company industry heads testified before the Senate about the disaster last month , President Obama described the hearing as a " ridiculous spectacle " .
He talked of " executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else " .
BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , who himself faces a House hearing on Thursday , has received a letter from the heads of two House committees which accuses BP of " taking shortcuts " on the design and construction of the well .
" It appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk , " representatives Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak say .
The letter quotes internal e-mails between BP engineers before the disaster in which the site is described as a " nightmare well " .
Keeping tourism afloat is crucial for Galveston , which is still recovering from the devastating impact of Hurricane Ike in 2008 .
In the aftermath , 10,000 of the city ’s 60,000 residents permanently fled .
Many who stayed are still awaiting federal money to rebuild .
Tourist shops offer books documenting “ The Storm ” and businesses have signs pointing to the high - water mark .
Some reopened barely a year ago .

“ This is not what I needed this summer , ” said Cheryl Jenkines , the manager of her family ’s antiques and accessories shop , Hendley Market , a downtown fixture for 30 years .
She began to cry .
After Ike , she explained , her store was flooded with 10 feet of water ; she was knee - deep in mud during the cleanup .
The store reopened in May 2009 , but only for three days a week and at a third of its original size .
Coupled with the economic slump , Ms. Jenkines , 51 , worried that any negative attention from the oil spill would torpedo her business .
“ There are a lot of sleepless nights , ” she said .
Some are hoping to get BP to help ease the financial strain .
Katie ’s Seafood Market is a sliver of a shop that sits dockside in the shadow of the oil rig museum .
Three of its boats are still working the gulf , 150 miles out , picking up fillings for the fish tacos in Galveston ’s cafes and red snapper to supply the East Coast .
But Keith Guindon , the owner of Katie ’s Seafood Market and treasurer of a trade group , the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders ’
Alliance , said he was preparing to file a claim with BP for lost income .
“ I ’d be foolish not to be nervous , ” Mr. Guindon , 54 , said .
“ Just the perception can really hurt things now . ”
Last week , a representative from BP came to the Galveston City Council meeting .
“ He seemed like a credible fellow , ” Mayor Jaworski said .
“ He came right up and listened to us and said he would help us pay for public relations . ”
A spokeswoman for BP said no deal had been reached yet .

One thing that has n't received very much notice lately I think is the fact that at the end of 2010 , the 2001 Bush tax cuts will be expiring for all taxpayers .
If you remember , the tax cuts were across the board for all taxpayers , meaning if they are n't renewed , all of us who pay taxes will be seeing an increase in our taxes next year .
Thankfully for many of us Obama has declared that he wants to renew the tax cuts for all taxpayers making less than $ 250,000 a year .
Continues after Advertisement
Obama wants tax breaks proposed by President George W. Bush to expire this year .
His budget would eliminate tax breaks on those making more than $ 250,000 a year , a move almost certain to be opposed by Republicans and perhaps some Democrats as the economy crawls out of the recession .
“ We extend middle - class tax cuts in this budget , ” Obama said Monday at the White House , but “ we will not continue costly tax cuts for oil companies , investment fund managers , and those making over $ 250,000 a year .
We just ca n't afford it . ”
While that 's all fine and good , the tax cuts have n't been extended yet , and some are wondering if in the end they actually will be .
To prepare you for either scenario , here 's a graphic from springfieldnewssun.com showing what everyone 's tax rates will be if all tax cuts expire , along with if only the tax cuts for those making less than $ 250,000 ( joint ) are extended .
Personally , I hope they 're extended .
What Effect Will Tax Increases Have ?
There is a lot of debate as to what effect tax increases will have on the economy , as fragile as it is .
Right now it seems that no one wants to allow the tax cuts for lower incomes expire ( no one wants to raise taxes on the middle class in an election year ! ) , but the question about tax increases on higher incomes is a contentious one .
Democrats are saying it is needed to help close the deficit and Republicans saying tax increases would cripple our economy .
I suspect the truth lies somewhere in between .
President Barack Obama wants Congress to extend the lower tax rates for individuals earning less than $ 200,000 a year and families making less than $ 250,000 annually .
But under his plan , those individuals making more than $ 200,000 a year and families above $ 250,000 would pay higher taxes on income , capital gains and dividends .
By contrast , congressional Republicans are pressing to extend all the tax cuts for everyone .
They insist it is folly to raise anyone ’s taxes as the economy struggles to recover from last year ’s crippling recession .
They contend that taking money from anybody will hinder private investment , which will slow economic growth .
Making the debate even more complicated are deficit projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
The CBO predicts that if Congress approves Obama ’s budget — including keeping the lower tax rates for families under $ 250,000 — the federal treasury will lose a staggering $ 2.2 trillion in the next 10 years .
Joel Slemrod , a professor of economics at the University of Michigan argues that increases on the wealthy are painful but necessary :
Obama ’s approach of raising taxes only on the wealthy is probably the safest bet .
While acknowledging that the economy will remain shaky next year , Slemrod said “ not raising any taxes in the face of this fiscal imbalance also has economic effects . ’’
“ We start to play out a scenario where interest rates go up , ’’ Slemrod said .
“ So it ’s not as if increasing taxes has certain adverse impacts , but not raising taxes do not . ’’
Other economists argue that tax increases in this economy would be crippling , and what we really need to be focusing on is decreasing government spending .
Marc Poitras at the University of Dayton , argue that raising any taxes now can choke off the recovery .
“ There is no economic model out there of whatever flavor — Keynesian or otherwise — that says that a tax increase is stimulative , ’’ Poitras said .
“ In the long run , they have to do something about the deficit because the deficits they are running are totally unsustainable .
The problem with the budget is more of spending ( problem ) than taxing .
It will not be solved until they bring spending under control . ’’
To me that is the key to this whole debate , and something that is n't brought up enough .
Far too often we focus simply on whether we should raise or lower taxes , when the elephant in the room is the high rate of government spending .
We need to closely examine where we are now and where we are going if government spending continues to increase at the current rate .
In my opinion it 's unsustainable .
What are your thoughts on the expiration of the Bush tax cuts ?
Do you think they 'll extend them for some people – or for everyone ?
What effect do you think they 'll have on the economy ?
Tell us your thoughts in the comments .

JEFF CARLTON , Associated Press Writer
DALLAS , Texas --
For the second time in a year , the guilt of an inmate executed in Texas is in doubt after a judge ordered DNA testing on a strand of hair that was the only physical evidence linking a man to the murder for which he was killed 10 years ago .
Judge Paul C. Murphy ordered testing done on a 1 - inch - long strand that helped prosecutors convict Claude Jones of capital murder in the 1989 shooting death of liquor store owner Allen Hilzendager near Point Blank , about 75 miles north of Houston .
" This is a DNA test that could prove someone was wrongly executed , " said Barry Scheck , the co-director of the Innocence Project , a New York - based legal center that helped ensure the preservation of the strand of hair .
Jones , a career criminal and paroled murderer , always insisted he did n't kill the 37 - year - old store owner .
He died in 2000 , the last of 40 inmates executed in Texas that year and the last of 152 inmates put to death during former President George W. Bush 's time as governor .
Murphy , a retired appellate judge assigned to the case , ordered the test Friday .
In April in a separate case , a state forensics panel renewed its review of a questionable arson finding that led to the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham , who was convicted of setting the fire that killed his three children .
According to the Innocence Project , Texas leads the nation with 40 DNA exonerations .
Gov. Rick Perry issued the state 's first posthumous pardon of a DNA exoneree in March .
Tim Cole , wrongly convicted of a 1985 rape , died in prison of complications from asthma in 1999 .
In Jones ' case , a hair analysis expert linked the strand to Jones at his trial .
The other primary evidence was testimony from an accomplice , who later acknowledged in an affidavit that he had no firsthand knowledge of the killing and said he testified against Jones to get himself a lighter sentence .
The single strand of hair allegedly belonging to Jones inexplicably survived , although it was supposed to have been destroyed years ago after the case was resolved .
In 2007 , a state district judge ordered it preserved to leave open the possibility of DNA testing after the Innocence Project , other innocence groups and The Texas Observer , a biweekly magazine , sought a temporary restraining order preventing its destruction .
San Jacinto County District Attorney Bill Burnett , the prosecutor in the case , died two weeks ago of pancreatic cancer .
He had pushed first to have the hair destroyed and then to prevent DNA testing , arguing a jury 's verdict should be final and only a live defendant could request DNA testing .
Montgomery County Attorney David Walker , who had been handling the case for Burnett , was expected to be out of his office for the rest of the week and did not return a message left Tuesday by The Associated Press .
Duane Jones , Claude Jones ' son , said he was willing to accept the results of the testing , which could clear his father or confirm his conviction .
" Every chance we have ... to discover and expand on the truth , it is incumbent on our justice system to do just that , " Duane Jones said .
Claude Jones was 60 when he was executed .
His first robbery conviction was in 1959 .
He also served time in Kansas for robbery , murder and assault .
While locked up there , he was convicted of killing a fellow inmate by throwing gasoline on him and setting him on fire .
By 1984 , however , he was out on parole despite a life term .
" If he was caught , he 'd fess up to what he had done , " Duane Jones said .
" This was the only thing he ever denied .
He said the only thing he had was his honor , and he was telling the truth about this thing . "
Lab notes indicate the hair expert originally thought the sample size was too small .
Also , the microscopic hair analysis done on the strand is now considered unreliable , Scheck said .
The hair must be transferred to a laboratory within 60 days , according to the order .
The tests could link the hair to Jones , one of his alleged accomplices or the victim .
It also could be a stray hair .
Scheck said if the test proves the hair did not come from Jones , it will show the state had no grounds on which to convict .
In Texas , a defendant cannot be convicted on the testimony of an accomplice unless there is corroborating evidence , he said .
According to The Innocence Project , which obtained records in a Freedom of Information filing , Bush 's staff never mentioned the possibility of DNA testing in briefing material given to the governor when he was considering a stay of execution .
Jones ' execution was delayed for 30 minutes when jailers were unable to find a suitable vein in either arm .
They eventually used a vein in his leg to inject a lethal cocktail of drugs .
Test vehicle for Guerrilla Sniper Rifle project
From reader AS :
The Case for the Guerrilla Sniper Rifle
My personal view is that in any coming maelstrom , most individual level “ misbehavior ” will very likely manifest itself in the form of small encounters , systems disruption , and “ Clinton Rules ” engagements .
While small unit action is possible and may happen in some instances , I think that it will be the aberration and the rule will be the small , individual action .
This is the territory of the guerrilla – individual , self supporting , and operating in their home AO .
For much of this type of activity , a reasonably accurate , potent , robust , and above all portable rifle is the most desired and efficient tool possible ( especially for many of the “ semi hard ” targets that systems disruption activity must deal with ) .
Enter the Guerrilla Sniper Rifle .
While the concept is not new , the modern use of the term has recently been popularized on Gabe Suarez ’s “ Warrior Talk ” forum .
More specific references to this site are found in the “ Sources For Further Study ” section of this document .
There is a large amount of good information on Warrior Talk and I strongly suggest any serious student go there and digest it .
It should help you sharpen your thoughts on the concept , as should the other resources referenced .
Additionally , I end this document with a “ Sources For Acquisition ” section that may help those interested in a similar project .
Through my own research and much supporting material gleaned from other sources ( Warrior Talk being one of the primary ones ) , I decided on the components necessary to build a couple of rifles as proof of concept vehicles .
I focus on one specific example here , but many other variations and implementations could be equal or better solutions .
Experiment and find what works for you – just make sure that you test it so that you know it works and can prove it on demand .
There will be no dress rehearsals .
For my Guerrilla Sniper Rifle subject , I utilized a Savage bolt action 308 ( short action length ) , a Choate Folding Sniper Stock , and a Nikon 3 - 9 x 40 BDC reticle scope .
That and a minimal set of supporting accoutrements are really all one needs .
First , why a bolt action ?
In the Guerrilla Sniper role , it is unlikely that multiple fast follow up shots will be needed , at least in the context of how I foresee such activity .
We are generally talking about one or perhaps at most three well placed shots , and then scoot .
A bolt action does this with a lighter , more accurate , less complicated , and usually much cheaper implementation than a semi-auto battle rifle .
A solid bolt action is simple and offers several tactical advantages ( brass retention , ease of scoping , superior suppressor platform , etc. ) .
Keep it simple when you can and you will usually find that you have the best tool for the job .
So I chose a bolt action .
Second , why the Savage 100/ 10 / Stevens 200 action in particular ?
From my analysis , I think there are three significant advantages that this action offers :
1 ) Accuracy / Economy ratio – they are the most affordable option and inherently accurate
2 ) Barrel changes – to be able to replace or exchange barrels yourself is unique and enabling
3 ) Accutrigger – to have an excellent trigger out of the box is a significant advantage
That all said , do n’t get too hung up on requiring the gun to have an Accutrigger , as most of the standard triggers can easily be made quite serviceable ( possible exception being the basic “ two screw ” variety that comes on the Stevens 200 and some older Savages ) .
The three screw models I ’ve played with are just fine .
If this is not the case for you , several excellent aftermarket triggers exist .
I cannot overstress that the modularity of the rifle , in particular the ease of barrel replacement , is what really makes this the best choice , in my opinion .
Never underestimate the utility of being able to replace or exchange your barrel in the field , with no need for precision , powered machinery or a trained gunsmith .
It could be a life saver .
Ponder the concept and I think you ’ll agree .
As to barrels , while one can make do with the standard 22 ” factory sporter barrel , the Guerilla Sniper concept really shines when you utilize a shorter barrel , something in the 16 ” – 20 ” range .
It may not seem like much , but shortening the barrel by just a few inches significantly improves the handiness of the rifle when in use and opens up whole new areas for transport and storage with the stock folded .
I have played with barrels from 22 ” down to 18 ” so far , with a 16 - 1/ 2 ” barrel next in the queue for testing .
A worthwhile option is to thread the barrel for a flash hider ( Smith Enterprise Vortex model 1009V is my recommendation ) and potentially a suppressor .
This is especially true if you have the barrel cut down to the 16 ” – 18 ” range .
If going this route , just make sure you plan ahead and have the barrel threaded to a pattern that will support both the flash hider and suppressor – not always a simple task .
Minimizing sound and flash can be critical in this role , so consider these options carefully .
The Choate Ultimate Sniper Folding Stock
The availability of this stock is really what made me decide to put together such a rifle .
Were I limited to traditional full length stocks , I could easily ‘ make do ” with my Steyr Scout with FFP reticle Pride Fowler scope and angelic trigger .
It ’s an awesome package and still is my go - to “ walking around ” rifle .
However , if you add the ability to shorten a rifle by 10 inches , you suddenly open up flexibilities normally associated with “ hand rifles ” such as the T/C Contender / Encore , Savage Striker , Remington XP - 100 , etc .
With the Choate folder , a short action , and an 18 ” barrel , you have a potent and accurate rifle that can be reduced to a storable length of less than 30 ” .
For a .308 rifle , that is excellent utility value .
Clearly this reduced form enables storing in some large packs and cases , but an aspect overlooked by most is the ability to sling the rifle over your back and yet be able to move much more freely than with a full length slung rifle .
The barrel does not poke down so low as to make kneeling or sitting down as problematic as is often the case with African Carry .
Similarly , nothing extends above the shoulder , as muzzle down is the obvious way to sling this setup .
Not only can you thus move much more easily , but when moving you will not stand out nearly so much as “ a man with a rifle slung over his back . ”
This lower profile is another huge advantage offered by a folding stock .
Originally , I was concerned about whether or not this stock would be rigid enough to provide a solid shooting platform for a .308 rifle .
After a number of shooting sessions , I am convinced it is more than up to the task .
Shooting it is comparatively comfortable and does not introduce any impediments to accurate field shooting .
It plain works .
There are downsides , however .
The stock is just a bit heavy for its size ( but it ’s cut down and thus manageable ) .
It also has no sling swivels , although that is easily fixed .
Given the abbreviated forearm , a traditional bipod location is not possible .
You can mount one , though ( and I did ) .
That said , the Guerrilla Sniper role likely is best served by a rucksack or pack rest , keeping with clean lines and minimalist equipment .
If you really want to put a bipod on it though , you have that option .
A decent sling , however , is not negotiable .
A good sling is required for carry and should be of a type offering proper sling supported position use , preferably via some type of loop for the support arm .
That is out of the scope of this paper , but is something that must be stressed – a Rifleman needs to be competent with the use of sling supported firing position in the field .
I care not what you can do off the bench in the shade , but what you can do in the field from sitting or rice paddy prone might just save your life – or mine .
Learn it , well .
( If you have no idea of what I speak , seek out an Appleseed and then follow it up with more training , since you wo n’t learn things like rice paddy prone at an Appleseed , which is only a starting point . )
One further carry idea that makes a lot of sense is something I picked up from the Warrior Talk forum .
Using one of the “ sniper rifle ” scope cover / muzzle cover combinations makes the folded rifle into a durable package , whether slung on your back or laying on the back seat floorboard .
It protects the scope and muzzle as you would expect , but also retains the folded stock and covers the bolt handle .
It ’s not quite as protective as a traditional soft case , but leaps ahead of just the bare rifle .
Such considerations are moot for the bench rest potato taking his rifle to the range , but of huge value to the lone rifleman in the field .
NOTE :
There is one significant caveat when buying this stock if you are working with a Savage Short action rifle .
Currently , this stock is only available in the 4.3 ” action screw spacing length .
Since some point in time around 2006 , Savage switched over to the newer “ center feed ” action , which uses a 4.41 ” action screw separation .
The older “ staggered feed ” actions are what fit the Choate Folder , while rifles manufactured recently do not fit .
If you have a 4.41 ” action , it is possible to buy the Choate Varmint Folder ( as used in the factory Savage " Model 10 FP Folding Choate " package ) .
However , as far as I can tell the stock is currently only available directly from Choate at full retail ( $ 285 IIRC ) .
Worse than that , it is HEAVY .
For Long Action
Savage rifles , there is only one screw spacing length and you are OK .
Similarly , those utilizing Winchester or Remington actions should also have no issues .
Thus if going this route , be careful with the parts you try to combine .
In summary : The Choate Sniper Folder stock weighs about 3.5 lbs and is what I describe here .
The Savage Choate FP folder stock weights about 5.25 lbs and :
- does not have its forearm abbreviated
- has a different butt section ( like from the original Ultimate Sniper / Varmint Stocks )
- is thought to only be available from Savage with a complete rifle , but one may be able to purchase it directly from Choate , albeit at full retail
- has a heavier duty folding mechanism that is slightly more difficult to disengage
Nikon Team Primos 3 - 9 x 42 w/BDC
IMHO this is the way to go for scoping a Guerrilla Sniper role .
Reticle wise , its BDC is a straightforward yet significant improvement over the Burris Ballistic Plex that I previously favored .
Optically , this specific “ Team Primos ” labeled scope is a notch ( or more ) up from the Burris Fullfield or the other Nikon options ( Prostaff and Buckmark lines ) , as it is essentially an old model Monarch UCC ( Ultra Clear Coat ) with its coatings and 95 % light transmission specification .
It also has nicer adjustments with decent miniature target style turrets and positive ¼ ” ( IPHY ) click adjustments .
It ’s a tremendous scope at a very attractive price , and comes with an outstanding reticle for our purposes .
On the reticle , where the Burris has small tick marks , the Nikon has little circles .
It also has more of them ( Burris has crosshairs , then three ticks , then the thick portion of the crosshair – Nikon has four little circles ) .
Dell has tried to put those problems behind it .
In 2005 , it announced it was taking a $ 300 million charge related , in part , to fixing and replacing the troubled computers .
Dell set aside $ 100 million this month to handle a potential settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a five - year - old investigation into its books , which will most likely result in federal accusations of fraud and misconduct against the company ’s founder , Michael S. Dell .

The problems affecting the Dell computers stemmed from an industrywide encounter with bad capacitors produced by Asian PC component suppliers .
Capacitors are found on computer motherboards , playing a crucial role in the flow of current across the hardware .
They are not meant to pop and leak fluid , but that is exactly what was happening earlier this decade , causing computers made by Dell , Hewlett - Packard , Apple and others to break .
According to company memorandums and other documents recently unsealed in a civil case against Dell in Federal District Court in North Carolina , Dell appears to have suffered from the bad capacitors , made by a company called Nichicon , far more than its rivals .
Internal documents show that Dell shipped at least 11.8 million computers from May 2003 to July 2005 that were at risk of failing because of the faulty components .
These were Dell ’s OptiPlex desktop computers  the company ’s mainstream products sold to business and government customers .
A study by Dell found that OptiPlex computers affected by the bad capacitors were expected to cause problems up to 97 percent of the time over a three - year period , according to the lawsuit .
As complaints mounted , Dell hired a contractor to investigate the situation .
According to a Dell filing in the lawsuit , which has not yet gone to trial , the contractor found that 10 times more computers were at risk of failing than Dell had estimated .
Making problems worse , Dell replaced faulty motherboards with other faulty motherboards , according to the contractor ’s findings .
But Dell employees went out of their way to conceal these problems .
In one e-mail exchange between Dell customer support employees concerning computers at the Simpson Thacher & Bartlett law firm , a Dell worker states , “ We need to avoid all language indicating the boards were bad or had ‘ issues ’ per our discussion this morning . ”
In other documents about how to handle questions around the faulty OptiPlex systems , Dell salespeople were told , “ Do n’t bring this to customer ’s attention proactively ” and “ Emphasize uncertainty . ”
Of all the stupid vanities in a business that specializes in stupid vanities , the possessory credit takes the cake .
That credit is the one that appears at the top of a film saying , “ A film by _______ , ” the blank then implausibly being filled by the name of a single person , the director .
Let ’s not get into how many other people — starting with the writer and continuing in essential ways through the cast , cinematographer , editor , and composer — influence the quality of a film .
( Try to imagine the original choice of Shirley Temple instead of Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz or Mae West rather than Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to understand how dependent a film ’s tone is on the contributions of all its elements . )
The possessory credit is silly for all kinds of reasons , not the least of which is that it ’s redundant : we ’ll see whom the film is by when we get to the other credits .
But if anyone deserves this credit , it would have to be someone who has created a world in which the speech and actions and people , in which the tone and tenor of events , are as obviously the creation of one artist as a passage of Twain ’s is obviously a passage of Twain ’s and not of Charlotte Brontë ’s , as a Renoir is never confused with a Picasso .
It is safe to say that no one ever mistook a film by Preston Sturges for a film by anyone else .
This is not something you can say of most directors , including many fine ones : George Cukor , William Wyler , John Huston .
While one might expect that it was George Cukor who directed Roman Holiday instead of William Wyler , one could never imagine anyone but Sturges behind any of the manic yet buttery pictures that bear his name .
Though the events in his films often border on the unreal , ironically his world resembles ours more than most movies do , because the Sturges universe is so ungentrified .
The characters in a Sturges film are slickers and hicks , frantic , contemplative , melancholy , literate , sub - intelligent , vain , self - doubting , sentimental , cynical , hushed , and shouting .
A hallmark of most artists is the consistency of their world — one thinks of the delicacy in René Clair ’s work , the droll , intoxicating understatement of Lubitsch , the painful clamor of Jerry Lewis .
But the Sturges world seems the product of a multiple - personality disorder .
( Sturges used to dictate his scripts aloud to a secretary as he wrote them , and when he did , he convincingly played all the parts . )
I can think of no other artist who keeps the delicate and the explosive so close together .
This collision of tones perhaps took its cue from his life .
He was born in Chicago at the end of the 19th century .
His mother , Mary , divorced Preston ’s father when Preston was not quite three and moved with her son to Paris .
On her first day there she met the celebrated dancer Isadora Duncan .
Though Sturges would at times resent his mother ’s fast friendship with Duncan , he owed the Duncan family an enormous debt .
Almost as soon as they arrived in Paris , Sturges , always susceptible to respiratory trouble , came down with a pneumonia that no doctor could tame .
Isadora Duncan ’s mother arrived with a bottle of champagne , from which she fed him lifesaving spoonfuls until he was restored .
“ Champagne and Pneumonia ” — it could be the title of a Sturges movie .
It also aptly calls up the conflicting elements at work in his films : the effervescent and the feverish .
He did not come to Hollywood the way people come to Hollywood today , fresh out of film school , eager to crib shots they like from other movies .
According to his biographer Diane Jacobs , he ’d been a stage manager , a flier in the air service , a songwriter , and the manager of his mother ’s cosmetics concern , where he invented a highly successful kissproof lipstick .
( “ Kissproof ” also sounds like a Sturges title . )
He ’d written a Broadway hit , Strictly Dishonorable , followed by three flops .
By the time he came to Hollywood , in the 30s , he had a good sense of himself and was quickly under contract as a writer at Universal , making a thousand dollars a week .
One of his films , The Power and the Glory , had a structure and subject that were reproduced a few years later by Orson Welles in Citizen Kane .
( If you had to have your ideas lifted , there was no finer pickpocket than Orson Welles . )
It may have been his success in business , or his age , or the example of independence set by his mother , but by the end of the 30s he had gotten himself a job directing his own script , becoming one of the first credited writer - directors of the talking age .
He did this with either the shrewdness of a businessman or the desperation of a writer : he sold Paramount his script of The Vagrant for $ 10 with the stipulation that he direct it .
President Obama addresses the nation live Tuesday night at 8 ET with the latest on the BP oil disaster .
Stay with CNN for updates on the cleanup and effort to stop the leak .
( CNN ) -- BP began deploying pressure sensors on its ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday in an effort to fine - tune estimates of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , government and company officials said .
BP used remote - controlled submarines to begin positioning the sensors inside the well , located 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf , company spokesman Mark Proegler said .
The sensors were requested by federal experts who have been trying to gauge how much oil has been pouring from the well , which experts say could have been spewing as much as 1.7 million gallons of oil a day into the Gulf .
But Proegler said the devices may not yield accurate information for several days .
" It 's not as if they 'll plug these sensors in and get readings right away , " he said .
Researchers recently doubled estimates of how much oil has been flowing from the ruptured well , saying last week that up to 40,000 barrels -- or 1.7 million gallons -- a day may have leaked for weeks .
Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the disaster , said the sensors will help give those researchers a better picture of the flow rate .
" We think we need some independent pressure readings to validate the estimates that have been made by the scientists looking at the video and some other acoustic data , " Allen said Sunday on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
Allen 's deputy , Rear Adm.
James Watson , has given BP until Sunday to provide alternative plans that adequately address substantially higher rates of oil flow .
The company said Saturday that it was reviewing a letter from Watson , but no response had been disclosed late Sunday .
The oil is believed to have been pouring into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion that sank the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon , killing 11 workers .
The spill now dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska 's Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989 , and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
Allen said the battle against the oil " continues to widen , " with efforts now being focused on the stretch of open water between the wellhead and about 15 miles off the coast .
" Rather than trying to capture all around the well head , we 've got to get our skimmers further offshore and protect it so we minimize the amount of oil that comes ashore , " he said .
Allen 's comments came on the eve of President Barack Obama 's fourth scheduled visit to the stricken Gulf region , a two - day trip that will be followed by a Tuesday night address to the nation .
Obama is scheduled to visit Mississippi , Alabama and Florida on Monday and Tuesday , then meet with BP executives on Wednesday .
BP has captured some of the gushing oil through a containment cap that has been pumping the crude up to a drilling ship for about a week .
BP said it collected more than 15,000 barrels of oil on Saturday and more than 7,700 by noon Sunday .
But despite this advancement , pressure has not been removed from BP .
White House adviser David Axelrod said Sunday the Obama administration wants BP to set up a massive , independently administered fund for cleaning up the oil - stricken Gulf states .
" The president will use every legal device at his disposal to make sure that this money is escrowed and that there is an independent administrator so that claims are not slow - walked , people can get the relief they need in a timely fashion and that we do n't create more victims from this terrible disaster , " Axelrod told reporters .
He said administration lawyers have advised " that we have the authority to compel such an escrow fund , if it comes to that . "
Estimates of the cleanup costs and the damages BP will owe to businesses and residents on the Gulf Coast range from $ 3 billion to $ 40 billion .
BP said it already has spent more than $ 1 billion trying to cap the spill and clean up the areas affected by the oil .
Axelrod did not discuss how much money might be set up in the fund .
But Allen told CBS that BP was " a company that 's got a lot of wealth inside it . "
And a group of 54 Senate Democrats -- nearly all the Democratic caucus -- has called on BP to put $ 20 billion in trust for the spill .
In a letter to the oil company 's CEO , Tony Hayward , they note that the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska 's Prince William Sound cost $ 7 billion , but Exxon paid far less for damages while continuing to make major profits .
Alabama Gov. Bob Riley told CNN's " State of the Union " on Sunday that he did n't care how the money was paid out .
But he said BP owed " every one " of his state 's Gulf Coast businesses .
" I do n't think there is a dividing line , " said Riley , a Republican .
" I do n't think you can say that one group is going to get it and another one does n't .
If a restaurant in Gulf Shores , Alabama , is off 50 percent because the tourists did n't come , I think he is owed 50 percent of his revenues from last year .
" The same thing with anyone in these areas , because the whole economy is based on the tourist market , " he said .
" And when it goes away , someone 's got to compensate them , because most of these people are not going to be here next year if we do n't . "
Riley also criticized the Obama administration 's handling of the disaster , saying the " unified command " set up with the federal government and BP is mounting a disjointed response .
" You can't have a committee making the decisions that are going to impact this entire coastal area .
You can't have someone come in and say , ' Well , if it gets onto the beach , we 'll clean it up and we 'll clean it up rapidly , ' and then OSHA come in and say , ' Well , the people can't work but 20 minutes out of an hour or two hours a day , ' and get it cleaned up .
Someone is
going to have to be in charge of each one of these operations , " he said .
Riley , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist are scheduled to meet with the president during his two - day visit .
Barbour told CBS he was pleased to hear Allen talk of trying to fight the oil offshore rather than on the beaches , but said he would push Obama to end the six - month moratorium he slapped on offshore oil exploration since the disaster began .
Obama has said no drilling should go forward until investigators determine the cause of the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon .
But Barbour said Obama " is going to hurt the national economy " if the temporary ban is n't lifted .
" There have been more than 30,000 oil wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 50 years .
This is the first time something like this has ever happened .
And we need to get to the bottom of it , find out what happened , make sure it does n't happen again .
But I think it is very reasonable to continue to drill , " Barbour said .
Several opposition parties say they have been prevented from taking part and a former speaker of the Rwandan parliament , Joseph Sebarenzi , told the BBC .

Scott Brown , along with George Voinovich ( not pictured ) are likely targets for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's quest to score the remaining votes for an unemployment benefits package .
Reid still short on unemployment vote
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said Wednesday he is still short on votes needed to break a Republican filibuster on a slimmed - down version of an unemployment benefits package .
Reid intends to call a vote Thursday evening on the smaller benefits bill — now paired with a homebuyer 's credit provision that may help garner more support .
But the majority leader conceded he might not be able to clear the bill before the July recess .
A more comprehensive tax extenders and unemployment benefits bill failed to pass the procedural block on three consecutive tries .

" I 've only had commitments from two senators — two Republican senators — so with Sen . [ Robert ]
Byrd not being here , it 's not enough .
So I know those commitments are good , and if we do n't have another responsible Republican to help these people who are so desperate for help , then they 'll have to wait 10 days until we get back , " Reid said .
The two GOP senators supporting the measure are Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins , their offices confirmed to POLITICO .
But with Byrd 's vacancy and Democratic Sen .
Ben Nelson of Nebraska telling reporters he will not support the bill , Reid will need to flip the votes of two more Republicans .
Sens. Scott Brown of Massachusetts and George Voinovich of Ohio , who both have voted with the Democrats on emergency extensions this year , are likely targets .
A Snowe spokesman added that the Republican is " thrilled " the Senate will be voting on the unemployment provisions , as she has been urging Reid to separate the unemployment benefits from the larger bill since it first failed cloture more than three weeks ago .
Nelson , who broke with his party to block the last version of a UI bill from moving forward , told reporters Wednesday afternoon he has not changed his position on the issue and is demanding that the costs of unemployment benefits not add to the deficit .
" Nothing 's changed .
The vote will be the same , " the Nebraska Democrat said .
" If it 's not paid for , I wo n't support it . "
Without an extension of the pending benefits , unemployment payments would continue to be phased out for more than 200,000 people per week .
Labor Secretary Hilda Solis added that more than 1 million people have already lost benefits .

Well , here 's one that a whole bunch of state motor - vehicle codes probably do n't address :
Is driving while wearing a burqa a road hazard ?
The question arises from the curious case of a 31 - year - old Muslim woman fined last week in France for driving while wearing a headscarf .
It was reported in some media as a burqa , although that may not be correct .
Hot button in France
Muslim dress has become a hot political issue in France , with laws banning headscarves in certain venues .
French president Nicholas Sarkozy has taken up a campaign against them , ordering Parliament to debate a law that bans the wearing of full - face veils in public .
The laws have sparked debate over the limits of religious expression in a secular society , despite estimates that fewer than 2,000 of France 's 5 million Muslims actually wear the veils .
This seems to be the first case in which road safety was used to justify legal action .
" Safety risk "
The unnamed 31 - year - old woman , a French citizen , was driving in the Breton city of Nantes when she was stopped by police , who claimed that the veil -- showing only her eyes - - was a " safety risk " because it restricted her vision and could have caused an accident .
The police asked her to raise her veil so they could confirm her identity , which she did .
She was then fined 22 euros , or roughly $ 29.30 .
Jean - Michel Pollono , her lawyer , told Agence France - Presse that he will appeal the conviction .
He called it a violation of human rights and women 's rights .
Veil = safety helmet ?
He added that her vision was not obscured , and noted that no French law currently forbids driving while veiled .
He compared the vision provided by the woman 's veil favorably to that offered by full motorcycle helmets .
That point likely applies to racing helmets as well .
There are actually several styles of scarves or veils worn by Islamic and Middle Eastern women that cover their hair in various ways , sometimes covering the neck but leaving the face visible .
These are the hijab , the al - amira , the shayla , the kimar , and the chador .
Covering full face : burqa or niqab
Two additional styles cover all or part of the face .
The niqab is a veil covering the whole face , but leaving the eyes clear .
It is accompanied by a head scarf , and an eye veil may be added as well .
[ Diagrams of all styles are shown on the BBC link below . ]
The burqa , which Aghan women were required to wear by the Taliban , is a single garment that covers the entire head , face , and body and falls to ground level .
The wearer sees solely through a mesh veil , which may not permit her eyes to be seen from the outside .
From press photos we are not authorized to reproduce , it would seem that the French Muslim woman was wearing not a burqa but a niqab , which did not appear to obscure her peripheral vision .
More complications
The case became more complicated when French interior minister Brice Hortefeux asked immigration minister Eric Besson to look into allegations the woman 's husband held radical views , had four wives -- illegal under French law - - and might be committing welfare fraud .
If his multiple marriages under Islamic law were not deemed legal in France , however , the women would apparently be considered his mistresses , and hence their children would be eligible for benefits under French law .
No doubt there will be more to come on the case .
Still , even French right - wing leader Jean - Marie Le Pen was quoted as saying that there was no need for a ban on driving while veiled .
And in the U.S. ?
It all leads us to wonder :
What laws , if any , exist on the books of the 50 states of the U.S. that cover such a case ?
And , is there data on the safety effects of the restricted vision provided by motorcycle helmets ?

Scientists discovered the partial skull ( cranium shown here ) of a new primate species , Saadanius hijazensis , in Saudi Arabia .
The specimen was found with the palate and teeth facing upward , embedded in an iron - rich clastic conglomerate in the middle part of the Shumaysi Formation .
Our lineage might have diverged from our monkey relatives later than previously thought , a new primate fossil from Saudi Arabia now suggests .
One key step in understanding human evolution is pinning doing when the hominoid lineage , which includes apes and humans , diverged from the Old World monkeys .
" If we can refine our understanding of the date of split between hominoids and Old World monkeys and eventually get a better idea of what was happening with the ecology , climate and composition of co-occurring mammals at that time , we will learn about the conditions driving our own ultimate origins , " researcher William Sanders , a paleontologist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor , told LiveScience .
Genetic analysis of humans , monkeys and other primates had placed the split at roughly 35 million to 30 million years ago , during the early Oligocene period .
However , the fossil record from the mid-to - late Oligocene , some 30 million to 23 million years ago , had previously provided little evidence supporting the timing of the divergence .
Primate skull
Now researchers have revealed a partial skull roughly 29 million to 28 million years old of a previously unknown species of medium - sized primate that might have come on the scene just before our lineage split away from Old World monkeys .
When alive the primate likely resembled a New World monkey ( a group that includes marmosets , tamarins , capuchins and other monkeys ) , sporting a tail and moving on all fours .
" It 's not a monkey , it 's not an ape — it's this intermediate , a precursor fossil for all apes and Old World monkeys , " said researcher Iyad Zalmout , a paleontologist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor .
The fossil , unearthed in 2009 near the west coast of Saudi Arabia during a joint field expedition of the Saudi Geological Survey and University of Michigan , is dubbed Saadanius hijazensis .
In Arabic , " saadan " collectively refers to apes and monkeys , while " Al Hijaz " refers to the region where the fossil was found .
The fossil had evidence of deep bite marks and possibly fatal puncture wounds on it .
Back then , the area was a warm , lush forest very unlike most of present - day Saudi Arabia , and was populated by extinct mammals known as creodonts , carnivores generally more heavily built than living cats and canines that possessed large fangs capable of inflicting the damage seen in the new fossil skull .
[ Evolution 's Most Extreme Mammals ]
Shared features
The fossil , which scientists said belonged to an adult male weighing about 33 to 44 pounds ( 15 to 20 kilograms ) , possessed features of the catarrhines , the common ancestor of hominoids and Old World monkeys , such as a tubular ectotympanic , a bone linked with the eardrum .
These new findings hint the divergence between hominoids and Old World monkeys happened between 29 and 24 million years ago .
" Between 24 million and 29 million years ago , there 's the beginning of the spreading of the Red Sea , and changes in temperature and sea level and climate , and new animals coming in from Europe and new vegetation from South Asia , " Sanders said .
" Now we can start looking at all these factors to better understand the evolutionary laboratory that drove the emergence of groups like our own . "
Future research will focus on trying to find more of Saadanius , particularly the rest of the skeleton besides its skull .
" We 'd like to know more about how it negotiated around the landscape , " Sanders said .
The scientists detailed their findings in the July 15 issue of Nature .

Investigators suspect a property firm linked to the 79 - year - old Scottish actor failed to pay 1.6 million euros ( $ 2.3 million ) in taxes , the Spanish newspaper Sur reported on its website , citing judicial sources .
The unpaid taxes reportedly stemmed from the sale of development rights to land on the outskirts of the Mediterranean resort of Malaga , the paper said .

It has never been publicly revealed what happened to ' tank man '
A cartoon that appears to refer to the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square has been printed in a Chinese newspaper .
The image , in the Southern Metropolitan Daily , shows a boy drawing a person standing in front of three tanks .
Online commentators have likened the image to the photograph of " tank man " , the protester who stopped a column of tanks during the demonstrations .
It appeared in the paper days before the 21st anniversary of the crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square .
It has now been pulled from the Guangzhou - based newspaper 's website .
It suggests that while the government stays silent on the issue , there are those in China who want to publicly remember the incident .
Online comments deleted
The cartoon was published with other pictures on Tuesday on a special page to mark International Children 's Day .
The boy in the picture has drawn the tanks on a school notice board .
The person in front of the tanks looks like a soldier .
No one was available for comment at the newspaper .
But there were many comments about the cartoon on the internet , although some of them were deleted shortly after they appeared .
" Today 's newspaper is very interesting .
They posted a cartoon picture of the ' tank man ' , " read one posting .
" I hope in the future people will discover that the newspaper is actually telling the truth , " went another .
This is not the first time that a newspaper has published an item relating to the Tiananmen massacre just before an anniversary .
In 2008 , the Beijing News published a famous picture taken at the time of the killings showing injured people being transported through the capital 's streets .
It appeared in an article about a photographer who had documented China over several decades and was simply entitled " The wounded " .
Hundreds , perhaps thousands , of students and workers are thought to have died when Chinese troops opened fire on the night of 3/4 June .
The crackdown followed weeks of protests in Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing .
The Chinese government said the protests were a counter - revolutionary rebellion .
It has not been publicly revealed what happened to " tank man " .

Today I will be reviewing the “ Dragon Slayer ” case , provided to me by the manufacturer , In - Win Development Inc .
According to their website , In - Win has been in the computer case business since 1985 .
I personally have been aware of them for more than a decade , and most , if not all of what I ’ve heard has been positive .
Let ’s see how well the “ Dragon Slayer ” lives up to In - Win ’s reputation .
Initial Impressions
First lets discuss the shipping .
I wo n’t say much about delivery as I ’m not reviewing Purolator ’s services .
Suffice it to say it made its way to me fairly quickly and the box was largely intact .
There was one small puncture in the cardboard box , but fortunately it was on a side that was completely protected by a foam insert .
I ca n’t say if it happened during shipping or at the manufacturing plant but either way it was a non issue for me .
The packaging was what you ’d expect for a computer case , a cardboard box only a few inches bigger than the case itself with molded foam on opposite ends to keep the case centered and protected from damage .
The package was light , only about 14 lbs .
I was met with a pungent smell once I opened the top of the box .
The kind of smell that new rubber and plastics can sometimes give off .
It was not overwhelming , nor even strong , but was noticeable .
Once removed from the box I rapped my finger tips along the top side of the case .
The high pitch of the reverberation had me concerned about the strength and durability of the case ’s outer shell .
It sounded pretty flimsy compared to most other cases I ’ve used .
Now that the case has been removed from the packaging , I took off the side door to check the contents that come with the case .
Inside I found several small bags containing screws ( black to match the case ’s finish ) , hard drive mounting rails ( yellow to match the fans ) , some black plastic clips with sticky tape on one side to help with cable management , and the manual .
The slide rails have rubber grommets to cut down on vibration , file that under “ little details ” along with their color matching the fan blades .
The manual for this particular case is not a booklet but comes as one long sheet folded back upon itself like and accordion .
The manual has several pages of specs , package content , case structure and warranty information repeated in English , French , German , Spanish , Turkish , Russian , Japanese and Chinese as well as a few pages ( in English only ) giving instructions for installing drives , motherboard , PSU , etc .
The combination of textual and pictorial instructions makes installation pretty easy to understand .
No complaints here .
Exterior Tour
Now onto the case .
Once I had set aside the secondary pieces , I looked at the overall presentation of the case .
It has ventilation on all 6 sides ( top and bottom incl . )
The two side doors are held on with large thumbscrews .
I ’ve had cases with thumbscrews before but these ones are bigger than ones I ’ve used before and I found them easier to grasp as a result .
The finish on the two doors , along with the top , bottom and back sides , is a matte black , with a bit of a grainy texture , both on the outside and the inside .
I found no flaws in the finish , no splotches or other inconsistencies and there were no scratches or scuff marks .
All the various pieces were assembled very precisely .
There were no gaps or edges sticking out , no pieces misaligned during assembly .
Angle shot showing front , component side door and top of case Door covering “ secondary ” side , behind mother board
The front side is the only side that does not have the grainy black metal .
Like most cases the front bezel of the Dragon Slayer is made of plastic .
The plastic is a dull black that matches the color of the metal very well and it is held in place by six tabs , three on each side of the bezel at the top corners , bottom corners and along the middle sides .
These tabs also help keep the case doors aligned properly as the doors have slots that , when properly closed , sync up with the tabs .
The bezel snaps in place and fits perfectly with the metal frame .
One of the tabs felt a little weak to me as I removed the front face .
I had some concerns that it might lend it self to snapping off more readily than the others .
I also found the same to be true for one of the tabs that lock the drive bay covers in place .
To put in or take out the drive bay covers you need to press in on the tabs that are on both sides of the bay cover , and one felt just a little bit too soft for my liking .
Much of the front surface of the case ( including the three 5 ¼ ” and one 3 ½ ” bay covers ) has a small hexagonal grid metal wire grill to let air in .
The outer grid holes are approximately 3 mm wide which by themselves could let a fair bit of dust in but all of the air intake areas have a removable , secondary inner mesh that has much smaller holes that should keep most of the dust out .
The outer grid is for show , to make the case look like it ’s armored .
I mean , surely you ’re not going to go out and slay a dragon without armor , right ?
The outer mesh also serves to protect the inner mesh , which is fairly soft .
The inner mesh is clearly there to keep out dust and such .
It ’s fine enough to catch much of the airborne dust and pet hair , but is far too soft to serve on its own without some protection .
A pen or other pointed object held carelessly in hand while turning the computer on or while inserting a CD into a drive could easily puncture it , so it needs that outer layer .
Air output holes , such as the fan at the back of the case , do not have the secondary inner mesh as that would just trap dust inside the case .
The lone exception to this is the top mounted 140 mm fan , and given that it it is on top of the case I think it makes sense to have a bit of extra protection in case something small is dropped onto the case and to help prevent dust from settling down into the case when the computer is not on .
The few places on the front that do not have the wire mesh are the front connectors area ( one USB 3.0 , two USB 2.0 , headphones and mic ) , the power button and the large , light - up “ In Win ” logo .
The USB connectors are differentiated by color , the blue one is for the 3.0 standard .
I found the logo to be much too bright for my eyes when on and as an owner of two cats and a bunny who are all at eye level with this part of the case I will be either disconnecting or dimming the light down before I need to buy my pets dark glasses and white canes .
It is n’t too bright for me where it is , but that ’s only because the case is down on the floor .
If the case were on the desk right next to my monitor it would be too much for me as well .
It does n’t show up too bad in pictures , but in person it is very difficult to look at for more than a few seconds .
The case has four external bays on the front .
At the top of the front face is a 5 ¼ “ bay , right below that is a single 3 ½ “ , below that are the front audio and USB ports , the power button , fan grill , light up In - Win logo and finally , at the bottom , the last two 5 ¼ “ bays .
Interior Tour
Now onto the interior , starting with the finish .
As I mentioned the interior has the same finish as the exterior and is just as flawless .
I like that the interior finish is just as flawless as the exterior , it shows good quality control .
If there was a blemish on the inside of the case , under the motherboard or tucked up inside one of the drive bays , you ’re not really going to notice it from day to day .
It would not be a glaring problem .
Nevertheless they ’ve made sure that even unseen errors like that do not get through QC .
Note the significant number and size or holes in the motherboard tray in the above picture .
These provide many options for cable management .
Now for the doors .
As I said earlier the doors were held on by large thumb screws .
The thumb screws are black and match the rest of the case .
In - Win could have gone with yellow to match the fan blades but what if you want to change the fans out for ones that are n’t yellow ?
I think black was the better choice .
It is a small detail , but the little things do add up overall .
Once I had removed the thumb screws from both doors ( again , good attention to detail .
If you want to adjust your cable management on the back side of the motherboard you do n’t have to go looking for a screwdriver to take the second door off ) I removed the doors with ease .
Unlike some cases I ’ve used , this one does not provide any resistance or difficulty putting on or taking off the doors .
I do n’t have to fight with it to make sure every clip is engaged on all sides of the door .
I should also point out that when the doors are on there are no gaps or edges sticking out .
They fit just as seamlessly to the rest of the case as the front bezel does .
The component side door is mostly mesh with rubber mount points for four 120 mm fans in a 2×2 configuration .
The fan mount area is raised out away from the case by about ½ ” which gives more depth for thicker case fans to be added to the door or taller CPU coolers to be used .
The rubber fan mount grommets cut down on vibration and the outer mesh has the smaller inner lining to help prevent dust accumulation .
The other door is mostly plain with just a few vent holes near the bottom .
These holes do not have the mesh filter on them , but given the number of intake fans on this case those holes are really more for output than intake so again the mesh really is n’t needed here .
Looking from either side of the case , we see lots of holes for wire management as mentioned above .
Aside from this we can also see that the opening for heatsink back - plate installation is fairly large and should give access to the mounting holes for most motherboards without issue ( see picture of empty case above and case with mother board installed below ) .
The space between the underside of the motherboard tray and the door on that side is over half an inch wide , so there is plenty of room for wires to be routed , even two layers thick if necessary .
As you can see from the image below , the ruler is pressed up against the back of the motherboard tray and the ruler measures a full centimeter before reaching the edge , add to that the 7 or so millimeters space before the markings on the ruler start and you ’ve got almost two cm of depth to hide your cables in .
Now the fans .
There are the following fans in the case .
One 140 mm fan in the middle of the front of the case .
This fan is installed for intake .
Below that , on the very bottom of the front side , there is an 80 mm fan , also set to intake .
This fan is hidden from view behind the two lower 5 ¼ ” face plates .
These two fans can be seen behind the front bezel in the image below .
In the middle of the back side of the case there is a 92 mm output fan .
The final fan is in the top side of the case at the very back .
It is a 140 mm fan set to output .
These two fans can be seen in the previous images showing the back side and top side of the case .
All fans have yellow blades , all but the 92 mm fan has a smaller grill on it to help keep out dust and all of them except the 92 mm fan ( again ) use a standard molex connector to power them .
The 92 mm fan has a 3 pin connector to plug into a fan header on the motherboard .
Those are the fans the case comes with , but there are other fan mounting points .
As mentioned the case has room for four 120 mm fans on the component side door with double mesh protection , and there is a vent ( again with both types of mesh ) in the bottom of the case for the power supply to draw in air if it has a modern top - mount 120 mm cooling fan instead of the older PSUs with rear - mount 80 mm fan .
Two more small details to note are first , the PSU mount holes at the back of the case allow the PSU to be mounted “ top side ” up or “ top side down , ” so if you want to take advantage of the case bottom intake vent , then you do n’t have to worry about your PSU mounting with the fan on the wrong side , facing into the case .
The second small detail to note is that both of the 140 mm fans mounts have secondary 120 mm mounts in the same area .
So if you want to switch out one or both of the 140 ’s for your favorite 120 mm fan you can do so with no problem .
Drive bays .
I ’ve already described what the drive bays look like from the outside , and you ’ve seen the images showing the drive bay covers earlier and you can also see them in the image immediately above .
Now we see what awaits within .
Up top it is pretty simple .
A single 5 ¼ ” external bay , followed by a single 3 ½ ” external bay below that and finally a single 2 ½ ” internal drive bay below that .
You can see the clips that lock the 5 ¼ ” and 3 ½ ” drives in place in the pic below .
The red lines underline the mounting points for the 2 ½ ” drive .
Simple .
Now onto the bottom .
Here ’s where it gets complex .
At first glance the bottom seems to have a drive cage for three 3 ½ ” interior drives with an 80 mm fan in front of them for cooling but , the two front face plates can be removed and the fan mounts unscrewed and you now have three exterior 3 ½ ” drive bays .
But wait , there ’s more .
The inner drive cage can be easily removed by sliding it forward , revealing a second , larger drive cage that can accommodate two 5 ¼ ” drives , interior or exterior .
The point is you ’ve got choices .
I should also add that removing the smaller drive cage from the bigger one was easy to do , just make sure the locking tabs on the outside the drive cage are disengaged and gently slide the cage forward .
Installation
Next , lets take a look at what I ’m installing .
Not top of the line by any means , but it by and large the components are somewhat up to date .
Everything except the second optical drive with the red “ X ” through it will be used .
I could have put both optical drives in by using the lower bays , it really would not have been a problem , but the second drive really was unnecessary for the system so I just left it out .
So what we do have is an ATX PSU , one 5 ¼ ” optical drive , one 3 ½ ” floppy drive , one 3 ½ ” hard drive , one AGP video card with a modified Intel P3 cooler on it and one mATX form factor LGA775 motherboard with a Conroe L Celeron cooled by the Cooler Master Hyper TX2 HSF .
Then we take a look at a shot of how the system looked in the old case .
Ugly inside , ugly outside but at least it worked .
The motherboard tray ends wrap around the back and almost touch the door , there ’s barely 2 mm of clearance .
So hiding the various cables behind the system was not possible .
What a mess !
So now let ’s see what happens when I try to install the system into this case .
The first thing to go in was the PSU .
It ’s not like some of the new extra long ones that put out 1 kw or more , this one is a Sparkle 350 w and measures 140 mm deep according the the spec page at the manufacturer ’s website .
Then I decided to temporarily mount one of the optical drives in the lower bay to see how much space there would be between it and the PSU .
Not a lot of room to spare but enough to get your fingers in to move a jumper or swap cables if necessary .
I ’m not going to buy one of every PSU and one of every drive that exists to make a list but I did a bit or research and found that some high powered PSU ’s are 160 mm long and some are 180 mm long .
Not know how long the drives that could be paired with such power supplies I will say this : A 160 mm long PSU would be a tight fit at best and a 180 mm PSU would almost certainly be a no go with an optical drive in the lower bay unless the optical drive was very short .
Given that this case is a MATX case I do n’t think the small space is anything to complain about , I ’m actually pleased to see that it is possible to put full sized optical drives in the lower bay with the 350 w PSU .
Compact size and functionality .
Screwing the slide rails into the hard drive was easy , then I just slid the drive into the inner cage and slid the cage back into the case before locking it in .
The upper drive bays went just as easy .
Just slide in the the drives and lock them in place .
The “ action ” for all of these maneuvers , putting drives in and taking them out , was very smooth .
No snags or getting caught on anything .
Let ’s hear it once more for good attention to detail .
Speaking of which , the back edges of the upper drive cage are not 90o , it ’s slightly tapered such that it does not come back as far on the motherboard tray side as it does on the component side .
I found this was very useful in helping me install the motherboard .
It gave me the extra room to move that made installation a breeze .
Again note the red line showing the 2 ½ ” drive mounts .
So here is what we see with everything installed .
The motherboard I ’m using is a mATX that meets the proper dimensions for the mATX standard .
While putting the motherboard in place , I did not have a lot of clearance , but I did n’t have to wiggle it in or remove the PSU or drives first , I did n’t even have to remove the CPU cooler ( Cooler Master Hyper TX2 , a “ standard sized ” heat - pipe tower with 92 mm fan ) , I just angled it into place and it aligned with the mounting holes perfectly .
Once mounted I could see that there was little headroom above the cooler , very little .
Most , if not all 120 mm tower coolers wo n’t fit , especially if you plan on putting fans on the door .
Heck I could n’t even put a thin ( 25 mm thick ) fan on the upper / back 120 mm fan mount on the door without it hitting the top of my TX2 .
So , if you ’re gonna use a cooler with a 120 mm fan you ’ll have to keep it to a max height of about 145 mm from top to bottom or the door wo n’t shut .
In the picture below , we can see the ruler measuring 145 mm from the top of the motherboard to the edge of the case .
To this number we must add the 7 - 8 mm distance from the start of the ruler to the actual beginning of the markings on it ( see the above image regarding the depth of room to hide cables behind the mother board ) but then we must also subtract a similar amount for the distance from the top of the motherboard to the top of the processor once installed in the socket .
This is for socket LGA775 .
Any other sockets and your mileage may vary but probably not much .
So your best bet is to pick a 92 mm cooler or use a cooler where the bulk of the setup runs parallel to the motherboard instead of perpendicular .
At this point you might be asking why I ’m complaining about this , after all it is a mATX case , it ’s supposed to be small .
Well the answer is I ’m not complaining , I ’m just letting you all know what to expect .
Well what about water cooling ?
Room for that in a mATX case ?
In this one there is .
I can think of several configurations to use .
Look at all that empty space above the lower drive cage near the front 140 mm fan in the image above .
Also notice the three ( not two , three ! ) rubber access ports at the back of the case .
You could use two of them to run to and from the CPU block while keeping the bulk of the components outside the case , or going to and from an external rad while keeping most of the components inside the case , and still have one access port available for a fill port t- line .
Or just keep everything internal by mounting a small rad on the top 140 mm fan with the pump near the front 140 mm fan and the block on the core ( obviously ) .
The point is once you take out the heatsink you gain enough room to go with several different layouts , as long as you choose the right parts for your loop .
Also , in spite of my initial concerns , I do believe the shell does have the structural integrity to handle the weight of a H 2 O loop .
The USB and front audio pin outs were labeled clearly in the manual and the pins were arranged in the proper manner .
I connected and tested them , the audio and USB front ports work fine , as does the power switch and the activity LEDs .
Now that I ’ve hooked up all the cables , routing them through the back side of the mother board tray of course , it was ready to go .
Hit the switch and it fired up just fine .
Fan noise ?
Near silent .
Very quiet , all of them .
I placed my hand on the case when the machine was on and felt very little vibration .
Conclusions
So now that I ’ve poked and prodded the thing , put the parts in and fired it up I should get to my conclusions .
I want to say that my initial fears of the fragility of some of the plastic tabs was unfounded .
I popped the front bezel on and off more than once and the same can be said for all of the drive bay covers , and they all held up just fine .
The initial smell I was met with upon opening the packaging ?
Once I had the case out of the packaging and it was getting some air it was gone within 10 minutes , tops .
The structure of the metal was stronger than my initial “ finger - rap ” led me to suspect .
I did n’t put it into a car - crusher or sledge hammer it to see how easily it would buckle , but a bit of gentle , consistent twisting pressure on the shell did not cause it to yield in the slightest .
Nothing bent , nothing warped , no rivets came out , no problem with the structure at all .
However , I did notice a small scratch in the finish on the outside of the bottom of the case .
This must have happened while I was installing the components because it was not there when I first examined the case .
I ’m surprised that it happened at all as I was n’t manhandling the unit despite the above sentence about “ gentle twisting . ”
I must have accidentally set it down on something with an edge at one point and not realized it .
The blemish which I caused is noticeable .
It shows up as a mark that is a slightly lighter shade .
I ’ve no doubt that part of the reason I ’m aware of the scratch is that I ’m looking the whole thing over with a very critical eye , but if the scratch were big enough and on the top or one of the sides I think most people would notice it .
I ’m not saying it looks terrible , but I would have thought that the grainy matte finish would hide it better than a scratch on a shiny smooth finish but this is just not the case .
Based on my own previous experiences and observations , I ’d have to say this finish is neither better nor worse at hiding blemishes than a glossy , smooth finish .
It ’s not a negative , just not the bonus I had hoped it would be .
I ’ve avoided posting an image of the bottom of the case until now because my pre-scratch shots did not turn out right and I did n’t want to show the scratch until I had a chance to state that it was my fault for causing it .
So now that that is out of the way allow me to show what the bottom of the case looks like ( it ’s not a lot different than the top really , just add the feet ) and the scratch .
So in the end , what problems did I have with this case ?
Well the illuminated In - Win logo is way too bright for my comfort .
Also scratches in the finish are fairly easy to notice .
Other than that I can’t really say anything bad about it .
What did I like about it ?
Wheeew !
Where to start …
Well the manual is laid out very clearly , it ’s easy to follow the instructions and if you do you should n’t get lost along the way .
It ’s very quiet , especially when you consider it ’s got four fans in it .
You get a lot of room to work with for a case in its size category .
The drive bays provide a lot of versatility with many configuration options possible .
The construction is sturdy .
Then there ’s all the little things , the rubber grommets to dampen vibration , the secondary mesh to keep out dust , the way all the bits and pieces fit together effortlessly .
Other thoughts ?
Well I could say it would be nicer to have a case that can house a full height 120 mm tower cooler , but it is a mATX case that I ’m reviewing .
Complaining that it ’s not bigger would be like reviewing the design for the new penny and then complaining that it ’s bad because it ’s not a dollar .
Also , the style of the face , which I did not really touch on much in this review , is in my opinion purely a matter of personal aesthetics .
I ca n’t tell you if it looks good to you or not .
You do n’t need me to help you make that decision .
Just look at the pictures .
If you really want my opinion though I do like the look of it .
The lines are clean , nothing looks out of place like a clown ’s nose on a fashion model wearing a new tuxedo , and the mesh does give it something of an armored feel ( so watch out dragons , this case is ready for battle ! )
I think most people will like the look of it too , but everybody has the right to their own opinion .
So you tell me .
Do you like the way it looks ?

This summer , it seems everyone 's craving the cool taste of frozen yogurt .
Google 's newest version of its Android operating system , Android 2.2 -- better known by its nickname , " Froyo " -- is expected to start hitting handsets any day now .
But there 's still plenty of confusion over which phones will get Froyo and which will be left in the cold .
That 's the topic of this week 's Android Power reader question , which comes to us from Froyo - longing Android fan Rich O .
Rich writes :
Any idea which phones are and are n't getting the new Android 2.2 ?
No one seems to be saying much one way or the other .
Rich is right : Since Google 's announcement of Android 2.2 last month , the manufacturers and carriers have been keeping pretty quiet about their specific Froyo plans .
But piecing together the bits of info the powers - that - be have divulged , we can get a fairly decent picture of where most major devices stand .
So here 's what we know so far .
And do n't forget :
If you have an Android - related question of your own , send it in to ask@androidpower.com .
I 'll answer it here soon .
The Android 2.2 Upgrade List : Phones Definitely Getting Froyo
• Nexus One : Despite the shuttering of its online store , Google 's flagship phone is still first in line for the Froyo upgrade .
In late May , a " very limited test group " received an early copy of the 2.2 software .
Google has since been working on final tweaks and expects a widespread rollout to begin soon .
• Motorola Droid :
The Droid that started it all is set to be second in line for the Android 2.2 upgrade .
Early reports suggested the Droid could see Froyo before the end of June .
We all know what happened with the Droid 's 2.1 upgrade schedule , though , so do n't mark your calendars just yet .
• HTC Droid Incredible : HTC has confirmed that its newest Droid handset will be feasting on Froyo .
No specific timeframe has been released outside of sometime " in the second half of this year . "
• HTC EVO 4G : The EVO 4G is the phone most frequently pitted up against Apple 's new iPhone 4 ( hint : the EVO wins ) , so it 's no surprise that it's on the confirmed guest list for the latest and greatest Android release .
The EVO should get Froyo sometime in the next six months .
• MyTouch 3G and MyTouch 3G Slide :
The entire MyTouch line of phones on T - Mobile is expected to see Froyo before the end of 2010 .
• HTC Desire :
It 's not yet available in the States , but this desirable HTC handset is on - tap to get the Android 2.2 upgrade sometime in the next six months as well .
The Android 2.2 Upgrade List : Phones Where Froyo Looks Iffy
• Motorola Devour :
There 's no definite answer on Verizon 's non-Droid Motorola Android device , but the upgrade to 2.2 looks slightly iffy .
Officially , the Devour is still listed as " under evaluation " for the Android 2.1 upgrade .
That sure does n't seem like a promising sign when it comes to 2.2 .
• HTC Droid Eris and HTC Hero :
File these two HTC handsets under the " maybe " column , too .
While listing out which phones would see Android 2.2 , HTC conspicuously left these two names off the list .
The company also said it would most likely offer upgrades for all of its 2010 - model devices -- but outside of the Droid , it made no mention of the phones that debuted in late '09 .
• Motorola Backflip : The Android phone given the locked - down treatment by AT&T might get the Froyo nod , but I would n't place any wagers just yet .
Right now , Motorola lists the Backflip as being on - track to get upgraded to Android 2.1 in the third quarter of the year .
Its odds of someday seeing 2.2 seem higher than the Devour 's , then , but not high enough that you 'd want to hold your breath .
The Android 2.2 Upgrade List : Phones Not Expected to Get Froyo
• T- Mobile G1 : The first Android phone , unfortunately , is n't expected to get the Froyo upgrade ; its hardware is said to be too limited to provide full support .
It 's been nearly two years since the phone 's release , though , so the option for a handset upgrade should n't be too far away for Android 's earliest adopters .
• Samsung Behold II : Samsung has indicated its Behold II wo n't be upgraded beyond Android 1.6 .
As for a reason , the company has said only that the phone is " not upgradeable " beyond that point .
The Android 2.2 Upgrade List : The Rest of the Phones
The fate of other Android phones is less clear .
The Motorola Cliq and Cliq XT , for example , were originally scheduled to be upgraded to 2.1 before the end of the summer .
It 's possible Motorola might bump them directly to 2.2 instead , but no one 's saying anything for sure .
Samsung 's also staying quiet on the status on its Samsung Moment Android device .
The phone just received its official 2.1 upgrade a month ago , so there 's no telling if and when the next release might arrive .
Stay Tuned ...
Set your bookmarks : I 'll continue updating this page as new info becomes available on any of the Android handsets .
In the meantime , why not grab some free Android cell phone stickers from Google ?
Or go back up your Android home screens -- you never know when you might need to restore those things .
Hey , anything that takes your mind off the wait for Froyo can only help .

When we 're not using the Large Hadron Collider to smash particle beams together or daydream about time travel , we might as well turn it into a musical instrument right ?
Great !
Except that its tunes are purely hellspawn .

Of course , these are n't the actual sounds made by the LHC itself .
Instead , LHCsound has turned the properties of the Higgs jet into one creeptastic jingle :
A jet is made up of lots of cells containing energy deposits .
Each cell has an energy , a distance and an angular distance ( dR ) associated with it .
So each cell can be heard as a separate note in this example .
This is quite a long track ( about 90 seconds ) .
The sounds reduce in density very much towards the end , with isolated events separated by silences of several seconds .

Intriguing !
And definitive proof that while the LHC has n't ended the world yet , it 's definitely plotting .

A male mexican molly with moustache
Male molly fish in Mexico wear a moustache that makes them appear more sexy to females .
Scientists were unsure why male Mexican mollies wear an extravagant moustache - like structure on their top lip .
Now a study has revealed that female fish find the moustache sexually attractive , and it is likely to be a sexually selected trait .
As well as being visually - attractive , the moustache may be used to rub the female fish 's genitals , exciting them .
Details are published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology .
As their name suggests , Mexican mollies ( Poecilia sphenops ) live in Mexico , being a fairly common species that resides in a range of habitats from small rivers to creeks and lakes .
The fish has a complicated mating behaviour , with males fertilising females internally , rather than spreading sperm over externally laid eggs .
Sexy company
Not all males are equal , however .
A close up of the sexy organ
Some possess a moustache - type structure growing from scales on their top lip .
Until now , its function has not been known as it has not been studied or described in any detail .
So zoologist Professor Ingo Schlupp of the University of Oklahoma in Norman , US and colleagues in the US and Germany decided to study it for the first time .
They caught from the wild a selection of male and female Mexican mollies , measuring the length of the moustache on those males found to be growing one .
The research team then conducted a series of experiments , placing male and female fish into tanks , and measuring how long females spent in the company of males sporting moustaches of various lengths , or none at all .
They also measured how female fish responded to videos of different males .
The results were clear : on experiments involving over 100 fish , females consistently preferred males with moustaches .
" The moustache - like structure seems to be a previously unrecognised sexually selected trait in poeciliid fishes , " the researchers write in the journal .
Touchy feely
Although the scientists only tested the visual attractiveness of the moustache , they strongly suspect it also has a tactile function .
" This is based on the general observation that males will touch the female 's genital region with their mouth prior to mating , " Prof Schlupp told the BBC .
This behaviour is known as ' nipping ' and is being investigated further by the scientists .
But they think that the females can acquire information about the males this way .
In short , rubbing his moustache against a female 's genitals may be a way for a male Mexican molly to advertise his attractiveness .

" Several other species , including catfish , have comparable structures , mostly with unknown functions , " Prof Schlupp says .
Some zoologists have speculated that the long fleshy tentacles grown by male catfish might mimic larvae , allowing them to catch more prey .
That ability to catch more food might make them attractive mates to females .
The Middle Island sinkhole is open to Lake Huron , creating a gradient of biological activity .
A nine - metre boat is also visible in this aerial photo for sense of scale .
(( Scott Kendall / Bopi Biddanda / Grand Valley State University ) )
Twenty metres below the surface of Lake Huron , scientists have discovered peculiar sinkholes where a bizarre ecosystem at odds with the rest of the lake flourishes .
The huge lake 's freshwater fish shun the dense , salty , oxygen - deprived waters of these sinkholes off northeastern Michigan .
Instead , brilliant purple mats of cyanobacteria — cousins of microbes found at the bottom of permanently ice - covered lakes in Antarctica — and pallid , floating , ponytail - like microbes thrive .
Groundwater from beneath the lake is dissolving minerals from the ancient seabed and carrying them into the lake to form these exotic , extreme environments , says aquatic ecologist Bopaiah Biddanda of Michigan 's Grand Valley State University , a leader of the team studying the sinkhole ecosystems .
" These are almost primordial Earth conditions , with high sulphur and low oxygen like in the ancient oceans that covered the Earth three billion years ago , " Biddanda told CBC News .
" It gives us a window into the past and who knows what value it will hold . "
The researchers describe this little - known underwater habitat in this week 's issue of Eos , published by the American Geophysical Union .
Although above - ground sinkholes in the area were discovered decades ago , the submerged sinkholes were only recently uncovered .
Discovered 8 years ago
In 2001 , researchers with the Connecticut - based Institute for Exploration stumbled across them during an underwater archeological survey for shipwrecks in Michigan 's Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary .
Scientists began to explore these sinkholes a couple of years later , finding some just 20 metres below the surface and others extending 100 metres down , where the sun never shines .
But their findings have trickled in over the last few years because of the logistical problems in exploring lakebed sinkholes .
" Finding these little spots in a huge lake — you can't even compare it to looking for a needle in a haystack , " said Biddanda .
The most recent findings show an ecosystem that has more in common with Antarctic lakes and deep - sea , hydrothermal vents than it does with a freshwater lake .
" We were amazed to find these brilliant cyanobacteria mats , " said Biddanda .
DNA sequencing of the purple mats show they are closely related to mats found in the ice - covered , oxygen - poor Antarctic lakes .
Biddanda suspects similar ecosystems once existed all around the Earth but largely disappeared as the planet 's atmosphere became increasingly oxygen - rich .
The team , including researchers from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , suspects similar sinkholes exist under the other Great Lakes because , with the exception of Lake Superior , the lakebeds are all composed of limestone , with ancient aquifers running beneath .
The researchers will continue to study the sinkholes this summer , keeping a sharp eye out for the possible discovery of never - before - seen organisms and biochemical processes .

A science historian at The University of Manchester has cracked " The Plato Code " - the long disputed secret messages hidden in the great philosopher 's writings .
Plato was the Einstein of Greece 's Golden Age and his work founded Western culture and science .
Dr Jay Kennedy 's findings are set to revolutionise the history of the origins of Western thought .
Dr Kennedy , whose findings are published in the leading US journal Apeiron , reveals that Plato used a regular pattern of symbols , inherited from the ancient followers of Pythagoras , to give his books a musical structure .
A century earlier , Pythagoras had declared that the planets and stars made an inaudible music , a ' harmony of the spheres ' .
Plato imitated this hidden music in his books .
The hidden codes show that Plato anticipated the Scientific Revolution 2,000 years before Isaac Newton , discovering its most important idea - the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics .
The decoded messages also open up a surprising way to unite science and religion .
The awe and beauty we feel in nature , Plato says , shows that it is divine ; discovering the scientific order of nature is getting closer to God .
This could transform today 's culture wars between science and religion .
• PhysOrg.com iPhone iPad Apps " Plato's books played a major role in founding Western culture but they are mysterious and end in riddles , " Dr Kennedy , at Manchester 's Faculty of Life Sciences explains .
" In antiquity , many of his followers said the books contained hidden layers of meaning and secret codes , but this was rejected by modern scholars .
" It is a long and exciting story , but basically I cracked the code .
I have shown rigorously that the books do contain codes and symbols and that unraveling them reveals the hidden philosophy of Plato .
" This is a true discovery , not simply reinterpretation . "
This will transform the early history of Western thought , and especially the histories of ancient science , mathematics , music , and philosophy .
Dr Kennedy spent five years studying Plato 's writing and found that in his best - known work the Republic he placed clusters of words related to music after each twelfth of the text - at one - twelfth , two - twelfths , etc .
This regular pattern represented the twelve notes of a Greek musical scale .
Some notes were harmonic , others dissonant .
At the locations of the harmonic notes he described sounds associated with love or laughter , while the locations of dissonant notes were marked with screeching sounds or war or death .
This musical code was key to cracking Plato 's entire symbolic system .
Dr Kennedy , a researcher in the Centre for the History of Science , Technology and Medicine , says : " As we read his books , our emotions follow the ups and downs of a musical scale .
Plato plays his readers like musical instruments . "
However Plato did not design his secret patterns purely for pleasure - it was for his own safety .
Plato 's ideas were a dangerous threat to Greek religion .
He said that mathematical laws and not the gods controlled the universe .
Plato 's own teacher had been executed for heresy .
Secrecy was normal in ancient times , especially for esoteric and religious knowledge , but for Plato it was a matter of life and death .
Encoding his ideas in secret patterns was the only way to be safe .
Plato led a dramatic and fascinating life .
Born four centuries before Christ , when Sparta defeated plague - ravaged Athens , he wrote 30 books and founded the world 's first university , called the Academy .
He was a feminist , allowing women to study at the Academy , the first great defender of romantic love ( as opposed to marriages arranged for political or financial reasons ) and defended homosexuality in his books .
In addition , he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery before being ransomed by friends .
Dr Kennedy explains : " Plato 's importance can not be overstated .
He shifted humanity from a warrior society to a wisdom society .
Today our heroes are Einstein and Shakespeare - and not knights in shining armour - because of him . "
Over the years
Dr Kennedy carefully peeled back layer after symbolic layer , sharing each step in lectures in Manchester and with experts in the UK and US .
He recalls : " There was no Rosetta Stone .
To announce a result like this I needed rigorous , independent proofs based on crystal - clear evidence .
" The result was amazing - it was like opening a tomb and finding new set of gospels written by Jesus Christ himself .
" Plato is smiling .
He sent us a time capsule . "
Dr Kennedy 's findings are not only surprising and important ; they overthrow conventional wisdom on Plato .
Modern historians have always denied that there were codes ; now Dr Kennedy has proved otherwise .
He adds : " This is the beginning of something big .
It will take a generation to work out the implications .
All 2,000 pages contain undetected symbols . "
Plato quoted :
“ Be kind , for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle . ”
“ If women are expected to do the same work as men , we must teach them the same things . ”
“ Ignorance : the root of all evil . ”
“ Only the dead have seen the end of war . ”
“ The price good men pay for indifference to publiuc affairs is to be ruled by evil men . ”
“ Wise men talk because they have something to say ; fools , because they have to say something . ”
The Southeastern Conference , reportedly keen on adding Texas A&M amid the onrush of a Big 12 shakeup , would be just as interested in luring Texas and Oklahoma but does n't see either as a realistic option , sources with knowledge of the SEC 's maneuverings have told ESPN and ESPN.com .
An SEC athletic director told ESPN.com 's Mark Schlabach that the SEC 's first choice would be adding the Longhorns , but might consider taking Texas A&M because it expands the league 's footprint into the Dallas and Houston TV markets .
Given the fact that Texas A&M may be the only Big 12 school the SEC could add , the league was prepared to make the move even if Texas and Oklahoma went elsewhere .
" We 've got to be diligent in evaluating this , " another SEC athletic director told ESPN.com 's Schlabach .
" We can't just add teams who are going to split the pie without adding anything substantial to the pie . "
Adding the Aggies would provide SEC West member Arkansas with a natural rival , which the Razorbacks have lacked since joining the league in 1992 from the Southwest Conference .
Looking beyond the Big 12 for expansion , specifically to the ACC for schools such as Georgia Tech , Clemson , Florida State or Miami , was not in the SEC 's plans , sources told ESPN .
The sources saw no way the SEC would raid the ACC and added serious doubt that Virginia Tech could be pried away from Virginia .
I ’ve been working at a frenetic pace lately trying to toggle between researching and writing a chapter on the relationship between fashion , creativity , and copyright ( from a critical race and gender studies perspective , naturally ) ; responding to queries about our exhibition on the fashion histories and practices of women of color ( such queries are increasing so YAY !! ) ; and playing Julie the cruise ship director for our impending family trip ( we are not going on a cruise ) .
All this is to explain why this post is full of links rather than original writing .
If I had the time to blog , I ’d finish this post about Rodarte ’s upcoming Fall collection , inspired by the maquiladora workers in Juárez , Mexico .
( I have to admit that I missed the news on this collection and only caught up with it when a link showed up this weekend on my personal Facebook wall to a blog post on Oh Industry .
So thank god for social media doing its thing ! )
As Nicole Phelps from Style.com explains , the collection came to the Mulleavy sisters ( the design team behind Rodarte ) as a brainstorm while on a recent roadtrip from El Paso to Marfa , Texas :
[ A ] long drive from El Paso to Marfa , Texas , got them thinking they might like to explore their Mexican roots .
From there , they became interested in the troubled border town of Ciudad Juárez ; the hazy , dreamlike quality of the landscape there ; and the maquiladora workers going to the factory in the middle of the night .
And that , according to the designers , who certainly know how to romance a pitch , led to this conclusion :
They ’d build a collection off the idea of sleepwalking .
While it is frequently speculated that the Mulleavys were attempting to comment on the mass murders of maquiladora workers along the Juárez border with this collection , their message clearly did not telegraph .
Consider the ways in which luminaries from the runway show describe the collection ( see video below ) .
Glossed over by the fantasies of fashion ( consider the descriptions by Glenda Bailey and Nadja Swarovski in the above video : enchanted forest , the modern American fashion spirit ) are the harsh physical and economic realities of the thousands of maquiladora workers who provide the hidden labors of globalized fashion and the hundreds ( some argue , thousands ) of women who have been murdered between Tijuana and Juárez .
( For more about maquiladoras , check out Vicky Funari and Sergio de la Torre ’s documentary Maquilapolis . )
I know Mimi would have a ton of smart things to say about this collection as well as Rodarte ’s forthcoming collaboration with MAC on cosmetic products inspired by their latest collection , which was inspired by their depoliticized aestheticization of maquiladoras .
Beginning on September 15 , 2010 , customers can purchase lipsticks called “ Ghost Town ” and “ Sleepless ” ; lipglass called “ del Norte ” ; eyeshadow called “ Bordertown ” ; and nail polish called “ Factory ” and “ Juarez ” ( and there ’s more ) .
Addendum : Looks like MAC is backing off maquiladora - chic : see here and here .
Mimi already has several posts in her draft queue for when she returns from her much - deserved vacation but I ’m hoping she ’ll have a few choice words about this collection as well .
But for now , why not revisit her crazy smart post on a related topic on the tangled complex of race , gender , labor , and fashion representation in Background Color ?
________________________________
As anyone who peruses the fashion media complex with any regularity knows by now , luxury fashion designers and companies have both praised and vilified new media communication technologies for democratizing or massifying ( depending on your perspective ) fashion .
Here are two recent pieces on fashion ’s vexed relationship with technology .
The first is Amy Odell ’s blog post called “ The Recession Has Forced High - Fashion Companies to Use the Internet ” and the second is an article in the New York Times titled , “ High Fashion Relents to Web ’s Pull ” . . . “ Forced ” and “ Relents ” – ha !
– as if the fashion elite has n’t already benefited enormously from the free labors of bloggers and other social media types who deftly use these technologies .
Sigh .
So much to post and so little time .
Ok , see you next week when I get back from week - long vacation from thinking about work ( hopefully ) !
I was thinking about the great time that I had at LISA09 and PICC , and the thought occurred to me that I did n’t know about many sysadmin - related events .
I mean , I hear about the big stuff , but there may very well be smaller events , or local events , that I ( and most other people ) do n’t hear about .
I think it ’s because the information is disseminated in relatively closed circles , or via a publicly available webpage that relatively few people go to .
It made me wish that there was a public clearing house for sysadmin - related events , but I could n’t find one , so I decided to do something about it .
I ’m happy to introduce the SysAdmin Event Calendar .
Essentially , it ’s an embedded Google Calendar that I ’ll be manually adding links to .
I do n’t expect that there are so many events that I ’ll be overwhelmed ( but that would be great , and I ’d have to elicit help from you all for volunteers ) , but for now I ’m going to take care of everything .
As you can see on that page ( which you can also get to by clicking the “ SysAdmin Calendar ” link in the top bar on the Standalone Sysadmin site ) that there are some ground rules I ’ve laid down to prevent this from being a commercial marketing service .
My interest is in getting system administrators together in person and meeting each other , and the rules are created with that in mind .
Please spread word of this calendar around .
Since it ’s hosted at Google , anyone can subscribe to the RSS feed or even to their own calendar with the ics file .
My eventual goal for this is to have enough entries and events that it becomes necessary to have multiple calendars , and separate them out geographically .
I ’d love to have the sysadmin community so active that I could say “ oh , I ’m going to be in Spokane next week , I wonder what ’s going on in that area ” and click the “ Northwest USA ” map .
Things like that take time , but I ’m patient , and I ’m committed to helping do what I can to make sure that people can build their communities .
Please let me know if you have any suggestions for the calendar , or if you think my rule set is too strict ( or too lenient , I suppose ) .
And please please please tell me about the sysadmin - related things going on in your world , because I want to put them on the calendar .
" I 'd seen him every day as I went by and wondered if he was going to be picked up .
Then on Friday I drove home to see his body between the lines - they had painted the road , but left a gap where he lay . "
In the early hours of April 17 , Seattle ’s 15 - year veteran police detective Shandy Cobane nabbed the wrong man while responding to a robbery .
Less than a month later , he was in tears before the press and his community , pleading for forgiveness .
What happened that fateful night was brought to the world thanks to the presence of an amateur videographer , who captured Cobane kicking an innocent man in the face as he lay face down on the concrete .

The robbery suspect was reportedly Hispanic .
Facing their Hispanic male suspect who lay compliant on the ground , Cobane screamed : “ I ’m going to beat the fucking Mexican piss out of you homey .
You feel me ? ”
Apparently reacting to the man wiping his eye , the officer kicked his face and dragged his boot across the man ’s arm .
Seconds later , a female officer on the scene stomped on his leg .
Once freed , officers appeared to acknowledge the man ’s injuries and one advises him to lean against a car to ensure he could remain on his feet .
“ I want you to relax your weight on the car , okay ? ” one said .
“ Put your hands back so you do n’t fall down . ”
After police realized their suspect had committed no wrongs and moved away , the videographer got up close with his subject .
“ So they kicked you in the head , man ? ” he asked the victim .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Yeah , they did , ” he said , appearing mildly dazed .
Asked why , the man replied with a pained smirk : “ I do n’t know … They just knocked me down and kicked me in the head . ”
“ I know my words cut deep and were very hurtful . …
I am truly , truly sorry , ” Cobane told reporters on Sunday , according to The Seattle Times .
“ Cobane said that as a 15 - year veteran of the Seattle Police Department , he at no time envisioned that he would ‘ do anything to bring such notoriety to my department .
Sadly , I did , ' ” the paper added .

He apparently did not apologize for injuring the man .
While the incident in the video took place on a Saturday , officer Cobane was not put on leave until the following Friday .
Police claimed an internal investigation was underway .

Supreme Court steps into Arizona 's public financing law
By Robert Barnes
The Supreme Court on Tuesday stopped Arizona from distributing campaign subsidies to publicly funded candidates facing big-spending opponents .
The court granted a stay request from opponents of a decade - old law that subsidizes state candidates who agree to spend only public money on their campaigns .
The high court will decide whether to review lower court decisions .
The subsidies are an attempt to blunt the influence of campaign contributors .
In order to keep the publicly financed candidates from being roundly outspent , new subsidies are doled out according to the fundraising and spending of their privately financed opponents .
But those candidates , some of whom are self - financed , say the law forces them to limit their spending to avoid triggering more public money for their opponents .
A federal judge in Arizona said that made the law unconstitutional .
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit disagreed , setting up the issue for the high court .
Opponents of the law asked the court to stop the next round of public payments , which are scheduled for June 22 , while deciding whether to hear the case .
A brief submitted by an intervener in the case , Clean Elections Institute , said disallowing the subsidies would " likely distort the outcome of the 2010 elections in Arizona . "
As an example , it pointed to the governor 's race .
Gov. Jan Brewer ( R ) , a publicly funded candidate , is eligible to receive more than $ 2.1 million under the current plan .
" If matching funds were enjoined , that amount will drop by 66 percent to $ 707,447 . "
Her privately financed GOP opponent Buz Mills , the brief said , already has spent nearly $ 2.3 million .
According to the court 's order , the stay would dissolve if the court decided not to take the case .
The decision on the stay , as is customary , came without explanation .
There were no noted dissents .
As the 2010 MLB All Star Game culminated its festivities , there was a feeling of unrest as if something was missing , and no doubt there was .
One of the best players to ever grace the field has retired and he will be known for his ‘ forever young ’ personality , incredible all around skill and one of the best smiles in professional sports .
Ken Griffey was n’t playing in the All Star game this season as he hung up the cleats as one of the greatest .
“ The Kid ” had 13 All Star appearances , 10 Gold Glove Trophy ’s and 7 Silver Slugger Title under his belt .
It seemed almost an inevitability that he was going to break every record in the book , including a trouncing of Hank Aarons 755 home runs , but unfortunately he ran into a countless list of career demoralizing injuries .
From broken hands , wrists to hamstring tears .
You name it Junior was plagued by it .
However , lets not focus on the injuries that derailed his career , rather lets focus on the illustrious and incredible career itself .
What distinguishes Griffey between him and any other great player in the last decade or so is his integrity to the game of baseball .
In the dreadful time of the “ steroids era ” he shunned all the external pressures of performance and never became involved in juicing up like pretty much every other star out there .
Jose Canseco…roids , Mark Mcgwire ….roids , Sammy Sosa….roids , Barry Bonds … you kinda get the picture .
There were more juiceheads going around , even Snookie would have gone crazy .
The manor in which Griffey disregarded all the drug using bullshit and played the game the way it was meant to be played really proves his true character .
Cooperstown will acknowledge Ken Griffey with open arms as he epitomized the righteous and honest way to play baseball unlike any other player in the modern era .
Let us re-indulge in his greatness oh just one last time …

The latest procedure to try to contain the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico hit a snag on Wednesday when a saw that was being used in a crucial part of the operation became stuck , officials said .
The diamond - laced wire saw was being used to cut the riser , the milelong pipe that once ran from the wellhead up to the drilling rig and now snakes along the seabed .
A technician involved in the effort said that the wire saw had cut less than halfway through the riser when it stopped being effective .
The saw was freed later Wednesday afternoon .
The technician , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the work , said it appeared that the saw was dulled by material inside the riser - including , perhaps , some of the objects pumped into the well during the failed " top kill " procedure last week .
The cut was part of a strategy to place a containment cap over the well and funnel the leaking oil up through a new riser to a ship on the surface .
A variation on this tactic was tried several weeks ago with a 98 - ton box that was to sit over the worst of the leaks , but it failed when the box became clogged with hydrates , icelike crystals of gas and water .
The Chicago Teacher ’s Union took legal action against the city for trying to increase Chicago Public School classroom sizes to 35 students .
In an unprecedented move that hinges on a decades old municipal code , the Teacher 's Union filed a lawsuit against the school system citing overcrowding .
A code passed in 1958 -- after the Our Lady of Angels School fire that killed 92 students -- requires that all classrooms have at least 20 square feet of space per body .
That means classrooms of 35 students and one teacher require at least 720 square feet of space .
The Union suit will include affidavits from teachers who have measured their rooms .
School officials say 90 percent of the classrooms in the CPS system are at least 700 square feet , and the typical classroom is 720 square feet .
" On top of the educational problems it would create , such huge class sizes would violate the city 's health and safety codes in thousands of our classrooms , " said Union President Marilyn Stewart in a statement .
" So whether you look at it from an educational standpoint or a health and safety standpoint , what CEO Ron Huberman and his Board of Education are trying to do is unconscionable . "
CPS estimates it can shave about $ 125 million off its budget by increasing class sizes from the maximum of 32 students to 35 .

That Matt Drudge ( pictured ) ' should set himself on fire ' is just one of David Weigel ’s most unvarnished opinions that was leaked from a liberal off - the - record listserv .
JournoList wonders who leaked
The leak of some of Washington Post blogger David Weigel ’s most unvarnished opinions ( Drudge “ should set himself on fire ” ) on the off - the - record listserv JournoList to Fishbowl DC – which prompted an apology on Weigel ’s blog – was not the first time the by - invitation - only group of left - leaning journalists and wonks has had their exceedingly frank comments unintentionally aired in public .
It was , if anyone is counting , the third – following one disclosure by Slate ’s Mickey Kaus of postings on the list and another , of sorts , by Salon ’s Glenn Greenwald .
That is an astoundingly low number for a three - year - old community of some 400 of the most outspoken and well - known voices in the American intelligentsia , and evidence of its members ’ loyalty to its code of silence .
Advertisement
But it was the first time the listserv has been used specifically as a weapon of the anonymous professional takedown , and so , sent shivers through the JournoList community .
“ People are feeling betrayed by whoever the leaker is , once again , ” said Eric Alterman , the Nation columnist and journalism professor who is a member of the listserv .
“ I think it ’s unwise to put anything on that list that you ca n’t defend in public .
There ’s no such thing as off - the - record with 400 people . ”
But the off - the - record nature of the listserve has been closely guarded , to the point that a previous article by POLITICO ’s Michael Calderone on JournoList last year got only a handful of the three dozen listserv members he contacted to share even basic elements of how the list functions .
“ The list is confidential , ” said one member who , in typical fashion , declined to be named for this article .
“ Whoever broke the confidentiality of the list obviously has no respect for some pretty basic journalistic norms .
But I ca n’t talk about it because it ’s supposed to be confidential . ”
The member added : “ Whoever leaked that is obviously extremely jealous of the exceptional work that Dave is doing for the Post , and whatever Dave said should be viewed in that light . ”
Weigel ’s specialty covering conservatives ( his blog “ Right Now , ” is subtitled “ Inside the conservative movement and the Republican Party ” ) has made him a target for some on the right who feel he is not sufficiently supportive .
His controversial comments on the list came in response to a rough few days last week after the Drudge Report linked to his reporting on North Carolina Democratic Rep .
Bob Etheridge ’s altercation with an anonymous videographer under the headline , “ WaPo : Not an attack , a hug . ”
Shortly after , the Washington Examiner published an item about him dancing at a friend ’s wedding .
He took to JournoList to vent his frustration :
" This would be a vastly better world to live in if Matt Drudge decided to handle his emotional problems more responsibly , and set himself on fire , ” he wrote .
And elsewhere : " It 's all very amusing to me .
Two hundred screaming Ron Paul fanatics could n't get their man into the Fox News New Hampshire GOP debate , but Fox News is pumping around the clock to get Paultard Tea Party people on TV . "
In his apology Thursday , Weigel tried to explain himself ( “ Paultard , ” he argued is “ a neologism coined during the 2008 campaign to describe fanatical supporters of Paul ” ) but the leaked comments played into the suspicions harbored on the right about Weigel ’s ability to cover them fairly .
He has had to apologize before for calling opponents of gay marriage “ bigots , ” and has often taken heat from right - leaning blogs , such as Newsbusters , for another joke he made about Drudge on Twitter .
“ It seems like he spends a lot of time apologizing , ” said Penny Nance , the chief executive of Concerned Women for America , one of Weigel ’s conservative critics .
“ The problem is Concerned Women for America and other conservatives resent the idea of the Washington Post or other major news affiliates hiring people who hate us to be the ones to report on us .
David Weigel has already shown great distaste , if not downright disdain , for conservatives , so it ’s difficult for us to take the Post seriously when this is the person the Post hires to cover conservatives . ”
But the Post does not seem moved by the criticism .

Just How Bad Is The Deepwater Horizon Disaster ?
Posted by Pile ( 23062 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Environment ]
It goes without saying that most people no longer believe what British Petroleum is saying publicly about the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf and the condition of the well structure .
The reality is much more frightening ...
In a few crevices in Cyberspace , experts in the industry are whispering what they think is really going on ...
" OK let 's get real about the Gulf of Mexico oil flow .
There does n't really seem to be much info on TOD [ The Oil Drum - an online site where oil industry people congregate ] that furthers more complete understanding of what 's really happening in the GOM .
As you have probably seen and maybe feel yourselves , there are several things that do not appear to make sense regarding the actions of attack against the well .
Do n't feel bad , there is much that does n't make sense even to professionals unless you take into account some important variables that we are not being told about .
There seems to me to be a reluctance to face what cannot be termed anything less than grim circumstances in my opinion .
There certainly is a reluctance to inform us regular people and all we have really gotten is a few dots here and there ...
First of all ... set aside all your thoughts of plugging the well and stopping it from blowing out oil using any method from the top down .
Plugs , big valves to just shut it off , pinching the pipe closed , installing a new bop or lmrp , shooting any epoxy in it , top kills with mud etc etc etc .... forget that , it wo n't be happening ..it 's done and over .
In fact actually opening up the well at the subsea source and allowing it to gush more is not only exactly what has happened , it was probably necessary , or so they think anyway .
So you have to ask WHY ?
Why make it worse ?
There really can only be one answer and that answer does not bode well for all of us .
It 's really an inescapable conclusion at this point , unless you want to believe that every Oil and Gas professional involved suddenly just forgot everything they know or woke up one morning and drank a few big cups of stupid and got assigned to directing the response to this catastrophe .
Nothing makes sense unless you take this into account , but after you do ... you will see the " sense " behind what has happened and what is happening .
That conclusion is this :
The well bore structure is compromised " Down hole " .
That is something which is a " Worst nightmare " conclusion to reach .
While many have been saying this for some time as with any complex disaster of this proportion many have " said " a lot of things with no real sound reasons or evidence for jumping to such conclusions , well this time it appears that they may have jumped into the right place ...
TOP KILL - FAILS
This was probably our best and only chance to kill this well from the top down .
This " kill mud " is a tried and true method of killing wells and usually has a very good chance of success .
The depth of this well presented some logistical challenges , but it really should not of presented any functional obstructions .
The pumping capacity was there and it would have worked , should have worked , but it did n't .
It did n't work , but it did create evidence of what is really happening .
First of all the method used in this particular top kill made no sense , did not follow the standard operating procedure used to kill many other wells and in fact for the most part was completely contrary to the procedure which would have given it any real chance of working .
When a well is " Killed " using this method heavy drill fluid " Mud " is pumped at high volume and pressure into a leaking well .
The leaks are " behind " the point of access where the mud is fired in , in this case the " choke and Kill lines " which are at the very bottom of the BOP ( Blow Out Preventer )
The heavy fluid gathers in the " behind " portion of the leaking well assembly , while some will leak out , it very quickly overtakes the flow of oil and only the heavier mud will leak out .
Once that " solid " flow of mud is established at the leak " behind " the well , the mud pumps increase pressure and begin to overtake the pressure of the oil deposit .
The mud is established in a solid column that is driven downward by the now stronger pumps .
The heavy mud will create a solid column that is so heavy that the oil deposit can no longer push it up , shut off the pumps ... the well is killed ... it can no longer flow .
Usually this will happen fairly quickly , in fact for it to work at all ... it must happen quickly .
There is no " trickle some mud in " because that is not how a top kill works .
The flowing oil will just flush out the trickle and a solid column will never be established .
Yet what we were told was " It will take days to know whether it worked " ...
" Top kill might take 48 hours to complete " ... the only way it could take days is if BP intended to do some " test fires " to test integrity of the entire system .
The actual " kill " can only take hours by nature because it must happen fairly rapidly .
It also increases strain on the " behind " portion and in this instance we all know that what remained was fragile at best .
Early that afternoon we saw a massive flow burst out of the riser " plume " area .
This was the first test fire of high pressure mud injection .
Later on same day we saw a greatly increased flow out of the kink leaks , this was mostly mud at that time as the kill mud is tanish color due to the high amount of Barite which is added to it to weight it and Barite is a white powder .
We later learned the pumping was shut down at midnight , we were n't told about that until almost 16 hours later , but by then ... I 'm sure BP had learned the worst .
The mud they were pumping in was not only leaking out the " behind " leaks ... it was leaking out of someplace forward ... and since they were not even near being able to pump mud into the deposit itself , because the well would be dead long before ... and the oil was still coming up , there could only be one conclusion ... the wells casings were ruptured and it was leaking " down hole "
They tried the " Junk shot " ... the " bridging materials " which also failed and likely made things worse in regards to the ruptured well casings .
" Despite successfully pumping a total of over 30,000 barrels of heavy mud , in three attempts at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute , and deploying a wide range of different bridging materials , the operation did not overcome the flow from the well . "
ref
80 Barrels per minute is over 200,000 gallons per hour , over 115,000 barrels per day ... did we seen an increase over and above what was already leaking out of 115 k bpd ?.... we did not ... it would have been a massive increase in order of multiples and this did not happen .
" The whole purpose is to get the kill mud down , ? said Wells .
?
We 'll have 50,000 barrels of mud on hand to kill this well .
It 's far more than necessary , but we always like to have backup . "
Try finding THAT quote around ... it 's been scrubbed ... here 's a cached copy of a quote ...
ref
" The " top kill " effort , launched Wednesday afternoon by industry and government engineers , had pumped enough drilling fluid to block oil and gas spewing from the well , Allen said .
The pressure from the well was very low , he said , but persisting . "
" Allen said one ship that was pumping fluid into the well had run out of the fluid , or " mud , " and that a second ship was on the way .
He said he was encouraged by the progress . "
ref
Later we found out that Allen had no idea what was really going on and had been " Unavailable all day " ref
So what we had was BP running out of 50,000 barrels of mud in a very short period of time .
An amount far and above what they deemed necessary to kill the well .
Shutting down pumping 16 hours before telling anyone , including the president .
We were never really given a clear reason why " Top Kill " failed , just that it could n't overcome the well .
There is only one article anywhere that says anything else about it at this time of writing ... and it 's a relatively obscure article from the wall street journal " online " citing an unnamed source .
" WASHINGTON " BP PLC has concluded that its " top - kill " attempt last week to seal its broken well in the Gulf of Mexico may have failed due to a malfunctioning disk inside the well about 1,000 feet below the ocean floor .
The disk , part of the subsea safety infrastructure , may have ruptured during the surge of oil and gas up the well on April 20 that led to the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig , BP officials said .
The rig sank two days later , triggering a leak that has since become the worst in U.S. history .
The broken disk may have prevented the heavy drilling mud injected into the well last week from getting far enough down the well to overcome the pressure from the escaping oil and gas , people familiar with BP 's findings said .
They said much of the drilling mud may also have escaped from the well into the rock formation outside the wellbore .
As a result , BP was n't able to get sufficient pressure to keep the oil and gas at bay .
If they had been able to build up sufficient pressure , the company had hoped to pump in cement and seal off the well .
The effort was deemed a failure on Saturday .
BP started the top - kill effort Wednesday afternoon , shooting heavy drilling fluids into the broken valve known as a blowout preventer .
The mud was driven by a 30,000 horsepower pump installed on a ship at the surface .
But it was clear from the start that a lot of the " kill mud " was leaking out instead of going down into the well . "
ref
There are some inconsistencies with this article .
There are no " Disks " or " Subsea safety structure " 1,000 feet below the sea floor , all that is there is well bore .
There is nothing that can allow the mud or oil to " escape " into the rock formation outside the well bore except the well , because it is the only thing there .
All the actions and few tid bits of information all lead to one inescapable conclusion .
The well pipes below the sea floor are broken and leaking .
Now you have some real data of how BP 's actions are evidence of that , as well as some murky statement from " BP officials " confirming the same .
I took some time to go into a bit of detail concerning the failure of Top Kill because this was a significant event .
To those of us outside the real inside loop , yet still fairly knowledgeable , it was a major confirmation of what many feared .
That the system below the sea floor has serious failures of varying magnitude in the complicated chain , and it is breaking down and it will continue to .
What does this mean ?
It means they will never cap the gusher after the wellhead .
They cannot ... the more they try and restrict the oil gushing out the bop ?... the more it will transfer to the leaks below .
Just like a leaky garden hose with a nozzle on it .
When you open up the nozzle ?... it does n't leak so bad , you close the nozzle ?... it leaks real bad , same dynamics .
It is why they sawed the riser off ... or tried to anyway ... but they clipped it off , to relieve pressure on the leaks " down hole " .
I 'm sure there was a bit of panic time after they crimp / pinched off the large riser pipe and the Diamond wire saw got stuck and failed ... because that crimp diverted pressure and flow to the rupture down below .
Contrary to what most of us would think as logical to stop the oil mess , actually opening up the gushing well and making it gush more became direction BP took after confirming that there was a leak .
In fact if you note their actions , that should become clear .
They have shifted from stopping or restricting the gusher to opening it up and catching it .
This only makes sense if they want to relieve pressure at the leak hidden down below the seabed ..... and that sort of leak is one of the most dangerous and potentially damaging kind of leak there could be .
It is also inaccessible which compounds our problems .
There is no way to stop that leak from above , all they can do is relieve the pressure on it and the only way to do that right now is to open up the nozzle above and gush more oil into the gulf and hopefully catch it , which they have done , they just neglected to tell us why , gee thanks .
A down hole leak is dangerous and damaging for several reasons .
There will be erosion throughout the entire beat up , beat on and beat down remainder of the " system " including that inaccessible leak .
The same erosion I spoke about in the first post is still present and has never stopped , cannot be stopped , is impossible to stop and will always be present in and acting on anything that is left which has crude oil " Product " rushing through it .
There are abrasives still present , swirling flow will create hot spots of wear and this erosion is relentless and will always be present until eventually it wears away enough material to break it 's way out .
It will slowly eat the bop away especially at the now pinched off riser head and it will flow more and more .
Perhaps BP can outrun or keep up with that out flow with various suckage methods for a period of time , but eventually the well will win that race , just how long that race will be ?... no one really knows ....
However now ?
... there are other problems that a down hole leak will and must produce that will compound this already bad situation .
This down hole leak will undermine the foundation of the seabed in and around the well area .
It also weakens the only thing holding up the massive Blow Out Preventer 's immense bulk of 450 tons .
In fact ?... we are beginning to the results of the well 's total integrity beginning to fail due to the undermining being caused by the leaking well bore .
The first layer of the sea floor in the gulf is mostly lose material of sand and silt .
It does n't hold up anything and is n't meant to , what holds the entire subsea system of the Bop in place is the well itself .
The very large steel connectors of the initial well head " spud " stabbed in to the sea floor .
The Bop literally sits on top of the pipe and never touches the sea bed , it would n't do anything in way of support if it did .
After several tens of feet the seabed does begin to support the well connection laterally ( side to side ) you could n't put a 450 ton piece of machinery on top of a 100 ' tall pipe " in the air " and subject it to the side loads caused by the ocean currents and expect it not to bend over ... unless that pipe was very much larger than the machine itself , which you all can see it is not .
The well 's piping in comparison is actually very much smaller than the Blow Out Preventer and strong as it may be , it relies on some support from the seabed to function and not literally fall over ... and it is now showing signs of doing just that .... falling over .
If you have been watching the live feed cams you may have noticed that some of the ROVs are using an inclinometer ... and inclinometer is an instrument that measures " Incline " or tilt .
The BOP is not supposed to be tilting ... and after the riser clip off operation it has begun to ...
This is not the only problem that occurs due to erosion of the outer area of the well casings .
The way a well casing assembly functions it that it is an assembly of different sized " tubes " that decrease in size as they go down .
These tubes have a connection to each other that is not unlike a click or snap together locking action .
After a certain length is assembled they are cemented around the outside to the earth that the more rough drill hole is bored through in the well making process .
A very well put together and simply explained process of " How to drill a deep water oil well " is available here : ref
The well bore casings rely on the support that is created by the cementing phase of well construction .
Just like if you have many hands holding a pipe up you could put some weight on the top and the many hands could hold the pipe and the weight on top easily ... but if there were no hands gripping and holding the pipe ?... all the weight must be held up by the pipe alone .
The series of connections between the sections of casings are not designed to hold up the immense weight of the BOP without all the " hands " that the cementing provides and they will eventually buckle and fail when stressed beyond their design limits .
These are clear and present dangers to the battered subsea safety structure ( bop and lmrp ) which is the only loose cork on this well we have left .
The immediate ( first 1,000 feet ) of well structure that remains is now also undoubtedly compromised .
However ..... as bad as that is ?... it is far from the only possible problems with this very problematic well .
There were ongoing troubles with the entire process during the drilling of this well .
There were also many comprises made by BP IMO which may have resulted in an overall weakened structure of the entire well system all the way to the bottom plug which is over 12,000 feet deep .
Problems with the cementing procedure which was done by Haliburton and was deemed as " was against our best practices . " by a Haliburton employee on April 1st weeks before the well blew out .
There is much more and I wo n't go into detail right now concerning the lower end of the well and the troubles encountered during the whole creation of this well and earlier " Well control " situations that were revealed in various internal BP e-mails .
I will add several links to those documents and quotes from them below and for now , address the issues concerning the upper portion of the well and the region of the sea floor .
What is likely to happen now ?
Well ... none of what is likely to happen is good , in fact ... it's about as bad as it gets .
I am convinced the erosion and compromising of the entire system is accelerating and attacking more key structural areas of the well , the blow out preventer and surrounding strata holding it all up and together .
This is evidenced by the tilt of the blow out preventer and the erosion which has exposed the well head connection .
What eventually will happen is that the blow out preventer will literally tip over if they do not run supports to it as the currents push on it .
I suspect they will run those supports as cables tied to anchors very soon , if they do n't , they are inviting disaster that much sooner .
Eventually even that will be futile as the well casings cannot support the weight of the massive system above with out the cement bond to the earth and that bond is being eroded away .
When enough is eroded away the casings will buckle and the BOP will collapse the well .
If and when you begin to see oil and gas coming up around the well area from under the BOP ?
or the area around the well head connection and casing sinking more and more rapidly ?
... it wo n't be too long after that the entire system fails .
BP must be aware of this , they are mapping the sea floor sonically and that is not a mere exercise .
Our Gov't must be well aware too , they just are not telling us .
All of these things lead to only one place , a fully wide open well bore directly to the oil deposit ... after that , it goes into the realm of " the worst things you can think of "
The well may come completely apart as the inner liners fail .
There is still a very long drill string in the well , that could literally come flying out ... as I said ... all the worst things you can think of are a possibility , but the very least damaging outcome as bad as it is , is that we are stuck with a wide open gusher blowing out 150,000 barrels a day of raw oil or more .
There is n't any " cap dome " or any other suck fixer device on earth that exists or could be built that will stop it from gushing out and doing more and more damage to the gulf .
While at the same time also doing more damage to the well , making the chance of halting it with a kill from the bottom up less and less likely to work , which as it stands now ?.... is the only real chance we have left to stop it all .
It 's a race now ... a race to drill the relief wells and take our last chance at killing this monster before the whole weakened , wore out , blown out , leaking and failing system gives up it 's last gasp in a horrific crescendo .
We are not even 2 months into it , barely half way by even optimistic estimates .
The damage done by the leaked oil now is virtually immeasurable already and it will not get better , it can only get worse .
No matter how much they can collect , there will still be thousands and thousands of gallons leaking out every minute , every hour of every day .
We have 2 months left before the relief wells are even near in position and set up to take a kill shot and that is being optimistic as I said .
Over the next 2 months the mechanical situation also cannot improve , it can only get worse , getting better is an impossibility .
While they may make some gains on collecting the leaked oil , the structural situation cannot heal itself .
It will continue to erode and flow out more oil and eventually the inevitable collapse which cannot be stopped will happen .
It is only a simple matter of who can " get there first " ... us or the well .
We can only hope the race against that eventuality is one we can win , but my assessment I am sad to say is that we will not .
The system will collapse or fail substantially before we reach the finish line ahead of the well and the worst is yet to come .
Sorry to bring you that news , I know it is grim , but that is the way I see it .... I sincerely hope I am wrong .
We need to prepare for the possibility of this blow out sending more oil into the gulf per week then what we already have now , because that is what a collapse of the system will cause .
All the collection efforts that have captured oil will be erased in short order .
The magnitude of this disaster will increase exponentially by the time we can do anything to halt it and our odds of actually even being able to halt it will go down .
The magnitude and impact of this disaster will eclipse anything we have known in our life times if the worst or even near worst happens ...
We are seeing the puny forces of man vs the awesome forces of nature .
We are going to need some luck and a lot of effort to win ...
and if nature decides we ought to lose , we will ....
Reference materials :
On April 1 , a job log written by a Halliburton employee , Marvin Volek , warns that BP 's use of cement " was against our best practices . "
An April 18 internal Halliburton memorandum indicates that Halliburton again warned BP about its practices , this time saying that a " severe " gas flow problem would occur if the casings were not centered more carefully .
Around that same time , a BP document shows , company officials chose a type of casing with a greater risk ofcollapsing .
ref
Mark Hafle , the BP drilling engineer who wrote plans for well casings and cement seals on the Deepwater Horizon 's well , testified that the well had lost thousands of barrels of mud at the bottom .
But he said models run onshore showed alterations to the cement program would resolve the issues , and when asked if a cement failure allowed the well to " flow " gas and oil , he would n't capitulate .
Hafle said he made several changes to casing designs in the last few days before the well blew , including the addition of the two casing liners that were n't part of the original well design because of problems where the earthen sides of the well were " ballooning . "
He also worked with Halliburton engineers to design a plan for sealing the well casings with cement .

The information from BP identifies several new warning signs of problems .
According to BP there were three flow indicators from the well before the explosion .

BP , what we know : ref
What could have happened :
1. Before or during the cement job , an influx of hydrocarbon enters the wellbore .
2. Influx is circulated during cement job to wellhead and BOP .
3. 9-7/8 ? casing hanger packoff set and positively tested to 6500 psi .
4 . After 16.5 hours waiting on cement , a negative test performed on wellbore below BOP .
(~ 1400 psi differential pressure on 9 - 7/8 ?
casing hanger packoff and ~ 2350 psi on
double valve float collar )
5. Packoff leaks allowing hydrocarbon to enter wellbore below BOP .
1400 psi shut in
pressure observed on drill pipe ( no flow or pressure observed on kill line )
6. Hydrocarbon below BOP is unknowingly circulated to surface while finishing displacing
the riser .
7 . As hydrocarbon rises to surface , gas break out of solution further reduces hydrostatic
pressure in well .
Well begin to flow , BOPs and Emergency Disconnect System ( EDS ) activated but failed .
8. Packoff continues to leak allowing further influx from bottom .

About the author :
I used to cover the energy business ( oil , gas and alternative ) here in Texas , and the few experts in the oil field -- including geologists , chemists , etc. -- able or willing to even speak of this BP event told me early on that it is likely the entire reserve will bleed out .
Unfortunately none of them could say with any certainty just how much oil is in the reserve in question because , for one thing , the oil industry and secrecy have always been synonymous .
According to BP data from about five years ago , there are four separate reservoirs containing a total of 2.5 billion barrels ( barrels not gallons ) .
One of the reservoirs has 1.5 billion barrels .
I saw an earlier post here quoting an Anadarko Petroleum report which set the total amount at 2.3 billion barrels .
One New York Times article put it at 2 billion barrels .
If the BP data correctly or honestly identified four separate reservoirs then a bleed - out might gush less than 2 to 2.5 billion barrels unless the walls -- as it were -- fracture or partially collapse .
I am hearing the same dark rumors which suggest fracturing and a complete bleed - out are already underway .
Rumors also suggest a massive collapse of the Gulf floor itself is in the making .
They are just rumors but it is time for geologists or related experts to end their deafening silence and speak to these possibilities .
All oilmen lie about everything .
The stories one hears about the extent to which they will protect themselves are all understatements .
BP employees are already taking The Fifth before grand juries , and attorneys are laying a path for company executives to make a run for it .

This is our " hope " and " change we can believe in " ... a swarm of Chicago - style gangsters and traitors , the Barahm Obamuel administration .
The trick they 're using over and over is to publicly berate BP , Goldman Sachs , and ( dare I say it ? )
Israel while quietly protecting them and paying them off with countless billions and trillions of dollars .
This recklessly and seemingly inexplicably mis-managed mega - disaster in the Gulf is already being used to try to justify the passage of the insanely crippling and draconian raft of new " green " taxes and fascist measures previously known as " cap and trade , " an unwanted , evil , unconstitutional , toxic , sticky tarball of legislation that , like the so - called Patriot Act , was floating around and refusing to go away long before the giant crisis for which it will now be offered as the necessary answer .
Just as we should face the realities of just how bad this disaster may be , we should also face the realities of just how corrupt and malevolent some of the senior people in this government and these corporations can be .
This disaster may have been intentionally engineered or allowed to happen in order for these terroristic gangsters to achieve what they consider to be higher priorities .
It is unthinkable to the average person , especially when this is supposed to be a liberal , environmentally - concerned administration .
But there are so many reports and pieces of evidence that do n't make any sense according to the public cover stories and facades .
On the other hand , if one tries on for size these much darker interpretations , the data begin to line up in a nauseatingly tidy way ... as usual .
Most people are n't seeing it or focusing on it , but I believe that deception and misdirection on that scale has become a well - developed science and a long - established routine in Europe and America .

In relation to education , you wish to leave zero room pertaining to mistakes .
You want to do this after and you want to do it appropriate .
So here 's a peek at some sensible education goes concerning your job that you not bum out over .

Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
Could Minnesota ’s state bird , the common loon , become a victim of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico more than 1,200 miles away ?
A state Department of Natural Resources expert says it is a real possibility .
Unknown numbers of nonbreeding , juvenile loons from Minnesota reside in the Gulf , awaiting the time when they will be old enough to breed and return north .
Juvenile loons spend three years in the Gulf before they are sexually mature and migrate to Minnesota , said DNR nongame lake wildlife expert Pam Perry .
“ We have juvenile loons down there right now , and we do n’t know what will happen to them , ” she said .
“ Oil can have a direct impact on their mortality , but it can also disrupt the food chain .
We certainly have a lot of concerns . ”
Mature loons residing in Minnesota are raising their young , but come late October and early November , they will migrate to the Gulf Coast , as well as the shores of Florida , where they will spend the winter .
During that time , they will molt , or grow new feathers , and spend their time feeding in the Gulf , Perry said .
If oil is present in the areas where the loons winter , they could face dangers when their feathers become coated .
The oil could cause their feathers to lose their insulating ability and could weigh down the birds , causing them to drown , Perry said .
So far , most of the oil from the blown - out Deepwater Horizon well has remained offshore , but oil - soaked seabirds are beginning to show up at rehabilitation centers .
At least 400 pelicans , seagulls and other waterfowl have been brought to the Fort Jackson Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Louisiana , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Perry admitted there are many unknowns about how the spill could affect Minnesota loons and other shorebirds and waterfowl .
That is part of the frustration she and other biologists share .
“ We ’re all feeling kind of helpless about this , and we ’re not even sure what the Minnesota DNR can do , ” she said .
Minnesota has the largest population of common loons in the lower 48 states .
The population is around 12,000 , based on a 20 - year - old survey , and Perry said the DNR ’s monitoring in the past two decades suggests the population has not changed much since .
A 2004 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report on the status of the common loon in North America indicated oil spills are a major threat to seabirds , including loons .
The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which spilled 11 million gallons of oil across 1,300 miles of shoreline , killed at least 216 common loons whose carcasses were recovered .
A 1996 spill of home heating oil off the coast of Rhode Island killed an estimated 400 loons .
Another spill in Buzzard ’s Bay in Massachusetts in 2003 killed an estimated 200 common loons , according to the Fish and Wildlife report .
According to the conservation group Ducks Unlimited , the oil spill could have a “ potentially devastating ” impact on marine and wetland wildlife species , as well as devastating impacts on marsh plants and wetlands that are part of the Gulf ecosystem .
About 13 million waterfowl may winter in the Gulf Coast in some years , according to the group , but those birds are on their breeding grounds in the north , including Minnesota , the Dakotas and Canada .
Like loons and other shorebirds , waterfowl wo n’t return to their winter grounds until late fall or early winter .
Most waterfowl spend winters in brackish or freshwater marshes away from the Gulf , said Steve Cordts , Minnesota DNR waterfowl specialist , but some species , such as scaup , spend winters in the ocean .
Ducks Unlimited officials say they also are concerned about scaup and redheads , another species of duck , which winter offshore from Louisiana .
“ There have been some huge rafts of scaup seen way off shore , in thousands of feet of water , and no one is sure why they go there , ” Cordts said .
“ If they are loafing out there , and are in the oil , it would likely kill them . ”
So far , biologists said they and other experts can only monitor the situation .
Perry said there are discussions about putting satellite - tracking devices on some loons in Minnesota this year , perhaps in a joint effort with Wisconsin , but the project is still in the discussion stages .
“ I wish we had an answer for what we could do , ” Perry said .
“ We do n’t know if it ( the spill ) will be really bad or just bad when it comes to loons .
We know it ’s not going to be good . ”
Fall migration is still three months away .
Its peak for waterfowl and loons occurs in late October .
With oil still pouring into the Gulf , it is unknown how big the spill will become and where it will have the greatest ecological impacts .
Texas U.S. Rep. and ex-presidential candidate Ron Paul has endorsed Michigan state Rep. Justin Amash in the Republican race for western Michigan 's 3rd U.S. House district .
U.S. Rep. Vern Ehlers , R - Grand Rapids , is retiring and has endorsed lawyer Steve Heacock as his successor .
Amash is from Kent County 's Cascade Township , near Grand Rapids .
The libertarian - leaning Paul said in a statement Monday that Amash is " one of the most principled young leaders " he 's seen in a generation .
He says Amash stands for lower taxes and more freedom .
Other Republican primary candidates include state Sen. Bill Hardiman of Kentwood and Harvard University graduate student and Air Force veteran Bob Overbeek of Wyoming , Mich .
Image caption Ceop uses cartoons to teach children about online safety
Paedophiles are increasingly accessing indecent pictures of children from webcams , experts warn .
The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre ( Ceop ) says it has seen a " notable increase " in still and moving images captured on webcams .
Ceop warns some of these images may be self - taken , as a result of online grooming , and others are passed on via webcam streaming chat sites .
The centre is also cracking down on paedophiles travelling abroad .
In its annual review , Ceop said the volume of indecent images remained challenging and the rise in pictures captured via webcams was notable .
" These can be self - taken as a result of online grooming , for example , inciting a child to commit a sexual act and then using video capture software to record the video streams for later viewing and trading and / or use as blackmail to ensure further compliance by the child , " the report said .
" Similarly , there is also a marked trend of the use of webcam streaming chat sites , enabling offenders to interact either through instant messages and / or webcam to share previously captured footage or live - time images of abuse of children in their care . "
Travelling abroad
The Ceop report said its overseas tracker team - which works to disrupt paedophiles travelling abroad to abuse children - had become " more proactive than ever before " .
It said new ways of tracking offenders and better tactical intelligence gathering had seen 58 arrests , deportations or warrants issued .
Ceop 's picture of travelling offenders was improving " at pace " , it said .
The organisation said it had safeguarded 278 children from abuse between February 2009 and March 2010 - double the number it helped last year .
And Ceop said it had safeguarded a total of 624 children since its launch in 2006 , delivering " significant results " in the fight against child sexual abuse .
The annual review also noted that nearly 5.7 million children had taken part in its " Thinkuknow " online safety programme .
Jim Gamble , chief executive of Ceop , said : " Ceop brings together cross- sector expertise and then delivers bespoke front line services to a whole network of practitioners .
" That is real economy of scale and our results year on year show the very lasting and significant impact we are making . "
The Minister for Crime Prevention , James Brokenshire , said : " The government is committed to protecting children and Ceop plays a vital role which means more children are safeguarded , more offenders are apprehended and more professionals are trained . "
JOHANNESBURG ( AP ) — Caster Semenya was cleared to immediately return to track by the sport ’s governing body Tuesday , ending an 11 - month layoff while she underwent gender tests after becoming the 800 - meter world champion .
Semenya is allowed to keep running as a woman , although it is unclear if she has had any medical procedure or treatment during her time away .
The International Association of Athletics Federations said medical details of the 19 - year - old South African ’s case would remain confidential and it will have no further comment on the matter .
The IAAF added in its statement from its Monaco headquarters that it accepts the conclusion of a panel of medical experts that Semenya can compete with “ immediate effect . ”
She could return to competition at the world junior championships in Moncton , New Brunswick , starting July 19 .
“ I am thrilled to enter the global athletics arena once again and look forward to competing with all the disputes behind me . ”
Semenya said in a statement .
Richard Stander of Athletics South Africa said that Semenya would now be considered for South Africa ’s team for the world junior championships , pending a fitness test in Pretoria on Wednesday requested by ASA .
“ Of course we are happy , ” Mr. Stander said .
“ When an athlete cannot compete it is frustrating for them and frustrating for us as a federation . ”
Mr. Stander said the African championships in Kenya in late July and October ’s Commonwealth Games in India were more realistic targets for Semenya after her long absence from competition .
Semenya ’s lawyers said negotiations with the IAAF lasted 10 months and had been held in Monaco , Istanbul and Parish .
“ But due to the nature of the matter the parties resolved to keep the negotiations confidential , ” said Greg Nott , managing partner of Dewey and LeBoeuf ’s Johannesburg office .
Semenya underwent gender tests following her dominant run as an 18 - year - old at the Berlin world championships last August .
“ We are delighted that Caster is finally being permitted to compete with other women , as is her legal and natural right , ” lawyer Jeffrey Kessler said .
“ Hopefully , this resolution will set a precedent so that no female athlete in the future will have to experience the long delays and public scrutiny which Caster has been forced to endure . ”
Earlier , Semenya ’s father said his daughter had told him before the announcement that she was going to be cleared .
“ She told me she does n’t have any problems and she is happy , ” Jacob Semenya said .
The announcement ended a saga in which the teenager burst onto the world scene in Berlin where she captured a gold medal in her first major event .
Her dramatic improvement in times and muscular build led the IAAF to order gender verification tests .
Semenya was welcomed as a national hero in South Africa following her stunning victory , but reports of the gender tests and stories in the Australian media saying she had both male and female sex organs caused outrage in her home country and led some public officials to rally behind her .
Last month , South Africa ’s sports ministry abruptly canceled a news conference in which it was expected to announce Semenya ’s return .
South African sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile also released a statement , saying it was “ great news for Caster and all of us . ”
“ We thank Caster for her patience and resilience , ” Mr. Stofile said .
“ We thank her family and coach for their unfailing support . ”
Last month , the sports ministry abruptly canceled a news conference in which it was expected to announce Semenya ’s return to athletics .
Semenya ’s lawyers said they had been told the conference , which was to be hosted by Mr. Stofile , had been called off because the IAAF ’s executive committee had not received a “ formal briefing ” on Semenya ’s case by medical officials .
South Africa ’s ruling ANC party also made a public statement Tuesday , calling the decision “ a vindication of the ANC , her family , our government and all progressive forces who stood behind her during her time of need . ”
“ It has always been our long - held view that Caster is a woman and she should have been allowed a long time ago to participate in athletics as a woman , ” national spokesman Jackson Mthembu said .
“ We do n’t believe that any aspersion should have been cast on her gender as woman . ”

Jose Theodore wo n't return to Caps
Moments after a misty - eyed speech here in Las Vegas while accepting the Bill Masterton Trophy , Jose Theodore confirmed to me that GM George McPhee called recently to inform the veteran goal that he wo n't be re-signed by the Caps .
" We had a good talk , " Theodore said .
" I enjoyed my time in Washington .
Two great years .
Winning percentage , stats - wise , it was fun to play for the Caps .
But things in the new NHL , they are , they 're going to go with the young kids [ Semyon Varlamov and Michal Neuvirth ] and I respect that . "
" I have nothing but good words to say about this city , especially the fans and the organization , " he added .
" With the way I finished last year , I 'm just looking forward to next season . "
Theodore said he does not know where he 'll end up but quickly added that he 's not ready to be a mentor or a backup .
" We 're going to see on July 1 , " he said .
" There 's going to be a few openings .
I 'm just going to see which one fits the best .
I 'm not ready for that mentoring job .
The last few years I 've been playing 50 or more games .
I still feel like I can play 50 games .
I feel I can mentor the best I can , but I still want to play . "
As the turning world melts about us , natural disasters turn up to 11 and an estimated five thousand barrels of crude oil blast into the Gulf of Mexico each day , America ’s cry for electric cars has never been louder .
Electric cars are n’t new .
When the internal combustion engine was in its infancy and , like an infant , was only capable of crapping out , the most reliable horseless carriages were powered by electric motors .
As gas prices fell and the internal combustion engine became more reliable , electric cars were cast aside with the rest of the old - timey garbage — like busted suspenders and empty jars of Dr. McSomebody ’s Mystery Mustache Wax .
Take a look at the graphic below for a full history of the electric car , from the 19th Century EVs you ’ve never heard of , to the future concepts you might be driving next year .
As an overview , the electric car came back in the middle of the 20th century , languishing in the hands of small companies run by patchouli idealists who honestly thought minuscule cars with cripplingly ugly body lines were the wave of the future .
And the crickets chirped for many years .
At the end of the 20th century , major auto manufacturers gave the electric car a few sideways glances .
Most notably , General Motors gave the electric car a half - serious test run from 1996 to 2002 with the EV1 .
Eight hundred cars were produced and were available through special lease programs in select U.S. cities .
In 2002 , the EV1 program was canceled and all road going EV1s were repossessed and either crushed or disabled .
Around the same time , Toyota ’s Prius began its rise to power and major manufacturers the world over were clamoring to jump on the Hybrid band wagon .
A hybrid Ferrari , really ?
Things are changing on the electric car scene .
Technology is advancing and world governments are taking alternative transportation energy sources seriously .
Ironically enough the best of the fully electric cars today is built by a small company .
The Tesla Roadster has a lot in common with the Lotus Elise and its performance figures , as well as its range , are the best anyone has achieved with a fully electric vehicle thus far .
But we ’ve still got a long way to go , baby .
After five years , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has finally given approval to an eye telescope that treats macular degeneration , the leading cause of blindness in the U.S. The Implantable Miniature Telescope ( IMT ) has been developed by VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies , Inc. as part of Centrasight , a new patient care system which treats end - stage age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
More than 10 million people in the USA alone suffer from macular degeneration , which is the leading cause of blindness in people over 55 .
Of those people , 1.7 million suffer from advanced AMD , for which there has been little or no medical answers up till now .
AMD is a disorder of the central retina or macula , the part of the eye that enables the clearest and most distinct vision , fundamental to abilities such as recognizing faces .
For many , central vision becomes blurred or completely dark , which impedes all daily activities .
The visual impairment suffered in end - stage AMD , in which both eyes are in the advanced phase of the disorder , often leads to loss of independence and patient isolation .
The telescopic implant is designed to improve visual acuity by reducing the impact of the blind spot .
The IMT , a device smaller than a pea , is surgically implanted into one cornea and acts to expand an incoming image onto the peripheral parts of the retina that are undamaged .
Central vision is improved in one eye , while the other continues to receive information on peripheral vision for mobility and orientation .
The clinical trials were conducted at 28 leading ophthalmic centers and showed that patients achieved clinically meaningful gains in visual acuity and quality of life with the telescope implant .
In fact , more than two - thirds of those treated reported notable improvement in vision .
The commercial version of the IMT is called Centrasight and is in development by VisionCare Opthalmic Technologies , Inc .
It is n't a complete fix , however .
The patient will need months of rehabilitation and occupational therapy to learn how to use the donut - shaped image the telescope provides .
Some patients may not adapt well to the new vision , or might find rehabilitation too stressful .
Additionally , some may suffer side - effects or damage to the cornea by the IMT .
That said , the IMT is available in the USA now and can be implanted during a short thirty - five minute out - patient procedure through Centrasight .
Patients should be greater than or equal to 75 years of age , with stable severe - to - profound vision impairment constituting statutory ( legal ) blindness .
VisionCare will conduct a post - approval study to monitor patient outcomes under commercial conditions .
A second smaller study will follow clinical trial patients for an additional two years .
“ This is truly a breakthrough technology for AMD patients as their treatment options have been limited until now , ” said Kathryn A. Colby , an ophthalmic surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School .
“ The clinical results from the pivotal FDA trial have proven we can place this tiny telescope prosthesis inside the eye to help patients see better and , for some , even to levels at which they can recognize people and facial expressions that they could not before . ”
Results from the two U.S. clinical trials have been published in peer - reviewed scientific journals including Ophthalmology , American Journal of Ophthalmology , and Archives of Ophthalmology .

The Detroit Red Wings have taken care of their ( third ) biggest off - season priority , as Todd Bertuzzi has agreed to a two - year extension .
" It ’s just a really good fit for me , " the forward said .
" My kids were so pumped when they found out we ’re going back for two more years — now my son gets to stay in his hockey program , and they get to go back to the same schools . "
The biggest issue for Bertuzzi was money and consistency .
He wanted a two - year deal after jumping around the league the past few seasons , but also did n’t want to take much less than what he made last season in Detroit .
It appears he got both .
" Playing with guys like Pavel Datsyuk and ( Henrik Zetterberg ) was great , but so was just being able to fit into the system , " Bertuzzi said .
" It ’s just a great group of guys to be around . "
Bertuzzi scored 18 goals and 44 points last season , playing all 82 regular season games and all 12 playoff games .
The deal is for a little more money than I anticipated , but it really does show that the Wings badly wanted him back .
There were n’t many better options on the free agent market for the price they got Bertuzzi .
Detroit will now have $ 54 million committed to 18 players for next season , about $ 4 - 5 under the expected cap .
An American soldier stationed in Germany threatened his neighbors with an ax over the constant noise from their World Cup vuvuzelas , police confirmed Friday .
Bild newspaper said the 45 - year - old became abusive and shouted that he wanted to kill someone , before returning to his home in the town of Weiden , Bavaria .
The incident occurred during Thursday 's match between The Netherlands and Cameroon .
The man , who was thought to have been drinking , was taken into custody by German police who then handed him over to U.S. military police .
In a separate incident , a police officer in Dinslaken , North Rhine - Westphalia was severely beaten by a drunken German soccer fan armed with one of the South African horns .
News website thelocal .de described how the 20 - year - old man " pounded the officer 's head with a vuvuzela " after the national team 's victory over Ghana on Wednesday night .
The officer was rendered incapable for duty by " severe injuries " to his head .

Big donors fund state parties at record levels MORE ( R - Texas ) and other GOP leaders are coming under pressure from the Republican grass roots to make Arizona ’s immigration law a national campaign issue .
GOP and conservative activists see the lawsuit the administration is considering against Arizona ’s tough new law as a tool to spike turnout by Republicans and independents at the polls .

A Rasmussen poll released Friday found that 56 percent of U.S. voters would oppose a suit against Arizona ’s law , which empowers law enforcement to check the identification of suspected illegal immigrants during routine policing activities .
“ If we ’re talking about gaining the Senate or the House , I think the Obama administration lawsuit will pour lighter fluid on the issue and it will burn Democratic candidates , ” said Jason Rose , a Republican political consultant based in Arizona .
Republicans also believe the lawsuit , which a White House official on Monday said remained under consideration , could be used as a wedge issue between the president and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidMeeting Trump Supreme Court pick a bridge too far for some Democrats GOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' MORE ( D - Nev. ) .
Arizona ’s tough new law is popular across the country and in Nevada ; a Mason - Dixon poll from earlier this month showed 57 percent of Silver State residents would support a similar measure .

Still , the issue of immigration is a difficult one for Cornyn , the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) .
He represents a state with a large and growing Hispanic population , and has treated the subject carefully .
He also represents a party that saw its share of the Hispanic vote tumble in the 2008 presidential race .
Republicans believe any lawsuit against Arizona ’s law would be designed by the White House to rally Hispanic voters to its party .
Cornyn has acknowledged the Arizona law is a delicate subject for him .
“ It ’s easy for the Democrats to demagogue and try to use this as a wedge issue , ” he told The New York Times in April .
“ It ’s a very sensitive subject .
A third of my constituents in Texas are Hispanic . ”
Bay Buchanan , a conservative activist who served as senior adviser to former Rep. Tom Tancredo’s ( R - Colo . ) presidential campaign , said GOP leaders are afraid of immigration as a political issue .
“ The corporations are not in support of this , ” said Buchanan , who added that GOP leaders “ are very nervous about being painted as racist or anti-Hispanic . ”
She said Senate candidates such as Angle and Kentucky Republican Rand Paul Randal ( Rand ) Howard PaulRon Paul hospitalized in Texas The Hill 's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump previews SCOTUS nominee as ' totally brilliant ' Rand Paul says he can't judge ' guilt or innocence ' in Breonna Taylor case MORE , by contrast , have been “ excellent ” on the issue .
A GOP political consultant who is advising several Senate candidates said the Arizona law could be a big issue in Nevada and Arkansas , which have seen an influx of immigrant labor .
But the consultant , who has urged clients to take a strong stance on immigration , does not expect Cornyn to make the Arizona law a national issue to batter Democrats , for fear of offending Hispanic constituents at home .
“ Sen . Cornyn is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
He ’s being very good about balancing it , but at some point he ’ll be called to task and asked , ‘ Where are you ? ’ ” said the consultant , who requested anonymity because Cornyn could influence the hiring decisions of potential clients .
Texas Republicans have battled this month over immigration while crafting the 2010 party platform .
The party has debated some tough positions , such as limiting citizenship by birth to babies who have at least one parent with U.S. citizenship .
Some Republicans in Texas , however , worry this could alienate the fastest - growing ethnic bloc of the electorate .
Brian Walsh , a spokesman for the NRSC , downplayed the role of immigration this fall .
He said the economy will dominate the midterm elections .
“ Ultimately , this election will come down broadly to a referendum on the Democrats ’ record in Washington and their failure to create jobs and move the economy forward , ” Walsh said .
Cornyn ’s position on immigration and the Arizona law wo n’t necessarily hamstring the NRSC from pushing it as a major campaign issue .

Some GOP strategists believe Cornyn should use Obama ’s lawsuit against the Arizona law as a weapon , just as Schumer used the Wall Street bailout against Republicans .
Politicizing immigration could also anger big - business allies Republican leaders are counting on to fund issue advertising in the fall .
But some Republicans argue their leaders should pay more attention to voters angry over illegal immigration .
“ The first thing Republicans ought to do is tell their buddies in the Chamber of Commerce that they ’re dead wrong , ” said Rep. Brian Bilbray ( R - Calif . ) , chairman of the House Immigration Reform Caucus , which supports cracking down on illegal immigration .
“ The GOP is not going to continue to pander to big businesses that have exploited cheap labor ; it ’s not sustainable . ”

Last Autumn I volunteered to review Windows 7 .
But in the following weeks , I found Linux to be preferable in many ways .
This is pretty significant progress , and outside the ' community ' has gone largely unnoticed , too - I have n't seen all that many Ubuntu stories in the Wall Street Journal .
But what comes next is going to be pretty challenging for everyone involved – and that 's what I 'll look at here .
But first a bit of history , starting with a confession .
About ten years ago at around the peak of the dot.com bubble , I looked at the rate of progress that Linux had made , which was phenomenal , and decided that it was only a matter of time before every PC ran Linux .
Now stop laughing there at the back , because it did n't seem quite so bonkers at the time .
If Linux was everywhere , I figured , and it soon would be , then systems vendors would need to compete by adding value higher up the stack .
Apple already appeared to have made this calculation ; Steve Jobs had interviewed Linus Torvalds a couple of years earlier , and why would he do that if he did n't want to swap out BSD for Linux , with its army of device driver authors ?
At the time , too , Microsoft appeared to be embroiled in a fatal antitrust lawsuit , and one of the most likely remedies floating around was to hand control of Windows development to a consortium of vendors .
That would surely seal its fate , because committees of vendors never do anything worthwhile , and would eventually lose interest .
( In the end , this was touted as a remedy early in 2002 , but nobody was interested in maintaining the hairball , quite wisely ) .
I 'd spent a very happy year with BeOS as my primary OS , as it seemed to fulfil my primary requirement – that a computer is just a piece of crap that gets between you and what you want to do .
For most people it 's music ( making or finding or playing ) , photos ( viewing and printing ) and reading the papers , the papers now coming in an amazing global variety of sources .
If I noticed the computer getting between me and the task in hand , it was an annoyance .
An OS had to be a very discreet tool indeed .
BeOS .
( Actually , it 's open source clone Haiku )
With its insane emphasis on performance , and all the UI you would ever need ( ie minimal ) , BeOS had been a super choice .
The only two things BeOS did n't do was view PowerPoint presentations from PR people and text retrieval .
But that was a problem for PR people , who got a polite message requesting a PDF version .
And as for find - by - content , I figured I would sit tight – something like Magellan or dtSearch would come along . [ # ]
But BeOS appeared to have succumbed to the Linux juggernaut , reckoning there was no future in operating systems .
No matter , everywhere you looked , somebody was doing something to fix Linux 's flaws .
A real - time , SMP Linux would surely be good enough for BeOS fans .
If the quality of the installation had gone from Yggdrasil peek and poke , to Caldera 's slick graphical screens in a couple of years – well , would n't all the confusion over competing Desktops be sorted out ?
At the same time I had a vague sense of unease , that something was n't quite right with this picture .
In a recent interview with Deborah Solomon in the NYT , rapper Eminem states his support for gay marriage :
NYT : You ’ve been accused of writing gay - bashing lyrics in the past .
Would you like to see gay marriage approved in Michigan , where you live ?
EMINEM : I think if two people love each other , then what the hell ?
I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable , if they want .
NYT : Is this the new , 37 - year - old tolerant you ?
EMINEM : It ’s the new tolerant me !

Veracity :
The next step in DVCS
One week from today , at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention , SourceGear will be making a big announcement .
Today I 'm giving you an early preview .
We 've been building something new . :-)
It 's called Veracity .
It 's a Distributed Version Control System ( DVCS ) , somewhat like Mercurial or Git .
It has some cool new capabilities no other DVCS has .
It will be open source , released one week from today under the Apache License , Version 2.0 .
This project has been consuming the bulk of my time , and I am glad to finally be able to write and speak about it .
I 'll have a lot to say going forward , but for today I just want to answer some questions we anticipate folks will be asking .
Why build yet another DVCS ?
At OSCON next week we will be referring to Veracity as " the next step in DVCS " .
This description may sound a bit audacious , but it describes exactly what we have built Veracity to be .
Git , Mercurial and Bazaar are all great , but we do n't think they are the last word .
This model of distributed development is the future of our industry .
Things are just getting started .
We 're building Veracity to push forward .
So let me try to explain how our vision is different from what is available from the popular DVCS tools today .
Please understand that my intent here is not to criticize existing tools or start a war with their fans ( especially because Veracity needs to simmer a bit longer before it 's ready ) .
I simply know that the easiest way to explain something new is to compare it to something well - known .
Decentralized Database
Veracity goes beyond versioning of directories and files to provide management of records and fields , with full support for pushing , pulling and merging database changesets , just like source tree changesets .
Veracity 's decentralized , template - driven database is used for all kinds of administrative data , including user accounts , tags , commit messages , and history .
This database is also the platform on which we are building features like work item tracking .
User accounts
Existing DVCS tools have no real concept of user accounts .
Enterprise customers need robust administration features like auditing and permissions .
Veracity supports these features with a user system built on its decentralized database engine .
Pluggable storage layers
Veracity wraps all the actual storage of a repository in an API .
This allows different implementations to offer different tradeoffs .
For example , an organization may want to use an enterprise SQL database to store repository data on a central server , while developer desktop machines may use a simpler filesystem - oriented storage engine .
You can push and pull changesets across different storage implementations seamlessly .
Hash functions
Just as with Mercurial and Git , Veracity identifies all repository objects using a cryptographic hash of the contents .
Veracity supports SHA1 like current tools , but is ready for the future with full support for SHA2 and Skein , at 256 or even 512 bits .
Veracity 's default hash is SHA1 .
Our dogfooding repo is SHA2/256 .
Robust tracking for rename and directories
Like Bazaar , Veracity assigns every repository object an ID which remains constant when the object is renamed or moved to a different path .
This handles the situation where a developer changes both the contents of a file and its path in the same transaction , and is a critical feature for robust merge operations .
Veracity also tracks directories as first - class repository objects , just like files .
Cross -Platform C
From the beginning , we wanted to make it easy to integrate Veracity into all kinds of other systems on a wide variety of platforms .
So we wrote everything in C , with Windows , Mac OS and Linux all on equal footing .
We love Python too , but C is a lowest common denominator that can be ported or integrated everywhere we need to go .
Apache License Version 2.0
Current DVCS tools do not yet have much penetration with enterprise customers .
This is largely due to lack of features and company infrastructure .
But even if Git or Mercurial were enterprise - ready in every other way , many companies will hesitate because of the GPL .
We chose the Apache License Version 2.0 ( instead of the GPL ) because we wanted there to be no obstacles for Veracity to be adopted in commercial and enterprise scenarios .
Open Source ?
How are you guys gonna make money ?
The core of Veracity will be open source , but we do plan to sell add - on products built on the core .
Does this news mean you are abandoning Vault ?
Heck no .
Vault is like , 100 % of our revenue .
And there are still thousands of teams on SourceSafe that need to be rescued from their plight . :-)
We looked hard at the notion of morphing Vault into a DVCS and decided it just is n't feasible .
If we had forced the square peg into the round hole , the result would either have fallen short of being a true DVCS or it would have been an incredibly painful upgrade for Vault customers .
Vault will continue to be supported and improved for centuries .
Is Veracity ready for people to actually use ?
Not yet .
We are dogfooding Veracity here at SourceGear , but if anybody else tries to use it , they 'll be frustrated .
File formats , command syntax and APIs are all still in flux .
We have a lot of stuff to finish up before we give it a 1.0 version number .
In the meantime , if you need a DVCS that is ready to use now , Mercurial , Git and Bazaar offer you three great choices .
How can I give feedback ?
My blog currently does not have a comments feature , but I would still welcome feedback from anyone who has something to say .
If you want to say something privately , feel free to email me directly ( eric@sourcegear.com ) .
Or you can use Twitter ( eric_sink ) .
We 'll be hosting a project mailing list which will be opened next week when the source is released .
And we 'll have a " modern " website for the Veracity community a bit later .
Coming Soon ...
Remember , this is open source stuff , so it 's not real until the source is actually available .
That 'll happen a week from today with the " official " announcement .
For now , I just wanted to let you know what 's coming .
This comic is either about Patrick Stewart getting knighted , or shoes from the 90’s .
You decide .
When you look at the list of celebrities the Queen of England has chosen to bestow the honour of Knighthood on , you either get the impression that she ’s a “ Gotta Catch ‘ Em All ! ” type collector of geek pop culture figureheads , or she is planning the most amazing party of all time .
Of the few I mention in panel two ( above ) you actually get more than twice the Knightly value for your Queenly dollar ( or pound ) .
You pay for Bond , Gandalf , Saruman , Alfred and the good Captain of the Enterprise D/E , and you get Henry Jones Sr. , Magneto the master of magnetism , a Sith Lord , Austin Powers ’ dad and Professor X for free !

There is also a PRINT of this design too ! ]
As far as party entertainment goes you ’ve got your all star band featuring a be -Donald - Duck - suited Elton John , Paul “ The Walrus ” “ The Paulrus ” McCartney , Brian May the noted astrophysicist who also happens to be the guitar god from Queen , some guy named Boner… Bonner … Bono ( whatever , I ’ve never heard of him ) and at least a couple of guys from either The Who or Pink Floyd or BOTH who probably are n’t dead yet .
She might not be planning a party .
She might be planning the end of the world .
I also find it highly suspect that she picks her knew Knights on her birthday .
It reminds me of Francis from PeeWee ’s Big Adventure .
Like she walks up to a noted entertainer ’s manager and says “ I will have this one for my collection .
Wrap him up and deliver him to the palace with bow on his head and a dusting a baby powder on his nethers . ”
Hell , even Steven Spielberg ‘s an honorary Knight ( you ca n’t go full armor and chain - male if you were n’t born in Britain ) .
Maybe she wants him to document “ The Final Party ” for … well , I guess no one would be left .
Maybe for whoever cleans up the mess .
Let ’s say the French .
Considering the general level of geekery at The Round Table , it gets even weirder when you look at the lower honours like Commander and Officer .
She ’s got Serenity ‘s Operative Chiwetel Ejiofor , Liam “ I play a Jedi or a bad ass in every movie ” Neeson , Michael Palin and J.R.R.
Tolkien .
Is the Queen a closet nerd ?
Is she wearing out VHS tapes of old Python sketches , and reading “ The Return Of The King ” while listening to “ Bicycle Race ” on 45 ?
Whatever her grand scheme is I think she is overlooking two valuable additions to her roster of Britain ’s finest .
Christian Bale and Daniel Day - Lewis .
I do n’t think I owe an explanation for either of those other than to mask my geek boner with a text book or a jacket .
My man -crushes on these man-men are the man-crushes of humanity .
Perhaps she is saving them for her final two Knight … holes … slots ?
Her final Knight slots .
Once all holes … slots are filled , the moon will crack to reveal its hollow core which contains an orbital disco ball only slight smaller than the moon itself .
The sun ’s rays will hit its hundreds of thousands of tiny mirrors and the people of earth will dance as the super intense reflected light rays render our gyrating booties to naught but smoldering ash .
I hope she serves scones .
U.S. House Democrats criticized airlines Wednesday for increasingly charging for checked baggage , seat selection and other services , and indicated they are considering legislation to tax the revenue collected from the fees .
Airlines are increasingly relying on ticket surcharges to offset spikes in fuel prices and overcome weak demand .
Airlines collected $ 1.3 billion from fees for checked baggage and reservation changes in the first three months of this year , a 13 % increase over the same period in 2009 , government data show .

While the California teachers ' unions are effectively destroying one school system after another , an alert commenter pointed me to some even more shocking news from Illinois .
Their pension system for educators is -- if you can believe it -- even farther off the reservation .

The Devils continued to make roster moves today , placing veteran winger Jay Pandolfo and enforcer Andrew Peters on waivers .
If both clear waivers , the Devils can buy the players out .
Pandolfo ’s deal is worth $ 2.5 million , while Peters ’ is only $ 500,000 .
The league ’s CBA determined that teams who buy out players spread their cap hit over two years .
With buyout of both players likely , the Devils will be paying two thirds of Pandolfo and Peters remaining salary this season and next season .
Pandolfo will cost the team $ 833,333 , while Peters will only be $ 166 , 667 .
Peters never seemed to fit into ex-coach Jacques Lemaire ’s system .
Peters made the team out of camp after being invited as a tryout , but never seemed to stick full - time .
This past season , Peters only played in 29 games , recording no goals and no assists , finishing with a plus / minus of - 5 .
His limited ability as nothing more than an enforcer really never fit in , and there ’s no love lost here for this move .
Lamoriello explained that , with the play of Pierre - Luc Letourneau - Leblond and the addition of Jason Arnott , their was n’t enough room on the roster for Peters .
“ With Jason Arnott coming our size and strength is there and also ( Pierre - Luc Letourneau ) Leblond has improved so much and we do n’t want to take a spot on the roster away from a young player , ” Lamoriello said to Tom Gulitti in explaining the decison to waive / buy out Peters .
Pandolfo , however , deserves the upmost respect from Devils fans .
Pando , as he was known by teammates , was drafted by the Devils in the second round ( 32nd overall ) in 1993 .
Pandolfo was a member of the 2000 and 2003 Stanley Cup championship teams , pairing with John Madden to form two - thirds of a great checking line .
Pandolfo ’s defensive game earned him the spot as a finalist for the Selke trophy in 2007 .
Never an offensive force , Pandolfo will finish his Devils career with 99 goals and 124 assists in 819 career games .
He tallied 11 goals and 22 assists in 131 playoff games .
Pandolfo , when healthy , rarely ever missed a game .
The left - winger holds the fifth - longest consecutive games streak for the Devils , playing in 307 consecutive games .
That streak came to an end November 28 , 2007 , when he sustained pubic bone ligament damage after being hit into the boards in a game against Dallas .
He missed 28 games with the injury , and never seemed the same since .
Since Pandolfo is injured , he needed to request to be put on waivers .
After speaking with Lamoriello , Pandolfo asked to be placed on waivers .
The left - winger told Gulitti he wanted an opportunity somewhere else .
“ I asked him if he would do it for me , ” Pandolfo said .
“ Obviously , the last two years have been a difficult two years and I do n’t want to go through the same exact thing next year .
I still want to play and this gives me an opportunity to try to sign with another team . ”
Last season , it seemed like Pandolfo found a way into Lemaire ’s doghouse .
The left - winger never got into a groove , only playing 52 games .
He also sustained a rotator - cuff injury after a hit from ex-Devil Mike Rupp while playing the Pittsburgh Penguins October 24 .
The winger was n’t happy with the way last season ended , when he was a healthy scratch for all five games of the playoffs .
According to reports , he was notified by the coaching staff through text message .
“ I ’m just bitter about what happened at the end of the year , ” he said .
“ That ’s not worth even going into . ”
Continue reading for more of my take on Pandolfo ’s time as a Devil .
Even with the way the season ended , Pandolfo still enjoyed his experience with the Devils .
He admitted it would “ be sad ” to leave the Devils after 13 years with the team .
Pandolfo was one of the better defensive forwards to ever wear a Devils sweater .
I remember idolizing him because of his strong defensive play , and there was always a calming feeling when Pandolfo came out on the penalty kill .
He scored some big goals , including three game winners this season .
He always rose to the occasion , shutting down the other team ’s top line time in and time out .
While his defensive presence will be missed , the sad fact is that Pandolfo was n’t the same player the past few years .
He constantly battled injuries , and he never seemed to look completely healthy on the ice .
While it ’s a tough decision , it ’s also a business decision .
While Pandolfo never got the recognition Scott Stevens or Ken Daneyko did , I believe his role as a defensive forward was integral in winning both the 2000 and 2003 Stanley Cup championships .
The Devils will lose a class act and a great team player , but it ’s a smart business decision .
With no need for introduction , here 's Gluskin - Sheff 's David Rosenberg on why the jobs report was even worse than the headlines suggest :
This is probably the first time on record when a 431,000 surge in U.S. nonfarm
payrolls was viewed as a terrible employment report .
Perhaps this is because
411,000 of those jobs , or 95 % of the tally , were in Census hirings , which
everyone knows are temporary .
Private payrolls were the real key for the market and the consensus was completely giddy believing that we were going to see a + 180,000 print today .
Instead , we got a putrid 41,000 increase , which is hardly significant in any statistical sense — for once , the ADP survey looked optimistic .
And of course , state and local governments are moving aggressively to get their fiscal position back into black ink and that means massive cost cutting .
In May , this belt - tightening translated into a 22,000 retrenchment in employment in this part of the economy , which is 50 % larger than the federal government .
Not only that , but a big red flag was clearly waved by the Household Survey ,
where total employment actually fell 35,000 — the first decline of the year and a
splash of cold water on the widespread view that this recovery was gaining
steam .
Note too that the 41,000 increase in private payrolls marked a huge
slowing from +218,000 in April and +158,000 in March , and the diffusion index
sank like a stone , to 54.1 % last month from 66.7 % , so we have a situation
where nearly half of the universe of employers were either cutting their payrolls
or leaving them stagnant last month .
This is not the hallmark of a robust V -
shaped expansion deserving of an 80 % rally off the lows , which is what we had
on our hands little more than a month ago .
Look for consensus GDP growth and
earnings revisions to start heading down in coming weeks .
The unemployment rate did manage to come down to 9.7 % from 9.9 % but this
was a pure statistical anomaly owing to the 322,000 plunge in the labour force .
Absent that decline , the headline jobless rate would have actually climbed back
to 10 % .
The broad U - 6 unemployment rate also managed to drop , to 16.6 %
from 17.1 % , again owing to a sharp decline in the total pool of available labour
last month .
( We have no idea where these 504,000 souls wandered off to —
maybe all the students went to camp instead of looking for a job at the gas
station ) .
We also had some new record highs being set :
i) The average duration of unemployment ( 34.4 weeks from 33.0 weeks in April ) ;
and ,
ii )
The share of the unemployed ranks who have been out of work now for at
least a half - year ( 46.0 % from 45.9 % ) .
Anytime we have both the employment rate ( 58.7 % from 58.8 % ) and the
participation rate ( 65.0 % from 65.2 % ) declining the same month , you know you
have a very soft labour market on your hands .
SPRINGFIELD – Police charged a one - armed man with unarmed robbery early Wednesday afternoon following an incident that occurred about noon on Wednesday a block away from the police station .
The suspect , Manuel Hernandez , 28 , of 52 Avon Place , goes by the street name of Lefty , Sgt. John M. Delaney said .
Hernandez robbed a 58 - year - old man of his wallet at the corner of Chestnut and Mattoon streets about noon , Delaney , aide to Police Commissioner William J. Fitchet said .
The wallet contained $ 354 in cash , he said .
The victim reported the robbery at police headquarters , 130 Pearl Street , and provided a description of the suspect .
Sgt. Mark Rolland spotted Hernandez a short time later on Worthington Street and arrested him , Delaney said .
The victim identified Hernandez as the man who robbed him .
Police recovered the victim's wallet -- including the $ 354 in cash -- from Hernandez 's pocket .
Hernandez entered an innocent plea at his arraignment Thursday in Springfield District Court .
He was ordered held on $ 10,000 bail and is due to appear in court again on Aug. 12 for a bind - over hearing to determine if his trial will take place in district or superior court .
These days in Seoul we ’re studying No River to Cross , by Seon Master Daehaeng .
It ’s a wonderful text with such hidden depths , that , from time to time , I thought it would be nice to recap a few of the key points here .
Chapter 2 is one of the harder chapters because it deals with the fundamental reality of the world around us .
Everything in all universes is directly connected to the fundamental mind of humans and all life .
Everything that functions and moves in the world is already directly connected to our foundation .
Everything in the whole universe , including both visible and invisible realms , is connected and communicates as one .
Nothing exists apart from anything else ; the mind of all Buddhas is your inherent mind , and the Dharma of all Buddhas is the Dharma of your inherent mind and your daily life .
( No River to Cross , p. 9 - 10 )
In Korean Buddhism , it ’s sometimes said that we are the combination of our body , our present consciousness , and our Buddha - nature or true self .
Body and perceptions
What we usually think of as “ me , ” are the perceptions and interpretations that arise from our body making contact with the material world .
If I encounter something , a feeling arises , it ’s interpreted , and I react to that judgement .
If it ’s fun , I ’ll start wanting more , and if it ’s painful , I ’ll try to avoid it .
In this way , the fears , desires , and judgements that occupy so much of my time , are only the automatic results of my body ’s interaction with the environment .
An extreme example of this is sexual orientation :
If I ’m born as a man , the make - up of my body will naturally turn my thoughts towards women , and yet if I were born as a woman , the elements of my body would turn my thoughts towards men .
( There are exceptions , obviously , but you get the point ! )
These thoughts and feelings not fundamental to my essence , but rather a temporary result of this body meeting the environment .
If you ’ve stuck with me up to here , then you ’ve probably already felt the sense of lack and incompleteness that comes from making these feelings the focus of our life .
That ’s because these conditioned feelings and concerns are n’t the whole picture : there is true self , also called fundamental mind , luminous mind , and God-nature .
Daehaeng Kun Sunim says about this aspect :
… true self has always been with us .
However , we wo n’t know this unless we try to find it .
Realize that everything comes from true self .
The physical body is like the leaves and branches that come from the root , the true self .
How could you forget about the root … .
Know the root ! ( p. 14 )
Because this root is where even this feelings and thoughts ultimately arise from , this is where we need to entrust them .
However , hearing this , people often begin to think that the body and the feelings and thoughts it gives rise to are something to be despised .
Daehaeng Kun Sunim cautions people about this view , saying :
There has to be a physical body in order to know the Buddha - dharma .
You need to be aware that throwing away your body is not the way to know the Buddha - dharma .
To think that the flesh is worthless and must be thrown away because it ’s only a temporary combination is an extremely misguided idea .
Without the body , you cannot develop , cannot broaden your wisdom , and cannot become a Buddha .
Because the son exists , you can know the father ; through the existence of the servant , you can come to know the master .
By understanding visible phenomena , you can understand the invisible essence , the non-material foundation that gives rise to and animates all visible phenomena , and which always works together as one with all things . ( p. 14 )
So our body is certainly something to value and take care of , yet while doing this , we have to be careful not to mistake it for our totality .
Ultimately everything has to be entrusted , everything has to be combined as one .
When this body , its perceptions and consciousness , and our inherent Buddha - nature all function together as one , then I think we ’ll discover what living as a human being truly means .

5 Huge Game Conversions You Must Download Right Now November 22nd , 2010
By root Trying to track down a list of “ five game mods you must download right now ” is a lot like trying to choose your five top games of all time .
Sure , your list might be impressive — maybe even awesome — but you ’re still going to get a heap of contenders sobbing in the corner at your refusal to acknowledge their almost - noteworthy existences .
And nobody likes bawling boxed titles .
So let that be a warning to you , fun -loving gamer who continues to read this article .
I ’m covering freeware game modifications this time around — freeware , obviously , because I doubt your average enthusiast is going to risk the wrath of a developer ’s fury because he or she is selling blood , sweat , and tears in the form of a $ 5 game add - on .
As well , I ’m not just looking at maps , or other whip - dip little tweaks .
I ’m talking about huge transformations that range from , “ making this game playable in the modern era ” to “ wow , I want to go back and revisit this title because it is now sweet . ”
I ’m paraphrasing , of course .
But you get the idea .
But as I mentioned , narrowing down to a list of five is near - impossible .
So if you do n’t have an affinity for the Infinity Engine ( including Baldur ’s Gate and Planescape : Torment ) , Sins of a Solar Empire , Fallout 3 , TIE Fighter / X- Wing Alliance , or Half - Life 2 … you might want to sit this one out .
Otherwise , let ’s get real .
Planescape : Torment ( et al. )
I ’m just going to focus on my all - time favorite game , Planescape : Torment , but know that other such tweaks ( in the same spirit of those I ’m about to mention ) exist for other games based on Bioware ’s Infinity Engine .
So , where were we ?
Yes .
Planescape : Torment , one of the greatest video games of all time , is practically unplayable on modern gaming systems .
If you have the old , disc - based version of the title , you ’re pretty much out of luck .
And even if you ’ve grabbed the latest GoG - based version of the game / installer , you ’ll be able to play Planescape … but you ’ll hate the low - resolution experience you ’ll be forced to endure on your souped - up gaming PC .
So , to fix that , a group of modders have released various tweaks that — for starters — build support for any and all monitor resolutions right into the title .
Throw in a litany of tweaks , hacks , and unlocks for buried content within the game ’s data files , and you have the makings of a perfect community drive to keep One Of The Greatest Games Ever Produced ( capitalization intentional ) alive in our hearts , minds , and astral dimensions .
TIE Fighter / X - Wing Alliance
No , I ’m not covering two games at once — even though they ’re technically the same games or , at least , the same spirit of games .
It ’s widely understood that Lucasarts ’
TIE Fighter is one of the greatest games , if not the greatest game , ever created .
It ’s an excellent space combat title that puts you in the role of a lowly pilot for the Empire , working your way up through the ranks to harder and crazier missions including , yes , flying alongside Darth Vader himself .
Cool , eh ?
Unfortunately , this title is old enough to make it damned near impossible to play on a modern system without some wacky kind of virtualization setup in place .
And even then , you ’re not really getting the best - in - class experience :
Your default resolution will look downright ugly on your snazzy big monitor and the game ’s graphics … well .
They ’re a bit dated .
So what do you do ?
Instead , use your TIE Fighter disc alongside your X - Wing Alliance disc ( you did buy both , right ? ) to essentially perform a total conversation of X - Wing Alliance with TIE Fighter material .
Using the newer game ’s better engine , you ’ll be able to play all your favorite old flights in updated , pretty - looking glory .
Download the various files and packs here !
Sins of a Solar Empire
If flying around in space is n’t your thing , how about sending other ships around in space and letting your digital pilots sop up the mess that your larger orders create ?
That ’s right .
Sins of a Solar Empire is a real - time strategy title that ’s a whole heap of fun to play .
However , it ’s even more fun if you take the requisite steps to geek out your game to maximum levels .
If you ’re a Star Wars fan ( who is n’t ? ) , be sure to check out the total modification “ Star Wars – Requium , ” which adds the Alliance and the Empire as playable races within your game .
That includes a whole arsenal of new ships ( no Death Star , sadly ) , new elements within the game ’s research tree and , yes , even customized music .
But if you ’re not a Star Wars fan , that ’s ok too .
You might want to then check out the conversion package called “ Star Trek : Sacrifice of Angels 2 . ”
It goes without saying what kinds of ships , races , and technologies you might experience in this one .
Do n’t forget about the Borg !
Download the Star Wars mod here !
Download the Star Trek mod here !
Fallout 3
I confess , I never quite got into Fallout 3 myself — my counterpart , Nathan Edwards , thinks that makes me the worst gamer of all time .
But if you ’re like me , perhaps the total conversion “ Cube Experimental ” might give you a reason to click that install button one more time .
And if you ’re a super - fan of the game , well , you ’ve already clicked on the “ download ” button for this extensive mod by now .
So what is Cube Experimental ?
In short , one of the most talked - about mods for Fallout 3 .
The general theme of the mod is that you ’re stuck in the center of a giant puzzle — a cube , obviously .
The goal ?
Find your way out .
And then the real fun starts !
With more than 500 different scripts , brand - new voice acting , and brand - new music , this is n’t just a little series of tweaks and hacks overtop a new map .
Cube Experimental is a brand - new experience in itself , and it ’s worth your while to check out .
I would definitely say that this mod rivals the quality of a typical DLC pack .
Download it here !
Half - Life 2
Fresh on the heels of my “ what the heck is this ” recommendation of Cube Experimental for Fallout 3 , I bring you Half - Life 2 fans a taste of lunacy all your own .
In this case , the total conversion is called , “ Dear Esther , ” and it ’s a complete mind - trip for those used to playing the game all normal , pew - pew - the - bad - guys style .
It ’s difficult to really summarize this modification in words — you ’ll understand once you install it for yourself .
Dear Esther is more of an interactive narrative than anything else , and this modification ’s excellent combination of voiceover storytelling and ingenious level design does much to weave a player through your character ’s tragic tale .

Duke Nukem : The Once & Future King ?
November 22nd , 2010
By root
The inside story on PC gamings greatest comeback — and a look at the game itself Thrills , drama , a long grind , and a twist ending — these are the sorts of things you normally expect from a videogame .
They are not what you expect from the story behind a game .
But then , Duke Nukem is n’t any ordinary game , and the saga of its development has been anything but normal .
For more than 13 years , the gaming world ’s been waiting for Duke , and now the end is in sight .
But first , lets review whats happened until now .
It all started back in 1996 , with Duke Nukem riding high .
The game for which he was known , Duke Nukem 3D , was a megaton hit , and gamers clung to the cocksure hero ’s every machismo - laden word .
He was , quite literally , the king .
He was on top of the world .
Then in 1997 , the follow - up , Duke Nukem Forever , was announced and , shockingly enough , it was all downhill from there .
Duke disappeared .
Year after year passed , and short of a few quick glimpses of the game , Duke was a disappointing no - show .
His once - loyal fan base declared him dead .
Anticipation rotted and festered , boiling over into angry cynicism .
The nail in Duke ’s supposed coffin , however , came in the form of developer 3D Realms closing up shop in 2009 and a subsequent lawsuit from publisher Take - Two Interactive .
And then everything went silent .
Game Over. Continue ? 5 4 … 3 … 2 … 1 … But wait !
At the last second , Borderlands developer Gearbox Software stepped in and saved the day .
Now , Duke Nukem
Forever ’s back on track and — get this — it ’s actually going to come out this time .
So , how ’s the game ?
Who ’s in charge now ?
After more than a decade of waiting , will it all be worth it ?
We traveled deep into the heart of Texas — to Gearbox ’s only - slightly evil lair — for three interviews with the men responsible for the past , present , and future of Duke Nukem .
We ’ll tell you what they have to say about the legendary franchise and we ’ll share the details of our hands - on experience with the upcoming game .
Yes , Duke fans , it ’s safe to dream again .
Duke Nukem
Then
Original Duke Nukem designer George Broussard explains the series turbulent development history
Maximum PC : Dukes come a long , long , long way .
So were just gonna ask : what took so long ?
What made you shy away from releasing DNF for all these years ?
George Broussard : I wish there was an easy or dramatic answer for what took so long but there just isnt .
It was just never ready .
We had lots of development issues along the way .
It wasnt a quest for perfection as some silly article in Wired implied last year .
I think what hurt us the most was licensing engines and trying to change them too much .
Shit happens and after delays the options are to continue or kill the game .
I never wanted to kill the game .
We got things turned around dramatically in 2007 - 2009 , with a lot of new hires , and most of the game as it exists today was created in that timeframe .
Do you worry that , in your pursuit of technological superiority , you allowed Duke Nukem to become a relic himself ?
Do you think Duke , with his crass and juvenile ways , can still be relevant in todays super - serious shooter world ?
Duke offers contrast and something very unique and different from the cookie cutter , cardboard , generic game heroes that dont have an ounce of personality .
Its ok to not like Duke or think him juvenile , but at least hes not boring and vanilla .
Most people play games to escape and enjoy a fantasy for a while .
What do you think makes
Duke so endearing as a character ?
Why have people continued to care so much for so long ?
I think like Darth Vader is an ultimate archtype of a villain , Duke follows the archtype for the alpha male action hero .
When we created Dukes character outline we wanted him to be a combination of Arnold Schwarzennegger , Clint Eastwood and John Wayne .
Combine those characters with a distinct look , attitude and one - liners and the result is that Duke is just an iconic character .
Expect to relive this football stadium battle in Duke Nukem Forever .
Howd the Gearbox deal come about ?
First , we had a relationship with Randy and Gearbox .
Randy worked for us in 1996 - 97 and I play poker with Randy and some Gearbox guys every week .
Second , we were in a bitter lawsuit with Take 2 that was going to last for years as they had shown no interest in being reasonable .
Third , behind the scenes , there were 9 or so ex-3DR guys ( Triptych Games ) that were working on DNF in secret , on their own money , out of a house , because they believed in the game .
Summer of 2009 , I played Borderlands at Gearbox , prior to release .
That afternoon , Randy and I talked about the suit and how things were going .
He mentioned that hed love to help or get invovled , and while it wasnt clear what that meant , it was clear he was passionate to somehow get involved with Duke .
A couple weeks later I mention Randys interest in passing to my partner Scott and everyone got to talking .
Around Xmas 2009 a strategy was planned that would leverage Gearboxs positive relationship with Take 2 ( due to Borderlands success ) , settle the suit , and get the game published .
How do you feel about that deal ?
Is it a best - case scenario for DNF ?
How much input do you have on the game now , if any ?
Its the result of several back to back miracles that people will get to see this game .
Imagine flipping a coin 5 times and getting heads each time .
It should be win win for everyone involved .
From what Ive seen the game is still largely what we had in May 2009 , but with a year of work and polish from the guys at Triptych Games .
We provide feedback when asked about all things Duke but its largely out of our hands now so well see what happens .
Is it difficult letting someone else finish up and ultimately take the reins on your creation ?
Do you regret not getting to finish the game yourself ?
Sure , but it is what it is , and at some point you get enough distance and perspective to let things go .
It probably took about a year .
Im just glad we worked it all out .
How did you originally envision Duke Nukem Forever ?
Gearbox ’s goal seems to be a sort of tribute to all that Duke stands for .
Their mantra seems to be “ It ’s the Duke you ’ve always known , but bigger , better , etc . ”
Was that your goal throughout Duke Nukem Forever ’s development process as well ?
Part of why we did this deal is that we knew Randy pretty well and he worked on the add - on for the original game and he loves and gets Duke .
So , its probably in pretty good hands and I think they will treat it as a top series inside Gearbox .
Its hard to continue an ip that someone else created , but by them owning it now , they are incentivised to care about it and not treat it as a middle tier licensed project .
What ’s next for you ?
Do you still want to develop games ?
Or does the future hold something entirely different ?
To be honest I havent thought much about it .
Im just enjoying the time off .
I still play games and love making them .

Windows Phone 7 : Tried and Tested ( 32 comments )
Windows Phone 7 : Tried and Tested
November 11th , 2010
Ultimately , the colorful , striking home screen is the first thing people notice about any Windows Phone 7 smartphone , and that ’s a good thing .
In fact , it is the best possible reaction Microsoft could hope for .
The truth is that , given the large gap between Microsoft and its competition , namely Android and the iPhone , anything less than extraordinary would have doomed Windows Phone 7 from the start .
There ’s a greater truth here however , one that has heretofore gone unspoken .
Since U.S. Robotics ’ debut of the Palm Pilot in 1996 , we ’ve been essentially stuck with the same look and feel for our PDAs and smartphones .
Sure , Android extends the desktop metaphor a little bit , but is n’t it pretty much a Windows / Mac desktop ?
So we ’re happy to see something different .
And we ’re slightly surprised to see such a refined and polished mobile operating system .
It ’s not perfect .
Windows
Phone 7 lacks deep layers of customization , cut / copy / paste functionality , and there ’s a dearth of third - party app support .
But it ’s different in a good way , so much so that critics are having a hard time identifying what it is about this fledgling OS that makes people so happy .
That ’s a good sign for Microsoft and a better sign for all of us .
We ’re going to take a deeper look at the OS and pit in head - to - head battle against Google Android .
Welcome to the smartphone party , Microsoft .
You ’re late , but we ’re glad you ’re here .
The Review
The core of Windows Phone 7 is the home screen and its symmetrical , Mondrian - esque arrangement of large square tiles , each of which provides entry into a basic task such as email , web browsing , games , text messaging , calendars , and more .
Each tile is plainly labeled , and each account is easy to set up .
We appreciate that each of our separate email inboxes was labeled independently — Outlook for our Exchange server , Comcast , Google Mail , Yahoo Mail , etc .
( You can customize these account names . )
Critics and users have bitched about the lack of a unified inbox that lumps all of our emails together .
Our take :
It ’s a nicety , but not a necessity .
These days , most of us use separate inboxes to reflect our various personas — worker bee , family man , pervert — so the separation makes sense .
Each of the tiles on the start screen are “ live ” , meaning that the OS constantly updates them with new alerts in real - time .
Typically , the alerts consist of a number signifying the number of new emails or items to process , but in the case of the calendar , specific meeting details are displayed .
Microsoft ’s decision to use larger tile icons than Android , Blackberry , and iOS is key ; all three competing mobile operating systems notify you of updates on the home screen , but the WP7 design makes it much easier to see these updates at a glance .
One other nice touch is that the lock screen itself notifies you of new email , calendar entries , and text messages .
Neither Apple nor Android does this .
We were pleased to discover that , across the board , this interface consistently removes one to two steps from almost every single smartphone task we perform on a day to day basis .
The only real exception to this is the ability to pick up news , weather , and sports scores via the desktop widgets that Android permits .
As a general rule , the level of customization consistently disappointed us .
You can customize the placement of individual tiles on the Start screen — an extended press on an icon allows you to drag it around the home screen and place it wherever you ’d like .
You can also “ pin ” just about anything — applications , websites , photos , games , people , podcasts , and more — to the home screen in the same manner .
After just under a week of usage , we wanted to adjust the color and / or size of individual tiles .
We wanted to leave a row of tiles blank in order to group our applications .
None of this is possible .
The inability to customize the Windows Phone 7 OS at deeper levels is our most substantial gripe .
In our minds , customization equals optimization and , as a general rule we want to be able to mold our mobile experience at the interface , text , and input levels .
Unrealistically , we expected that because Exchange and Outlook are Microsoft products , Outlook in Windows Phone 7 would function in some kind of special manner .
We were misguided .
Performance around message delivery and syncing is identical .
The interface and color design is vastly superior to Android ’s email client .
It ’s amazing how a shift to black text on a white background — you know , the way we actually read most of the text in our lives — works wonders for legibility .
( Android phones ’ default mode uses white / colored text on a black background . )
SMS Texting in Windows Phone 7 utilizes a threaded approach , with each SMS conversation housed in a separate window .
One aspect of SMS / MMS messaging that we appreciate is that it ’s really easy to attach images to your messages .
Click the attach icon , and you ’re good .
We cheered the presence of Microsoft Office , which allows us to create and edit Word and Excel documents , and edit .
PPT decks from the convenience of our smartphone .
One minor disappointment is that you can only save your documents locally or on a Sharepoint server — we want to be able to save our docs to Microsoft ’s cloud - based Skydrive service .
Given the prevalence of touchscreen smartphones , one of the most important aspects of mobile operating systems is the quality of the virtual keyboard .
We confess to feeling initially disappointed by Windows Phone 7 here .
Compared to the iOS and Android keyboards , it feels too small and the keys are too crowded , particularly in landscape mode .
One of Android ’s great strengths is that you can swap out the default keyboard for a handful of other high - quality opotions .
We expect ( and hope ) that we ’ll soon see a series of third - party replacement keyboards for sale in the Windows Phone marketplace .
We were pleased to discover that the virtual keyboard ’s adaptive traits were top - notch .
It constantly adapted to and corrected the errors caused by our clumsy , meaty thumbs .
Games , Music , People , and More
One other significant change in Windows Phone 7 is the way the OS treats your friends and social networks .
Instead of shunting your social life into a series of applications , , Microsoft has created a dedicated channel — People — that allows you to keep track of all of your real and faux friends ’ posts , status updates , and more .
It functions in a similar manner to Blackberry 6 ’s aggregate social view , but looks prettier .
This aggregated people view also extends to the Photos category of the OS — here you can see all of your friends ’ most recent photo posts .
For existing Zune users ( like us ) , the integrated Zune support is a beautiful thing ; it essentially means that every WinPhone is also a Zune HD .
This means that you can download and stream all of the Zune catalog of music , podcasts , and videos .
The only exception to this rule is that , for some reason you ca n’t stream or download Zune music channels .
The most important thing to know is that the Zune PC software functions as a sync client for WinPhone devices in the same manner that iTunes does for iPhones .
Plugging your device into your PC initiates an automatic two - way sync ( if you prefer ) , although you can also set up your phone to sync with your home PC via the wireless network .
Microsoft created a lot of hype around the built - in integration with Xbox Live , which is simultaneously a category for downloading and playing games as well as a way to keep track of your Xbox Live achievements , score , and more .
One nice touch is that you can download a trial version of every single game in the marketplace .
At launch , there were only 20 + games available for download ; this will have ( hopefully ) increased substantially by the time you read this .
At launch , app support is clearly Windows Phone 7 ’s biggest weakness in comparison to Google and Android .
It will take Microsoft many months to catch up to the massive app libraries available on Android and iPhone and the truth is that , in terms of raw numbers , it will never fully catch up .
At launch , some hyper - basic categories such as instant messaging , Dropbox , and Google Voice were n’t available .
That ’s a big concern because it probably reflects a wait - and - see attitude by third - party app developers .
Still though , it ’s probably just a matter of time before we see thousands of apps across all major categories .
In conclusion
Days after the launch , one of Maximum PC ’s Facebook fans , I Jedi , summed up the key question around Windows Phone 7 : What is Microsoft bringing to the table that will encourage adoption of its platform ?
It ’s a fair question .
Upon launch , it seems that Windows Phone 7 meets at least two key criteria for standing apart from the competition mainly , the user interface design is so strikingly different that everyone wants to touch it .
That ’s a great start .
Beyond this , the fact that 95 % of the world uses some incarnation of Windows presents a massive opportunity for Microsoft to bring more power and more functionality to the table .
We ’re intrigued by Windows Phone 7 for what it does well — interface and interoperability — and for what it can do in the future .
In 12 months time , we envision a mobile OS with built - in remote connectivity to our desktop , our media server , and our home network .
We envision a massive games library , with deep hooks to our Windows and Xbox games .
We see built - in file sharing via SkyDrive .
And yes , we see cut and paste .
The 12 - 18 month smartphone upgrade cycle we all live by means that Microsoft has definitely inserted itself into the smartphone conversation .
We ’ll see what happens next .
Deathmatch : Windows Phone 7 vs. Android
Previously , in Smartphone Deathmatches :
In a surprise upset , Google Android bested both Blackberry and Apple iOS on the merits of its customization , flexibility , and rapidly swelling application support .
This month , we ’re tossing Windows Phone 7 in the cage with the iPhone killer .
Can Microsoft ’s fledgling mobile OS hold its own against a pack of angry Androids ?
It ’s time to find out .
Round 1 : Ease of Use
The Windows Phone home screen is everything we want in a phone ; attractive , dynamic , and functional .
Android ’s home screens are more customizable and we love the ability to place widgets but ultimately , the desktop metaphor feels a little dated .
WinPhone ’s use of categories trumps the all - in - one approach of Android .
Overall , Microsoft has a created a much easier at - a - glance interface .
We considered penalizing Windows Phone 7 for the absence of cut / paste , but then we tried to remember the last time we used it on our phone , and could not .
WINNER : WINDOWS PHONE
Round 2 : Flexibility and Customization
Microsoft has emphasized simplicity in its mobile operating system , and the end result is that , aside from the ability to tweak the colors and position of the tiles on the home page , you ca n’t change very much of the interface at all .
We love Android in this regard , which allows us an abundance of control over our mobile environment .
You can change pretty much every single element of the desktop , applications , and power management settings .
WINNER : ANDROID
Round 3 : Application and Developer Support
Android has over 100,000 apps .
At launch , Windows
Phone only had a few thousand , and was missing some big categories , such as all Google apps ( no surprise there ) , Instant Messenging , and more .
Over time , Microsoft will catch up — and WinPhone ’s use of achievements in games is novel — but right now , this category is a no -brainer .
WINNER : ANDROID
Round 4 : Email and Messaging
Both operating systems ’ email clients are easy to set up and offer built - in support for Exchange , Gmail , Yahoo , and POP .
Microsoft ’s interface and color design is slightly superior to Android , mostly because we can see three lines of text in the default view .
Although Windows Phone ’s threaded SMS text messaging looks and feels better than Android , you can download superior third - party text clients from the Android Marketplace .
This one ’s too close to call , mostly because both email clients are top - notch .
WINNER : DRAW
Round 5 : Media Storage and Playback
Android is fairly open source in the manner it deals with media .
You can sync up music using Windows Media Player , or any other sync client ( except Zune and iTunes ) , and you can drag / drop directly from Windows to your device .
Windows
Phone works extremely well with Zune , which allows you access to a massive music library for $ 15 per month , and also grants you a la carte access to movies and TV shows .
And you can sync your phone wirelessly with your PC .
WINNER : WINDOWS PHONE
Round 6 : Photos and Storage
And the Winner Is …
The fact that Microsoft is in the mobile conversation at all feels like a minor miracle .
When Microsoft announced that it was delaying Windows Phone 7 earlier this year , we thought that was the kiss of death .
Instead , holy cow !
This is a unique , good - looking mobile operating system .
It ’s still a 1.0 version , and does n’t come close to approaching the levels of customization available to Android users .
But between the intuitive use of categories for basic smartphone tasks , Zune integration , and a cleaner look and feel , we have to declare Windows Phone the winner .
One final thought : one of the things we have n’t mentioned in this Deathmatch is battery life .
Ultimately , it would n’t be fair because hardware and battery size / type are a big part of the equation .
However , our tests have made it clear that the Windows Phone OS is far less battery - intensive than Android .
As we see more devices , we ’ll investigate further .
These days , almost all of us are walking around with the equivalent of several rolls of film in our pockets .
The question , as always , is what the hell do we do with all these photos ?
Both Android and Windows
Phone offer easy ways of viewing pictures we ’ve taken .
This said , Windows Phone ’s ability to upload photos automatically to Facebook or SkyDrive , and the ability to view all of our friends ’ photographs as well , is so innovative we wish we ’d thought of it .
WINNER : WINDOWS PHONE

Hypocrisy is nothing new in the world of politics .
Unfortunately for politicians , television and the internet are now there to record and spread their every misstep .
It seems like every day I hop onto various news sites and read about some self - styled leader - type reaching for new levels of douchebaggery .
When you consider the entire history of their particular business , it must seem a tremendous task .
How do you top the likes of Stalin or Hitler ?
I suppose you ca n’t beat them in terms of tyranny in the sort of globo - politi - whatever we live in today , so you ’ve just got to go for extra points in style .
When it comes to style , nobody , and I really mean nobody , beats America .
We have so many power - strength dickheads in our government screaming about homosexuality , abortion , and other things that you ’d think would be left up to individuals that our news organizations can’t reasonably cover all of the preposterous antics they get up to .
We ’ve got Republican “ Family Men ” who wander off on the Appalachian Trail and end up banging some South American woman , we ’ve got Democrats trying to get it on with other dudes in airport bathrooms , and most incredibly of all , we ’ve got plenty of clergymen molesting children .
There seems to be something about a desire for power that goes hand in hand with being a complete asshole .
Does my contempt for these people show ?
Let me try to reel it in .
The funniest part about all the shenanigans surrounding these “ morality ” issues is that the individuals screaming the loudest about them have been shown , quite frequently , to be engaging in the very activities that they are supposedly against .
The best ones are the ultra - conservative buffoons that bash homosexuals and court the lowest common denominator amongst us by speaking out against gay marriage and then engage in sex with other men !
In that context they play the parts of both victim and villain in some fucked up melodrama I ca n’t even begin to wrap my head around .
It ’s like looking at an MC Escher Painting , or something .
I know this is n’t a mythology strip , I apologize , but I do like to mix it up every now and again .
I was a political science major for a whole year before I realized I despise the sorts of people that become political science majors and became an art student , so hopefully you ’ll indulge me here .
I ’d thought , at one point , that I could make a difference in the world by standing on a soapbox at political rallies and telling people that thinking certain ways was wrong .
It turned out that I was wrong .
I ’ve since realized that the best way to really touch peoples ’ lives is to create things that they can identify with .
The most life - changing experiences I ’ve had have been with books , comics , and art and they ’ve been pretty substantial .
I started drawing comics and writing because of Gabe and Tycho over at Penny - Arcade .
I learned to believe in myself when I was young because of JRR Tolkien ’s The Hobbit .
Now , I write every day and draw constantly so that someday I can have a dialogue with people about what we think is important .
And if we ca n’t have a dialogue , I hope at least that I can make you smile or , even better , make you laugh .
Because butts are pretty damned hilarious .
SEOUL Ã¢â‚¬â€ North Korea has completely cut off state food rations after China failed to supply the impoverished communist country with extra cereals , a welfare group said Monday .
The ruling communist party announced in a directive on May 26 that there would be no state rations for a while , said South Korea ’s Good Friends group which has contacts in the North .

People were authorised to buy food supplies through private markets , it said , adding the directive was due to delayed shipments of food from China .
“ The directive was unavoidable ” because China failed to send the aid which had been anticipated after leader Kim Jong - Il ’s trip to Beijing in early May , group president Pomnyun , who uses just one name , told reporters .
Private markets are now open around the clock across the North , he said .
The North suffered famine in the mid-1990s which killed hundreds of thousands and it still grapples with severe food shortages .
The UN children ’s fund estimates one third of children are stunted by malnutrition .
The state food distribution system collapsed during the famine .
Free markets sprang up and were condoned for a time .

Since 2005 the regime has been reasserting its grip on the economy , with controls or outright bans on the private markets .
A currency revaluation last November , designed to flush out entrepreneurs ’ savings , backfired disastrously , fuelling food shortages as market trading dried up and sparking rare outbreaks of unrest .
The North was forced to suspend its campaign to curb the private markets .

NOKERO INTRODUCES WORLD'S ONLY SOLAR LIGHT BULB TO PROVIDE CLEAN , SAFE LIGHTING SOLUTIONS AROUND THE GLOBE
- Designed as an affordable , safe and clean alternative to burning fossil - fuel lamps
- Multiple uses for homes , schools , businesses , outdoor recreation and more
Hong Kong , ( June 10 , 2010 ) - Nokero International
Ltd today announced the release of the Nokero N100 , the world 's only solar light bulb™ .
The innovative Nokero bulb offers an affordable , clean and safe lighting solution to 1.6 billion people worldwide – a quarter of the human population – who live without electricity and rely on fossil - fuel lanterns for lighting .
The durable , rainproof light bulb is about the size of a standard incandescent bulb and can be charged during the day to provide hours of clean , safe light at night .
It 's also designed with a replaceable , rechargeable battery so it can be renewed to operate for several years .
" We 've done everything we can to make this solar bulb affordable and long - lasting so the people who need it can afford it , and reap the benefits , " said Nokero 's inventor and founder Stephen Katsaros .
" There are so many ways this product can change lives :
It can help keep families and shopkeepers safe , help students study at night , eradicate indoor pollution , and reduce worldwide carbon emissions . "
More affordable than kerosene
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCC ) estimates that those using fuel lamps spend five percent of their income on fuel .
The Nokero bulb removes the cost of fuel , making it affordable even to those living in substandard conditions .
It can pay for itself within months when replacing a kerosene lantern because of kerosene 's high cost .
Nokero is cordless and does n't require the infrastructure of traditional grid lighting – removing much of the expense faced when attempting to bring electricity to many parts of the world .
It is simple , and does n't require complicated installation or maintenance .
The bulb provides about four hours of light when fully charged , and about two or more hours of light after a typical day charging in full sunlight .
A cleaner lighting solution
The UNFCC estimates that 190 million tons of carbon dioxide are released by fuel lanterns each year , the equivalent of 30 million cars .
The Nokero bulb is solar - powered and does not emit carbon dioxide .
Users can expect to save up to 250 kg ( 550 pounds ) of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere in one year when they use Nokero bulb versus burning kerosene .
A safer lighting solution
Continued study by the UNFCCC found that families and children using fuel lanterns suffer from increased indoor air pollution and fire risk .
Millions of students study in poor lighting conditions and millions more face reduced nighttime security .
Nokero provides steady , bright and safe light in comparison to kerosene .
" There 's no other product like this on the market , " Katsaros said .
" This bulb represents our best chance at eradicating an outdated , dangerous practice and replacing it with a safe , sustainable solution . "
Nokero is built to last .
It is made of impact resistant plastic , four solar panels , and five bright LEDs ( light emitting diodes ) .
It can withstand wind , rain , and weather .
The replaceable , nickel metal hydride battery lasts up to two years , and is easily and cheaply replaced .
With long - lasting solar panels and LEDs rated for 50,000 hours of light , Nokero N100 can provide reliable light for well beyond the two - year life of the battery .
Nokero has multiple uses .
It can be deployed in areas of natural disaster , used for domestic lighting , on camping trips , in schoolhouses or in and around the home or patio .
Its elegant light creates a comfortable atmosphere in almost any setting .
In February , the U.S. Treasury and Labor departments jointly announced they were seeking public comment on proposed design changes to employer - sponsored 401 ( k ) plans and individual retirement accounts that would centralize the private pension system under structures created and administered by the government .
Supporters say these changes are needed to ensure Americans save more for their retirement and have lifetime income options that prevent them from outliving their retirement savings , protecting them from market risk .
At stake for the millions of Americans with private retirement plans :
Would they be able to continue making their own investment decisions ?
Or would Congress mandate both investment options and distribution methods ?
Government Retirement Accounts also would prevent workers from owning their retirement savings fully , as they could bequeath only half of their remaining account balances to their heirs .
Government officials , labor unions , and some industry groups favor GRAs and mandatory annuitization .
Under the proposal being discussed , workers and companies alike would contribute a minimum of 2.5 percent of pay , up to the Social Security earnings cap , to their GRA .
In return , workers would be guaranteed a 3 percent return on their investment .
This system would not replace Social Security , forcing workers to contribute to both systems .
According to the Department of Labor , 61 percent of all private - sector workers and 71 percent of all full - time private - sector workers had access to an employer - provided retirement plan in 2008 , and another 47 million households currently participate in IRAs .
Proponents of a government takeover of the private pension system say the housing and financial crises have jeopardized retirement security and left Americans less trusting of the financial system .
However , a survey conducted in fall 2008 , even as the financial crisis was unfolding , found strong support for the current system .
The Investment Company Institute , a national association of U.S. investment companies that manage about 50 percent of the nation ’s 401( k ) , 403 ( b ) , and IRA assets , surveyed 3,000 households and reported nearly nine of 10 rejected the idea that government , not individuals , should make retirement investment decisions .
Even households without a 401 ( k ) or IRA did not see a need for drastic changes to the private system .
Effect on private wealth
Government officials vociferously deny any intent to eliminate 401 ( k ) or IRA investments in favor of a government - run system .
Joseph Dewolk , a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Labor , told Carolina Journal it ’s inaccurate to say they ’re looking to convert IRAs or 401 ( k ) s to a government - run plan .
“ I would refer you to the ‘ Request for Information ’ because it ’s just that , a series of questions to gather input from the public and others about our proposed rules .
It ’s about making sure Americans can make their savings last . ”
The “ Request for Information Regarding Lifetime Income Options for Participants and Beneficiaries in Retirement Plans , ” posted to the Federal Register in February , was open for public comments until May 3 ( see EBSA - 2010.pdf ) .
So how do Americans find out when an issue is up for public comment ?
When questioned about the transparency of the public comment system , Dewolk said , “ Well , a lot of people did know , and they commented on the website . ”
Sandra Salstrom , a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury , told CJ that “ it ’s [ the Request for Information ] is on the Federal Register so anyone can read it and comment .
Apparently , 700 people cared enough to make a comment . ”
As CJ first reported in November 2008 , the House Committee on Education and Labor has held several hearings since early 2008 on strengthening pensions .
Teresa Ghilarducci , professor of economic policy analysis at the New School of Social Research in New York , is among those advocating Congress to remove favorable tax treatment for 401 ( k ) s , which opponents say essentially would eliminate any reason for companies to offer these plans , and instead offer GRAs .
In a statement to the committee on Feb. 24 , 2009 , John Bogle , founder and former CEO of The Vanguard Group , pushed for a new defined contribution plan in the private sector but overseen by a new independent Federal Retirement Board .
“ If we want to encourage and maximize the retirement savings of our citizens , we must drive the money changers — or at least most of them — out of the temples of finance . ”
But others , including Paul Stevens , president and CEO of Investment Company Institute , said the government should “ not favor one solution over others , but should nurture a robust and transparent market where innovative products can be developed and understood by retirees . ”
( Details of testimony are here . )
Two reports referenced in recent Committee hearings and the U.S. Labor and Treasury departments ’ joint RFI discussed government - run options .
The Annual Report of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class , released in February , strongly favors automatic IRAs , annuitization , and GRAs ( see Annual - report - middle- class.pdf ) .
A July 2009 Government Accountability Office report on private pensions prepared for the House committee details the advantages and trade - offs of alternative retirement options currently under consideration ( see GAO-09-642.pdf ) .
One option would be the Universal 401(k )
Plan giving every worker , including part - time employees and recent hires not yet eligible for an employer - sponsored plan , access to a government - administered defined contribution retirement savings account .
Workers would be enrolled automatically unless they opted out .
The Guaranteed Retirement Accounts plan proposes a mandatory system with both defined benefit and defined contribution features .
The report makes it clear in footnote 79 that this system would work only if everyone has to participate : “ A mandatory retirement system cannot ensure 100 percent coverage if certain groups , such as very low - income workers , are exempt from the mandate . ”
The report also warns that requiring workers and employers to contribute to any type of pension plan would increase the costs and divert funds from other uses , such as employers ’ business expenses and workers ’ basic necessities .
Under such a scenario , employers might have to reduce compensation to employees , disproportionately affecting lower - income workers and small businesses .
An annuity is the investment vehicle most favored by many government officials .
However , the GAO report says that forced annuitization is problematic because annuitants who die early in their retirement would not realize much benefit , they would no longer have access to their assets in the event of an emergency , and generally could not leave a bequest to their heirs .
Finally , the report concludes that any centralization or nationalization of the private pension system , especially one that guaranteed a rate of return , “ may be a costly and complex effort that requires new regulatory and oversight efforts .
These costs could be passed on to workers , employers , and taxpayers in general . ”
Opposition to government - run plans
In a letter sent to the Department of Labor and Department of the Treasury , Republicans expressed strong opposition to any attempt to eliminate or federalize private - sector IRAs or 401 ( k ) s .
Alexa Marrero , spokesperson for Republican members of the House Education and Labor Committee , told CJ that , while she ’s unaware of any specific timeline , the administration ’s lack of transparency on previous issues makes it possible it could act at any time without providing much notice .
Public comments to the RFI from those who were not connected to labor advocacy groups or the investment community largely were negative .
While some said improvements could be made to the current system , many expressed distrust of the government ’s ability to manage retirement systems and said individuals should make their own decisions .

The moment when , after many years
of hard work and a long voyage
you stand in the centre of your room ,
house , half - acre , square mile , island , country ,
knowing at last how you got there ,
and say , I own this ,
is the same moment when the trees unloose
their soft arms from around you ,
the birds take back their language ,
the cliffs fissure and collapse ,
the air moves back from you like a wave
and you ca n’t breathe .
No , they whisper .
You own nothing .
You were a visitor , time after time
climbing the hill , planting the flag , proclaiming .
We never belonged to you .
You never found us .
It was always the other way round .

Advantages and Disadvantages of Silver
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : A Gold Economy Begins
Silver is not being mined like gold is .
New silver mines not as plentiful .
See Silver Institute web site for accurate information on supply and demand of silver .
Only 36 U.S. silver mines report production ( Source : Wikipedia )
Annual gold production : 2,310,000 kilograms ( kilo = 2.2 lbs ) Annual silver production 20,900,000 kilograms
No silver reserves kept by central banks
Less likely to be confiscated
Less expensive to purchase
In greater demand than gold ( largely by females who desire silver as a more affordable shiny metal ; but also has industrial demand as silver is used in industry for silverware , in photography , electronics , etc . )
Silver coins are more practical for use in commerce because of its lower value ( can buy groceries with it )
US silver coins should be distinguished from silver rounds , which are not legal tender in the U.S .
Silver round , looks like U.S. coin
The Best of Bill Sardi
The Spanish midfielder is impressed with Bob Bradley 's side .
It caught all of the attention in the United States , but apparently the USA 's last minute victory over Algeria has become the talk of the tournament .
In fact , Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas , who today helped his side reach the knockout rounds as group winners themselves , said that the game was the best of the tournament so far .
" The best moment for me at the World Cup so far was that nail biting end when the USA scored in the last minute against Algeria , " Fabregas told The Sun .
" It was an incredible finale and was the most memorable one for me .
" Everybody is talking about it .
That was a great moment and they are a great team .
" But the Arsenal star was n't done with his praise of the USA and went on to say he felt the team could make a deep run in the competition while mentioning that his team found out how good they were at the Confederations Cup .
" I was n't surprised at all they finished top of the group .
They are fit and strong and dangerous on the counter - attack .
" They have spirit too - they came from two goals down against Slovenia to get a draw and scored in injury time against Algeria to go through .
The USA never give up .
That 's why I believe they can go much further because they fight to the end and work so hard .
" They are in a good side of the draw now - they have Ghana next , then maybe Uruguay in the quarter - finals .
" So I can see them reaching the semi-finals and then who knows what might happen .
" The USA will get their next shot at glory on Saturday when they take on Ghana in a crucial final 16 clash .

Ask The Champ
With Ken Climo , Eleven - Time World Champion
( Courtesy of Ken Climo and Disc Golf Journal ) Hey Champ ,
Consider this situation .
Having marked my lie and completed my pre-putting routine , I am focused on the exact link I want to hit .
Out of the blue comes this negative feeling .
Sometimes it is fear that I may miss the putt .
Sometimes it is an inner dialogue that debates my ability to hit the putt .
Sometimes it is just an uncomfortable feeling something is not right .
So , I turn around and take a deep breath , tell myself I can hit this with my eyes closed , wiggle my shoulders and arms to loosen up a bit and resume my putting stance .
My 30 seconds are just about up , and unfortunately , I did not succeed in clearing my mind of the negative vibes .
Assuming you occasionally confront this dilemma , what is your formula for regaining control of the correct mental focus ?
Thanks .
- Stan McDaniel Indian Trail , NC Stan ,
You covered basically everything I try to do  step away , look the other direction , and take a good , deep cleansing breath .
Then approach the putt as if it were the first time with a new focus .
But just standing there while you re having negative thoughts is the cause for a lot of missed putts .
You have to go with the mental frame of mind that  I havent stroked the putt yet so this is the first time . 
It s the nature of the game to sometimes be distracted .
I dont take too long to putt , so I dont often push the 30 seconds .
The only time I encounter that is maybe when I m waiting on some wind .
When I know my time is getting near 25 seconds I just go ahead and trust myself .
That s the key  having trust and confidence in your abilities .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken ,
The most incredible shot Ive ever seen under pressure was your roller out of a farm shed during the finals of the 1995 PDGA Worlds in Port Arthur , TX .
Mike Randolph was catching you and having a perfect round .
After your drive landed on top of that building it looked to me like Randolph was going to win .
It s easy to throw shots when you re not under pressure .
How did you make the shot and can someone actually practice pressure situations ?
Being a mediocre myself , I create all kinds of games to practice pressure with the hopes that when I get to a tournament I will be better prepared for it .
- Mark Ellis Farmington Hills , MI Mark ,
It s tough to practice the exact tournament situations , but something Ive been doing for a long time is play singles against a doubles or a triple team around my local course .
That s a way for me to practice to keep my edge up every shot .
With the farm - shed situation I really didnt take much time to think it out .
Ive been in those high - pressure situations before and I seem to excel at them .
Pressure affects people differently .
Even in my early days competing against Akins , Monroe and Slasor , I was more caught up in the moment , not the pressure .
Like ,  Wow , Ive got a chance to win , I cant let up now . 
Keep everything positive .
That s the key .
If you re there for so many rounds and you have a chance to win or to cash  whatever your goal is  you just tell yourself you can do it for a few more holes or whatever is left .
Positive brain waves are key on the golf course .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken ,
What goes into your decisions to go to an event today compared to when you started touring in the early 90s ?
- David Sporleder Kennewick , WA
In the early days Id base my travel plans around other people going to a big event to make sure I wasnt driving by myself for 20 hours .
These days I do more flying so its easier to travel alone , and I decide which tournaments to go to based on the ones I like and the courses I like to play .
The Masters Cup  I really like that course .
The Great Lakes Open is a great venue .
Super
Tours are getting more enticing with the bonus situation , and the competition is getting tougher .
I love the competition .
The course and payout are probably 80 % of the decision if I decide to go to an event .
The other 20 % is location .
I have a son now too .
I didnt have a son when I started touring and that s making a big difference in my life and my decisions .
I generally dont stay on the road for more than three weeks  ever .
It causes burnout when you re on the road too long .
I dont want to do that to myself and I enjoy giving my body rest  things I didnt think about earlier in my career .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Champ ,
Ive been experimenting with different putting styles and finally stuck with one very similar to yours .
I like it because its not a push putt , butt more of a pitch putt , like pitching a horseshoe .
It has the up and down trajectory with little spin and no blow - by .
I have isolated my problem to my hand and wrist position at the release point .
If my thumb is at the 9 or 10:00 position , I get good hyzer and spin .
But , when I roll my thumb to 12 or 1:00 it comes out nose down with no spin and ends up short .
I notice in photos Ive seen of you putting that your thumb is at 7 or 8:00 .
Any suggestions ?
- Andy Caris Germantown , MD
Your thumb position is really to create the hyzer angle .
A lot of people putt with wrist  theyll turn their wrist , snap and release .
Im pretty much locked throughout the putt .
On the way down when I take the disc back I dont curl the disc with my wrist .
I want the disc to come out of my hand due to forward momentum , not spin .
I want the weight shift to take over .
It s easier to do a weight shift putt if you have a locked wrist .
I line the disc up with my push foot , which is my left foot , and the pole .
I get all three on a line .
Ill push from the back of my left foot through my body on the line of the disc and extending to the pole .
If you pitched a 5 - pound weight from a barbell it wouldnt go left or right  it would go straight .
And thats what I try and envision 
I have a weight in my hand , not a Frisbee that s going to turn .
You push the weight and the weight will go straight .
The release is almost like you re extending your hand to make a handshake , not flipping or spinning too much .
Obviously the disc has to have some spin but not much .
You see a lot of potential aces fall out because of speed and spin .
If the drives came in with less speed and spin theyd stick more .
That s my goal with the putt , not so much less speed but less spin .
When the disc hits the chains you dont want much action .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Champ ,
I actually have two questions .
The first concerns distractions during putting  what keeps you focused ?
The other question would be any tips you could give me on throwing uphill ?
Thanks .
- Paul Larson Lakewood , WA When I putt I look at a specific link .
That s all my focus is on .
Distractions such as car horns and people moving are a part of life .
If the distraction is during the stroke theres nothing you can do about it .
If its before the shot you can back away , turn around and approach the shot fresh .
As far as throwing uphill , slow down a little bit and use more leg power .
Not a lot of people get the maximum power they can from their legs and it really shows when driving uphill .
Most people just try and wing the disc around with their arms rather than pulling it through with legs , hips and shoulders .
If the hole is just a straight incline an anhyzer release will work best .
And remember to get the nose down .
Dont throw uphill with the nose up .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Champ ,
I hope I am not getting too personal , but are you in a relationship right now ?
And what sacrifices have you made in your personal life in pursuit of being the # 1 Disc Golfer ?
Does your drive to be # 1 tax the personal areas of your life ?
- Doug Opiela Hamburg , NY Hi Doug ,
No this is nt too personal for me .
Im pretty loose right now and not in a serious relationship .
I dont see my son as often as I would like but when I am at home and not on tour I see him quite a bit .
Sacrifices have to be made such as not being able to go to a tournament because of obligations .

Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center may have found a way to replace missing teeth by having them regrown by stem cells in your mouth .
Jeremy Mao , director of the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Lab ( TERML ) , used tooth shaped scaffolds augmented with growth factors and proteins to attract stem cells from the body and grow the appropriate bone in place in just 9 weeks .
The work was performed in rats using both rat and human - based scaffolds and was reported in the Journal of Dental Research .
While still very preliminary , Mao ’s results show that we may have the potential to regrow teeth lost to trauma or disease .
Chalk up another win for regenerative medicine in the fight to repair long term damage to the human body .
We ’ve been talking about using stem cells to grow new organs for years now , but that is typically in the context of the tissue being generated in a lab , such as when Columbia University grew a jawbone .
A recent trend towards in vivo studies are newer and very promising .
A boy in England had a new trachea grown in his throat using a scaffold and his own stem cells .
The in - body approach has some major benefits including quicker integration and cheaper production .
TERML ’s work stands out not just because it is in vivo , but also because it requires no culturing of stem cells .
The mysenchemal cells in the body are attracted to the scaffold site by growth factors and proteins .
This means that one day you may be able to pop in a scaffold in your tooth socket and your body will just grow a new tooth onto it .
But we ’re still a long way from that day .
First and foremost , we should be cautious because TERML ’s recent study was in an animal model .
Scaffolds for 22 rat incisors and human molars were made from polymers and calcium - based minerals using 3D bio-printing .
The incisor scaffolds were placed in the rat ’s mouth ( after extracting the natural one ) while the human molars were surgically inserted into the back .
( Animal testing never sounds pleasant , does it ? )
Even if the same scaffolds were to work perfectly in humans , we ’d still be faced with years of human trials and safety evaluations .
Secondly , while tooth cells were grown at the interface of the scaffold after 9 weeks , this is far from regenerating an entire tooth .
It may take several rounds of engineering to find a way to induce cells to recreate the dentin , pulp , enamel , etc of an adult tooth .
Still , the scaffolds themselves have a lot promise – perhaps even bankable potential .
Columbia has pursued a patent on the work , and TechVentures is actively seeking investors .
The polymer / mineral structure of the scaffold may be something that could be adopted elsewhere .
The growth factor ( SDF1 ) and protein ( BMP7 ) were shown to have significant effect in the attraction of stem cells to the site , so we ’re likely to see those applied in other places as well .
If the overall scaffold does show success in growing teeth then chances are it could be modified for use in orthopedic endeavors as well .
At first glance , the TERML research may seem very specific , and to some degree it is .
Mao and his colleagues are looking for the best way to replace missing teeth .
Yet the applications for in vivo generation using stem cells is epic .
If the appropriate scaffold and growth factors could be made , you could find ways to regenerate tissue almost anywhere in the body .
To some extent we ’ve already seen this with ACell and CookBiotech .
TERML raises the possibility of regenerating entire complex structures .
We may one day be able to regrow a tooth in place , or replace cartilage in a knee , or maybe even heal damage to hearing ( by targeting the small inner ear structures ) .
We ’re still years from such applications making their way to you , but they no longer seem like science fiction .
Eventually the practice of implanting fake teeth , caps , and crowns will seem arcane .
If it does n’t already .

" I'm in different cities all the time , " he said .
" You kind of get a tour guide to a certain extent . "
Christopher Barton , 31 , of Boulder City , Nev. , first tried Rentafriend about six months ago during a business trip training clients for an online university .
Living on the road , he hates to eat alone in restaurants and wants to make the most of his downtime .
Rentafriend receives 100,000 unique views every month and has nearly 2,000 members who pay $ 24.95 a month , or $ 69.95 a year , for a login and password so they can peruse the photos and profiles of 167,000 - plus possible pals .
" The real question is , is it solving anyone 's problems ?
My first reaction was to roll my eyes , but it may in fact help people meet others and get back into circulation .
If it 's used as a substitute for meaningful face - to - face relationships , it 's not going to work , " said John T. Cacioppo , a social neuroscience researcher and co-author of " Loneliness : Human Nature and the Need for Social Interaction . "
In a world where friend is a verb and you may never meet some of yours from Facebook in real life , where research indicates chronic loneliness can lead to depression , suicide , high blood pressure and viral infections , where roughly 20 percent of all people -- 60 million in the United States alone -- say they feel lonely at any given moment , is renting a friend a solution or stopgap ?
While Morrison is happy to meet new people and make a little extra money , charging $ 20 to $ 30 an hour , she 's not the only one to think lonely thoughts about the 7 - month - old service modeled on similar , hugely successful sites in Japan and elsewhere in Asia .
" You look at a site like this and think , ' Oh , they must all be escorts or it's a dating site or something , ' " said Morrison , a mother of a 2 - year - old who signed on with the blessing of her husband .
" When I first saw it I had mixed feelings about it .
I thought it was kind of sad that people have to do this . "
It 's all because of a new arrival to the Web - fueled , rent - an - everything revolution -- Rentafriend.com .
A bored grandmother visiting family from the Midwest hired her for an afternoon movie .
A stay - at - home mom who was new to the area paid her to come on over to do some scrapbooking .
Morrison , 31 , met a traveling businessman at the airport with a folder of research he requested on things to do and helped him rent a car .
The reservation - taker at a popular Las Vegas restaurant has accepted cash to show an introverted , out - of - town computer programmer around the Pinball Hall of Fame and the Bellagio 's famous dancing fountains .
He chooses young , attractive women because " I 'd just feel weird paying to go out with a guy . "
A rent - a- pal in Chicago took him to a fun , hole - in - the - wall restaurant that he never would have found himself .
In New Orleans , he and another rental hit Cafe du Monde in the French Market and Jackson Square .
Started by Scott Rosenbaum in Stewartsville , N.J. , a former marketer for dating websites , Rentafriend has some competition from other services that will make platonic matches for a fee , like Rentalocalfriend.com for travelers .
The difference , he said , is Rentafriend allows the renter to make a pick , negotiating the cost and making arrangements one - on - one through e-mail or phone calls .
" People e-mail me all the time about it .
Is it legal ?
Is it really platonic ?
There 's no 100 percent way to be sure , but we have zero tolerance if a friend says they were solicited .
There 's no second chance , " Rosenbaum said .
Rosenbaum 's site , like those in Japan , has people renting for lots of different reasons .
Two students rented parents to meet with college officials after they were caught drinking on campus .
A woman once hired a college girl to visit her mother in a nursing home three days a week after she moved away .
" In Japan and China , they 're more cultural because having a full family is so important , " he said .
" It 's common to rent a fill - in family member for a wedding , like a father figure or someone to stand in as an important uncle to give a toast . "
Rosenbaum 's site is set up for search by ZIP code .
His rentals skew young , with most ranging from 20 to 35 , though there are plenty in their 40s and 50s .
Hourly fees range from $ 10 to a rare $ 150 , usually between $ 20 and $ 50 .
" When you look at the profiles , there 's tons of things people want to do , " said Barton , who 's an actor on the side .
" You can kind of pick and choose and find a profile of somebody who 's into what you 're into .
It 's a better kind of experience than going around by yourself . "
Morrison mentions her husband and child in her Rentafriend profile and offers that she dances Tahitian style and hip hop .
" If you need someone to work out with or just hang out I am your girl .
I 'm pretty peppy and bubbly if you just need a smile and I have lived a life of someone twice my age if you need an ear and some advice . "
She has a full - time job but Rentafriend has helped her earn a little extra .
" I 'm trying to save more .
We 'd like to buy a house and just put money away .
I treat it like a business , but it is n't my profession . "
Ori Brafman , co-author with brother Rom of the new book " Click : The Magic of Instant Connections , " said the concept " seems really tragic , kind of surreally tragic " in ways that sex services do n't because it represents the worst kind of social isolation .
" The danger is n't Rentafriend per se , but rather what it symbolizes , " he said .
" We purchase fleeting replacements because , as a society , we lack those close , meaningful bonds that are so essential . "
Does Barton consider himself lonely ?
Not really .
He has buddies , does n't have a girlfriend and is n't using Rentafriend to find one .
" If I did have a girlfriend , she 'd probably want to know what was going on , " he said .
" I 'd use it a little less probably , or maybe I 'd start paying guys . "

Do n’t you love when grandparents re-invent history ?
But it wo n’t be long until some of us start reminiscing about the good old days and creating stories about how life worked before everything was online .
I know some people that even do it now .
They sit around and tell us about how good things were before everyone was distracted by facebook , twitter and iphones .
Yup , in the good old days all they had to keep them amused were video games , IRC chats , Rubiks cubes , messageboards and web - rings …..

Opposition grows to police repression in Toronto
By Paul Franklin
29 June 2010
Police provocations on the streets of Toronto continued Monday evening as thousands of city residents rallied in front of the municipal police headquarters to protest the martial law tactics let loose against the population over the weekend .
As crowds began to spill out into the road outside the headquarters , police cordoned off the area , preventing hundreds of others from joining in .
Several individuals who attempted to cross the police cordon were summarily arrested .
Already , by six in the evening some 2,000 people had gathered in the vicinity , outraged by police actions .
Over the weekend , while the leaders of the G20 met behind a barbed - wire perimeter at Toronto ’s Metro Convention Centre to discuss another round of austerity measures against the international working class , the 14,000 strong “ Integrated Security Force ” had rampaged through the ranks of peaceful demonstrators , arresting over 900 individuals and incarcerating them in a filthy , make - shift holding pen in the city ’s east end .
Over the course of the past 72 hours protestors have been bludgeoned , kicked , tear gassed , trampled by police horses and shot at with rubber and plastic bullets .
Homes have been raided for “ preventative arrests ” without a warrant .
Journalists covering these unprecedented events have been arrested and assaulted .
A section of the Toronto protest
Demonstrators have been hauled into detention cages , strip searched and denied legal counsel .
There , detainees suffering from concussion and deep lacerations were denied medical attention .
A diabetic entering into shock was denied treatment for four hours .
The “ kennel ” as it was dubbed by police guards , was crammed with people arrested for such egregious offences as carrying “ dangerous weapons ” such as protest signs and noise - makers .
Smokers carrying lighters have been accused of possessing “ incendiary devices ” .
Youth with the temerity to wear black clothing have been swept up by the police dragnet in a program dubbed “ catch and release ” by rank - and - file cops .
( A collection of eyewitness accounts was published by the Toronto Star here . )
In one particularly provocative action , hundreds of heavily armed riot police corralled some 200 people Sunday night at a downtown street - corner , forcing them to stand in a driving thunderstorm for four hours .
This “ kettling operation ” detained not only youth demonstrating against the G20 but commuters heading home from weekend shopping , dozens of citizens departing from world cup soccer celebrations , journalists covering the police build - up and entire families resident in the area .
The scenes of drenched and shivering people , crying children and distressed family pets have struck a chord amongst broad layers of the city ’s populace .
Police block demonstrators
News anchors covering Monday evening ’s protest against police brutality have been shocked by the size of the spontaneous outpouring of opposition to the repressive measures unleashed against the citizenry .
As the march proceeded from downtown police headquarters towards the site of Sunday night ’s “ human corral ” , people heading home from work joined the procession .
A cacophony of car horns , stuck in traffic , rhythmically beeped in time with chants of “ No police state ” !
Thousands of riot and mounted police , aware of the symbolism of the march , moved to block the route towards the kettling site .
Blocked from heading westward , the crowd marched to Toronto ’s Nathan Phillips Square , the seat of the municipal government , shouting “ Shame , Shame ” in criticism of the social democratic mayor , David Miller , who issued statements over the weekend supporting the police repression .
The march then proceeded to Queen ’s Park , the grounds of the provincial legislature , to register its opposition to the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty that earlier this month secretly passed a provision massively expanding police powers .
Security forces had claimed the right to take over Toronto ’s financial and entertainment districts under the federal Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act .
Following the 2001 demonstrations against the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City , the Liberal government of Jean Chretien amended the act to stipulate that “ the Royal Canadian Mounted Police may take appropriate measures , including controlling , limiting or prohibiting access to any area to the extent and in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances ” .
The vague terminology , and the absence of any reference to the rights of free movement and free speech that are reputedly guaranteed under Canada ’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms , have provided police organizations with the ability to impose martial - law - like restrictions at will .
But even this carte - blanche was deemed inadequate by Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair and McGuinty .
At the “ extraordinary request ” of the police chief , the provincial cabinet on June 2 secretly passed a new regulation under the Ontario Public Works Protection
Act that allows police to arrest anyone within five meters of the security zone who refuses to submit to a request for identification or a search of their person .
The new law , in effect until June 28 , was not publicized .
Its public exposure occurred when it appeared without notice on a provincial e-laws database last week .
Despite hundreds of briefings given to the citizens of Toronto over the past month , police consistently withheld this information .
“ It reminds me a little bit of the War Measures Act , ” said Nathalie Des Rosiers of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association .
To date , Premier McGuinty and his entire cabinet have remained unavailable for comment .
In a press conference given by Blair on Saturday evening , the police chief dismissed criticism of McGuinty ’s anti-democratic measure , stating that police did not need the provision to arrest so - called suspicious people wherever and whenever they saw fit .
On Monday morning Amnesty International , the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and several journalistic societies called for an inquiry into the police actions .
So naked has been the assault on democratic rights that even sections of Canada ’s mainstream press have been forced to denounce the “ excesses ” .
The Toronto Star , the country ’s largest circulation daily , featured a front page editorial Monday morning dubbing the Conservative Harper government ’s $ 1.2 billion G20 security plan as “ a brutal spectacle that failed a city and its people . ”
Throughout the weekend , Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s office and the media trumpeted the vandalism of a small group of “ Black Bloc ” anarchists who , on Saturday , broke away from police lines to smash shop windows and bank ATM ’s and set alight several police cruisers .
It was these actions , claimed the police , which brought about their repressive measures .
But police attacks on activists preceded these actions by several days .
Already dozens of protestors had been arrested .
“ Preventative ” raids on the homes of known protest organizers began on Friday evening .
In the months prior to the G20 summit , organizers had been followed by police , their meetings aggressively “ monitored ” and “ visits ” paid to their homes and places of work .
Moreover , over the past 24 hours , more evidence has surfaced that put into serious question the police version of events around the vandalism of Saturday .
The actions , including the torching of police cars , were carried out without any intervention from the police .
Today , close - up photographs of those attacking the cruisers show that several of them were attired in footwear closely resembling that issued to the squads of riot policemen deployed on the streets .
One reporter noted that a gas cap on one of the cruisers had been removed prior to the arrival of the “ Black Bloc . ”
Others questioned why cruisers were left isolated and unattended by the police .
Leo Broderick , vice - chair of the Council of Canadians and a participant in the demonstration held Saturday afternoon , provided the following observation : “ I returned from viewing the burning of police cars on Bay Street and the latest on Queen Street .
I am convinced this is a police set up .
My first clue of a pending entrapment was on leaving Queens Park and we were confronted with an empty police car blocking our way .
Very peculiar .
We all walked around it ….
This evening on Queen Street a police car was simply left there .
Supposedly broken down .
I saw the car there abandoned , and was puzzled .
No police around .
Earlier when I was there the police were everywhere .
But they were not there when this car was torched . ”
THE US Navy has a raygun - and it's a big one .
In a red -letter week for the US military , its Naval Sea Systems command " successfully tracked , engaged , and destroyed ” several unmanned aircraft with its Laser Weapon System , otherwise known as LaWS .
On the ground , iRobot unveiled its gift to the Pentagon - the 710 Warrior designed to clear an entire 45 square metre minefield in one blow .
But first , the raygun .
According to The Register , " it represents the first Detect - Thru - Engage laser shoot - down of a threat representative target in an over - the - water , combat representative scenario " .
LaWS is fitted to the Navy 's " R2 - D2 " robotic gun turret and looks every bit like what you 'd expect a raygun to look like .
In normal operations , R2 - D2 would support the Navy 's Phalanx 20 mm cannon , which automatically locks onto incoming missiles and blasts them out of the sky .
Unfortunately for anyone in the impact zone , that ususally results in a shower of shrapnel or the 20 mm shell itself if it fails to explode .
The LaWS system simply vapourises the target .
Naval spokesman Captain David Kiel said the success test " validates the military utility of ( rayguns ) in a maritime environment " .
" Further development and integration of increasingly more powerful lasers into Surface Navy LaWS will increase both the engagement range and target sets that can be successfully engaged and destroyed , " he said .
As for iRobot 's Warrior , an extremely convincing video shows how it can roll into a minefield and deploy a set of grenades to clear a large chunk of turf .
i Robot co-founder had previously told Wired that his company was n't in the business of making weaponised robots , and it 's probably sticking to its guns , so to speak .
But obviously iRobot can't tell the US military how to use its devastating metal marine ...
CLEVELAND HEIGHTS , Ohio -- Harvey Pekar 's life was not an open book .
It was an open comic book .
Pekar chronicled his life and times in the acclaimed autobiographical comic book series , " American Splendor , " portraying himself as a rumpled , depressed , obsessive - compulsive " flunky file clerk " engaged in a constant battle with loneliness and anxiety .
Pekar , 70 , was found dead shortly before 1 a.m. Monday by his wife , Joyce Brabner , in their Cleveland Heights home , said Powell Caesar , spokesman for Cuyahoga County Coroner Frank Miller .
An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death .
Pekar and Brabner wrote " Our Cancer Year , " a book - length comic , after Pekar was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in 1990 and underwent a grueling treatment .
He was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer , and also suffered high blood pressure , asthma and clinical depression , which fueled his art but often made his life painful .
" American Splendor " carried the subtitle , " From Off the Streets of Cleveland , " and just like Superman , the other comic - book hero born in Cleveland , Pekar wore something of a disguise .
He never stepped into a phone booth to change , but underneath his persona of aggravated , disaffected file clerk , he was an erudite book and jazz critic , and a writer of short stories that many observers compared to Chekhov , despite their comic - book form .
Unlike the superheroes who ordinarily inhabit the pages of comic books , Pekar could neither leap tall buildings in a single bound , nor move faster than a speeding bullet .
Yet his comics suggested a different sort of heroism :
The working - class , everyman heroics of simply making it through another day , with soul -- if not dignity -- intact .
" American Splendor " had its roots in Pekar 's friendship with R. Crumb , the seminal underground comic - book artist .
The two met in 1962 when Crumb was working for American Greetings in Cleveland .
At the time , Crumb was just beginning to explore the possibilities of comics , which would later lead to such groundbreaking work as " Mr. Natural " and " Fritz the Cat . "

Pekar 's last interview , with blogtalkradio.com
Previous Plain Dealer coverage
When Pekar , inspired by Crumb 's work , wrote his nascent strip in 1972 , Crumb illustrated it .
Crumb also contributed to Pekar 's first full - fledged books , which Pekar started publishing annually in 1976 .
" He 's the soul of Cleveland , " Crumb told The Plain Dealer in 1994 .
" He 's passionate and articulate .
He 's grim .
He 's Jewish .
I appreciate the way he embraces all that darkness . "
Yet the darkness came with a humorous silver lining .
As Pekar said , " The humor of everyday life is way funnier than what the comedians do on TV .
It 's the stuff that happens right in front of your face when there 's no routine and everything is unexpected .
That 's what I want to write about . "
Pekar often complained that he made no money from his comics , but they did not go unappreciated .
He won the American Book Award in 1987 for his first anthology of " American Splendor . "
He was a regular guest on " Late Night With David Letterman , " until they had a falling out .
( Letterman declined to comment . )
And in 2003 , the film adaptation of his comics , also titled " American Splendor , " won the Grand Jury Prize for dramatic films at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival .
Pekar reacted to the prize with his characteristic mordant wit .
" I 'm always shook up and nervous and I 've got the hospital record to prove it , " he said that night .
" I wake up every morning in a cold sweat , regardless of how well things went the day before .
And put that I said that in a somewhat but not completely tongue - in - cheek way . "
Pekar was born Oct. 8 , 1939 , to Saul and Dora Pekar , who had emigrated from Bialystok , Poland .
His father , a Talmudic scholar , owned a small grocery store on Kinsman Avenue , and the family -- who included Harvey 's younger brother , Allen , a chemist -- lived above the store .
He graduated from Shaker Heights High School in 1957 , and went on to Case Western Reserve University , dropping out after a year when the pressure of required math classes proved too much to bear .
He served in the Navy , then returned to Cleveland and a series of menial jobs before landing at the Veteran 's Administration Hospital in Cleveland as a file clerk , a job he would hold until he retired in 2001 .
He was married three times , the last to Brabner , whom he met in 1983 when she wrote to him asking for an issue of " American Splendor . "
They were married on their third date , and a comic book naturally followed .
" American Splendor No. 10 " was subtitled , " Harvey 's Latest Crapshoot : His Third Marriage to a Sweetie from Delaware and How His Substandard Dishwashing Strains Their Relationship . "
They became legal guardians of Danielle Batone when she was 9 years old , in 1998 , " raising her as our own , " Pekar said .
After he retired from the VA hospital , Pekar continued to write jazz reviews and " American Splendor , " garnering the accolades of his peers and critics .
In 1989 , the New York Times Book Review said , " Mr. Pekar 's work has been compared by literary critics to Chekhov 's and Dostoevski's , and it 's easy to see why . "
The filmmaker David O. Russell ( " Three Kings " ) , who was on the Sundance jury that awarded " American Splendor " the grand prize , said , " It 's really great for people to see someone like Harvey Pekar , this guy who wants to remain authentic , is n't going to buy [ garbage ] , is n't going to the malls , keeps on collecting old jazz music that 's important -- that kind of independence . "
In the 1994 Plain Dealer article , R. Crumb said Pekar 's work examined the minutiae of everyday life , material " so staggeringly mundane it verges on the exotic . "
Pekar himself summed it up as revealing " a series of day - after - day activities that have more influence on a person than any spectacular or traumatic events .
It 's the 99 percent of life that nobody ever writes about . "

Linux has a powerful booster in the never - ending debate over what OS is safest from malware and spyware : Dell .

UPDATE : As a commenter pointed out below ( and I had in mind when I set out to write this , believe it or not ) , the greater number of advisories also can be attributed to some advisories being repeated for various Linux distros - Ubuntu , Debian , Fedora , etc. - and due to the fact that Microsoft bundles its advisories , with several issues addressed in each one on its Patch Tuesday each month .
My apologies for not making this point originally .

BP ’s oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is without a doubt former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s Katrina .
President George W. Bush and Cheney consistently catered to Big Oil and other special interests to undercut renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives that would set the United States on a more secure clean energy path .
Oil companies raked in record profits while benefitting from policies they wrote for themselves .
These energy policies did nothing for our national security and left consumers to pay the price at the pump and on their energy bills , which rose more than $ 1,100 during the Bush administration .
The following timeline outlines the administration ’s direction , consequent legislative steps and missteps , and the resulting circumstances that provided advantages to Big Oil companies and led to the establishment of a regulatory system that created the BP oil disaster .
2001
Cheney ’s secret dirty energy task force crafts national energy policy .
The Bush administration released the National Energy Policy Report on May 16 .
President Bush appointed Vice President Cheney — who gave up his title as CEO of oil and gas company Halliburton to take on his new role — with developing a new energy policy swiftly after taking office .
But Cheney ’s relationship with Halliburton did not end .
Cheney was kept on the company ’s payroll after retirement and retained around 430,000 shares of Halliburton stock .
The task force report was based on recommendations provided to Cheney from coal , oil , and nuclear companies and related trade groups — many of which were major contributors to Bush ’s presidential campaign and to the Republican Party .
Oil companies — including BP , the National Mining Association , and the American Petroleum Institute — secretly met with the Cheney and his staff as part of a task force to develop the country ’s energy policy .
The proposal clearly represented the interests of dirty industry , including opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and encouraging oil and gas production , coal output , and the development of biofuels and nuclear power .
Only 7 of the 105 recommendations in the plan involved renewable energy .
Cheney ’s task force report proposed funding the development of clean energy technologies by opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling and earmarking $ 1.2 billion of bid bonuses from leases in ANWR .
The administration was clearly not serious about ending our addiction to oil .
Less than two months earlier the president proposed cutting millions from renewable energy programs .
The New York Times reported at the time that , “ The plan does little for efficiency or renewable energy . ”
Renewable energy budget cuts .
Bush released the fiscal year 2002 budget on April 9 that included steep cuts for clean energy research and development : “ Solar and renewable energy R&D would drop by more than a third ; nuclear energy R&D would be almost halved ; and energy conservation R&D would fall by nearly 25 percent . ”
House energy bill includes $ 33.5 billion in tax breaks for dirty energy .
The House of Representatives on August 2 passed the Securing America ’s Future Energy Act , H.R. 4 .
This special - interest energy bill included $ 33.5 billion in tax breaks and other incentives over 10 years for the power industry aimed at increasing oil and gas exploration , developing new coal - burning technologies , and promoting nuclear energy .
The bill also opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas exploration , a top Bush administration priority .
The bill reflected White House priorities laid out in the 2001 plan .
An amendment by Reps. Sherwood Boehlert ( R- NY ) and Ed Markey ( D - MA ) to raise fuel efficiency standards for sport utility vehicles and other light trucks was defeated .
2002
Senate clean energy bill fails .
The Senate began acting on a bill proposed in a previous Congress that would have raised fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks and included more incentives for energy conservation and alternative fuels , but no Arctic Refuge drilling .
The bill passed the Senate but was not reconciled with the House bill that closely followed the Cheney dirty energy task force proposal .
Renewable energy budget cuts .
President Bush released his FY 2003 budget on February 4 , which devoted unprecedented funding for research and development at the Department of Defense and the National Institute of Health .
It meanwhile reduced research and development funding for biomass , geothermal , and solar energy programs .
2003
House energy bill includes $ 23.5 billion in tax breaks for dirty energy .
The House passed another oil industry handout energy bill , H.R. 6 , on March 11 that would allow oil and gas leasing in Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , let companies avoid federal royalty payments on natural gas taken from the Gulf of Mexico , and provide for expedited environmental impact studies .
The legislation would hand out $ 23.5 billion over 10 years in tax breaks to increase oil and gas production and $ 5.4 billion in subsidies and loan guarantees .
The Senate once again passed the 2002 energy bill .
The conference report to reconcile the two bills included the administration ’s dirty energy policies and did nothing for consumers or clean energy ; it was approved by the House but was blocked by a filibuster in the Senate .
Yet the Senate still approved billions of dollars in tax credits for the oil and gas , coal , and nuclear industries .
More renewable energy budget cuts .
President Bush ’s FY 2004 budget once again reduced funding for solar , wind , geothermal , and biomass totaling more than $ 25 million in cuts .
The fossil fuel budget increased around $ 10 million over 2003 levels .
2004
House passes bill allowing companies to build oil refineries in minority communities .
The United States Refinery Revitalization
Act passed the House on June 16 , but was never made into law .
The bill would have made it easier to build or expand oil refineries in areas that the League of United Latin American Citizens argued are “ heavily minority populated and already disproportionately impacted by refineries and other industries . ”
The League and the National Hispanic Environmental Council opposed the bill because of such environmental justice issues .
2005
More renewable energy budget cuts .
President Bush ’s FY 2006 budget once again cut energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy by about 4 percent ; cuts totaled nearly $ 50 million .
Energy bill includes $ 27 billion for dirty energy .
President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on August 8 .
The bill closely resembled Cheney ’s 2001 plan and gave $ 27 billion to coal , oil and gas , and nuclear , and only $ 6.4 billion for renewable energy .
Amendments in the House and Senate to raise fuel efficiency standards for vehicles failed .
Amendments in the House to remove provisions limiting state and local roles in the siting of oil refineries also failed , as did measures to ensure environmental justice for minority and low - income communities .
Senate amendments requiring a renewable energy standard of 10 percent by 2020 and addressing global warming through mandatory limits on carbon emissions were dropped during conference .
Regulations permit oil and gas industry to regulate itself .
The Interior Department ’s Minerals Management Service — the agency responsible for managing oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf and collecting royalties from companies — decided in 2005 that oil companies , rather than the government , were in the best position to determining their operations ’ environmental impacts .
This meant that there was no longer any need for an environmental impact analysis for deepwater drilling , though an earlier draft stated that such drilling experience was limited .
In fact , MMS “ repeatedly ignored warnings from government scientists about environmental risks in its push to approve energy exploration activities quickly , according to numerous documents and interviews . ”
And an interior general analysis even found that between 2005 and 2007 MMS officials let the oil industry to fill out their own inspection reports .
2006
Bush : “ America is addicted to oil . ” President Bush states in the State of the Union Address on January 31 that , “ America is addicted to oil . ”
A House - passed bill allows drilling in Arctic Refuge .
The House passed the American - Made Energy and Good Jobs Act on May 25 , which would open oil leases on the coastal strip of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — an area of 1.5 million acres .
The Arctic Refuge development was once again blocked in the Senate because drilling proponents were unable to muster the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster .
More budget cuts for renewable energy .
President Bush ’s 2007 FY budget cut funding for energy conservation by 6.3 percent to $ 289 million and stopped funding for the geothermal program — although Congress later restored some of this geothermal funding .
2007
Government agency failed to collect more than $ 865 million in revenues .
Investigators from the Interior Department determined that a “ top Interior Department official was told nearly three years ago about a legal blunder that allowed drilling companies to avoid billions of dollars in payments for oil and gas pumped from publicly owned waters . ”
The report found that the Minerals Management Service could have could have collected $ 865 million in the previous three years alone .
Budget cuts for renewable energy .
President Bush ’s fiscal year 2008 budget proposed to cut research funds for efficiency and renewable energy by 16 percent , eliminate them for geothermal energy , and leave funding for solar stagnant .
Bush administration opposes expansion of renewable energy .
President Bush also threatened to veto the Energy Independence and Security Act because it included a renewable electricity standard and renewable energy tax credits funded by the elimination of many tax subsidies for major oil companies totaling approximately $ 13 billion .
Congress eliminated these provisions from the bill , which President Bush then signed .
Bush blocked a request the same day he signed the bill from California and a dozen other states that wanted to adopt global warming pollution standards that would have enhanced fuel economy and saved oil .
2008
Budget cuts for renewable energy .
President Bush proposes a 27 percent cut for Department of Energy efficiency and renewable energy programs in the FY 2008 budget .
Bush administration opposes expansion of renewable energy .
President Bush opposed House passage of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act , H.R. 5351 , as advised on February 28 .
Bush lifts moratorium on offshore drilling .
Bush lifted the executive moratorium on offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts on July 14 .
This moratorium was put in place in 1990 by Pres. George H.W. Bush .
Bush then called on Congress to lift its own annual ban on drilling , as John McCain embraced “ drill , baby , drill ” that year .
Government agency accepted gifts and engaged in fraternizing and illicit activities .
A June 2008 interior general report found that Minerals Management Service officials accepted gifts , engaged in drug use and illicit sex with employees from energy firms , and showed favoritism in handling contracts .
Gasoline prices soared to more than $ 4.00 per gallon , and oil set an all - time record high price of $ 147 per barrel in July 2008 .

I find it fascinating when I hear someone state that “ Scrum does n’t work ” or that it is n’t all that it is advertised to be , particularly in organizations that have embraced and adopted Agile / Scrum development .
It ’s always worth exploring why that person feels the way he or she does , particularly if Scrum is n’t working for a software development project .
If a lightweight process like Scrum is n’t working , you ’re seeing the fragile side of Agile .
It ’s all too easy to read about Agile development and listen to people like me – I ’m an optimist by nature – champion the wonders of Agile development and how it will improve your development universe .
While Agile sounds simple on paper , a proper implementation requires a deep understanding , discipline , and organizational support .
And even if you get it right initially , it 's easy to go astray .
I embrace Agile / Scrum development because I am firmly convinced that it addresses many of the problems that plague software development along with providing working professionals with the autonomy that they should have in the first place .
If something is n’t working , most likely it is n’t the process that is at fault .
I ’d wager that there is an implementation or execution problem .
We ’ve implemented Scrum at my company , and we ’ve been fairly successful with the basics to date .
Unfortunately , I keep hearing and reading about other organizations that are failing on the basics , hindering their successful adoption of Agile / Scrum .
This is the classic ScrumBut problem of , “ We ’re doing Scrum , but … ”
We do n’t have a product owner .
We do n’t have a product backlog .
We do n’t bother with daily standup meetings .
We ’re not doing ... some fundamental activity that is and should be a part of the Scrum process .
I ’ve witnessed the benefits of Agile / Scrum , seeing teams improve productivity , reduce overtime , and generally enjoy their day .
But we have experienced problems as well .
A common problem is that teams will implement the mechanics of Scrum in the context of old habits .
In the software world , functional specialties become the focal point : analysts create the requirements , developers develop the software , and QA tests the software once development is “ done . ”
Functional hand - offs turn Agile projects into a series of “ mini- waterfall ” efforts – bypassing the collective , collaborative aspects that Agile development brings to the table to boost productivity .
The risk with this approach is that the User Stories may be in various stages of completion at the end of the sprint , but are n’t “
Even when teams are collaborating well , they sometimes take on more work than they should .
This problem surfaces in different ways .
Many organizations struggle with implementing the basics .
Jeff Sutherland has spoken frequently about the Nokia Test and how upwards to 80 % of teams that claim to be doing Scrum do n’t perform the basics ( some do n’t even know who the product owner is , let alone have a prioritized backlog ) .

This problem surfaces in different ways .
Teams fail to track their velocity – skimping on an important aspect of Scrum – and then continually misjudge their capacity to take on work and end up committing to more User Stories in a sprint than they should .
Teams start work on too many stories at the beginning of the sprint instead of focusing on the high - priority stories , possibly feeling external pressure to get a set amount of work done in a specific time frame .
This again leads to ending with User Stories in various stages of completeness , none of which qualify as finished .
Vancouver , Canada –
On day three of the International Trade Union Confederation ’s Congress the delegates , from trade union federation ’s around the world , including the American Federation of Labor – Congress of Industrial Organizations ( AFL - CIO ) , took a break from their deliberations to rally for jobs and a just economy for workers .
In a spirited demonstration outside the Vancouver Convention Center , speakers called for more action and street heat for jobs , taxes on the banks and financial institutions , re-regulation of financial markets , restoring public services , and defending labor rights , including the right to organize and the right to strike .
They further demanded a reordering of global priorities , away from war and towards peaceful green development and meeting human needs instead of corporate greed .

For example , a small XOOPS installation can be used as a personal weblog or journal , but this can be expanded upon and customized , for example users might add the appropriate modules to store content in news , forums , downloads , and more .
The cross marks the location of the black hole Cygnus X - 1 in this radio image .
The bright region to the left ( east ) of the black hole is a dense cloud of gas existing in the space between the stars , the interstellar medium .
A huge invisible bubble surrounds a well - studied black hole , scientists have just learned .
The cavity is carved from space by the activity of the black hole itself and was detected with a radio telescope .
Other space bubbles have been spotted , excavated by exploded stars and by supermassive black holes that anchor entire galaxies .
The most recent discovery is unique because it involves a stellar black hole , one that resulted from the collapse of a dead star here in our Milky Way .
The bubble is formed by a jet of material streaming from the black hole at very high speeds .
Since this type of black hole is common , the finding suggests scientists have been " severely underestimating how much power black holes pump back into the universe , " said the astronomers who announced the finding last week in the journal Nature .
" We already knew that supermassive black holes at the centers of other galaxies produce enormous amounts of energy , " said study leader Elena Gallo of the University of Amsterdam .
" But this finding proves that something similar is happening in our backyard . "
Vast impact
The jet of energetic particles moves at a significant fraction of light - speed .
" This jet travels up to more than 15 light - years from the black hole , at which point its pressure is balanced by the pressure of the surrounding interstellar gas , " Gallo told SPACE.com .
" There the jet starts to inflate a bubble with energy and particles .
As the bubble expands sideways it creates a shock - compressed " hollow sphere " which gives rise to the observed emission . "
Those observations involve a ring of radio emissions around a two - object system known as Cygnus X - 1 , in which a black hole 10 times the mass of our Sun is orbited by another star .
The setup is about 6,000 light - years away .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion kilometers ) .
Black holes can't be seen because they swallow light and everything else that gets too close .
But matter and energy in the black hole 's vicinity can escape in dramatic fashion .
Material orbits the black hole and is lured inward by gravity .
But as with all black holes , mealtime is messy .
Some of the matter is kicked outward instead by intense magnetic fields .
And some is converted to energy , emitted as X - rays and other wavelengths .
Scientists are still trying to understand the exact mechanisms behind all this output .
Powerful finding
The newfound bubble is about 10 light - years across and is expanding at about 225,000 mph ( 100 kilometers per second ) .
Its creation has been ongoing for a million years or so .
Astronomers are excited about the disovery because it is impossible to measure directly the power of jets like this one .
By noting the interaction at the bubble , however , the researchers were able to calculate the jet 's power .
The jet packs about 100,000 times more energy than our Sun .
" Remarkably , it also means that , after a massive star dies and turns into a black hole , it is still capable of energizing its surroundings , by means of completely different mechanisms , " Gallo said .
Astronomers suspect there are millions of black holes similar to Cygnus X - 1 .
" We knew about jets from black holes and expected to discover some interaction of the jet 's energy with the gas in our Milky Way , but the size and energy content of this bubble came as a surprise , " said study co-author Christian Kaiser of the University of Southampton in the UK .
The observations were made with the Dutch Westerbork radio telescope .
