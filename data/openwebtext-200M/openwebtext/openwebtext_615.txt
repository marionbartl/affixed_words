NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Financial institutions ran to their lender of last resort for record amounts of cash in the latest week , under extreme pressure from the worst global financial crisis in a generation , Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday .
Banks and dealers ’ overall direct borrowings from the Fed averaged a record $ 437.53 billion per day in the week ended October 15 , topping the previous week ’s $ 420.16 billion per day .
Some analysts are concerned that banks ’ dependence on Fed lending might become long term and difficult to change .
“ The banking system is going to become addicted to this very cheap money .
Unwinding it will be very difficult , ” said Howard Simons , strategist with Bianco Research in Chicago .
“ We have effectively allowed the central banks to disintermediate the banking system .
Why would I want to borrow from you if I could do it with the central bank , because they can always print it up and say ‘ here ’ ... and they are in the business now of making sure I stay in business , ” Simons said .
Primary credit discount window borrowings averaged a record $ 99.66 billion per day in the latest week , up from $ 75.0 billion per day the previous week .
Primary dealer and other broker dealer borrowings were $ 133.87 billion as of October 15 , versus $ 122.94 billion on October 8 .
“ Other credit extensions ” , mostly reflecting loans to insurer AIG , were $ 82.86 billion as of October 15 , versus $ 70.30 billion as of October 8 .
The Fed ’s lending to banks to enable them to purchase asset - backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds was $ 122.76 billion as of October 15 , versus $ 139.48 billion on October 8 .
Proceeds from the U.S. Treasury ’s sales of Treasury bills in the Fed ’s supplementary financing account , which are helping to fund the Fed ’s support of financial institutions , were $ 499.13 billion as of October 15 , versus $ 459.25 billion as of October 8 .
A 24 - year - old man suspected of attempting to burglarize a home on Friday was captured by the homeowner , who also is a detention officer , according to the Mesa Police Department .
Scott
Boe told police he was in the home because he needed to use a power outlet to charge his cell phone but that he did not have permission to be there , according to police reports .
The homeowners found the suspect in the home in the 1900 block of East Fifth Avenue when they returned .
The suspect attempted to flee but was restrained by the homeowner , according to police .
Inside the home police found the suspect 's backpack containing several knives , a large pry tool and other tools that are used in burglaries .
Boe , who told police he uses illegal drugs , was booked on one count of second - degree burglary and one count of possession of burglary tools .
What is the difference between hard money and soft money ?
Or between Medicare and Medicaid ?
These are just a few of the many well - used - but often misunderstood - terms in US politics .
A - C A Air war
The battle between candidates to get as much advertising on television and radio as possible .
B Balancing the ticket
When a candidate has won his or her party 's presidential nomination , he or she is then obliged to pick a " running - mate " , who - if the pair win the election - will become vice - president .
The two candidates are then often referred to as " the ticket " .
Candidates are often advised to pick a running - mate who " balances the ticket " - that is , one whose qualities make up for the candidate 's perceived weaknesses .
So in 2000 , George W Bush - who was thought to be relatively young and inexperienced - selected veteran Republican operator Dick Cheney .
And in 2004 , John Kerry , a New England liberal , picked John Edwards , a southerner with a populist streak .
Ballot initiative A number of US states allow for a procedure known as a ballot initiative , whereby citizens are able to draw up a petition for a proposed change in the law , which - if it gathers enough signatures - is placed before voters in a referendum .
If the change is approved by the voters it then becomes law .
Sometimes , political parties may organise ballot initiatives on controversial issues in an attempt to drive up turnout among their core supporters .
For example , in 2004 , a number of states held referendums on Republican - initiated ballot initiatives to ban gay marriage .
Ballot initiatives are sometimes referred to as " ballot measures " or " propositions " .
Bellwether state A state which , historically , tends to vote for the winning candidate , perhaps because it is - demographically - a microcosm of the country as a whole .
The classic example of a bellwether state is Missouri , which has voted for the winner in every US presidential election since 1904 - except 1956 .
The term derives from the name for a sheep which shepherds would fit with a bell .
By listening out for this sheep , the bellwether , shepherds were able to locate the position of the entire flock .
Beltway An American term for the orbital highway or ring - road that often surrounds major cities .
In political reporting the term generally refers to congressional business undertaken inside the highway surrounding Washington DC - Interstate 495 .
For example , " a beltway issue " refers to a political issue or debate considered to be of importance only to the political class and of little interest to the general public .
Alternatively , those considered to have a " beltway mentality " are seen as being out of touch with the ordinary voters elsewhere in the country .
Bill of rights
The collective term for the first 10 amendments of the US constitution establishing the fundamental rights of individual citizens .
The amendments act as a mutually reinforcing set of rights and limit the powers of federal and state governments .
Acts of Congress or laws ruled to be in conflict with these rights - and therefore unconstitutional - may be declared void by the US Supreme Court .
The Bill of Rights arose because only a very few individual rights were specified in the original main body of the constitution .
Blue state A state where people tend to vote for the Democratic Party .
Brokered convention
If a single candidate for a party 's presidential nomination does not obtain the majority of the votes during the primary and caucus process , or during the first round of voting of the party convention , the convention is described as brokered .
The nomination is decided through further ballots .
There may also be an element of political horse - trading behind closed doors , where a deal is done to nominate a candidate and the brokers of the deal urge their supporters to support this candidate in the next ballot .
Buckley vs Valeo
The 1976 Supreme Court decision allowing unlimited spending by individuals or groups who are not standing for election themselves but who wish to support or oppose particular candidates .
The provision does not apply to contributions made by corporations or unions and rules that in any donor situation there must be no co-ordination or consultation with any candidate .
The court 's decision in effect overruled two major parts of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign
Act which imposed mandatory spending limits on all federal races , and limited independent spending on behalf of federal candidates .
The court ruled that such restrictions violated an individual 's First Amendment rights to freedom of expression .
The subsequent rise in " soft money " campaign contributions and " issue ads " led to growing concerns about corruption and the influence of pressure groups in federal election campaigns , culminating in the McCain - Feingold legislation of 2002 .
C Capitol
The seat of Congress in Washington DC .
The Capitol , constructed largely of white marble , is home to both the Senate and House of Representatives as well as various committee and hearing rooms and an art gallery .
The steps of the Capitol building are traditionally the stage for the formal inauguration of presidents in the January following an election year .
The building 's famous white dome is crowned with a statue of Freedom .
Most states have their own capitol buildings in the state capital , many of which have a similar design to the building in Washington .
Caucus
A private meeting of party members designed to seek agreement on delegates for a state or national nominating convention based on which candidate they wish to support .
Participants in presidential caucus meetings generally elect delegates to county conventions who in turn , at a later date , choose delegates for a state or local congressional convention .
The delegates selected are not bound , but usually follow the wishes of caucus - goers .
It is at these later meetings that the delegates will usually be chosen for the party 's national nominating convention at which the presidential candidate will be declared .
Critics of the caucus system argue that its laborious nature tends to mean it is dominated by political activists , unrepresentative of popular feeling , who will nominate candidates with little real chance of winning .
Just under a dozen states use the system - the number is different according to party .
Citizens United A 2010 Supreme Court ruling that overturned aspects of the McCain - Feingold Act on the use of corporate and union money in elections .
In a controversial 5 - 4 decision , the Supreme Court ruled that corporations should be viewed the same way as individuals in terms of their First Amendment right to free speech .
Using that rationale , it overturned a ban on corporate and union spending on " electioneering communications " - that is , advertisements broadcast within 60 days of a general election ( or 30 days for primary elections ) , which explicitly mention the name of a candidate .
Now , unions and corporations will be able to directly advertise , right up until election day , as long as they have n't co-ordinated their advertisements with a candidate 's campaign .
The ruling maintained the McCain - Feingold Act 's ban on corporations and unions directly donating to candidates and political parties , as well as the requirement for ads to disclose their funding sources .
Cloture
The procedure to place a time limit on consideration of a bill in the US Senate is known as a cloture .
Under this procedure , the Senate may limit consideration of a pending matter to 30 additional hours , but only by 60 votes of the full ( 100 - member ) Senate .
The use of a cloture thus prevents a filibuster - an attempt to infinitely extend debate upon a proposal by making a never - ending speech .
Commander in chief
The constitutional role granted to the president as head of the United States ' armed forces .
Under Article III of the constitution the president is given authority to lead " the army and the navy of the United States and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the United States . "
No president since James Madison in the War of 1812 has personally led troops into battle .
Congress forms the law - making or legislative branch of the US Government as prescribed in Article I , Section I of the US constitution .
It is made up of two houses - the 435 - member House of Representatives and 100 - member Senate - each of which officially has equal power , if not prestige .
A congressional period lasts two years ( or sessions ) and begins at noon on 3 January of odd - numbered years .
As well as drafting and implementing laws , Congress can also : investigate matters of public concern ;
oversee federal agencies and their programmes ;
declare war ;
approve and ratify treaties ;
regulate commerce ;
increase and decrease taxes ;
print and appropriate money ;
confirm / approve judicial and federal appointments and nominations ;
impeach federal officials including the president and vice - president ;
and override presidential vetoes based on a two - thirds majority in each chamber .
Congressman / woman
This term is most often used to refer to a member of the House of Representatives , but it can be used to refer to a member of either of the Houses of Congress - the House of Representatives or the Senate .
Constitution of the United States
The fundamental law of the US federal system of government , the US constitution defines the principal organs of government , their jurisdictions and the basic rights of citizens .
It is upheld as the supreme law of the land , meaning all federal and state laws , executive actions and judicial decisions must be consistent with it .
The US constitution is the oldest written national constitution in operation .

A chef was found guilty today of murdering a boyfriend before carving flesh from his thigh , seasoning it with fresh herbs , frying it in olive oil and chewing a section .
Former Mr Gay UK Anthony Morley , 36 , from Bexley Place , Leeds , slashed Damian Oldfield 's throat before stabbing him multiple times and cutting sections of flesh from his body .
Morley , who was in bed with 33 - year - old Mr Oldfield at the time of the murder in April , later walked into a nearby takeaway wearing a bloodstained dressing gown and flipflops and told staff he had killed someone because he tried to rape him .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A jury at Leeds Crown Court took just two hours and 20 minutes to find him guilty of murder .
Members of the packed public gallery cheered and applauded as the verdict was read out .
Morley clasped his hands and bowed his head and several jury members left the court in tears .
During the two - week trial , the court heard how Morley carved sections of flesh from Mr Oldfield 's thigh and chest , including the nipple .
He left a Lloyds TSB bank card over the wound on his victim 's chest .
Police searching the house later found a chopping board with six pieces of human flesh , cooked so they were raw in the middle and browned on the edges .
A bundle of fresh herbs , a knife used to chop them , some olive oil and a dish of seeds were found on the work surface near the cooker and a frying pan was on the hob with the remnants of fried herbs and oil in it .
The murder was described to the jury as " terrible , horrific and bizarre " .
The court heard that Morley and Mr Oldfield , who sold advertising space in gay lifestyle magazine Bent , had previously had a relationship of some kind but that Morley was confused about his sexuality .
Morley was the first winner of the Mr Gay UK title in 1993 but he had a girlfriend at the time .
On the day of the murder , the two men met in Leeds before later going back to Morley 's house , where he cooked openly gay Mr Oldfield a meal .
The pair , who had both been drinking , kissed and cuddled and went upstairs to his bedroom to watch a DVD of the film Brokeback Mountain in bed .
The court heard that sexual activity took place between the two men before Morley launched his attack .

He claimed he could not remember killing Mr Oldfield or his following actions and denied murder on the grounds of provocation or diminished responsibility .
Judge James Stewart QC said he would sentence Morley on Monday .
After the verdict , Mr Oldfield 's mother , Denise , said in a statement : " We shared a special bond , which I can still feel , but now I 'm only left with memories and that 's not good enough .
" Damian loved life and he has had that taken away from him in the cruellest of circumstances .
" He was so easy going and friendly that to know Damian for five minutes was to know Damian as a friend .
" Damian always made a big impression on those who knew him and I have been very touched by all the messages that have been left on the Gone Too Soon and Facebook websites .
" It 's testament to Damian 's popularity that school friends as well those who knew Damian more recently have left messages . "
Mrs Oldfield continued : " Damian will be sadly missed by all those who knew and loved him .
" Gran , older brother Craig and sister - in - law Tracy , as well as all his nieces and nephews , will miss his smile and his company . "
Detective Inspector Scott Wood , of the Homicide and Major Inquiry Team of West Yorkshire Police , praised Mr Oldfield 's family for their dignity throughout the investigation and trial .
He said : " Thankfully disturbing crimes of this type remain incredibly rare events .
" None of the investigation team has been involved in a crime of this nature before . "
Hydrogen sulphide is behind the smell of rotten eggs
The gas best known for being used in many stink bombs may also control blood pressure , say US researchers .
Small amounts of hydrogen sulphide - a toxic gas generated by bacteria living in the human gut - are responsible for the foul odour of flatulence .
But it seems the gas is also produced by an enzyme in blood vessels where it relaxes them and lowers blood pressure .
The findings in mice may lead to new treatments for high blood pressure , the Science journal reported .
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University , in Maryland , found that the gas is produced in the cells lining blood vessels by an enzyme called CSE .
We know hydrogen sulphide is not good for us at high levels but it seems that at the lower levels in the body it is essential
Professor Amrita Ahluwalia
In mice engineered to be deficient in this enzyme , levels of hydrogen sulphide were almost depleted compared with levels in normal mice .
The CSE - deficient mice also had blood pressure measurements about 20 % higher than the normal mice , comparable to serious hypertension in humans .
When the engineered mice were given a drug which relaxes normal blood vessels - methacholine - there was no difference , indicating the gas is responsible for the relaxation .
Treatments
Another gas , nitric oxide , is already known to be involved in control of blood pressure .
Researcher Dr Solomon Snyder said : " Now we know hydrogen sulphide 's role in regulating blood pressure , it may be possible to design drug therapies that enhance its formation as an alternative to the current methods of treatment for hypertension . "
Professor Amrita Ahluwalia , an expert in vascular pharmacology at Barts and The London Medical School , said : " This study shows that smelly hydrogen sulphide is also likely to have a role in regulating blood pressure and it will be a bit of an impetus for scientists to develop more specific tools to work out what 's going on .
" We know hydrogen sulphide is not good for us at high levels but it seems that at the lower levels in the body it is essential . "
Dr Allan MacDonald , a reader in pharmacology at Glasgow Caledonian University , said : " Treatments based on hydrogen sulphide could become important in a variety of cardiovascular diseases , " he said .

The well - known Double Violin Concerto in D minor , BWV 1043 is the basis of the transcription for this Concerto for two keyboards .
It was transposed down a tone to allow the top note E6 to be reached as D6 , the common top limit on harpsichords of the time .
In a keynote speech at the Broadband World Forum , John McMahon , President of Sony Pictures Television asked ISPs to join their battle against piracy .
McMahon further said that DRM is one of the major causes of piracy , but says Sony does n't have any plans to get rid of it .
Sony is following in the footsteps of established anti-piracy lobbyists .
The IFPI , for example , has been lobbying politicians to force ISPs to identify , filter , block and remove copyright infringing content from the Internet .
For their part , the RIAA has suggested similar measures for the upcoming Anti-Piracy Trade Agreement Wishlist ( ACTA ) .
Thus far , these attempts have n’t been particularly successful .
ISPs worldwide are refusing to cooperate , mainly because they feel such actions violate the privacy of their customers .
In addition , last week the Belgian ISP Scarlet – previously ordered to stop illegal file - sharing on its network – told the court that it is simply impossible for it to do so .
Nevertheless , Sony ’s John McMahon said in his keynote speech at the Broadband World Forum , that he would like ISPs and copyright owners to cooperate in order to reduce piracy .
According to McMahon , the entertainment industry is losing more than two billion dollars a year because of piracy , but he believes this number can be reduced significantly with the help of ISPs .
Interestingly , McMahon also said that customer frustration with DRM is one of the main reasons why people turn to file - sharing networks , instead of legal alternatives .
Sony recognizes , but at the same time ignores these signals from their customers , as they are not planning to get rid of DRM .
Instead , they are investing in a new and improved DRM , the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem ( DECE ) .
Click above for gallery of CARS photochopped by our readers
Consumers prefer cars to be angry - looking and dominant .
That 's the official word from a team at the University of Vienna after studying a group of male and female volunteers .
Each were asked to rate the design features on 38 passenger cars introduced between 2004 and 2006 .
After rating the vehicle 's physical traits , the researchers asked if the subjects saw " faces " ( it 's a phenomenon called " pareidolia " ) in the vehicles ' appearances .
Lastly , they asked participants which cars in the group they preferred .
Interestingly enough , the more a vehicle bore characteristics appearing mature , dominant , masculine , arrogant , and angry - looking , the better the research subjects liked the cars .
While the study did n't correlate actual sales figures with implied vehicle attitudes , it does add credence to the fact that emotion sways consumers towards certain models and adds yet another meaning to the familiar mid-cycle " facelift . "
The Linux Foundation - the non-profit consortium that gives Linus Torvalds his paycheck and facilitates the growth of Linux and Linux standards - has announced the first beta of the Linux Standard Base 4.0 .
There are many Linux variants , and they use different kernel releases and software libraries , depending on the technical preferences of the people putting together the distros .
Variety may be the spice of life , but it can cause compatibility issues if it is taken too far , and the LSB effort has established many years ago to provide a consistent set of specifications that allow the many distros to remain compatible despite their individual choices and , using LSB tools , to test operating system and application code to ensure that they adhere to the specs .
The Linux Foundation itself was formed in January 2007 to help remove some redundancies in the Linux development effort and to provide a single point of contact for those contributing to the Linux cause .
It does not , however , directly steer the development of Linux , says Ted T'so , chief platform strategist and a fellow at the Linux Foundation who is also the maintainer of the ext4 file system project related to Linux .
This is a common misconception , apparently .
The Linux Foundation is the result of the merger of Open Source Development Labs , an industry consortium established in 2000 by key IT vendors who wanted to get a hand in steering the development of Linux and other open source programs , and the Free Standards Group , the home of the Linux Standards Base , a specification that wants to keep Linux implementations from forking and to make it easier to ensure applications run across various Linuxes .
With the LSB 4.0 spec , a new tool is going to make it easier for independent software vendors to see just how portable their applications are thanks to the revised Linux Application Checker .
The new checker draws upon a framework created by researchers the Russian Academy of Sciences that can peer into application binaries and determine how it will run on LSB - certified Linuxes .
LSB 4.0 also has a specification for shell scripts that is intended to let scripts run across any of the popular shells out there , and it has a script checker that will show which scripts in a distro wo n't work if a different shell is used .
With LSB 4.0 , the software development kit is being decoupled from the specification , which means the SDK can evolve on its own schedule .
This also means the SDK is designed to build applications that adhere to LSB 3.0 , 3.1 , 3.2 , or 4.0 specs .
In other words , it 's not tied to a specific LSB release level .
According to T'so , all of the current Linux distributions are certified to the LSB 3.1 or 3.2 spec , but only a handful of Linux applications themselves have been certified .
" In the application space , people tend to want to use the very latest libraries , " explains T'so .
That means that application makers are often ahead of the LSB , which by its nature has to take a slower , more conservative approach since its goal is Linux compatibility , not speed or some other attribute of an application .
LSB compliance is , nonetheless , used as a proxy for application compliance , in that if a Linux application runs on one distribution , a vendor can be " reasonably confident " that it will be compatible with another LSB - certified Linux distro at the same compliance level .
But T'so and his compatriots at the Linux Foundation have higher hopes for LSB 4.0 .
" LSB 4.0 will be the first release where we have a critical mass of libraries together , which means more application vendors can and will certify . "
T'so says that the Linux Foundation hopes to have LSB 4.0 finalized by the end of the year and that as the major Linux distros put out their service packs and updates over the next two quarters or so , they will update their certifications for the spec .
Once LSB 4.0 is out , a dozen key applications will be certified right out of the box , and T'so says another 75 or so applications will be able to be certified with a minor change , such as a recompile or the move to a more modern server platform .
In total , the LSB Database Navigator shows 234 applications that are either ready or nearly ready for certification to the new spec .
You can download the LSB 4.0 beta specification , test suite , and developer tools at this link on the Linux Foundation site . ®

In the most lethal friendly - fire incident in more than a year , Afghan authorities said coalition forces accidentally bombed an Afghan army checkpoint Wednesday , killing nine soldiers and injuring three .
U.S. military officials acknowledged in a statement that American troops “ may have mistakenly killed or injured ” Afghan soldiers in Khowst province , southeast of the capital , Kabul .
The incident is under investigation , said Lt. Cmdr. Walter Matthews , a spokesman .
The airstrike took place before dawn as a U.S. convoy was returning to base from a nighttime mission .
The American statement suggested that the convoy had previously come under fire , saying it was “ involved in multiple engagements . ”
Friendly - fire incidents involving Afghan and Western forces are relatively rare .
Often , darkness is a contributing factor .

Sixteen months ago , U.S. troops on an overnight operation encountered an Afghan police patrol , which mistook them for Taliban fighters .
Seven Afghan police officers were killed in the resulting firefight , the last incident with such a high death toll .
Twice in the last month , Afghan police fired on American troops in apparently deliberate attacks that left two soldiers dead .
Insurgents are believed to have infiltrated some Afghan police units .
Mindful of tensions and mistrust that arise from such incidents , Western commanders have worked to improve coordination between the armies .
American troops have the lead role in training Afghan security forces .
The circumstances of Wednesday ’s strike suggest that U.S. troops might have been unaware of the presence of the Afghan army checkpoint , which had been in place on the main highway in the area for 10 days , according to Arsallah Jamal , the governor of Khowst .
He said Afghan soldiers had done nothing to provoke the attack .

“ One thing is very clear : The [ Afghan troops ] did not fire at the coalition forces , ” he said .
“ They tried to flash their vehicles ’ lights to show they were friendly forces , but unfortunately this did not work . ”
Jamal said he had received a condolence call from a ranking U.S. military official and had been told that a U.S. military delegation would carry out a thorough investigation .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , this is a pure accident , a technical mistake , ” he said .
The nine deaths were confirmed by Afghanistan ’s Defense Ministry .
A spokesman , Gen. Mohammed Zahir Azimi , said the airstrike took place about 2 a.m. in the Sayed Kheil district .
Elsewhere , U.S. forces said Wednesday that a Taliban leader , Mullah Ghafar , was killed in an airstrike Monday in Afghanistan ’s insurgent - ridden Helmand province .
Most regular Western troops in the province are British , but U.S. Special Forces often aid in tracking and targeting senior Taliban figures .

The U.S. military said Ghafar was identified as he was getting into a vehicle , which was then struck .
He was responsible for a number of attacks on Western forces in the south , the military said .
U.S. officials also reported that Sharif Agha , a Taliban commander suspected of masterminding suicide attacks and roadside bombings in the south , was killed Tuesday in Oruzgan province .
Oruzgan , which borders the volatile provinces of Helmand and Kandahar , has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days .
Local authorities said two days of clashes had left 35 insurgents and three Afghan police officers dead .
Western military officials later said Afghan and coalition forces had killed 55 militants Tuesday after being attacked by a large group of insurgents .

Also on Wednesday , three members of the U.S. - led coalition were killed by a roadside bomb in western Afghanistan .
A coalition announcement gave few details , Associated Press said .

A tornado of economic discontent is buffeting the nation , sending satisfaction with the country 's direction to a 35 - year low , George W. Bush 's approval rating below Richard Nixon 's worst – and Barack Obama , boosted by economic empathy , to his best - yet advantage in the presidential race .
Given the global economic crisis , a record 90 percent of registered voters say the country is seriously off on the wrong track , the most since this question first was asked in 1973 .
At 23 percent , Bush 's job approval rating has fallen below Nixon 's lowest ; it 's a point away from the lowest in 70 years of polling , set by Harry Truman in early 1952 .
Bush 's disapproval , meanwhile , is at an all - time record – 73 percent .
Click here for a PDF with charts and full questionnaire .
Powered chiefly by the public 's economic concerns , Obama leads John McCain by 10 points among likely voters , 53 - 43 percent , in this ABC News / Washington Post poll .
Though every race is different , no presidential candidate has come back from an October deficit this large in pre-election polls dating to 1936 .
Still , Obama 's lead depends upon a shift in basic partisanship that will need to stand the test of turnout come Nov. 4 .
And while movable voters – those who have n't definitely made up their minds – have inched down to 13 percent , that 's still more than enough to change the shape of the race .
Given the critical elements at play , attention to the contest is extraordinary .
Ninety - two percent of registered voters are following the election closely , 59 percent " very " closely – both mid-October records in ABC and ABC / Post pre-election polls back to 1988 .
WOE – Economic concerns are paramount .
Nearly nine in 10 registered voters are worried about the economy 's direction ; nearly seven in 10 are worried about their own family finances .
Fifty - five percent call the economy the single most important issue in their vote , with all other mentions in the single digits .
Reflecting these economic worries , just 44 percent of Americans are confident they 'll have enough money to carry them through retirement , down sharply from a high of 69 percent three years ago .
At the same time , the public 's economic concerns are long - running – consumer confidence hit a 22 - year - low back in May – and not directly related to the stock market crash .
As in the past , people are keeping the market in perspective ; just 16 percent say it 's hurt them " a great deal . "
( See separate analysis . )
As first evident in an ABC / Post poll three weeks ago , Obama holds the reins on economic woe .
Registered voters trust him over McCain to handle the economy by 53 - 37 percent .
Obama holds his largest lead yet , a remarkable 30 - point margin , in better understanding the economic problems Americans are having , 58 - 28 percent .
He leads McCain by about as much , 59 - 31 percent , in trust to help the middle class , and by 11 points on taxes , two prime points of contention in the last presidential debate .
WIND – The economy is not the only wind at Obama 's back .
McCain 's receiving blowback for what 's perceived as negative campaigning ; registered voters by 59 - 35 percent say he 's been mainly attacking Obama rather than addressing the issues .
Obama , by contrast , is seen by an even wider margin as issue - focused .
( See separate analysis . )
The issue advantage helps Obama another way ; among likely voters who say they care more about the candidates ' positions on the issues than their personal qualities he leads McCain by a huge 39 points , 68 - 29 percent .
McCain leads broadly among those who say personal qualities matter more , but there are fewer of them .
The debates also seem to have helped Obama ; 32 percent say they have a better opinion of him as a result of the two debates so far , vs. just 8 percent worse .
For McCain it 's 12 percent better , 26 percent worse .
Their third and final debate is Wednesday .
One apparent result of these factors is a drop in McCain 's favorability rating , to 52 percent , a loss of 7 points since the Republican convention ; 45 percent now see him unfavorably , a new high for McCain in polls since 1999 .
Obama 's rating , meanwhile , is 64 percent favorable , near its high and up 6 points in the same time frame .
Enthusiasm for McCain 's candidacy , never strong , has softened alongside his favorability rating .
Just 29 percent of his own supporters are " very enthusiastic " about his campaign , the fewest since August and down a sharp 17 points from his post - convention peak .
By contrast , 63 percent of Obama 's backers are very enthusiastic , steady since September .
McCain 's portrayal of Obama as a risky choice , further , is not resonating , and indeed may be backfiring .
By 55 - 45 percent registered voters see Obama as safe rather than risky ; by contrast , they divide 50 - 50 on whether McCain himself is safe or risky – down from 57 - 41 percent " safe " at McCain 's best on this measure in June .
Among other factors , part of this may relate to concerns about McCain 's age ; registered voters also divide 50 - 50 on whether they'd be comfortable with his taking office at age 72 , his weakest rating to date on this question .
It was 56 - 42 percent after his convention .
AMMUNITION – McCain 's not entirely out of ammunition .
Even with the aura of negativity they 've produced , there are some areas in which his criticisms have scored .
He 's moved closer on who 's more honest and trustworthy , 44 - 40 percent Obama - McCain ; that compares to a 47 - 36 percent Obama lead in an ABC / Post poll Sept. 22 .
McCain 's also moved up ( though still trails ) on who would better stand up to lobbyists and special interest groups – the " maverick " pitch – and he remains competitive on handling Iraq , terrorism and an unexpected crisis , all potential selling points if he can overcome the current dynamic .
Obama 's greatest vulnerability remains experience , but McCain 's failed to capitalize on it so far .
Despite McCain 's efforts , 54 percent say Obama has the experience it takes to serve effectively as president – a new high , albeit by a scant 2 points .
Still , 45 percent say Obama lacks adequate experience , a lot to lose on this most basic qualification .
Obama , though , has opened a 14 - point lead as the stronger leader ; maintains his broad advantage on bringing " needed change " to Washington ; and holds significant advantages in trust to handle health care , Social Security and – notably – taxes , another point they 've sharply debated .
Forty - five percent think their taxes would go up under Obama , but about as many , 42 percent , think they 'd go up under McCain , too .
In terms of basic approach to governance , registered voters by 47 - 38 percent see a bigger risk that McCain would put in too few regulations than Obama putting in too many .
And 47 percent are concerned McCain would do too much to represent the interests of large business corporations , up 6 points from June .
Just 14 percent , meanwhile , think Obama would do too much to represent the interests of African - Americans .
And , in contrast with concerns about McCain 's age , 91 percent say they 're comfortable with the idea of Obama being the first African - American president .
BUSH AND PARTY ID – Another way to look at the challenge facing McCain is via the shadow of George W. Bush .
Fifty - one percent of registered voters think McCain as president would lead the nation in the same direction as the profoundly unpopular Bush – as persistent a problem for McCain as experience has been for Obama .
Among likely voters who approve of Bush , McCain 's supported by 91 percent – but there are precious few of them .
Those who disapprove of Bush , meanwhile , favor Obama over McCain by a 70 - 25 percent margin .
All else equal , to pull into the barest lead over Obama , McCain needs to boost his share of Bush disapprovers to 38 percent or more .
Other measures of discontent underscore the challenge .
Among likely voters who say the country 's off on the wrong track , Obama has a 16 - point lead ; ditto among those who are worried about the economy 's direction .
And among those who cite the economy as their top voting issue he leads McCain by 61 - 34 percent .
Long - running dissatisfaction with Bush ( he has n't seen majority approval in 45 months , a record by far ) , the Iraq war and the economy has prompted a flight from the Republican Party .
On average in 2003 , for the first time since ABC News started polling in 1981 , equal numbers of Americans identified themselves as Democrats and Republicans .
That 's turned around ; on average this year there 's been a 10 - point advantage in Democratic self - identification .
Specifically among likely voters , this poll finds a 9 - point advantage for the Democrats – 39 percent identify themselves as Democrats , 30 percent as Republicans , the rest as independents or something else .
If that holds on Election Day it 'll be a departure from turnout in presidential elections since 1984 , in which Democrats have held at most a 4 - point edge .
But given the level of current discontent with Bush , and the overall trend in party identification the last five years , it could .
One factor that 's tended to help Republicans is the fact that the country is more center - right than center - left ideologically ; on average , half again as many voters call themselves conservatives as liberals .
But McCain nonetheless places less well than Obama does : Just 39 percent of registered voters call McCain " about right " ideologically , compared with 55 percent for Obama .
A key reason is that 47 percent of moderates call McCain too conservative , more than the 29 percent who call Obama too liberal .
GROUPS – A note of caution in this election is the unusual movability in key swing groups – especially , again , independents , white Catholics and married women , all of which at various points have moved markedly in vote preference .
Obama now leads by 10 points among independents , 51 - 41 percent , and runs a competitive 51 - 46 percent against McCain among married women .
White Catholics , however , favor McCain by 54 - 41 percent – worth watching , as they 've backed the winner in each of the last eight presidential elections .
Obama makes it back , perhaps surprisingly , among non-evangelical white Protestants ; normally a Republican group , they now tilt toward the Democrat – for the first time in ABC / Post polls this cycle – by 53 - 44 percent .
Among all white voters , McCain leads Obama by 7 points , 52 - 45 percent ; that , however , is a bit less than the average Republican advantage among whites in presidential elections .
Obama makes it back with 95 percent of blacks , as well as clear majority support among Hispanics .
There 's a big gender gap .
McCain and Obama are even among men ; among women , who are more apt to be Democrats , Obama holds an 18 - point lead , tying his biggest of the campaign .
And Obama holds his best support to date , 81 percent , among sought - after Clinton Democrats – Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents who preferred Hillary Clinton for the nomination .
Again , though , there are the movables , disproportionately likely to include some of the swing groups – 20 percent of white Catholics and 22 percent of independents .
Movables may be a hard sell ; while they could change their minds , half say it 's " pretty unlikely . "
But movable they are , and until they settle , McCain may be down – but not out .

Google claims to be able to answer any question you can throw at it – but it obviously was n’t prepared for Prince Philip when he visited Google ’s London headquarters with Queen Liz the other day .
The Google staff were all prepared for the Royal drop in , the products were all ready and everyone had their lines all memorized .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Obviously they forgot about the 87 year old Duke , who apparently has a very big interest in technology and who has a habit of asking a lot of questions .
When the Google staff started showing him Google Earth and satellite shots of Buckingham Palace , Phil decided he would much rather want to see an image of the Google offices instead .
He then asked “ You DO know where it is , do n’t you ? ”
So the staff started clicking to find their own building – only to find out that the building was not there because the satellite images were taken before the offices were built !
So the red - faced Google employees had to try to explain this to the Duke who looked rather bemused by the whole thing .
But to give Google credit , they rapidly moved on by showing Liz and Phil a YouTube video of a laughing baby :
The Queen thought it most amusing .
“ Lovely little thing , is n’t it ? ” she said to Phil .
“ Amazing a child would laugh like that . ”
But Phil did n’t hear her – he was out in the street trying to figure out why Google Earth could n’t see the building from the air ( “ has Google made the building invisible ?
It ’s the only explanation !
BLOODY MARVELLOUS ! ” )
Oh , and for those who did n’t get it , that last part was a joke by the way !
So the story of Sarah Palin spending $ 150,000 on clothes ?
Brother , it gets better .
See , the RNC is required by law to list who exactly bought all the fancy clothes .
And all the Sarah Palin fancy purchases — at Barney 's , Bloomingdale's , and Saks Fifth Avenue — were made by one guy : Jeff Larson .
Jeff Larson is one of the men behind FLS Connect , a Republican robocalling firm !
They 're famous this cycle for terrible robocalls about Barack Obama and Bill Ayers .
And back in 2000 , they made their name with robocalls smearing John McCain .
It 's funny because John McCain sold his soul and all it got him was a fancy new wardrobe for Sarah Palin .

Dr. Phil is Sued For Fraud and Defamation
I know this title sounds shocking and downright crazy but .... the ever so sweetis being sued by the memorabilia dealer , who recently got his 15 minutes of fame via the O.J. Simpson trial .
The " dealer " was the one who took O.J. by the hand and led him straight to the hotel room where the fateful crime took place .
Poor O.J.!
The reason that Riccio is suing the miracle doctor is because during an interview on the Dr. Phil Show , Thomas claims that his words were spliced to change their meaning .
What ?
Not Dr. Phil .
Riccio said he would not have appeared on the talk show if he would have known that his character would be questioned .
The show called him a " a shady deal - maker " and " a puppet master who would sell his soul for coin " .
People sell their souls for coins all the time .
How many coins are we talking ?
O.J. Simpson was found guilty of all 12 counts and is going away for a long time .
Dr. Phil seems to be having his character questioned on a regular basis .
Who can forget how he rushed to Britney Spears side when she was being held on a 5150 in early 2008 ?
His big plans were dashed as the Spears family saw right through his ploy .
Does that sound like a man who would do harm to others for the good of his wallet ?
We think so !

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - A
Thai video game distributor halted sales of “ Grand Theft Auto ” on Monday after a teenager confessed to robbing and murdering a taxi driver while trying to recreate a scene from the controversial game .

“ We are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games , ” Sakchai Chotikachinda , sales and marketing director of New Era Interactive Media , told Reuters .
“ We are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service , ” Sakchai said .
An 18 - year - old high school student , now in custody pending further investigations and a trial , faces death by lethal injection if found guilty of robbing and killing a 54 - year - old taxi driver with a knife at the weekend .
Police said the youth , an obsessive player of “ Grand Theft Auto ” , showed no sign of mental problems during questioning and had confessed to committing the crime because of the game .
“ He said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game , ” chief police investigator Veeravit Pipattanasak told Reuters .
The youth , described by his parents as polite and diligent , was arrested late on Saturday after he was found trying to steer a cab backwards out of a Bangkok street with the severely wounded driver in the back seat , newspapers reported .
The suspect told police he did not mean to kill the driver , whom he had chosen as a possible victim because of his age , but that he stabbed him to death when he fought back , newspapers reported .
“ Grand Theft Auto ” , now available in its fourth edition , has been criticized for depicting violence including beatings , carjackings , drive - by shootings , drunk driving and prostitution .
A senior official at Thailand ’s Culture Ministry said the murder was a wake - up call for authorities to tackle the issue of violent video games , and urged parents to pay closer attention to what their children played .
“ This time - bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse , ” Ladda Thangsupachai , director of the ministry ’s Cultural Surveillance Centre , told Reuters .
“ Today it is a cab driver , but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner . ”
The ministry has been pushing for tougher regulation of video games such as Grand Theft Auto , including the imposition of a rating system on sales and restriction on hours that youngsters can play the games in public arcades .
A multi-million dollar lawsuit was filed in the U.S. state of Alabama against the makers and marketers of Grand Theft Auto in 2005 , claiming that months of playing the game led a teenager to kill two police officers and a 911 dispatcher .
The blockbuster Grand Theft Auto games are published by Nasdaq - listed Take - Two Interactive Software .

We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes .
There is grave concern in low - income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures .
Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market , I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders , investors , loan servicing organizations , consumer advocates , federal regulators and housing - related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge .
And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending , both must act and act quickly .
Working together , the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger .
Rampant foreclosures are in nobody 's interest , and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices , preserving homeownership , and stabilizing housing markets .
The summit should consider best practice loan marketing , underwriting , and origination practices consistent with the recent ( and overdue ) regulators ' Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending .
The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling , voluntary loan restructuring , limited forbearance , and other possible workout strategies .
I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following :
* What standards investors should require of lenders , particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates .
* How to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty .
* How to support independent community - based - organizations to provide counseling and work - out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical .
* How to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage .
* How to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability , transparency , non-discrimination , genuine consumer value , and competitive returns .
* How to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability .
Of course , the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices , or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short - term post - purchase interventions in certain cases .
My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation .
Nevertheless , a consortium of industry - related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at - risk homeowners and neighborhoods , even before Congress has had an opportunity to act .
There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy .
Please do n't let this opportunity pass us by .
Inspired by the success of my Awk One - Liners Explained article ( 30,000 views in first three days ) , I decided to explain sed one - liners as well .
These one - liners , just like the Awk one - liners , were compiled by Eric Pement .
You can download them here – sed one - liners ( link to .txt file ) .
Most people are only familiar with one sed command , namely the s ( substitute ) command .
It 's usually written like this – s / from / to / – and it replaces text from with text to .
This is just one command .
Sed has at least 20 different commands for you .
You can even write Tetris in it ( not to mention that it 's Turing complete ) .
My sed learning process was identical to Awk learning process .
First , I went through Bruce Barnett 's sed tutorial ; then I created a sed cheat sheet ; and then spent a couple of days going through sed one - liners file .
I prepared a couple of test files with a bunch of random text lines and typed each one - liner in the command prompt and tried to decipher how it works .
I could n't figure out only one of the one - liners in the file , so I ended up asking for help in comp.unix .
shell .
Eric 's sed one - liners file is divided into seven sections :
Update : Spanish translation of part one is available .
I 'll divide this article in 3 parts .
In the first part I 'll cover " File spacing " , " Numbering " and " Text conversion and substitution " .
In the second part I 'll cover " Selective printing of certain lines " and in the third " Selective deletion of certain lines " and " Special applications " .
Before I start explaining , I want to share the key idea that changed the way I think about sed .
It was the four memory spaces of sed – input stream , output stream , pattern space , hold buffer .
Sed operates on the input stream and produces an output stream .
Lines from input stream are placed into the pattern space ( where they can be modified ) and then pattern space is sent to output stream .
The hold buffer can be used for temporary storage .
These four spaces completely changed the way I think about sed .
You 'll learn all about them as you work through the examples in this post .
Awesome news : I have written an e-book based on this article series .
Check it out !
Please grab a copy of my sed cheat sheet , print it and let 's dive into one - liners !
File Spacing
1. Double - space a file .
sed G
This sed one - liner uses the G command .
If you grabbed my cheat sheet you 'll see that G appends a newline followed by the contents of hold buffer to pattern space .
In this example the hold buffer is empty all the time ( only three commands h , H and x modify hold buffer ) , so we end up simply appending a newline to the pattern space .
Once all the commands have been executed ( in this case just the G command ) , sed puts the contents of pattern space to output stream followed by a newline .
And there we have it .
Every line now is followed by two newlines – one added by the G command and the other by output stream .
File has been double spaced .
2. Double - space a file which already has blank lines in it .
Do it so that the output contains no more than one blank line between two lines of text .
sed '/ ^$ /d;G '
Sed allows to restrict commands only to certain lines .
This one - liner operates only on lines that match the regular expression /^$ / .
What are those lines ?
Those are the empty lines .
Note that before doing the regular expression match , sed pushes the input line to pattern space .
When doing it , sed strips the trailing newline character .
The empty lines contain just the newline character , so after they have been put into pattern space , this only character has been removed and pattern space stays empty .
Regular expression /^$ / matches an empty pattern space and sed applies d command on it , which deletes the current pattern space , reads in the next line , puts it into the pattern space and aborts the current command , and starts the execution from the beginning .
The lines which do not match emptiness get a newline character appended by the G command , just like in one - liner # 1 .
In general sed allows to restrict operations to certain lines ( 5th , 27th , etc. ) , to a range of lines ( lines 10 - 20 ) , to lines matching a pattern ( lines containing the word " catonmat " ) , and to lines between two patterns ( lines between " catonmat " and " coders " ) .
You 'll learn about this soon .
3. Triple - space a file .
sed ' G ; G '
Several sed commands can be combined by separating them with ; symbol .
Such commands get executed one after another .
This one - liner does twice what the one - liner # 1 does – appends two newlines ( via two G commands ) to output .
4 . Undo double - spacing .
sed ' n ;d '
This one - liner assumes that even - numbered lines are always blank .
It uses two new commands – n and d .
The n command prints out the current pattern space ( unless the -n flag has been specified ) , empties the current pattern space and reads in the next line of input .
We assumed that even - numbered lines are always blank .
This means that ' n ' prints the first , third , fifth , ... , etc. line and reads in the following line .
The line following the printed line is always an empty line .
Now the ' d ' command gets executed .
The ' d ' command deletes the current pattern space , reads in the next line , puts the new line into the pattern space and aborts the current command , and starts the execution from the first sed command .
Now the the ' n ' commands gets executed again , then ' d ' , then 'n ' , etc .
To make it shorter - ' n ' prints out the current line , and ' d ' deletes the empty line , thus undoing the double - spacing .
5 . Insert a blank line above every line that matches " regex " .
sed '/ regex /{x;p ; x ; } '
This one liner uses the restriction operation together with two new commands - ' x ' and ' p ' .
The ' x ' command exchanges the hold buffer with the pattern buffer .
The ' p ' command duplicates input -- prints out the entire pattern space .
This one - liner works the following way : a line is read in pattern space , then the ' x ' command exchanges it with the empty hold buffer .
Next the ' p ' command prints out emptiness followed by a newline , so we get an empty line printed before the actual line .
Then ' x ' exchanges the hold buffer ( which now contains the line ) with pattern space again .
There are no more commands so sed prints out the pattern space .
We have printed a newline followed by the line , or saying it in different words , inserted a blank line above every line .
Also notice the { ... }.
This is command grouping .
It says , execute all the commands in " ... " on the line that matches the restriction operation .
6 . Insert a blank line below every line that matches " regex " .
sed '/ regex / G '
This one liner combines restriction operation with the ' G ' command , described in one - liner # 1 .
For every line that matches / regex / , sed appends a newline to pattern space .
All the other lines that do not match / regex / just get printed out without modification .
7 . Insert a blank line above and below every line that matches " regex " .
sed '/ regex /{x;p ; x ; G;} '
This one - liner combines one - liners # 5 , # 6 and # 1 .
Lines matching / regex / get a newline appended before them and printed ( x ;p ; x from # 5 ) .
Then they are followed by another newline from the ' G ' command ( one - liner # 6 or # 1 ) .
2. Numbering .
8. Number each line of a file ( named filename ) .
Left align the number .
sed = filename | sed 'N;s /
/ \t /'
One - liners get trickier and trickier .
This one - liner is actually two separate one - liners .
The first sed one - liner uses a new command called '= ' .
This command operates directly on the output stream and prints the current line number .
There is no way to capture the current line number to pattern space .
That 's why the second one - liner gets called .
The output of first one - liner gets piped to the input of second .
The second one - liner uses another new command ' N ' .
The ' N ' command appends a newline and the next line to current pattern space .
Then the famous 's ///' command gets executed which replaces the newline character just appended with a tab .
After these operations the line gets printed out .
To make it clear what ' = ' does , take a look at this example file :
line one line two line three
Running the first one - liner ' sed = filename ' , produces output :
1 line one 2 line two 3 line three
Now , the ' N ' command of the second one - liner joins these lines with a newline character :
1
line one 2
line two 3
line three
The 's /
/ \t / ' replaces the newline chars with tabs , so we end up with :
1 line one 2 line two 3 line three
The example is a little inaccurate as line joining with a newline char happens line after line , not on all lines at once .
9 . Number each line of a file ( named filename ) .
Right align the number .
sed = filename | sed ' N ; s/^/ / ; s/ *\(.\{ 6, \}\ )
/\1 /'
This one - liner is also actually two one - liners .
The first one liner numbers the lines , just like # 8 .
The second one - liner uses the ' N ' command to join the line containing the line number with the actual line .
Then it uses two substitute commands to right align the number .
The first ' s ' command 's /^/ /' appends 5 white - spaces to the beginning of line .
The second ' s ' command 's / *(.{6, } )
/ \1 /' captures at least six symbols up to a newline and replaces the capture and newline with the back - reference ' \1 ' and two more whitespace to separate line number from the contents of line .
I think it 's hard to understand the last part of this sed expression by just reading .
Let 's look at an example .
For clearness I replaced the '
' newline char with a ' @ ' and whitespace with '- ' .
$ echo " -----12@contents " | sed 's /-*\(.\{6,\}\)@/\1--/'
----12--contents
The regular expression '- (.{ 6 , } ) @ ' ( or just ' - (.{ 6,} ) @ ' ) tells sed to match some ' -' characters followed by at least 6 other characters , followed by a ' @ ' symbol .
Sed captures them ( remembers them ) in \ 1 .
In this example sed matches the first ' -' ( the ' - ' part of regex ) , then the following six characters " ---- 12 " and ' @ ' ( the ' ( .{ 6 , } ) @ ' part of regex ) .
Now it replaces the matched part of the string " ----- 12@ " with the contents of captured group which is " ---- 12 " plus two extra whitespace .
The final result is that " ----- 12@ " gets replaced with " ----12--" .
10 . Number each non-empty line of a file ( called filename ) .
sed '/./= ' filename | sed '/./N ; s/
/ /'
This one - liner is again two one - liners .
The output of the first one - liner gets piped to the input of second .
The first one - liner filters out lines with at least one character in them .
The regular expression '/./' says : match lines with at least one char in them .
When the empty lines ( containing just a newline ) get sent to the pattern space , the newline character gets removed , so the empty lines do not get matched .
The second one - liner does the same one - liner # 8 did , except that only numbered lines get joined and printed out .
Command '/./N ' makes sure that empty lines are left as -is .
11 . Count the number of lines in a file ( emulates " wc - l " ) .
sed -n '$= '
This one - liner uses a command line switch " - n " to modify sed 's behavior .
The " - n " switch tells sed not to send the line to output after it has been processed in the pattern space .
The only way to make sed output anything with the " - n " switch being on is to use a command that modifies the output stream directly ( these commands are ' = ' , 'a ' , 'c ' , ' i ' , ' I ' , ' p ' , ' P ' , 'r ' and ' w ' ) .
In this one - liner what seems to be the command " $= " is actually a restriction pattern " $ " together with the " = " command .
The restriction pattern " $ " applies the " = " command to the last line only .
The " = " command outputs the current line number to standard output .
As it is applied to the last line only , this one - liner outputs the number of lines in the file .
3. Text Conversion and Substitution .
12 . Convert DOS / Windows newlines ( CRLF ) to Unix newlines ( LF ) .
sed 's /.$//'
This one - one liner assumes that all lines end with CR+LF ( carriage return + line feed ) and we are in a Unix environment .
Once the line gets read into pattern space , the newline gets thrown away , so we are left with lines ending in CR .
The 's /.$ //' command erases the last character by matching the last character of the line ( regex '. $ ' ) and substituting it with nothing .
Now when the pattern space gets output , it gets appended the newline and we are left with lines ending with LF .
The assumption about being in a Unix environment is necessary because the newline that gets appended when the pattern space gets copied to output stream is the newline of that environment .
13 . Another way to convert DOS / Windows newlines ( CRLF ) to Unix newlines ( LF ) .
sed 's /^M$//'
This one - liner again assumes that we are in a Unix environment .
It erases the carriage return control character ^M .
You can usually enter the ^M control char literally by first pressing Ctrl - V ( it 's control key + v key ) and then Ctrl -M .
14 . Yet another way to convert DOS / Windows newlines to Unix newlines .
sed 's /\x0D $//'
This one - liner assumes that we are on a Unix machine .
It also assumes that we use a version of sed that supports hex escape codes , such as GNU sed .
The hex value for CR is 0x0D ( 13 decimal ) .
This one - liner erases this character .
15 - 17 . Convert Unix newlines ( LF ) to DOS / Windows newlines ( CRLF ) .
sed " s / $ / `echo -e \\\r` / "
This one - liner also assumes that we are in a Unix environment .
It calls shell for help .
The ' echo -e \\r ' command inserts a literal carriage return character in the sed expression .
The sed " s / $ / char / " command appends a character to the end of current pattern space .
18 . Another way to convert Unix newlines ( LF ) to DOS / Windows newlines ( CRLF ) .
sed 's /$/\r/'
This one - liner assumes that we use GNU sed .
GNU sed is smarter than other seds and can take escape characters in the replace part of s/// command .
19 . Convert Unix newlines ( LF ) to DOS / Windows newlines ( CRLF ) from DOS / Windows .
sed " s / $ / / "
This one - liner works from DOS / Windows .
It 's basically a no - op one - liner .
It replaces nothing with nothing and then sends out the line to output stream where it gets CRLF appended .
20 .
Another way to convert Unix newlines ( LF ) to DOS / Windows newlines ( CRLF ) from DOS / Windows .
sed -n p
This is also a no - op one - liner , just like # 19 .
The shortest one - liner which does the same is :
sed ''
21 . Convert DOS / Windows newlines ( LF ) to Unix format ( CRLF ) from DOS / Windows .
sed " s/\r / / "
Eric says that this one - liner works only with UnxUtils sed v4.0.7 or higher .
I do n't know anything about this version of sed , so let 's just trust him .
This one - liner strips carriage return ( CR ) chars from lines .
Then when they get output , CRLF gets appended by magic .
Eric mentions that the only way to convert LF to CRLF on a DOS machine is to use tr :
tr -d \r < infile > outfile
22 . Delete leading whitespace ( tabs and spaces ) from each line .
sed 's / ^[ \ t ]*//'
Pretty simple , it matches zero - or - more spaces and tabs at the beginning of the line and replaces them with nothing , i.e. erases them .
23 . Delete trailing whitespace ( tabs and spaces ) from each line .
sed 's / [ \t ] *$//'
This one - liner is very similar to # 22 .
It does the same substitution , just matching zero - or - more spaces and tabs at the end of the line , and then erases them .
24 . Delete both leading and trailing whitespace from each line .
sed 's / ^[ \ t ]*//;s/[ \t ] *$//'
This one liner combines # 22 and # 23 .
First it does what # 22 does , erase the leading whitespace , and then it does the same as # 23 , erase trailing whitespace .
25 . Insert five blank spaces at the beginning of each line .
sed 's /^/ /'
It does it by matching the null - string at the beginning of line ( ^ ) and replaces it with five spaces " " .
26 . Align lines right on a 79 - column width .
sed -e :a -e 's /^.\{1,78\}$/ &/;ta'
This one - liner uses a new command line option and two new commands .
The new command line option is ' - e ' .
It allows to write a sed program in several parts .
For example , a sed program with two substitution rules could be written as " sed -e 's / one / two / ' -e 's / three / four ' " instead of " sed 's / one/two/;s/three /four ' " .
It makes it more readable .
In this one - liner the first " - e " creates a label called " a " .
The ' :' command followed by a name crates a named label .
The second " - e " uses a new command " t " .
The " t " command branches to a named label if the last substitute command modified pattern space .
This branching technique can be used to create loops in sed .
In this one - liner the substitute command left - pads the string ( right aligns it ) a single whitespace at a time , until the total length of the string exceeds 78 chars .
The " & " in substitution command means the matched string .
Translating it in modern language , it would look like this :
while ( str.length ( ) <= 78 ) { str = " " + str }
27 . Center all text in the middle of 79 - column width .
sed -e :a -e 's /^.\{1,77\}$/ & /;ta'
This one - liner is very similar to # 26 , but instead of left padding the line one whitespace character at a time it pads it on both sides until it has reached length of at least 77 chars .
Then another two whitespaces get added at the last iteration and it has grown to 79 chars .
Another way to do the same is
sed -e :a -e 's /^.\{1,77\}$/ &/;ta' -e 's /\( *\) \1/\1/'
This one - liner left pads the string one whitespace char at a time until it has reached length of 78 characters .
Then the additional " s / ( *) \1/\1 / " command gets executed which divides the leading whitespace " in half " .
This effectively centers the string .
Unlike the previous one - liner this one - liner does not add trailing whitespace .
It just adds enough leading whitespace to center the string .
28 . Substitute ( find and replace ) the first occurrence of " foo " with " bar " on each line .
sed 's /foo/bar /'
This is the simplest sed one - liner possible .
It uses the substitute command and applies it once on each line .
It substitutes string " foo " with " bar " .
29 . Substitute ( find and replace ) the fourth occurrence of " foo " with " bar " on each line .
sed 's /foo/bar/4 '
This one - liner uses a flag for the substitute command .
With no flags the first occurrence of pattern is changed .
With a numeric flag like " /1 " , " /2 " , etc. only that occurrence is substituted .
This one - liner uses numeric flag " / 4 " which makes it change fourth occurrence on each line .
30 . Substitute ( find and replace ) all occurrence of " foo " with " bar " on each line .
sed 's /foo/bar/g'
This one - liner uses another flag .
The " / g " flag which stands for global .
With global flag set , substitute command does as many substitutions as possible , i.e. , all .
31 . Substitute ( find and replace ) the first occurrence of a repeated occurrence of " foo " with " bar " .
sed 's /\(.*\) foo\ (.* foo\ )/\1 bar\2/'
Let 's understand this one - liner with an example :
$ echo " this is foo and another foo quux " | sed 's /\(.*\) foo\ (.* foo\ ) /\1 bar \2 / ' this is bar and another foo quux
As you can see , this one liner replaced the first " foo " with " bar " .
It did it by using two capturing groups .
The first capturing group caught everything before the first " foo " .
In this example it was text " this is " .
The second group caught everything after the first " foo " , including the second " foo " .
In this example " and another foo " .
The matched text was then replaced with contents of first group " this is " followed by " bar " and contents of second group " and another foo " .
Since " quux " was not part of the match it was left unchanged .
Joining these parts the resulting string is " this is bar and another foo quux " , which is exactly what we got from running the one - liner .
32 . Substitute ( find and replace ) only the last occurrence of " foo " with " bar " .
sed 's /\(.*\) foo/\1 bar /'
This one - liner uses a capturing group that captures everything up to " foo " .
It replaces the captured group and " foo " with captured group itself ( the \ 1 back - reference ) and " bar " .
It results in the last occurrence of " foo " getting replaced with " bar " .
33 . Substitute all occurrences of " foo " with " bar " on all lines that contain " baz " .
sed '/ baz/s/foo/bar/g '
This one - liner uses a regular expression to restrict the substitution to lines matching " baz " .
The lines that do not match " baz " get simply printed out , but those that do match " baz " get the substitution applied .
34 . Substitute all occurrences of " foo " with " bar " on all lines that DO NOT contain " baz " .
sed '/ baz/!s/foo/bar/g '
Sed commands can be inverted and applied on lines that DO NOT match a certain pattern .
The exclamation " ! " before a sed commands does it .
In this one - liner the substitution command is applied to the lines that DO NOT match " baz " .
35 . Change text " scarlet " , " ruby " or " puce " to " red " .
sed 's / scarlet/red/g;s/ruby/red/g;s/puce/red/g'
This one - liner just uses three consecutive substitution commands .
The first replaces " scarlet " with " red " , the second replaced " ruby " with " red " and the last one replaces " puce " with " red " .
If you are using GNU sed , then you can do it simpler :
gsed 's/scarlet\|ruby\|puce/red/g'
GNU sed provides more advanced regular expressions which support alternation .
This one - liner uses alternation and the substitute command reads " replace ' scarlet ' OR ' ruby ' OR ' puce ' with ' red ' " .
36 . Reverse order of lines ( emulate " tac " Unix command ) .
sed ' 1!G;h ;$ !d '
This one - liner acts as the " tac " Unix utility .
It 's tricky to explain .
The easiest way to explain it is by using an example .
Let 's use a file with just 3 lines :
$ cat file foo bar baz
Running this one - liner on this file produces the file in reverse order :
$ sed ' 1 ! G;h ; $ !d ' file baz bar foo
The first one - liner 's command " 1! G " gets applied to all the lines which are not the first line .
The second command " h " gets applied to all lines .
The third command " $ !d " gets applied to all lines except the last one .
Let 's go through the execution line by line .
Line 1 : Only the " h " command gets applied for the first line " foo " .
It copies this line to hold buffer .
Hold buffer now contains " foo " .
Nothing gets output as the " d " command gets applied .
Line 2 : The " G " command gets applied .
It appends the contents of hold buffer to pattern space .
The pattern space now contains .
" bar
foo " .
The " h " command gets applied , it copies " bar
foo " to hold buffer .
It now contains " bar
foo " .
Nothing gets output .
Line 3 : The " G " command gets applied .
It appends hold buffer to the third line .
The pattern space now contains " baz
bar
foo " .
As this was the last line , " d " does not get applied and the contents of pattern space gets printed .
It 's " baz
bar
foo " .
File got reversed .
If we had had more lines , they would have simply get appended to hold buffer in reverse order .
Here is another way to do the same :
sed -n ' 1!G;h ;$p '
It silences the output with " - n " switch and forces the output with " p " command only at the last line .
These two one - liners actually use a lot of memory because they keep the whole file in hold buffer in reverse order before printing it out .
Avoid these one - liners for large files .
37 . Reverse a line ( emulates " rev " Unix command ) .
sed '/
/!G;s/\(.\)\(.*
\)/&\2\1/;//D;s/.//'
This is a very complicated one - liner .
I had trouble understanding it the first time I saw it and ended up asking on comp.unix .
shell for help .
Let 's re-format this sed one - liner :
sed ' /
/ !G s/\(.\)\(.*
\ )/&\2\1/ //D s/.// '
The first line "/
/ !G " appends a newline to the end of the pattern space if there was none .
The second line " s / (. ) ( .*
) /&\2\1 / " is a simple s/// expression which groups the first character as \ 1 and all the others as \ 2 .
Then it replaces the whole matched string with " &\2\1 " , where " & " is the whole matched text ( " \1\2 " ) .
For example , if the input string is " 1234 " then after the s/// expression , it becomes " 1234
234
1 " .
The third line is " //D " .
This statement is the key in this one - liner .
An empty pattern // matches the last existing regex , so it 's exactly the same as : /(. ) ( .
) / D. The " D " command deletes from the start of the input till the first newline and then resumes editing with first command in script .
It creates a loop .
As long as /(. ) ( .
) / is satisfied , sed will resume all previous operations .
After several loops , the text in the pattern space becomes "
4321 " .
Then /(. ) (.*
) / fails and sed goes to the next command .
The fourth line " s/.// " removes the first character in the pattern space which is the newline char .
The contents in pattern space becomes " 4321 " -- reverse of " 1234 " .
There you have it , a line has been reversed .
38 . Join pairs of lines side - by - side ( emulates " paste " Unix command ) .
sed '$ !N;s /
/ /'
This one - liner joins two consecutive lines with the " N " command .
They get joined with a "
" character between them .
The substitute command replaces this newline with a space , thus joining every pair of lines with a whitespace .
39 .
Append a line to the next if it ends with a backslash " \ " .
sed -e :a -e '/ \\$ /N ; s/\\
// ; ta '
The first expression ' : a ' creates a named label " a " .
The second expression looks to see if the current line ends with a backslash " \ " .
If it does , it joins it with the line following it using the " N " command .
Then the slash and the newline between joined lines get erased with " s / \
// " command .
If the substitution was successful we branch to the beginning of expression and do the same again , in hope that we might have another backslash .
If the substitution was not successful , the line did not end with a backslash and we print it out .
Here is an example of running this one - liner :
$ cat filename line one \ line two line three $ sed -e :a -e '/ \\$ /N ; s/\\
// ; ta ' filename line one line two line three
Lines one and two got joined because the first line ended with backslash .
40 .
Append a line to the previous if it starts with an equal sign " = " .
sed -e :a -e '$ !N;s /
=/ /;ta ' -e ' P;D '
This one - liner also starts with creating a named label " a " .
Then it tests to see if it is not the last line and appends the next line to the current one with " N " command .
If the just appended line starts with a " = " , one - liner branches the label " a " to see if there are more lines starting with " = " .
During this process a substitution gets executed which throws away the newline character which came from joining with " N " and the " = " .
If the substitution fails , one - liner prints out the pattern space up to the newline character with the " P " command , and deletes the contents of pattern space up to the newline character with " D " command , and repeats the process .
Here is an example of running it :
$ cat filename line one =line two =line three line four $ sed -e :a -e '$ !
N;s /
=/ /;ta ' -e ' P ; D ' filename line one line two line three line four
Lines one , two and three got joined , because lines two and three started with '= ' .
Line four got printed as -is .
41 . Digit group ( commify ) a numeric string .
sed -e :a -e 's /\(.*[ 0 - 9 ] \ ) \( [ 0 - 9 ] \{ 3\}\ )/\1,\2/;ta'
This one - liner turns a string of digits , such as " 1234567 " to " 1,234,567 " .
This is called commifying or digit grouping .
First the one - liner creates a named label " a " .
Then it captures two groups of digits .
The first group is all the digits up to last three digits .
The last three digits gets captures in the 2nd group .
Then the two matching groups get separated by a comma .
Then the same rules get applied to the line again and again until all the numbers have been grouped in groups of three .
Substitution command " \1, \2 " separates contents of group one with a comma from the contents of group two .
Here is an example to understand the grouping happening here better .
Suppose you have a numeric string " 1234567 " .
The first group captures all the numbers until the last three " 1234 " .
The second group captures last three numbers " 567 " .
They get joined by a comma .
Now the string is " 1234,567 " .
The same stuff is applied to the string again .
Number " 1 " gets captured in the first group and the numbers " 234 " in the second .
The number string is " 1,234,567 " .
Trying to apply the same rules again fail because there is just one digit at the beginning of string , so the string gets printed out and sed moves on to the next line .
If you have GNU sed , you can use a simpler one - liner :
gsed ':a;s/\B[0-9 ]\{3\}\>/,&/;ta'
This one - liner starts with creating a named label " a " and then loops over the string the same way as the previous one - liner did .
The only difference is how groups of three digits get matched .
GNU sed has some additional patterns .
There are two patterns that make this one - liner work .
The first is " \B " , which matches anywhere except at a word boundary .
It 's needed so we did not go beyond word boundary .
Look at this example :
$ echo " 12345 1234 123 " | sed 's / [ 0 - 9 ] \{ 3\}\>/,&/g'
12,345 1,234 ,123
It 's clearly wrong .
The last 123 got a comma added .
Adding the " \B " makes sure we match the numbers only at word boundary :
$ echo " 12345 1234 123 " | sed 's / \B [ 0 - 9 ] \{ 3\}\>/,&/g'
12,345 1,234 123
The second is " > " .
It matches the null string at the end of a word .
It 's necessary because we need to to match the right - most three digits .
If we did not have it , the expression would match after the first digit .
42 . Add commas to numbers with decimal points and minus signs .
gsed -r ' : a;s /( ^ |[ ^0 - 9 . ] ) ( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ( [ 0 - 9] {3} )/\1\2,\3/g;ta'
This one - liner works in GNU sed only .
It turns on extended regular expression support with the " - r " switch .
Then it loops over a line matching three groups and separates the first two from the third with a comma .
The first group makes sure we ignore a leading non -digit character , such as + or -.
If there is no leading non -digit character , then it just anchors at the beginning of the string which always matches .
The second group matches a bunch of numbers .
The third group makes sure the second group does not match too many .
It matches 3 consecutive numbers at the end of the string .
Once the groups have been captured , the " \1\2, \3 " substitution is done and the expression is looped again , until the whole string has been commified .
43 .
Add a blank line after every five lines .
sed 'n ;n;n;n;G ;'
The " n " command is called four times in this one - liner .
Each time it 's called it prints out the current pattern space , empties it and reads in the next line of input .
After calling it four times , the fifth line is read into the pattern space and then the " G " command gets called .
The " G " command appends a newline to the fifth line .
Then the next round of four " n " commands is done .
Next time the first " n " command is called it prints out the newlined fifth line , thus inserting a blank line after every 5 lines .
The same can be achieved with GNU sed 's step extension :
gsed ' 0~5 G '
GNU sed 's step extensions can be generalized as " first~step " .
It matches every " step " 'th line starting with line " first " .
In this one - liner it matches every 5th line starting with line 0 .

ST . PETERSBURG , Fla . 
On pace to set postseason records for home runs and stolen bases , the Rays did all the little things Thursday night as they won the first World Series game in franchise history , tying the Fall Classic at a game apiece before it moves to Philadelphia for Game 3 on Saturday night .
DAMAGE CONTROL : Shields jelled when stuck in jam
Philadelphia has shown all of the firepower of a go - kart at a NASCAR race in the clutch this postseason , hitting .157 .
The Phillies , who pride themselves on their powerful offense , are hitting even worse this series , batting .
036 with runners in scoring position .
They might be hitting .400 with no one in scoring position but have one infield hit in 28 at - bats with a runner on second or third base .
" I 'm concerned about us hitting with guys on base , " Phillies manager Charlie Manuel says , " because it looks at times like we might be trying too hard . "
" It may seem like we 're pressing , but I know personally I 'm not , " Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino said .
" I mean , is it that guys are pressing or are guys just not getting the job done ?
You tell me .
" Hey , you 're going to fail in this game .
But we 're just failing too often . "
While the Phillies had problems simply hitting the ball out of the infield , the Rays scored three of their four runs on two groundouts and a safety squeeze .
Philadelphia scored its two runs on a solo homer by Eric Bruntlett and an error by Rays third baseman Evan Longoria .
Rays DH Cliff
Floyd sees a veteran team perhaps trying too hard .
The Phillies have left 22 runners on base , and leadoff hitter Jimmy Rollins has yet to reach base .
" You have to settle for what they give you , not try to do too much , " Floyd said .
" If you do n't capitalize on those opportunities , you usually end up losing .
They know it .
We know it .
Everybody in baseball knows it . "
Floyd scored in the fourth inning on Jason Bartlett 's safety squeeze down the first - base line .
" Speed kills , baby , " Floyd said , getting laughter from the reporters standing at his locker .
" I looked at the sign and thought , ' Are you sure ? '
I think that 's the first safety squeeze I 've been a part of .
I had to get these legs going .
If they had pitched out , I would have been out by a mile . "
Floyd said he appreciates that manager Joe Maddon likes to surprise the team .
" That 's Joe .
He 'll do anything at any time .
I think any time you can surprise the other team , you should go for it . "
Maddon usually explains his strategy , but when asked about Bartlett 's bunt , he said he 'd rather not discuss it .
" I 'm not going to talk about it , " he said .
" I 'm not being rude .
It 's just something we do , and it worked out well . "
The Rays scored two runs in the first inning on RBI groundouts by Carlos Pena and Longoria , two of their big power threats .
Another of their power hitters , outfielder B.J. Upton , who has hit seven home runs this October , added an RBI single in the second .
" That 's what we are all about — small ball , " Upton said .
" We can do the little things .
Carlos ' grounder and Evan 's grounder got us off to a good start .
" We win any way we can , small ball , home runs .
Sometimes it goes one way , and sometimes it goes the other . "
On defense , right fielder Rocco Baldelli caught Chase Utley 's drive and then threw to Pena to double up the Phillies ' Jayson Werth at first base to end the fifth inning .
" I think Chase might have hit it on the end of the bat , " Baldelli said .
" I looked up and saw that he was off , so I just took a chance with the throw . "
The Rays have hit 23 home runs in 13 postseason games , fourth - most in major - league history , and their 18 steals have tied the 1995 Cleveland Indians for most by an American League team in the postseason .
The Rays are two short of the postseason steals record , held by the 1975 Cincinnati Reds and 1992 Atlanta Braves .
Maddon was pleased with the small - ball success because he said the team is n't as good at it as the players say .
During the game , he told coach Dave Martinez that they need to practice it next spring training .
" We 've been horrid with that all year , " Maddon said .
" Ground ball , ground ball , bunt , three points ( runs ) right there .
That 's beautiful .
You 're not always going to hit home runs .
When you get an opportunity to score a run , you better take advantage . "
Upton had a surprised look for a TV reporter who asked if he thought the Rays could win a game in Philadelphia to bring the series back to St. Petersburg next week .
Upton set the record straight : " We are confident .
We like to go into every game thinking that we can win .
We are going to be fine . "
ROME ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Film director Spike Lee has set off a storm in Italy with a movie about black American soldiers fighting alongside Italian partisans in World War Two .
Director Spike Lee speaks to the media at the ' Babelgum Online Film Festival ' news conference during the 33rd Toronto International Film Festival , September 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mark Blinch
Surviving members of the resistance to the Nazi occupation of Italy have taken issue with “ Miracle at St. Anna ” ahead of the film ’s Italian release on Friday , distributing protest flyers and accusing Lee of distorting history .
Lee has said he wanted to set the record straight about the role played by black U.S. soldiers in the war .
The film is based on a novel by James McBride and focuses on the all - black 92nd Buffalo Division which helped liberate Italy in 1944 - 45 .
At the heart of the dispute is the film ’s depiction of an infamous 1944 massacre in the Tuscan town of Sant ’Anna di Stazzema , where Nazi troops rounded up and killed 560 civilians .
In the film , the massacre is portrayed as a response to the actions of resistance fighters , with one of them betraying the town and colluding with the Nazis -- a version of events that has angered surviving partisans .
Lee , who is in Italy promoting the film , has responded to the criticism in his characteristically feisty manner .
“ I would not allow anybody to tell me how to make a film , be it a partisan or the president of the United States , ” Lee told a news conference in Florence on Wednesday after a preview screening , according to Italian media .
“ This simply shows that in Italy the wound is still open .
...
It is up to Italians to come to grips with their past , not up to me or James McBride or the film , ” he said .
Members of the ANPI association of resistance fighters were not amused .
“ For Spike Lee the partisans who ‘ hit and then ran away ’ were responsible for the Sant ’ Anna di Stazzema massacre , ” ANPI said on its website .
“ Before shooting his film , the director should have read the truth about that horrible slaughter , ” it said , posting a copy of the 2005 verdict of an Italian military tribunal which convicted 10 ex -Nazi officers for the murders .
KABUL , Afghanistan — American military successes in Iraq have prompted growing numbers of well - trained “ foreign fighters ” to join the insurgency in Afghanistan instead , the Afghan defense minister said on Tuesday .
The minister , Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak , said at a news conference that the increased flow of insurgents from outside Afghanistan had contributed to the heightened intensity of the fighting here this year , which he described as the “ worst ” since the American - led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001 .
American commanders have said that overall violence here has increased by 30 percent in the past year and have called for more troops .
The defense minister said that “ the success of coalition forces in Iraq ” had combined with developments in countries neighboring Afghanistan to cause “ a major increase in the number of foreign fighters ” coming to Afghanistan .
“ There is no doubt that they are better equipped than before , ” he said .
“ They are well trained , more sophisticated , and their coordination is much better . ”

Not Your Grandfather 's Depression
The current stock market crash has spurred a vital national debate about the causes and catalysts of the Great Depression .
The dominant school of thought believes that the stubborn refusal of then president Herbert Hoover to intervene after the stock market crash of 1929 , and his preference for free market solutions , led directly to the ensuing decade - long catastrophe .
Through this lens , our leaders assure us that the most recent raft of government measures will prevent another episode of bread lines , Hoovervilles and pencil salesmen .
As usual they have it completely wrong .
In my view , the Depression was created precisely because Hoover followed the path that our government is now taking .
When the stock market bubble of the Roaring Twenties ( which was created as a result of the loose monetary policy of the newly created Federal Reserve ) finally popped , Hoover would not allow market forces to correct the imbalances .
His policies were aimed at propping up unsound businesses , artificially supporting prices , particularly wages , and providing Federal funds for public works projects .
These moves went well beyond the progressive reforms of Teddy Roosevelt , and established Hoover as the most interventionist president ever up to that point .
In fact , much of what eventually became the New Deal had its roots in Hoover 's policies .
However , at the time , there were those who recommended a different course .
Andrew Mellon , the long - serving Secretary of the Treasury whom Hoover had inherited from the prior two Republican Administrations , was labeled by Hoover as a " leave it alone isolationist " who wanted to " liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , and liquidate real estate . "
Hoover would have none of it .
In fact , during his nomination speech for a potential second term , Hoover bragged " We determined that we would not follow the advice of the bitter liquidationists and see the whole body of debtors of the United States brought to bankruptcy and the savings of our people brought to destruction . "
Hoover chose to ignore the sound advice of his Treasury Secretary ( in contrast to today where the current Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is actually leading the charge over the cliff ) and instead used every tool at his disposal to " fix " the problem .
As a result , rather than allowing a recession to run its course , with healthy and rapid liquidations of the mal - investments built up during the boom , Hoover inadvertently created what became the Great Depression .
When Roosevelt took office he continued the same failed policies only on a grander scale .
The magnitude and the idiocy of many New Deal programs , such as the wage and price setting National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) , compounded the problems .
So while Mellon 's advice would have caused a sharp but relatively brief economic downturn ( which occurred after the Panic of 1907 , for example ) , the Depression plodded on for nearly a decade until the country began gearing up for the Second World War .
In an amazing feat of revisionist history , somehow Hoover 's interventionist policies have been completely forgotten .
It is taken as fundamental that his inaction led to the Depression and Roosevelt 's " heroics " got us out .
Unfortunately , since we have learned nothing from history , we are about to repeat the very mistakes that lead to the most dire economic circumstance of the last century .
A major difference however , is that the structure of the U.S economy today is far weaker than it was in the fall of 1929 .
Years of reckless consumer borrowing and spending , and enormous trade and budget deficits have resulted in a hollowed out industrial base and an unmanageable mountain of debt owed to foreign creditors .
Instead of the support of a strong currency backed by gold , the public now must deal with a modern

Nick , I believe the Great Depression was artificially created by the Federal Reserve Banks .
Throughout history , the FEDs have a history of loosening and then tightening the money available to the general public .
They loosen the money making money easily attainable , people prosper , take out loans , make purchases and investments , then they tighten the money , causing people to go into default .
They then foreclose or buy up the investments for pennies on the dollar .
Today they call this the Business Cycle .
Immediately before the Great Depression , we had a period of Great Prosperity ( The Roaring 20s ) .
During this time , people and corporations were prospering and using their own profits to invest back into their businesses .
They were n't taking out new loans .
This had to be stopped .
They tightened the money and created the Great Depression all the while , paying themselves great dividends .
Just like is happening today .

The current stock market crash has spurred a vital national debate about the causes and catalysts of the Great Depression .
The dominant school of thought believes that the stubborn refusal of then president Herbert Hoover to intervene after the stock market crash of 1929 , and his preference for free market solutions , led directly to the ensuing decade - long catastrophe .
Through this lens , our leaders assure us that the most recent raft of government measures will prevent another episode of bread lines , Hoovervilles and pencil salesmen .
As usual they have it completely wrong .
In my view , the Depression was created precisely because Hoover followed the path that our government is now taking .
When the stock market bubble of the Roaring Twenties ( which was created as a result of the loose monetary policy of the newly created Federal Reserve ) finally popped , Hoover would not allow market forces to correct the imbalances .
His policies were aimed at propping up unsound businesses , artificially supporting prices , particularly wages , and providing Federal funds for public works projects .
These moves went well beyond the progressive reforms of Teddy Roosevelt , and established Hoover as the most interventionist president ever up to that point .
In fact , much of what eventually became the New Deal had its roots in Hoover 's policies .
However , at the time , there were those who recommended a different course .
Andrew Mellon , the long - serving Secretary of the Treasury whom Hoover had inherited from the prior two Republican Administrations , was labeled by Hoover as a " leave it alone isolationist " who wanted to " liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , and liquidate real estate . "
Hoover would have none of it .
In fact , during his nomination speech for a potential second term , Hoover bragged " We determined that we would not follow the advice of the bitter liquidationists and see the whole body of debtors of the United States brought to bankruptcy and the savings of our people brought to destruction .
" Hoover chose to ignore the sound advice of his Treasury Secretary ( in contrast to today where the current Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is actually leading the charge over the cliff ) and instead used every tool at his disposal to " fix " the problem .
As a result , rather than allowing a recession to run its course , with healthy and rapid liquidations of the mal - investments built up during the boom , Hoover inadvertently created what became the Great Depression .
When Roosevelt took office he continued the same failed policies only on a grander scale .
The magnitude and the idiocy of many New Deal programs , such as the wage and price setting National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) , compounded the problems .
So while Mellon 's advice would have caused a sharp but relatively brief economic downturn ( which occurred after the Panic of 1907 , for example ) , the Depression plodded on for nearly a decade until the country began gearing up for the Second World War .
In an amazing feat of revisionist history , somehow Hoover 's interventionist policies have been completely forgotten .
It is taken as fundamental that his inaction led to the Depression and Roosevelt 's " heroics " got us out .
Unfortunately , since we have learned nothing from history , we are about to repeat the very mistakes that lead to the most dire economic circumstance of the last century .
A major difference however , is that the structure of the U.S economy today is far weaker than it was in the fall of 1929 .
Years of reckless consumer borrowing and spending , and enormous trade and budget deficits have resulted in a hollowed out industrial base and an unmanageable mountain of debt owed to foreign creditors .
Instead of the support of a strong currency backed by gold , the public now must deal with a modern
Fed free to print as much money as politicians want .
So rather than getting the benefits of falling consumer prices ( as happened during the Depression ) , consumers today will contend with much higher consumer prices , even as the economy contracts .
With Barack Obama now waiting in the wings to conjure a newer New Deal , far larger than even FDR could have imagined , and at a time when we cannot even afford the old one , this will not be your grandfather 's Depression .
It may be much worse .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A huge South Korean land reclamation project has destroyed wetlands , killed migratory birds and pushed endangered species toward extinction , a report obtained at the weekend said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The Saemangeum land reclamation , completed in 2006 on the west coast and covering about 400 square kms ( 155 sq miles ) -- about seven times larger than Manhattan -- has removed one of the largest feeding grounds on the Yellow Sea for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds who pass by each year , it said .
“ Within Saemangeum , ( we ) recorded a decline of 137,000 shorebirds , and declines in 19 of the most numerous species , from 2006 to 2008 , ” according to the study by conservation groups Birds Korea and Australasian Wader Studies Group that will be released at an international Ramsar convention on wetlands this week in South Korea .
Migratory birds traveling between Russia and Alaska in the north to New Zealand and Australia in the south congregate for often their only refueling stop at Yellow Sea tidal flats to feast on shellfish and other food .
South Korea , now one of the world ’s largest economies , launched its reclamation project decades ago to increase its farm land when it was trying to rise from the ashes of the 1950 - 1953 Korean War and now says it will use the land for factories and recreation sites .
The study indicated that the critically endangered Spoon - billed Sandpiper and the endangered Spotted Greenshank were being pushed to extinction by the loss of wetlands .
“ There have been large declines and some of this is irreversible , ” said Nial Moores , a British - born conservationist and director of Birds Korea .
“ We anticipate the declines will not only continue but become more obvious in other species . ”
South Korean environmental officials have said they thought there would be no major harm done to migratory birds because they would be able to find food at nearby wetlands in the country .
“ The evidence very strongly indicates that most shorebird populations are declining in the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) , the study said .
The study said the loss of wetlands at Saemangeum has decreased water quality on the coast , which has led to a loss of marine life and puts other areas at risk .
The conservation groups who conducted the study through bird counts for three years are calling on the South Korean government to restore the tidal flow in the area by opening and enlarging the sluice gates .
ALBUQUERQUE , New Mexico ( Reuters ) -
How much money makes a person rich ?
That ’s the latest question dividing Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. presidential race .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ripped Republican rival John McCain on Monday for joking during a televised discussion on values that $ 5 million fit the definition for being monetarily rich .
“ I guess if you ’re making $ 3 million a year , you ’re middle class , ” Obama told a campaign event in New Mexico .
“ That ’s reflected in ... his policies , ” Obama said , adding McCain would give a $ 500,000 tax credit to people making more than $ 2.5 million .
McCain , who made the comment to evangelical pastor Rick Warren on Saturday , caught himself immediately and said the remark would likely be taken out of context .
The ailing U.S. economy and soaring energy prices have become the top issue in the race for the White House .
ROLLING STONE : IT ’S ALREADY STOLEN
Investigation by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Greg Palast released today
Do n’t worry about Mickey Mouse or ACORN stealing the election .
According to an investigative report out today in Rolling Stone magazine , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Greg Palast , after a year - long investigation , reveal a systematic program of “ GOP vote tampering ” on a massive scale .
– Republican Secretaries of State of swing - state Colorado have quietly purged one in six names from their voter rolls .
Over several months , the GOP politicos in Colorado stonewalled every attempt by Rolling Stone to get an answer to the massive purge – ten times the average state ’s rate of removal .
– While Obama dreams of riding to the White House on a wave of new voters , more then 2.7 million have had their registrations REJECTED under new procedures signed into law by George Bush .
Kennedy , a voting rights lawyer , charges this is a resurgence of ‘ Jim Crow ’ tactics to wrongly block Black and Hispanic voters .
– A fired US prosecutor levels new charges – accusing leaders of his own party , Republicans , with criminal acts in an attempt to block legal voters as “ fraudulent . ”
– Digging through government records , the Kennedy - Palast team discovered that , in 2004 , a GOP scheme called “ caging ” ultimately took away the rights of 1.1 million voters .
The Rolling Stone duo predict that , this November 4 , it will be far worse .
There ’s more :
– Since the last presidential race , “ States used dubious ‘ list management ’ rules to scrub at least 10 million voters from their rolls . ”
Among those was Paul Maez of Las Vegas , New Mexico – a victim of an unreported but devastating purge of voters in that state that left as many as one in nine Democrats without a vote .
For Maez , the state ’s purging his registration was particularly shocking – he ’s the county elections supervisor .
The Kennedy - Palast revelations go far beyond the sum of questionably purged voters recently reported by the New York Times .
“ Republican operatives – the party ’s elite commandos of bare - knuckle politics , ” report Kennedy and Palast , under the cover of fighting fraudulent voting , are “ systematically disenfranchis[ing ] Democrats . ”
The investigators level a deadly serious charge :
“ If Democrats are to win the 2008 election , they must not simply beat McCain at the polls – they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP vote tampering . ”

In Florida , however , Republicans appear to hold the upper hand , while in Colorado , early voting is about evenly split among Republicans and Democrats .
Mr. Bush won all those states in 2004 .
The dates when early voting begins and ends vary by state .
Experts cautioned that the full impact of early voting cannot be known until the choices of those without party affiliations become more clear on Election Day .
In years past , however , early voting has tended to favor Republicans , according to voting experts .
Mr. Bush won the early vote in 2004 in his race against Senator John F. Kerry , 60 percent to 40 percent .
Mr. Bush won early voters by a similar margin in his 2000 run against Vice President Al Gore .
As a result , the preliminary data from some states has surprised certain experts .
“ In the past , what you ’ve seen is early voters tend to be older , had higher incomes and lean more Republican and that trend has held over the past elections , ” said Paul Gronke , executive director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon .
“ But what we are seeing now when you look at the numbers is that they are more African - American , Hispanic and the young .
I look at this and I go , ‘ Wow ! ’
This is quite different .
It is a lot different from what we ’ve seen before and it has to raise concerns for the G.O.P . ”
The early voting is part of a broader transformation in the way Americans vote .
In the past , absentee voting was reserved mainly for those unable to make it to the polls on Election Day , whether because of sickness , business or military service .
Now more than 30 states allow voters to cast early ballots either in person or by mail without requiring an excuse .

With news this week that Congress is poised to consider a new stimulus package , I am forced to again ask a question that seems silly in Washington :
How will we pay for this ?
While a few Members of Congress have raised the issue , it certainly was not the primary concern of the House Budget Committee when they interviewed Ben Bernanke on Monday .
And , when they did direct this question to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , his answer was the standard rhetoric about how Congress needed to make tough choices .
Needless to say , not many specifics were discussed .
One of the most liberal members of the House , Barney Frank , has at least volunteered something of a suggestion :  We can let Iraq take care of itself . 
This , of course , goes in the right direction , but hardly far enough .
We need to declare the facts and their obvious consequences .
The deficit of the United States is now spiraling out of control , and the recent bailout package has only made it worse .
Our crushing federal debt is one key reason behind our current economic turbulence .
As Congress begins to consider the third stimulus package of the year , we need to realize it is time to start setting priorities .
Priority number one should be cutting spending in foreign countries .
This does not simply mean Iraq , but everywhere .
The next stimulus package is likely to include money for infrastructure .
While these investments are , constitutionally speaking , supposed to be made by state and local governments , it is not likely that Congress will suddenly begin to pay heed to the document we are all sworn to uphold .
Still , we need to acknowledge the fact that the current Congress and Administration are rushing the nation toward bankruptcy .
This being the case , we could hope they would at least come to their senses regarding our debt and foreign spending sprees .
Our nation ’s foreign - held debt is at record highs and moving ever higher .
Continuing to borrow money from Red China and others in order to pay dues to the United Nations and run  Plan Colombia makes no sense at all .
Our whole carrot - and - stick approach to foreign policy makes no sense .
The US government simultaneously gives money to Israel , and to Egypt .
We send AIDS money to Africa while AIDS clinics in America shut down .
 Millennium challenge funding goes to countries which enact market - based reforms  as we push our own country further and further into a centrally planned economy .
Economic recovery will only come through financial prudence , savings , and getting back to producing things of value again .
But it seems to be a foregone conclusion that we are about to enact another government initiative to stimulate the economy .
Instead , there should be some serious talk about cutting all of these foreign giveaway programs .
But , alas and again , we should not hold our breath .
Congress is still not close to being serious about ending its addiction to debt and spending , and is again faced with the deadly temptation to attempt to spend us out of a recession .
We should not forget that in the 1930 ’s those types of efforts gave us the Great Depression .

Although John McCain is the presumptive Republican nominee , as the various state conventions roll forward in obscurity , conflict and chaos continue to be spread by Ron Paul ’s enthusiastic followers who continue to try to storm the ramparts of the GOP establishment .
These efforts by libertarian - leaning Republicans , looking to strike a blow against the neo-cons , have met with some successes and some failures and certainly a very undesirable backlash .
Their strategy , as demonstrated at district conventions around the country , is to show up in large numbers , use procedural motions to disrupt the convention , and if their forces are sufficient , force a vote to suspend the convention rules , remove the convention leadership , and start over again with their faction in control — all within the rules , of course .
This strategy is continuing at the state level as was demonstrated at the Nevada State Convention in Reno , where an attempt to take over the convention was near succeeding when the sitting chairman countered with a space - skipping checkmate .
He had seen that the Ron Paul faction was far stronger than the John McCain delegation and cleverly adjourned the proceedings altogether in order to avoid the inevitable .
Officials indicated that they are to reconvene at a later date , but the Paul faction suspects a different and secret city .
As news of what happened in Texas Senate District 25 ( where Paul supporters completely took over ) and in Nevada has spread , state party bosses have drawn up their counter - strategies which include changes to how conventions are run which reduce direct input from delegates and motions from the floor , draconian measures to remove anyone they think is “ disruptive ” and in some cases special meetings of credentials committees to disqualify Ron Paul delegates before the convention convenes .
Meanwhile , as more state conventions are held the conflict continues .
At the Maine Republican State Convention in May the screws were tightened , with no microphones on the floor of the convention and a number of Paul delegates forcibly ejected from the hall .
Police were on hand to maintain security .
Scheduled pro-Paul speakers found their time shortened or their appearances canceled .
Attempts to introduce delaying motions were quickly ruled out of order .
The whole proceeding charged ahead with little opportunity to interrupt .
This type of highly managed convention where delegates are treated more like observers than participants may now be the standard for these state conventions .
Not surprisingly , this type of behavior from party bosses has not been well received .
One of the best reports on the Maine convention comes from Robert Miller , a young delegate whose account of the convention stresses the alienation which he felt as a Ron Paul supporter from the convention proceedings from which he described the bias for McCain and the prejudice against Ron Paul .
He said the anti-Ron Paul agenda became evident soon after the hammering of the initiating gavel .
After the first order of business , someone from one county made a motion reminding the convention that since there were two candidates , and John McCain was well represented , someone should be allowed to speak on behalf of Ron Paul also .
Young Miller says that that idea “ must have been too dangerous to vote on , ” because the chairwoman immediately called the motion “ out of order ” and proceeded without even considering the matter , or letting it come to a vote .
Despite the obstacles being put in their path , the Ron Paul faction is having some success .
They have n’t taken over a state convention yet , and may not , considering the stacked deck , but they are gaining delegates here and there .
Some states use a system for selecting delegates to the national convention where a part of the delegation is chosen at district conventions and the rest are selected at the state convention .
Paul supporters have done very well in states which use this approach , taking half of the 12 available delegate slots in Minnesota and a third of the delegate positions in Oklahoma .
This representation , out of proportion to Paul ’s actual standing in the official ( fraudulent ) vote in those states , is made possible because Paul ’s supporters are highly motivated and actually attend the conventions while less motivated partisans stay home , and because of the departure of two moderately successful candidates who have dropped out of the race and left a vacuum which the Paul forces can move in and fill .
If this pattern continues , even with crackdowns at future state conventions , Paul supporters are still likely to fill a lot more seats at the national GOP convention in September than would normally be justified by his showing in the ( fraudulent ) popular vote , “ perhaps 30 times the 21 delegates they are officially entitled to based on the state primary results , ” suggests political writer , Dave Nalle .
“ Along the way they ’re likely to antagonize party organizers and drive away potential allies , ” he says , “ and ultimately make themselves into pariahs .
But the fireworks at the national convention should be fun . ”
Some are suggesting that instead of trying to seize control of convention after convention , the Paul people could have laid relatively low and worked within the system and probably sent even more delegates to the national convention than they are likely to now , and by being more subdued they could have won over allies and made converts within the mainstream of the party .
Then the backlash would have been minimal , and while they might not have been able to stop McCain from getting the nomination they could have had a profound influence on the platform , the issues raised in the election and the future direction of the party .
In addition to the step - child treatment at every state convention , these loyal supporters have witnessed vote theft at every turn , but now the party bosses are is definitely cracking down .
Conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher told the hosts of Fox and Friends .
“ There is no question that this could be a major headache for McCain .
“ John McCain would be well - served to kind of reach out and give him an olive branch at the convention , ” Gallagher continued .
“ Let him speak , give him a role , because if these people are disrespected — you know , this , combined with Bob Barr ’s announcement that Barr now is running as a Libertarian — is going to just take votes away from John McCain and could be a disaster for the Republican Party . ”

Despite its name , the iKit ( sadly ) has nothing to do with Michael Knight or his coche fantástico .
Instead , it is the kind of tiny handheld computer we longed for in the 1980s – a folding , QWERTY - equipped pocket computer with Wi -Fi , webcam , movie and music playback and Bluetooth .
The iKit is designed to be an always - on internet device .
The trouble starts immediately .
The iKit has just 192MB inside , split between ROM and RAM .
The SD card slot means you can boost that to 8GB .
Battery life is listed at a decent 250 hours for standby , but in use you get a feeble three hours .
Worse , the iKit does n't come with any 3G connectivity .
The internal USB connection needs to be modified to accommodate an HSDPA dongle .
If we assume that the cell carriers will take care of that , then the iKit 's next USP goes out the window :
The press release claims that the iKit is cheaper than competitors , at £ 100 ( $ 172 ) .
How much cheaper than , say , an iPhone ? £ 500 ( $ 860 ) , apparently .
This figure is achieved by adding in the price of an 18 month iPhone contract .
Of course , you 'll need some kind of data plan to make the iKit work , too , so it seems like a rather unfair , if not desperate , comparison .
Indeed , the flailing continues .
Before reading the next sentence , take another look at the picture , specifically the picture on the left , and consider the aesthetics .
the elegant design mean that iKIT is the ultimate , portable multimedia device iKIT runs the multi-media and communication tools required by the teen and youth audience a very attractive device for a youth audience

Do you really think that this will pull the kids away from their iPhones ?
It 's not even a phone .
There 's only one place this device will end up , and it might a big enough market to save it :
In the hands of geeks .
Because it is Linux based , it could prove to be a very useful hacking platform , and that SD card slot means dropping in custom firmware should be a breeze .
We do n't like to be too down on companies trying to do things a little differently , but trying to push this little handheld through the usual subsidized telco markets looks like it will lead to a big failure .
Get this thing on Amazon or in Best Buy , though , and you 've got a possible nerd - phenomenon on your hands .

Atlanta ’s cops need this bad boy for SWAT raids on Bubba for selling weed .
It ’s no big deal , insists the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
It ’s just the local cops with a $ 500,000 APC .
For you civilians , that ’s Armored Personnel Carrier .
“ Do n’t be surprised to see an Army tank rolling down a street near you , ” chides the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
“ The Cobb County police department has refurbished a donated Armored Personnel Carrier for officers to use in SWAT situations . ”
Apparently , the cops think those on the receiving end of any SWAT operation using this military vehicle are armed to the teeth like the resistance in Iraq or maybe the Taliban in Afghanistan .
It certainly is not needed for busting the average dope dealer , even one hopped up on PCP .
Equipped with thermal sensors , computerized tracking devices , night vision , tear gas launchers and other gadgets , the all - black six - wheel unit can hold up to nine SWAT officers .
It has a new engine and transmission , which will allow it to reach a speed of 60 miles per hour .
“ In these times , you do n’t know what you are facing , ” Cobb police chief George Hatfield said .
“ We want the maximum safety for our officers and the public .
We want to be prepared for whatever comes up .
This is another tool that will allow us to be quicker and faster in our response . ”
The L.A.V. 300 will also send a message to the civilians — increasingly , there is little difference between the cops and the military .
In order to get the message out , the APC will be on display at Marietta ’s town square , reports the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .

Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur today signed onto a bill authored by Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio that would address the credit crisis by requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to change accounting practices that critics blame for problems .
Kaptur , who voted against a $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout package on Monday , said credit difficulties can be traced to accounting practices that require institutions to value their assets at fire - sale prices when markets for them have temporarily dried up .
" It 's a false credit crunch , " Kaptur said at a press conference to unveil the bill .
" It is not a real credit crunch .
The assets have value . "
The bill also would require the SEC to block traders from short selling stocks unless they first borrow shares , or ensure they can be borrowed .
It would also raise the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation account protection limit from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 as a way to eliminate runs on banks .
Kaptur said she 'd like to see an expedited procedure that banks can use to revise the terms of mortgages facing foreclosure , and to establish a Justice Department office that would investigate financial crimes that could have contributed to the current crisis and recover assets from those found guilty .
Kaptur discussed the bailout vote today on ABC's " Good Morning America , " which has posted video of her appearance , and is scheduled to appear at 7:30 PM on CNN 'S Lou Dobbs ' Tonight .
As the financial crisis crimps demand for American goods and services , the workers who produce them are losing their jobs by the tens of thousands .
Layoffs have arrived in force , like a wrenching second act in the unfolding crisis .
In just the last two weeks , the list of companies announcing their intention to cut workers has read like a Who ’s Who of corporate America : Merck , Yahoo , General Electric , Xerox , Pratt & Whitney , Goldman Sachs , Whirlpool , Bank of America , Alcoa , Coca - Cola , the Detroit automakers and nearly all the airlines .
When October ’s job losses are announced on Nov. 7 , three days after the presidential election , many economists expect the number to exceed 200,000 .
The current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is likely to rise , perhaps significantly .
“ My view is that it will be near 8 or 8.5 percent by the end of next year , ” said Nigel Gault , chief domestic economist at Global Insight , offering a forecast others share .
That would be the highest unemployment rate since the deep recession of the early 1980s .
Today we shipped the final release of Silverlight 2 .

Click here to learn more about this and download the free Silverlight Eclipse plugin .
Click here for a step - by - step tutorial that walks - through how to use their Eclipse tools today to build a Silverlight 2 application .
We are also announcing today that we are releasing the Silverlight XAML vocabulary and schema under the Open Specification Promise ( OSP ) , which enables anyone to create products that read and write XAML for Silverlight .
You can learn more about this announcement here .
Learning Silverlight 2
The best way to learn Silverlight 2 is to visit the www.silverlight.net web -site .
You can find free online tutorials , videos and training available there .
The site also hosts an online forum system where MVPs and Microsoft Silverlight team members will be able to help answer technical questions .
Also make sure to subscribe to the Silverlight Community RSS Feed , Jesse Liberty 's Blog , and Tim Heuer 's Blog for a daily dose of great Silverlight content .
I 've recently updated my Digg - client tutorial for the final Silverlight 2 release .
This provides an end to end walkthrough of a Silverlight 2 application , and helps explain the different programming concepts behind it ( controls , layout management , networking , data - binding , styles , user controls , control templates , etc ) .
If you are brand new to Silverlight or WPF development I recommend walking through it to understand the basics :
You can develop Silverlight 2 applications using any version of Visual Studio 2008 .
Simply install the Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 download to get Silverlight tooling support within it .
If you do not have VS 2008 , you can alternatively install the free Visual Web Developer 2008 Express SP1 Edition .
This free tool provides great ASP .
NET development tool support , and starting today also now supports Silverlight 2 development .
You can follow all of the steps in my tutorial above using the Visual Web Developer 2008 Express Edition - and get full intellisense , debugging , and deployment support .
Upgrading from the Beta
If you have the Beta2 or RC versions of the VS Tools for Silverlight , or the Silverlight 2 Beta SDK or Developer Editions of Silverlight 2 , please make sure to uninstall these completely before downloading and installing today 's release .
End users who have Silverlight 1 , or Silverlight 2 Beta1 or Beta2 will be automatically upgraded to the final Silverlight 2 release starting later this month .
Until then , if they visit a Silverlight 2 ( final release ) site , they will see the standard install prompt that a machine that does not have Silverlight installed would see .
Clicking it will upgrade their machines to the final release of Silverlight 2 ( there is no need for them to uninstall anything - Silverlight 2 will cleanly install over Silverlight 1 or the previous betas ) .
Because there are some breaking changes between Silverlight 2 Beta2 and the final Silverlight 2 release , end users who have the final Silverlight 2 release installed will not be able to run applications that are still targeting Silverlight Beta2 .
Most major Silverlight 2 sites plan to upgrade to the final release in the next 24 hours ( which will fix this issue ) - if you hit a site built with Beta2 before then you might experience trouble with it .
That should go away within about a day once all sites are updated though ( this was one reason why we released the public release candidate last month - to help developers get their sites ready for the final release ) .
Summary
Silverlight 2 is a major release that enables some great new application and media experiences to be built , and allows developers to use .NET within any browser to create them .
Thank you for all your support and feedback the last year as we 've worked on it .
All of us on the Silverlight team are really excited to see what you build with it . :-)

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Hard hats , transit workers , machinists , teachers and other labor unionists railed against the U.S. government ’s proposed bailout of Wall Street on Thursday in a protest steps from the New York Stock Exchange .
Several hundred protesters yelled their enthusiastic support as union leaders decried a proposed $ 700 billion plan aimed at reinvigorating the credit markets by relieving financial institutions of distressed debt .
“ The Bush administration wants us to pay the freight for a Wall Street bailout that does not even begin to address the roots of our crisis , ” said AFL - CIO National President John Sweeney .
“ We want our tax dollars used to provide a hand up for the millions of working people who live on Main Street and not a handout to a privileged band of overpaid executives . ”
Signs read “ No Blank Checks For Wall Street ” and “ Our Hard - Earned Pensions Are Not Up For Grabs . ”
Protesters cheered repeated calls for the government to spend money on education , health care and housing as freely and readily as it was proposing to do for Wall Street .
“ We know that the economic situation has to be solved .
But we want a responsible rescue , not an opportunistic bailout , ” said United Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten .
“ And that means , just like every single boss says to me , that there should be accountability for the teachers , then there should be accountability for Wall Street , ” he said .
“ The bailout is a sellout unless it includes the victims of the tyranny , ” civil rights activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson told reporters after the rally .
“ The homeowners need long - term , low interest rate loans and the restructuring of loans , not the repossession of homes . ”
“ This is a Roosevelt moment , ” Jackson said , referring to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s program to lift the United States out of the Great Depression .
“ It ’s time for reconstruction of manufacturing law , trade law and banking transparency . ”
Sure you can go crazy and drop a few hundred bucks on a high - tech door lock , or you can follow the lead of the folks from Makers Local 256 and build this USB - authenticated deadbolt , which should set you back just $ 60 -- or no doubt less if you can scavenge up some spare parts .
The setup is based on Arduino 's slightly lesser known cousin the Freeduino , and effectively turns any standard USB thumb drive into a key , which can be just as easily lost or misplaced as a regular key but not as easily duplicated .
What 's more , it 's not the data on the drive that gets read by the lock , but rather the serial number on a chip , which leaves the rest of the drive free for you to use as you please .
Head on past the break to check it out in action .
Why did United Airlines ( UAUA ) stock suddenly plunge from $ 12 to $ 3 the other day ?
Because everyone on Wall Street thought the company had filed for bankruptcy .
Why did everyone on Wall Street think the company had filed for bankruptcy ?
Because :
The airline industry is reeling from $ 100 + oil , and airlines like United file for bankruptcy at the drop of a hat A news summary on Bloomberg ( incorrectly ) said the company had filed for bankruptcy .
We knew that much the other day .
And now we know the full story .
At 1 AM last Sunday morning , a 2002 article with the headline " UAL Files For Bankruptcy " suddenly appeared in the " Most Popular " section of the web site of the Tribune - owned Florida newspaper Sun-Sentinel .
Why did this happen ?
Tribune does n't explain precisely .
Because it happened at 1AM , however , it seems reasonable to assume that traffic to other stories on the site was very light , meaning that it did n't take much to make the story popular .
Googlebot found the article and made it searchable within Google News .
A non-detail - oriented securities analyst summarized the article ( apparently without reading it first ) and uploaded the summary to Bloomberg .
By Monday morning , UAL stock had plunged to $ 3 a share .
Tribune insists that the text of the article made it clear that the bankruptcy filing took place in 2002 -- and therefore denies responsibility .
Google News , run by an algorithm that does n't understand English , presumably also denies responsibility .
The Sun-Sentinel " Most Popular " widget presumably denies responsibility .
Which leaves the securities analyst , who , we gather , made a mistake .
( But we do imagine the SEC will be taking a peek into his and his relatives and friends bank accounts to see whether they have suddenly come into some unexplained cash ) .
Google , interestingly , says the story did not appear on the Google News headline pages but was merely available to those searching Google News .
It also points out that the story did not have any sort of dateline , that a date on the PAGE itself ( not within the story ) said September 7 , 2008 , and that it removed the article as soon as it was notified that it " had been posted in error . "
( Implication : by the Sun Sentinel ) .
Google also helpfully includes a snapshot of the first part of the article ( see below ) , which does NOT make it clear that it is from 2002 .
OUR VERDICT
Google 's Liability : None .
Based on the detailed evidence Google has provided ( see images and chronology below ) , we believe it is blameless .
The only date on the page that we can see is the current date , and the first several paragraphs of the story do NOT make it clear that the article is from 2002 .
Tribune 's Liability :
At least partial , possibly full .
The article should have had a dateline .
We challenge Tribune management to look at the screenshot Google provided and say with a straight face that a general - interest reader should have known that it was from 2002 .
Securities Analyst's Liability : Probably partial , possibly none .
We assume that the article eventually makes it clear that the article was from 2002 ( again , though , this does n't seem to be evident in the excerpt ) .
If so , the analyst should have been more careful .
Google 's findings and Tribune 's findings below :
GOOGLE's FINDINGS
Since our last post , some have asked why Google News did n't recognize that an old story relating to United Airlines ' 2002 bankruptcy was outdated .
We thought that a brief chronology would be helpful .
On Saturday , September 6th at 10:36 PM Pacific Daylight Time ( or Sunday , September 7th at 1:36 AM Eastern Daylight Time ) , the Google crawler detected a new link on the Florida Sun -Sentinel 's website in a section of the most viewed stories labeled " Popular Stories : Business . "
The link had newly appeared in that section since the last time Google News '
Googlebot webcrawler had visited the page ( nineteen minutes earlier ) , so the crawler followed the link and found an article titled " UAL Files for Bankruptcy . "
The article failed to include a standard newspaper article dateline , but the Sun -Sentinel page had a fresh date above the article on the top of the page of " September 7 , 2008 " ( Eastern ) .
Because the Sun-Sentinel included a link to the story in its " Popular Stories " section , and provided a date on the article page of September 7 , 2008 , the Google News algorithm indexed it as a new story .
We removed this story as soon as we were notified that it was posted in error .
While we do n't know why the Sun-Sentinel 's website included the link in its " Popular Stories " section , our timestamps show that Google News first crawled the UAL story after following the link from the Sun- Sentinel 's " Popular Stories " box :
At 10:17:35 PM / PDT , our crawler retrieved a copy of the Sun-Sentinel business section page .
As you can see , no UAL story appears at this time .
business section page .
As you can see , no UAL story appears at this time .
At 10:36:38 PM / PDT , our crawler retrieved an updated copy of the same section .
This updated version included a new link in the " Popular Stories : Business " section to a story titled " UAL Files for Bankruptcy . "
At 10:36:57 PM / PDT , our crawler followed the new link and fetched this copy of the UAL story .
At that point , our index was updated to include the article with the date that the story was crawled , and the story became searchable on Google News .
At that point , our index was updated to include the article with the date that the story was crawled , and the story became searchable on Google News .
At 10:39:57 PM / PDT , the Sun-Sentinel received its first referral to the UAL story from Google News , with a user clicking on a Google News link to the Sun -Sentinel 's UAL story .
The Tribune Co. ( owner of the Sun- Sentinel ) has confirmed in its September 9 , 2008 press release that the first referral from Google News to the article came after the UAL story appeared in the " Popular Stories " section .
We hope that this sheds some light on the situation from our perspective .
TRIBUNE's FINDINGS :
The December 10 , 2002 , Chicago Tribune article on United Airlines ' bankruptcy filing , along with thousands of others stories in the searchable database of the Sun Sentinel website , was accessible for years .
Our records show that due to traffic volume , sometime between 1:00:34 a.m. EDT , Sunday , September 7 ( 10:00:34 p.m. PDT , Saturday , September 6 ) and 1:36:03 a.m. EDT , Sunday , September 7 ( 10:36:03 p.m. PDT , Saturday , September 6 ) , a link to the old article appeared in a dynamic portion of the Sun Sentinel 's business section , grouped with other stories under a tab entitled " Popular Stories Business : Most Viewed . "
No new story was published and the old story was not re-published -- a link to the old story was merely provided .
Importantly , the URL for the old story did not change when the link appeared on the website 's business section .
At 1:36:57 a.m. EDT , September 7 , ( 10:36:57 p.m. PDT , September 6 ) , our records show that the Google search agent -- known as " Googlebot " -- crawled the story on Sun Sentinel 's website .
Our records also show that the Google search agent had previously crawled this same story numerous times , including as recently as last week .
Shortly after Googlebot crawled the Sun Sentinel site this time , however , a link to the story appeared on Google News , with a date of Sept. 6 , 2008 , provided by Google .
At 1:39:59 a.m. EDT , September 7 ( 10:39:59 p.m. PDT , September 6 ) , our records show the story on the Sun Sentinel website received its first referral from Google News .
Apparently sometime Monday morning , the story was made available to subscribers of Bloomberg News .
As we said yesterday , the December 10 , 2002 , story contains information that would clearly lead a reader to the conclusion that it was related to events in 2002 .
In addition , the comments posted along with the story are dated 2002 .
It appears that no one who passed this story along actually bothered to read the story itself .
Ocean Buoys to Provide 10 % of US Energy Requirements
September 25th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
With so much of our planet covered in the stuff , it is a surprise that water does not receive the attention that renewable technologies like wind and solar do .
Nevertheless , with renewable energy being the catchphrase of many countries at the moment , advancements are being made towards a future where our oceans will provide us with electricity .
After two years , an oversized yellow buoy floating five miles off the southern tip of Long Beach Island has definitely proved its technology feasible .
With the rise and fall of each wave , pistons slide up and down inside a cylinder within the buoy , generating electricity .
Though the little buoy does n’t make much in the way of electricity , it makes enough to power its onboard systems , and the occasional message back home , to its manufacturer , Ocean Power Technologies of Pennington , N.J. Co-founder of OPT George W. Taylor , a 74 - year - old engineer , grew up a young surfer in Australia ( the best place to be a young surfer ) and knew all about the power of the ocean .
Taylor looks at his one buoy as the predecessor for large farms of buoys , all generating electricity across the planet , on coasts with much larger waves than New Jersey .
Indeed , ocean energy is “ probably the last of the large natural resources not yet investigated for producing electricity in the United States , ” according to a report from the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute .
Roger Bedard , the EPR institute ’s ocean energy expert , believes that the potential for hydro electricity generation is “ significant . ”
In fact , he believes it could generate up to 10 % of America ’s power needs , accounting all current inefficiencies and practicalities .
Perhaps , in the future , that 10 % could grow as power grids change and adapt to handle the sometimes irregular influx of power generated from wind , solar and water .
Europe is already well ahead of the US in terms of ocean technology .
Only recently did a wave farm begin operations in Portugal , and plans are popping up all across the UK – including off the western coasts – to make use of the violent North Atlantic .

( Recasts , adds reaction , details , prvs NEWPORT NEWS )
By Jason Szep
ENGLEWOOD , Col. , Oct 4 - Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin accused Democratic candidate Barack Obama on Saturday of “ palling around with terrorists , ” in the latest sign the campaign is turning increasingly nasty .
The comment by Palin , whose running mate John McCain is vying against Obama for president in the Nov. 4 election , was dismissed by the Obama campaign as “ gutter politics ” and came shortly after the McCain campaign had already called the U.S. senator from Illinois a liar .
With polls showing McCain trailing Obama in many battleground states , including several won by Republicans in the 2004 election , Palin said “ There is a time when it ’s necessary to take the gloves off and that time is right now . ”
Speaking at a fund - raiser in Englewood , Colorado , she launched an assault on Obama just days after both candidates urged Congress to set aside partisan politics to pass a $ 700 billion bad - debt securities package in a bid to free up frozen credit markets .
“ Our opponent though is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country , ” Palin said of Obama , also calling him an embarrassment .
Palin cited a New York Times story on Saturday that examined Obama ’s relationship with Bill Ayers , a former member of the Vietnam - era militant Weather Underground organization who is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
The Times concluded they were not close .
Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said , “ Today , the McCain - Palin team took their discredited , dishonorable campaign one desperate step further , announcing that they were going to try ‘ turning a page on this financial crisis ’ and launching more personal attacks on Senator Obama . ”
“ Instead of offering solutions for working Americans and families struggling through a failing economy , they have offered more gutter politics and false attacks , ” he said in a statement .
Obama served with Ayers on the board of a foundation in Chicago , and has said he was only eight - years - old when the Weather Underground committed its best - known bombing .
He has also noted that former President Bill Clinton pardoned two members of the group during the last days of his presidency .
Earlier , McCain ’s campaign called Obama a bald - faced liar in reference to how he characterized the Republican ’s plan to reform health insurance .
“ When you read the fine print , it ’s clear that John McCain is pulling an old Washington bait and switch .
It ’s a shell game , ” Obama said of McCain ’s plan to reform health insurance .
“ He gives you a tax credit with one hand but he raises your taxes with the other , ” the senator from Illinois told a crowd of about 18,000 supporters in Newport News , Virginia .
‘ BALD - FACED LIE ’
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds shot back , “ Barack Obama is lying to voters .
...
It ’s a bald - faced lie . ”
After a week where congressional negotiations over the financial rescue package dominated the campaign , Obama had hoped to use his rally in Virginia to refocus the political discourse on health insurance and economic policy .
Health insurance is an emotive issue , with some 45 million Americans living without coverage and others worried about losing coverage if they lose their jobs in the economic slump .
Both campaigns say they will improve access to health insurance and make care more affordable .
On Saturday , both campaigns derided the other ’s plan as “ radical . ”
The sharp exchanges came as the more than year - long campaign enters its last month .
New polls show Obama has solidified his national lead and gained an edge in crucial battleground states in recent weeks as the Wall Street crisis focused the attention of voters on the weakening economy .
McCain and Obama will get to spar in person on Tuesday when they meet for the second of three nationally televised presidential debates , this one in Nashville , Tennessee .
Later , at a rally in Carson , California , Palin again said the Republican campaign would become more negative .
“ As one of my campaign staffers reminded me as I was walking out , ‘ Ok now the heels are on , the gloves come off ’ , ” she told thousand of people at a rally in a sports stadium .
Recent polls show McCain in a dogfight in Ohio , Florida , Virginia , North Carolina , Colorado , Missouri and Indiana .
All were won by President George W. Bush in 2004 , and McCain cannot afford to lose them as he tries to piece together the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House .
5 Best LED Grow Lights | 2020 Ultimate Buyer ’s Guide
In this guide , you will learn about TOP - 5 best LED grow lights and their types : clusters and single broad - spectrum models making UV and white light .
Today , we ’re going to look at some small manageable panels that would be excellent for indoor or hot house growing , and even for light tanning potentially .
We ’ll also discuss what these things may soon become .
Find out how these items work and what things you should pay attention to while shopping for a new one .
You will be able to grow marijuana at home all year round ( just first find out whether it is legal in your state ) or exquisite herbs such as basil and rosemary .
What You Will Learn From This Guide :
How LED Grow Lights Work
LED bulbs produce light due electricity flowing through them , but some energy not being permitted to leave .
Diodes allow current to only flow in one direction , and so the resistance is shed as light .
The chemical makeup of the LED ’s material determines the type of light they shed .
Some light is easy to produce with a little chemistry , others took a lot of work .
A full spectrum LED is actually a tricky thing .
Some produce it with clusters of single - color LEDs to emit some or all of the spectra you want .
Others have a complex chemistry feat , managing to emit all of them from a single component .
This is done based on voltages fed into them .
Some of these broad spectrum LED panels only emit white and UV light .
LEDs can produce white light as actual white light , rather than combining component sources to produce it .
Others are more advanced , capable of individual colors as well .
What are the Types of LED Lights ?
We touched on this a little bit in looking at how the technology works .
There are a few different ways these can be implemented .
It ’s more about how the multispectrum light is achieved .
Is it a cluster of LEDs , or is it a single broad - spectrum LED ?
If it ’s a single broad - spectrum LED , is it just making UV and white light ?
Most of these models are rectangular panels , fairly thin ( about as thick as an old DVD player ) , and lined with a matrix of LEDs .
They can be mounted on walls , hung from ceilings , mount - hung from ceilings , placed on stands , really anything .
They weigh very little , and consist primarily of one or two thin , long controller boards at either or both ends of the matrix , depending on its size .
Along with this will be a voltage control component , and a microcontroller / microchip to control complex lighting tasks .
So , there ’s not much to these devices .
There may also be fans in some of them , or at least breather panels , to allow the heat produced by broad - spectrum light to be shed rather than damage the LEDs and their board .
What to Look for When Buying
So , this is n’t a super complex technology aside from the “ gee whiz ” aspects of how an LED itself works .
They are an affordable , quickly - made product , and outside displays and some future materials tricks we pull , their main purpose is illumination , and in this case , illumination that can help plants grow .
This means that while there are things to pay attention to while shopping for these , it ’s not as complex as it could be with other products .
But , let ’s look at some of these factors , and keep them in mind .
Light Types – Full spectrum grow lights do n’t necessarily produce every basic light type singularly .
Some , as we said , are actually white light and UV , and there ’s no way for them to select one of the RGB components discreetly .
This is fine for green houses .
– Full spectrum grow lights do n’t necessarily produce every basic light type singularly .
Some , as we said , are actually white light and UV , and there ’s no way for them to select one of the RGB components discreetly .
This is fine for green houses .
Form Factor –
They all have a more or less similar form factor , but some are broader and thinner ( producing more light surface ) , while others are dense and squat .
Both have their strong points , as the condensed ones provide a more directional , concentrated UV source .
– They all have a more or less similar form factor , but some are broader and thinner ( producing more light surface ) , while others are dense and squat .
Both have their strong points , as the condensed ones provide a more directional , concentrated UV source .
Controllable Strength –
You will want , if possible , to be able to control the strength of the light being put out .
Too much UV can cook some plants , too little can starve others .
This also prevents you from being burned , as UV will burn you if overexposed .
It ’s called a sunburn .

If you set specific durations and times for the lights , you could reliably produce a circadian cycle for your hot house .
This will be useful for space colonization .
TOP - 5 Best LED Grow Lights
Below , you will find TOP - 5 best products available on the market within the price range from $ 70 to $ 300 .
They differ in the number of LEDs and their design .
Most of the models are chunky panels that are not hangable from the ceiling , however , there is an option of a thin panel that is both mountable to the walls and hangable from the ceiling .
Standard LED Grow Light | Relassy
This one is basically a standard concept for an LED grow light , providing whitish / yellowish light , and UV .
It will illuminate an area , but not blindingly brightly , still plenty of light to see .
It attempts to look like real sunlight , with the same yellowish tint that it naturally has .
It uses two control boards , being dual - matrix , which has its ups and its downs , but this is to allow it to fold .
Features
LED Count : 338 LEDs .
Matrix Count : One .
Type : Yellow / white and UV .
Timer : Yes , 4/8/12 hour settings .
Form Factor : Thin panel .
Wall Mountable : Yes .
Hangable from Ceiling : Yes .
Runs Hot : Not terribly .
RGB : Not on this one .
Performance
This is really a bog standard LED grow light .
It produces a slightly unappealing yellowish light , which is a wee bit sicklier than real sunlight .
I would prefer plain white light to denote UV activity myself .
But , it ’s affordable , it ’ll work , and the design is more than suitable .
I could see this in a hot house or just for indoor growing of things .
The overheat detection is nice , meaning this thing wo n’t ever get too hot , and is a nice peace of mind .
Pros Cons Affordable .
Thin .
Aims for realistic sunlight .
Power - smart .
Does n’t run too hot .
No RGB .
Light looks a little sickly to me .
Conclusion
This is a fine light for just a hot house or other enclosure , but not ones I ’d recommend for areas where you spend a lot of time .
It ’s not a bad light , but it ’s a little basic in some ways .

Mixed - Channel 1500W LED Grow Lights | Yehsence
This is an example of mixed - channel sources , which puts out a mix of blues and reds , plus strong UV itself .
This has base channels , and triple chips , putting out a unique kind of mixed light .
However , this one does not produce white or any pure colors , resulting a weird reddish light .
I find it pleasant , but others might not .
One nice thing is the solidity of the chip design .
Zener diodes regulate power better to make the LEDs last longer and stand up to abuse .
Features
LED Count : 300 LEDs .
Matrix Count : One .
Type : Proprietary .
Timer : No .
Form Factor : Chunky panel .
Wall Mountable : No ( fans ) .
Hangable from Ceiling : No ( fans ) .
Runs Hot : Not terribly .
RGB : Not on this one .
Performance
So , the gimmick with this one is varied intensities of UV and visible light , which are more ideal for different growing stages ( or for sensitive plants ) .
This is not a bad idea , but this could be achieved with more accoutrements .
The light , while it does n’t bother me , might be unpleasant to other people , but it is a solid way to do a gradual exposure setup .
Pros Cons Cyclical growing design .
Solid construction .
Good venting .
Long lifespan .
Power smart .
No RGB .
Light might be weird to some .
Simplistic controls .
Conclusion
This is for more precise growing , but it works well for it .
However , the weird light might put some people off .
There are better looking options ( though similar ) from these .

Best Looking LED Grow Lights | VIPARSPECTRA
This one produces the most pleasant light .
Yes , it does have a largely bluish or reddish hue , but the three channels produce nicer lights .
The blue is soft ( this is UV ) .
IR is very dim and scarcely visible .
Like the one before it , it does have different cycles in mind , but works fine for emulating a day , or attending to different picky plants .
The thing that stands out about this one is , it ’s better looking both in case and in light emission , than most others on here .
It is , however , not quite as sturdy nor powerful .
It is n’t pointlessly week , though .
Features
LED Count : 80 LEDs .
Matrix Count : Four .
Type : Proprietary .
Timer : No .
Form Factor : Chunky panel .
Wall Mountable : No ( fans ) .
Hangable from Ceiling : No ( fans ) .
Runs Hot : Not terribly .
RGB : Sort of yes .
Performance
This is the best looking one , it looks like a modern box itself , and the three kinds of light are just easier to be around than with others like this .
It ’s simplistic , and it ’s not as powerful as others , but it ’s not so weak as to be not good enough for what it does .
The fans mean it can only be hung by chains / tethers from the ceiling .
Pros Cons Pleasant light .
Nice design .
Power smart .
Affordable .
Not as powerful as some .
Slightly fragile if it falls .
Daisy chaining concept is cute , but hazardous .
Conclusion
This one ’s not bad at all .
It makes weird light ( all the rest of these do ) , but this one ’s is more pleasant .
Be careful daisy chaining them , though .

Compact 2000W Double Chips LED Grow Lights | King Plus
This one unfortunately produces that “ ugly ” pinkish light , but this one has its advantages .
It ’s very powerful and compact , which means it ’s easy to pack these , though you should n’t daisy chain them .
Features
LED Count : 80 LEDs .
Matrix Count : Two .
Type : Proprietary .
Timer : No .
Form Factor : Chunky panel .
Wall Mountable : No ( fans ) .
Hangable from Ceiling : No ( fans ) .
Runs Hot : Not terribly .
RGB : Not on this one .
Performance
Okay so this is n’t that different from the second one on this list , aside from its form factor being a little boxier .
As such , it focuses on a gradual strength plan for most growing , and it produces a weird kind of light as a result .
Okay , so the appeal of the light is n’t the primary focus with grow lights – growing things is .
However , remember that plants take a lot of maintenance , which means you will be exposed to this light for protracted periods of time .
That means if the light bugs you , that ’s going to be an issue .
It ca n’t really harm you , of course , it ’s just ugly .
Pros Cons Long - lasting .
Powerful .
Ugly light .
Heavy .
Expensive .
Conclusion
This is a more durable version of the second one , with the same strengths and weaknesses otherwise .
It works fine , just ugly light comes from it .

Best LED Grow Lights for Hydroponics , 3000W | BESTVA
This intense purple - skewed light is designed with hydroponics in mind , where the others are more just for enclosed growing of whatever form .
That said , this one is most performant for those environments .
Features
LED Count : Not Listed .
Matrix Count : Not Listed .
Type : Proprietary .
Timer : No .
Form Factor : Chunky panel .
Wall Mountable : No ( fans ) .
Hangable from Ceiling : No ( fans ) .

RGB : Not on this one .
Performance
So , this one works just fine for hydroponics , which is still a burgeoning science all these years later .
With the proper setup , you could grow tropical fruit in an enclosure while snow and sleet fall around you outside .
This has a lot of potential for fighting hunger in the future .
If you can supply water , power , and plant food , you can grow anything anywhere with this and a heat source .
It ’s pretty impressive when you think about it .
Pros Cons Long - lasting .
Powerful .
Ugly light .
Heavy .
Expensive .
Conclusion
If your focus is hydroponics , then this is the grow light for you .
I really would say the light is ugly from it too , but most of them are .
You can also have other illumination present to make the atmosphere more organic .

Making Your Plants Grow Taller and Faster
Light is particularly essential to plants as it is converted into energy through photosynthesis and determines the direction of their growth , the size of their leaves as well as the moment when the plant starts to flower .
Thus , different kinds of light and the way they are mounted result in a different response .
In fact , this is about the wavelengths , with the visible longer ones being of the red color and the shorter ones being violet .
At the same time , there are kinds of light that cannot be seen but are physically felt by humans .
It is these longer wavelengths , known as infrared light , that generate warmth .
On the other hand , we have ultraviolet ( UV ) lights that are smaller than those of the violet color and are able to burn the exposed surfaces .
Andrew McAllister , a PhD student in the Applied Physics program at the University of Michigan , specifies what kinds of light should be used depending on what a farmer wants to achieve .
So chlorophyll , a pigment giving the plant its green color , is used in producing energy .
You might be surprised but most leaves typically have a green color because this chemical prefers blue and red light .
In order to change the direction of the plant growth as well as the size and the number of leaves , use red light .
This is due to phytochromes , the plant 's photoreceptors that are responsible for detecting light .
Another chemical compound , cryptochromes , responds to blue light and determines the time when the plant starts to flower .
How to Maximize Cannabis Yield
According to Lighting Research Center , at present , 48 % of growers use supplemental lighting to grow crops , what makes these technologies particularly valuable for those who make produce marijuana indoors .
Apart from helping to yield crops , LED lights are energy efficient , allowing to reduce your energy bills .
On top of that , this results in the increased cannabinoid content in plants grown under light .
Scientists from Dominican University have conducted a study and tested 45 marijuana plants grown with the use of this technology .
The tests have shown an impressive range of full spectrum lighting for cannabis .
“ To do the job , the correct PAR value in consideration to plant photosynthesis is critical .
Further analysis will show the correct red and blue spectrum required by plants to gain nutrients and photosynthesis , ” the researchers concluded .
The idea is that you get a color range that is perfect for marijuana to grow , without any excess illumination .
In addition , such cannabis plants have elevated THC levels .
Using a hydroponic environment that includes dehumidiﬁers , lighting and irrigation facilities is essential for growing marijuana indoors , says Mel Thomas in his book “ Cannabis Cultivation .
A Complete Grower ’s Guide . ”
This fact is supported by experience of cannabis growers who managed to yield large crops in an enclosed space .
A 50 - Pint Dehumidifier with Humidity Control for some $ 200 is designed for a continuous operation .
However , in this case you should place it near a low - level drain .
You may want a an electric Mini Dehumidifier that covers an area of 150 square feet .
This option is 4 times cheaper but is lightweight and portable .
A wise choice is to acquire a temperature controller that comes with a humidity controller .
Both gadgets have the calibration function and emit an alarm signal when either temperature or humidity fall outside a specified range .
Where Is Growing Marijuana Legal
In the US ?
Before anything else , check you state to make sure it is legal there .
Cannabis is permitted in 33 states but this is about using the plant for medical purposes , while recreational marijuana is only legal in 10 states .
On top of that , just some of these state allow for its production at home and there are certain limitations .
So in the District of Columbia , it is legal to grow no more than 6 plants for recreational purposes .
The same rules are applied in Alaska .
Residents of Arizona may produce up to 12 plants at a time but the crop must be intended only for medical purposes .
On top of that , the farm can be located at least 25 miles away from a medical cannabis dispensary .
In California , only medical marijuana can be produced at home , with the number of plants amounting just to six ones .
Cannabis production in Colorado is limited to 12 plants while selling the crop to other people is forbidden there .
As you can see , policies regarding the medical and recreational use of marijuana vary significantly depending on the region .
In addition , some states prohibit transportation of home - grown marijuana to another state , even where cannabis is legal .
How to Use LED Grow Lights Properly : My Personal Experience
I wo n’t lie and say I ’ve ever used an LED grow light to actually grow a garden in a hot house or the like .
I am not a nature man , nor an agrarian sort .
Sure in college I grew something , you know , but never very well .
However , I have used this concept .
Being a nerd , I am not a huge day time and bright light fan .
I tend to like to keep sunlight coming in to a minimum .
However , I liked having live plants in my house in various places .
They were constantly sun starved , and would die .
I did n’t like the idea of a bunch of hot UV bulbs being in my house , and they ate a lot of power as waste heat .
So , I got hold of some early UV / white light LEDs .
They were n’t popular because this particular type did n’t make a very bright white light – about on par with twilight in brightness .
I preferred this .
So , I built some panels of these , small and concentrated , that are positioned tastefully on little stands next to plants , angled at their leaves .
For 10 hours a day ( 12 would cook them due to its persistence ) , they would feed my plants some UV light .
Later designs , as I tinkered with this , had clusters of white and UV , just white , red , green and blue .
This was a costlier thing to design but still not bad enough to matter .
These could do other lighting when the UV cycle was over , which allowed some colorful mood lighting to be done .
I want to leave you with some warnings I became aware of with this , that these commercial panels may still have .
Be careful about over doing the UV you give your plants .
Yes , day and night are more or less 12 hour cycles on earth , but remember that this light is gradual , brightest at midday , but climbing and then reducing the rest of the time on a broad gradient .
UV lights are putting out a constant amount of energy .
Some plants do n’t mind it , but others do n’t like that much overload .
I did kill a few plants before I realized a shorter cycle at that constant power was ideal .
FAQ
Which LED grow lights are the best ?
It depends on the plant you ’re growing .
Do they use less electricity ?
Than what ?
Old sun lamp bulbs ?
Oh yes .
Will they hurt your eyes ?
Not generally .
Why , are you planning on staring into it ?
Do n’t do that to any LED unless it ’s a display .
Do LED grow lights work for weed ?
Yes .
Yes , they do .
Plants are plants .
Pros & Cons of Using These Products
Pros
Allow “ natural ” light in controlled environments .
More power - smart than UV bulbs or the like .
Less taxing on a grow house ’s heat .
Affordable technology .
Well - understood implementation of a technology .
Cons
Most of them make ugly light .
They ’re affordable , but that ’s not the same as “ cheap ” .
They usually have to hang from ceiling suspension to breathe .
LED Grow Lights : Explaining the Technologies Behind
Illumination is an interesting hallmark of technology .
Before the digital revolution , people often demarked the “ modern ” world from the “ ancient ” world via the presence of artificial light .
It still sounds surreal to realize that electric lights are well over a century old .
Of course , the early devices were a hellish nightmare in actuality .
Edison ’s first bulb had a vacuum .
The filament oscillating in a vacuum , where heat energy could n’t be conducted , resulted in x-ray emissions to shed the energy .
Neon , or more accurately , fluorescent options are almost as old as bulbs .
Tesla famously invented them while working with Edison , and was one of the two disagreements that split them up ultimately .
LEDs , conversely , are somewhat newer .
They ’ve existed since the 1960s ( arguably 50s ) , but had minimal practical uses until multiple colors of them at a small enough size , became affordable .
I gave you this brief glance at lighting for a reason – what ’s happening to lighting now is very interesting .
LEDs are such a powerful and effective innovation , that they ’re reshaping our world .
We ’re moving into a period of tech history where we illuminate our homes and devices , and display our graphics all with the same technology , with scale being the only real difference across them .
In the near future , they will be able to produce LEDs as small as a human cell .
This will result in flexible displays , woven - in lighting for clothing , exterior coating that can render images , and much more .
Backlights will not be needed as the pixels will be luminous .
Currently , though , another implementation of LEDs is quite fascinating , and has a lot of potential .
The big struggle with LEDs has n’t been the miniaturization – once the LED type was designed , making small versions was n’t too big a deal , comparatively speaking .
It ’s always been about the light they can emit .
It was n’t until the 1990s that blue LEDs were finally figured out ( thus opening up their use for displays ) .
Other wavelengths have proven easier or more elusive .
Infrared turned out to be easy , and is used to this day for a lot of remote controls , pulses of infrared light being sensed by the device .
This is gradually being phased out by Bluetooth and other high - end wireless technologies .
Ultraviolet , however , has been a struggle .
Today , full - spectrum LEDs can produce infrared , visible , and ultraviolet light .
Being a powerful wavelength , getting LEDs to emit strong UV is an accomplishment of note .
But , what ’s more interesting with these , is the practical applications that this technology can allow .
Presently , sun lamps require special bulbs that emit UV , a critical component that makes sunlight as powerful and necessary as it is .
Plants require a UV rich light to grow , and humans need some exposure to it for health .
With lighting panels that can emit UV and visible light , literally any light source could potentially be a source of controlled “ sunlight ” .
For the far flung future , imagine what this could do for the space program ?
For now , this has immediate ramifications for agriculture .
Conclusion
This technology ’s real appeal is how easy it is to implement , and how affordable it is .
This opens up a once tricky enterprise to people in all climates , able to grow things in controlled environments that are much easier to control .
In the future , this technology will play a much bigger role , helping to feed people better , a big problem in the modern world .
Space exploration and colonization will rely very much on future versions of this concept as well .
One of these will work for your needs , for certain .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Loose regulation , now blamed for ills ranging from the U.S. financial crisis to imports of tainted Chinese goods , is drawing increasing fire from opponents of the Bush administration ’s environment program .
U.S. President George W. Bush stands by as the new Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson is sworn in at EPA headquarters in Washington , May 23 , 2005 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
In the final months of President George W. Bush ’s two terms in office , criticism about the use of regulation instead of legislation to craft environmental policy has grown louder .
That is amplified by the campaign for the U.S. presidential election on November 4 , with both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama staking out environmental positions at odds with the current administration .
The environment is important to U.S. voters but ranks far below their top concern , the economy and jobs , according to a sampling on PollingReport.com .
A CNN poll in July found 66 percent said the environment was important or very important in choosing a president , compared with 93 percent who said the same about the economy .
On a broad range of environmental issues -- climate - warming carbon emissions , protecting endangered species , clean air and water preservation , the cleanup of toxic pollution -- opponents in and out of government have taken aim at the White House for failing to tighten some rules and loosening others .
“ The Bush administration ’s long - standing efforts to weaken environmental regulations to benefit narrow special interests come with a terrible cost , ” said Sen. Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat who has led the charge .
“ If you ca n’t breathe because the air is polluted , you ca n’t go to work .
If your kids ca n’t breathe , they ca n’t go to school . ”
Frank O’Donnell , of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch , agreed , saying that “ the hallmark of Bush administration policy on the environment is a lack of regulation . ”
One Capitol Hill staffer familiar with legislation on global warming accused the Bush administration of actively seeking to undermine measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions that spur climate change .
“ They were the biggest obstacle to progress , ” the staffer said .
“ They did everything possible to ensure that nothing would happen . ”
James Connaughton , who heads the White House Council on Environmental Quality , vehemently disagreed , saying the Bush administration has equaled or exceeded the environmental accomplishments of its predecessors , sometimes through regulation and other times by the use of incentives .
Connaughton took aim at states , notably California , for setting high environmental standards but failing to meet them .
He specifically faulted Congress for failing to reinstate the Clean Air Interstate Rule , which would have curbed power plant pollution , after a federal appeals court rejected it in July .
EMISSIONS AND POLAR BEARS
Bush promised to regulate carbon emissions when he ran for president in 2000 but quickly reversed course once in the White House , saying any mandatory cap on greenhouse gases would cost U.S. jobs and give an unfair advantage to fast - developing economies like China and India .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2007 that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) had the power to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants if they posed a danger to human health .
The EPA delayed a decision on the so - called endangerment finding , making it highly likely that any regulatory action will be left to Obama or McCain when the winner of November ’s election takes office in January .
The Bush administration ’s record on designating endangered species has drawn widespread scorn from conservation groups .
So far , it has listed 58 species under the Endangered Species Act , compared with 522 under President Bill Clinton and 231 under President George H.W.
Bush , the current president ’s father , who served only one term in office .
For one high - profile species , the polar bear , the Bush administration waited until May 14 , one day before a court - ordered deadline , to list the big white bears as threatened by climate change .
Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said then that the listing would not curb climate change .
He noted he was taking administrative and regulatory action to make sure the decision was not “ abused to make global warming policy . ”
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the decision , calling it a “ common sense balancing ” between business and environmental concerns .
At a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on September 24 , Boxer accused the Bush administration of trying to undermine the mission of the EPA and the Interior Department to protect public health and the environment .

A recent NDepend v2.10.2 feature is the analysis of Silverlight application .
Silverlight recently went from beta to 2.0 Release
Candidate 0 .
In this blog post I will first
compare Silverlight 2.0 RC0 and .NET Framework v3.5 SP1 assemblies .
I
will then compare Silverlight 2.0 RC0
and Silverlight 2.0 beta assemblies .
To do so , I ’ll use the Build Comparison feature of NDepend .
Silverlight 2.0 RC0 vs. .NET Framework v3.5 SP1
Let ’s notice first that
only the following assemblies can be compared : mscorlib , System , System .
Core , System .
Net , System .
Runtime .
Serialization ,
System.ServiceModel , System.ServiceModel.Web , System.Xml .
While the .NET Framework has numerous other
assemblies not supported by Silverlight ,
Silverlight comes with only 2 assemblies
not present in the .NET Framework : System .
Windows .
Browser and System .
Windows .
Another detail : the
assembly System.dll had been renamed
( I think by mistake ) system.dll in Silverlight ?!
SELECT TYPES WHERE IsPublic AND WasAdded
Silverlight has 44 new public
types .
41 of them are in the assembly System .
Net ,
and the public class System.Xml.XmlXapResolver
and the 2 enumerations System .
Xml.
DtdProcessing ,
System.Xml.NamespaceHandling are in the assembly System.Xml .
Interestingly enough , it is easy to see that these System .
Net types are in the assembly System of the regular .NET
Framework .
So the decision has been to move these types .
SELECT METHODS WHERE WasRemoved
By visualizing the .NET Framework methods removed in Silverlight with the NDepend metric / treemap
view , it is really obvious that Silverlight
is a mini-mini-.NET
Framework ( methods removed are in blue ) .
For the concerned
assemblies , 8 129 types on 9 989 have been removed .
It is even more impressing
in terms of methods , 72 515 methods on 90 574 have been removed .
In terms of IL
instructions , 1 607 974 IL instructions on 2 046 294 have
been removed , around 78.5 % !.
It is interesting to list the 100 namespaces that
have been completely discarded in Silverlight .
SELECT NAMESPACES WHERE WasRemoved ORDER BY NbTypes DESC , NbILInstructions DESC
Concerning dependencies , Microsoft did the work of removing many
dependencies to .NET Framework assemblies not part of the Silverlight release .
This can be shown with the following graph ,
where .NET Framework 3.5 SP1small
assemblies in yellow are considered by NDepend
as tier assemblies , because they are indeed not part of the list of assemblies
chosen .
Concerning Silverlight internal dependencies , the
following Dependency Matrix tells us that hopefully the Silverlight assemblies are layered , which is not the case of the
regular .NET Framework .
For example in
the regular .NET Framework mscorlib.dll and System.dll are mutually dependent .
Notice that we infer from the following matrix that there are no cycles between
assemblies of Silverlight , because
the matrix is triangularized .
Moreover , cells with a red tick
represent dependencies between assemblies that have been changed ( basically all
of them ) .
Cells with a red tick and a plus / minus ,
dependency represent dependencies between assemblies that have been created / removed especially for
Silverlight .
Here is the same set of Silverlight internal dependencies
represented with a graph .
Here , we infer from the graph that there are no
cycles between assemblies of Silverlight ,
because the graph is perfectly layered from top to bottom ( i.e there are no
rows that goes from bottom to top ) .
Silverlight 2.0 RC0 vs. Silverlight 2.0 beta
The delta between Silverlight
beta and RC0 is significant .
SELECT TYPES WHERE IsPublic AND WasAdded
73 public types have been added
( a lot of controls ) .
SELECT TYPES WHERE IsPublic AND WasRemoved
11 public types have been
removed .
By looking at the metric
view for methods added or refactored , it is pretty clear that a lot of work has
been done on controls in System .
Window ( methods added or refactored are in blue ) :
SELECT METHODS WHERE CodeWasChanged OR WasAdded
Analyzing your Silverlight application with
NDepend
To make possible Silverlight assemblies analysis , we
needed to tweak a bit how NDepend
resolves .NET Framework assemblies .
Indeed , not only NDepend analyzes the
code of your application , but also the code used by your application , what we
call Tiers Code .
And the .NET Framework code ( mscorlib ,
System . Core… ) is by - design tier code
for all .NET applications since all .NET Assemblies references mscorlib.dll ( except mscorlib.dll itself [ : ) ] ) .
As shown below , we added
the possibility to choose the .NET
Framework targeted .
There is no magic behind this , but just the
modification of the list of folders that contain the .NET Framework assemblies .
As you can see on the
screenshot above , NDepend references Silverlight beta assemblies version 2.0.30523.8 .
Silverlight RC0 has the version number 2.0.30923.0 and you then need to update the version number as
shown below .
Of course the next version of NDepend
will be updated .
In US economic decline , worst is yet to come Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday October 30 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
The US economy contracted in the third quarter as panicked consumers slashed spending , data showed Thursday in the first downside leg of what analysts say could be a deep and nasty recession .
In its first reading of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the July - September period , the Commerce Department said output of goods and services fell at a 0.3 percent annual pace amid a sharp retrenchment by consumers and businesses .
The drop in gross domestic product ( GDP ) was the first negative figure since the fourth quarter of 2007 .
The decline , not as steep as the 0.5 percent annualized drop expected by private economists , comes amid mounting expectations of a sharp falloff in the US economy amid the worst banking and financial crisis in decades .
Some analysts said the drop could be just the start of a deep and painful recession , which is normally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
" A heftier decline in real GDP is likely in the fourth quarter , which will confirm that the US economy is in recession , " said Dawn Desjardins , economist at RBC Capital Markets .
The decrease marked a sharp fall from the 2.8 percent growth rate of the second quarter and reflected weaker consumer and business spending and housing activity , offset in part by strong exports and government spending .
With the decline , economic output was estimated at an annualized 14.43 trillion dollars .
" What is noticeable is that the US economy is hanging onto support from exports that will not last in the fourth quarter , " said Avery Shenfeld , economist at CIBC World Markets .
" The rest of the world is slowing and the rising dollar will take some of the shine off exports .
The fourth quarter is going to be much worse , with a decline of perhaps as much as two percent . "
Consumer spending , the main driver of economic activity , fell 3.1 percent in the quarter on a sharp 14 percent plunge in spending on so - called durable goods like cars and appliances expected to last three years or more , the report showed .
Spending on nondurables such as food and clothing slid 6.4 percent , the biggest decline since 1950 .
" The drop in consumer spending was the largest since the recession in the early 1980s , " said Augustine Faucher at Economy.com .
" Households are cutting back because of the end of the tax rebates , tighter credit , the worsening labor market , falling house prices , the drop in the stock market , and general angst . "
In housing , which has seen a horrific meltdown after a long boom , investment fell 19.1 percent , a major drag on the economy .
While the decline in activity was mild , the report comes amid expectations for one of the worst recessions in decades as the economy is strangled by a collapse in credit amid troubles from banks that bet on the US property bubble .
Ian Shepherdson , chief US economist at High Frequency Economics , noted the GDP number would have been even weaker without accounting for companies building up inventories , which added 0.5 percentage points on the positive side .
" This is the first of a run of negative GDP numbers , " he said .
" The economy is in recession .
We tentatively expect GDP of minus one percent in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2009 . "
Activity had been supported in the second quarter by a big US government stimulus plan that sent out tens of billions of dollars in tax rebates to consumers , but the impact of that has now faded .
Exports , a main source of economic activity earlier this year , also helped keep the GDP figure from being weaker but growth slowed to 5.9 percent in the third quarter from 12.3 percent in the second .
Peter Kretzmer , economist at Bank of America , said another factor skewing the report was a 5.8 percent jump in government purchases , including an 18.2 percent annualized jump in federal defense purchases , which added 0.9 percentage points to GDP .
" We expect a faster pace of GDP decline in the current quarter , as capital spending declines far more rapidly , inventories are reduced at a faster pace , the housing decline remains steep and federal defense spending simmers down , " he said .
Citigroup 's Steven Wieting said it could get even uglier : " Production and employment declines , credit tightening , and wealth destruction are clearly more severe in the current ( fourth ) quarter , which should show shrinkage in GDP in excess of the 3.0 percent decline posted in consumption last quarter .

How to become an obnoxious internet cam whore in five easy steps .
Ever wanted to become a trashy internet cam whore , but you just do n't know how ?
Tired of earning money for things the honest way ?
If you 're shameless and conceited enough , then the exciting world of online prostitution may be for you .
It 's hard at first , but do n't get discouraged .
Being a cranky bitch and undressing yourself in front of a cam for middle - aged men is n't as easy as it seems , so here are five simple rules to keep in mind when becoming an internet cam whore :
1 . Never smile .
Smiling gets you nowhere .
Guys totally dig ornery chicks who wallow in self - pity .
Be sure to give yourself a clever moniker like " SEX_GODDESS " or bring out the real cock tease inside you by naming yourself " 2_HOT_4_U . "
It 's very important to mope and look depressed because people do n't like talking to other people in a good mood .
Depressed losers are cool and totally original , do n't hold back !
One other subtle point : never use proper grammar or punctuation .
Why type " you 're " when you can type " ur " ?
Being coherent is overrated .
2 . Write bad poetry , and lots of it .
Writing bad poetry is easy when you disregard meter , pace , and rhyming scheme .
Just make sure to follow a few simple guidelines :
1 . Never write about anything cheerful .
Remember , you are a tortured artist .
Be one .
2 . Be sure to use the following words at least once per sentence , no fewer than 50 times per poem : lament , loathe , soul , darkness , bitter , agony , despair , misery , anguish , pain , suffer , woe , hate , death , love , sultry , angel , rose , acrid and nihilism .
Nihilism is a good one because it comes up all the time in normal conversations .
It 's easy , here 's a sample to get you started : fire ... burning ... agony ...
sultry shivers of a dark essence
why am i tortured with this nihilistic existence ?
bitter ... darkness ... despair .
notice the constant lower case ?
i added that touch to be unique .
unique people type in lower case .
3 . Turn up the brightness and contrast to hide blemishes in your complexion .
Are you worried that you 're not cut out to be a cam whore because you look like a stretched out sack of shit ?
No problem , just turn up the brightness and contrast to hide your skin blemishes !
Zits , black heads , and scars instantly vanish when you convince yourself that you 're not a pimply - faced salad dodger by manipulating your image .
Do n't worry about integrity , this is the internet , anything goes .
4 . Wear stupid trendy box - framed " EMO " glasses .
No pseudo - intellectual is complete without a pair of ultra-hip " EMO " glasses .
Just put them on and let the smart vibes flow .
A mere glance and people will be able to tell that you 're the type of person who reads Dostoevsky .
You wo n't be mistaken for anything short of an astro- physicist , or a theoretical physicist of some sort .
All physicists go to stupid raves , bleach their hair , and listen to angst - filled punk music because they do n't want to seem uncool in front of the other scientists .
If you want to go the extra mile and really seal the deal , wear plugs in your ear lobes so you have giant nasty sagging flaps of skin hanging off of your head .
It 'll look great when you pull your head out of your ass and go to a job interview some day .
Then again , you 're EMO ; you do n't need a job .
You 're totally unique , and all unique people wear box - framed nerd glasses .
Even though real nerds wear glasses like these , they 're not cool because they wear their glasses out of necessity .
5 . Make a wishlist and sell yourself for it .
Now comes the pay off for all your hard work .
Every cam whore needs to make a wishlist .
A wishlist is a list of items that you want , usually from a website such as Amazon , but unlike people who have to work for the things they buy , you want to sit around being a fat lazy bitch and still get the things you want without having to work for it .
Here 's a simple formula to keep in mind : YOU + WEBCAM - CLOTHES - DIGNITY = $ $$ Do n't let your dignity get in the way of your online prostitution .
It will seem hard at first to exploit fat , lonely losers who jerk off to pre-teen skanks , but it gets easier every time .
Just keep telling yourself that you 're only going to do this temporarily , and that you 're going to eventually go back to community college to finish up your associates degree in liberal arts .
Hint : always dress your best and wear makeup for your online audience .
Sure , other people may tell you that you 're a pathetic pig , and that what you 're doing is tantamount to prostitution , but they 're just jealous because total strangers are n't buying them anything .
Nevermind the fact that they have a job and earn their material excess without exploiting losers , or that the men watching you could be stalkers or rapists .
Do n't get caught up in details !
Have fun , it 's your life and it's your body : cheapen it !
That 's it , those are the simple rules to becoming an obnoxious internet cam whore .
It may seem like a lot of work at first , but keep it up and you 'll be sitting back and spreading your legs for books and CDs before you know it .

Cam whores despise me for exposing their fraud .
© 1997-2017 by Maddox
He said the two men arranged to meet in Leeds on April 23 this year and later went back to Morley 's house , where the defendant prepared a meal for them both before the pair went upstairs to his bedroom .
Image via WikipediaParody artist , accordion aficionado , and esteemed geek rocker Weird Al Yankovic has just announced via MySpace blog that a brand new song will be made available on iTunes next Tuesday – that 's October 7th for those of you watching in black and white .
This track has been touted as " a parody of a song that very recently was ( or perhaps still is ) the number one song in the country . "
This marks an interesting turn in Weird Al 's career because – as he admits in his blog entry – his typical 3 to 4 year album cycle often makes it difficult to both stay topical and to lampoon contemporary pop songs while they 're still high on the charts .
With recent hits from Kid Rock , Rihanna , and Katy Perry all ripe for derision and the nation abuzz with news of bailouts and VP debates , the question on fan 's minds obviously concerns where Weird Al plans to take the parody and which song will prove the most ample fodder .
But let us not forget in our excitement for new material the very interesting precedent this announcement sets .
For an artist like Weird Al , a man with a solid fan base but a somewhat less than regular output , digital distribution might just open up some exciting new doors .
In the same way that the relatively fast production time of a show like South Park allows the writers to skew current events as they unfold , the downloadable single ( when unfettered by the lengthy , often laborious wait for a full album release ) could easily give
Al the chance to lampoon popular songs and cultural developments while they are still at the very forefront of the American psyche .

Link of the day - Sway : The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior
More suicides ?
Fewer male births ?
Less back pain ?
More laxative sales ?
Data points litter the landscape as economists , sociologists , psychologists and marketers examine the societal changes , big and small , trivial and traumatic , that accompany a bad economy .
And with this particular version of a troubled economy — a stock market that goes into convulsions at 3 p.m. , a looming global recession , a $ 700 billion bailout plan that may or may not work , and a jittery public wondering what is coming next — changes should flow as freely as profits in good times .
It ’s one thing to measure changes in society , however , and another to ascribe causes .
But if the causal link is elusive , you still might expect to see slack soda sales , more frequent car thefts and meaning - laden tunes at the top of the pop charts during a recession .
Terry F. Pettijohn II , a professor of psychology at Coastal Carolina University , is one of those who sees popular tastes shift with economic conditions .
Take beauty , for example .
“ What we find attractive is not a stable currency , ” said Mr. Pettijohn , who has studied how economic and social factors shape preferences in popular music , movie stars and Playboy models .
“ It ’s affected by the environment , by what ’s happening in society , and what makes us feel more comfortable in threatening times . ”
Looking at Billboard No. 1 songs from 1955 to 2003 for a study to be published in the journal Psychology of Music , he found that in uncertain times , people tend to prefer songs that are longer , slower , with more meaningful themes .
“ It ’s ‘ Bridge Over Troubled Water , ’ and ‘ That ’s What Friends Are For , ’ ” he said .
“ In better times , it ’s more likely to be faster , upbeat songs like ‘ At the Hop ’ or ‘ My Sharona . ’ ”
The correlation is n’t perfect .
The song Mr. Pettijohn ’s raters called most meaningless , “ Macarena , ” was a hit in a relatively bad year .
The Environmental Security Hypothesis that he and his colleagues have been testing , positing that people look for reassurance in worrying times , also helped explain why Playboy magazine ’s Playmate of the Year in bad times tended to have a more mature appearance — that is , to be older , heavier , taller and less curvy — than those selected when times were good .
Similarly , in a study of American movie stars from 1932 to 1955 , he found actresses with mature features — small eyes , large chins , and thin faces — more popular in hard times .
Buying patterns too , can be predicted in economic downturns , according to Leo J. Shapiro , who has tracked consumer behavior since he was a young man in the late 1930s .
“ DURING a recession , laxatives go up , because people are under tremendous stress , and holding themselves back , ” said Mr. Shapiro , now chief executive of SAGE , a Chicago - based consulting firm .
“ During a boom , deodorant sales go up , because people are out dancing around .
When people have less money , they buy more of the things that have less water in them , things that are not so perishable .
Instead of lettuce and steak and fruit , it ’s rice and beans and grain and pasta .
Except this time the price of pasta ’s so high that it ’s beans and rice . ”
A recent Nielsen report listed tobacco , carbonated drinks and eggs as especially vulnerable to recession , and candy , beer and pasta sauce as recession - proof .
On Thursday , Hershey ’s announced third - quarter sales and income higher than last year’s .
( “ We offer a tremendous variety of affordable indulgences , and people love chocolate , even in hard times . ” said Kirk Saville , a company spokesman . )
Almost anything can be an economic indicator .
Back in the 1920s , the economist George Taylor conceived the hemline index , finding that skirts got longer as the economy slowed .
These days , there ’s been talk of a haircut index , with short locks signaling a market drop .
The economic downturn could signal significant changes in American life .
“ A stunning statistic is that unlike in past epochs , the higher up the income ladder you go , the more hours you work , ” said Dalton Conley , a sociology professor at New York University .
“ More and more , things that used to be outside the marketplace are in the economy .
Instead of mom or dad coming home with groceries , they go out , or order in . ”
A downturn , then , could result in benefits unmeasured by the market .
“ If people eat out less , the G.D.P. goes down , ” Mr. Conley said , “ but nothing in the G.D.P. captures what you gain if you cook and eat in a leisurely way with your kids . ”
In a study of coffee growers in Colombia , Grant Miller , who teaches health policy at Stanford ’s medical school , found that infant and child mortality rates fell as coffee prices slumped , and concluded that it was because parents had more time to take care of their children .
By most accounts , bad times herald an upturn in at least some crime .
“ I ’ve never been able to find any relationship between violent crime and the economy , ” said Stephen Raphael , an economics professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in urban and labor economics .
“ But there is a relationship with property crime .
Whether it ’s burglary , larceny or motor vehicle theft , they all go up with unemployment . ”
And already , the market drop has created many personal crises .
“ We ’ve never had this level of call volume ” said Dr. Richard A. Chaifetz , chief executive of ComPsych , the largest provider of employee assistance programs , covering 27 million people .
“ It ’s been going up gradually all year , but then it spiked and we ’re up 20 , 30 percent since late July .
And where relationships and personal psychology issues used to the be the No. 1 reason people called , it ’s now financial and legal issues that are No. 1 . ”
In a typical downturn , young people flock to higher education , especially lower - cost alternatives like community colleges , state universities and trade schools , to bolster their employability .
At the same time , parents and students nationwide are agonizing over choices between public schools and private schools and what loans they can afford or even qualify for .
And although Americans have a hard time paying their medical bills and preventive medical care takes a hit in a poor economy , some economists say that there are positive health effects .
“ People are physically healthier in times of recession , ” said Christopher Ruhm , an economist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro .
“ Death rates fall , people smoke less , drink less and exercise more .
Traffic fatalities go way down , which is not a surprise when people drive less .
Heart attacks go down .
Back problems go down .
People have more time to prepare healthier meals at home .
When the economy weakens , pollution falls . ”
This Panglossian view has its limits .
“ People are healthier , but they ’re not happier , ” Mr. Ruhm said .
“ Suicide rises , and mental health may deteriorate . ”
Generally , though , poverty is associated with bad health .
And since economic downturns have so many effects , it is often impossible to sort out what mechanism might be responsible for what health result .
Some economists are skeptical of Mr. Ruhm ’s findings .
“ This is a very complicated area , ” said Ralph Catalano , a professor of public health at Berkeley .
“ If you ’re looking at people anticipating economic adversity , worrying about losing their job , some of them will spend less money on alcohol , take fewer risks , do more things that are good for them .
So , in some places , the net effect may be fewer people having acute traumatic illness .
But if you look at the people who ’ve actually lost a job , or lost a business , they are more likely to have adverse health outcomes .
When you get to saying there must be fewer people driving , so there must be fewer traffic accidents and cleaner air , that ’s what I ’d call econometric imagination . ”
Mr. Catalano , who found in an earlier study , based on data from Germany , that a bad economy was linked with a decline in male births , cautioned against predicting how this recession would reshape society .
“ What we do n’t know is what ’s going to happen next , ” he said .
“ We do n’t know yet how anxious people are going to get , or how many people are going to lose their jobs .
The experience we ’re going through is unprecedented .
The last time we had this kind of experience was in the 1930s , and we did n’t have data . ”
Mr. Conley , too , harked back to the Great Depression in suggesting that the current downturn could lead to a more equal America , if the richest people suffer the greatest economic losses .
“ Nineteen twenty - nine was the peak of inequality , ” he said .
“ It ’s almost like things get too top - heavy , and they topple over . ”

Credit Crunch Is A Boon For Cookbook Publishers
Easing Death 's Sting While Turning A Profit
Geneticist says evolution may be near its end
At 76 , Daniel Ellsberg is still vocal .
The man who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1969 , leading to the fall of President Richard Nixon , is speaking out this time on the 2008 presidential election .
IPS correspondent Bankole Thompson caught up with Ellsberg in downtown Detroit , where he keynoted the opening of the 2008 National Lawyers Guild ( NLG ) convention .
The celebrated whistle - blower has reservations about the candidacies of both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain .
But he still believes an Obama presidency would better deal with the constitutional crisis of the last eight years .
IPS : In your speech to the NLG , you said Nov. 4 will be an election between ‘ two monarchies . ’
Explain ?
DE : The last seven years have expanded the powers of the president well beyond the bounds of the American constitution .
Even [ McCain ’s running mate ]
Sarah Palin said the other day ‘ well , it ’s rather flexible . ’
Well , it is not flexible enough to accommodate their view of the constitution of the president ’s role , which is that of a king  exactly what the constitution meant to exclude was a ruler [ who is ] essentially beyond the laws .
That ’s what the checks and balances were meant to reject .
With the cooperation of Congress , they really have said in the age of terrorism the president is a law unto himself .
The fact is neither [ Obama nor McCain ] will inherit the limitations that are implicit in the constitution .
If that ’s going to change , I do not think it will be by the efforts of the next president .
No president has voluntarily cut back on the powers that they inherited when they came into office .
It takes Congress to do that .
Again they wo n’t do it without the public pressing them .
There is some movement now for impeachment and for investigations that Congress has not responded to .
I ca n’t tell you whether it ’s because the movement is so small , and it is a minority or because Congress is so resistant .
Why is Congress so uninterested in defending their own rules , their own powers ?
IPS : If Obama wo n’t do much to curtail presidential powers , why do you contend that it ’s ‘ urgent ’ for him to be elected ?
DE : I disagree with Obama on many points of foreign policy and I ’m very sorry that he has not stood up for the constitution .
But in comparison with the Republicans , except Ron Paul who took the constitution seriously , any of the Democratic candidates [ would be better ] .
To say the Republicans are no worse or no different is absurd .
They ’ve been consistently very much worse .
I think if McCain were elected the chances of war with Iran alone would be much higher .
I do n’t think there is chance with Obama .
I think with McCain there is a high chance of war with Iran .
That alone is reason to make it urgent to elect Obama .
It is not just a matter of his being better than McCain .
That ’s a very low standard .
He of course in many ways looks much more promising than people we ’ve had .
IPS : What issues do you disagree with Obama on ?
DE : On Iraq , he talks about ending the war .
I do n’t think he intends to end the war in Iraq , but to keep our bases there .
He wants to increase our forces in Afghanistan .
I think that ’s a terrible mistake and could ruin his own presidency as well as kill a lot of Afghans .
He wants to enlarge the size of the armed forces .
That ’s the wrong way to go .
He wants to increase the defense budget  wrong way to go .
He ca n’t achieve anything he wants to do significantly without doing something that he has so far not talked about doing  and that is greatly reducing and converting the military budget .
I do n’t even think he ’s likely to do that .
And yet he ca n’t achieve his goals by keeping the military budget at the level it is .
IPS : Has any government in the past reduced the military budget ?
DE : Interestingly , the last one seriously to do it was Harry Truman just before the Korean War .
Now you may not believe this , but he was getting the budget down to 10 billion dollars .
And Korea came along and his backers used that as an excuse to quadruple the budget in a year and a half to two years .
It went up to 40 billion dollars and never came down again .
So that was an example after World War II .
The then secretary of defense [ Louis Johnson ] wanted to run as a president and his campaign was going to be “ I reduced the defense budget ” and that was the last we heard of that .
There was some talk of doing it after the Cold War and that did n’t last very long .
Otherwise it ’s going nowhere but up .
IPS : Which of the two , Obama or McCain , would be more prone to secrecy ?
DE : Whether Obama would really , greatly change the system I do n’t know .
But he has raised the secrecy issue and proposed to look at our regulations and not allow allegations of national security to trump everything .
I think it ’s possible he would be much more open .
Both Clintons are rather secretive themselves in their own political world .
But in terms of declassifying [ President Clinton ] was pretty good on that .
And that was all reversed of course by George W. Bush .
For example , something Obama could do right in office is he could change the executive order Bush put in which made it much harder to get into presidential archives .
George W. Bush , obviously in order to protect his own father , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , made it very much harder to get at a president ’s papers once he was out of office .
Obama could change that with an executive order .
He has nothing personally to worry about there .
He is not related .
It is not a dynasty here .
Clinton would never do that now because they have too much to hide .

This just keeps getting better and better .
Earlier this month , I wrote about the Senate campaign of Elizabeth Dole and how it was attempting to stir up anti-atheist bigotry to use against her Democratic challenger , Kay Hagan .
Now , the national Republican Party has joined in , and once again , Daylight Atheism is a part of the controversy .
Shock !
Horror !
Outrage !
Reader Brian Westley informs me of this new web ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee , titled “ Godless ” .
In their most brazen attempt yet to incite hate , the ad quotes representatives of atheist political groups who ’ve appeared on TV , then again cites Kay Hagan ’s attendance at a fundraiser held by Wendy and Woody Kaminer of the Secular Coalition for America .
And , yes , Daylight Atheism is once again cited in the video ( at about the 1:40 mark ) for my dreaded statement that “ Kay Hagan ought to be rewarded for inviting nonbelievers onto her platform ” .
I continue to be disappointed by the lackluster quality of these smear ads .
The melodramatic piano music in the background is way over the top .
Also , the NRSC does n’t appear to have a copyeditor who knows how to spell “ atheism ” .
And when it comes to the scary , scary goals of the atheist movement , they can only think of three : removing “ under God ” from the Pledge of Allegiance , removing “ In God We Trust ” from the currency , and no longer designating Christmas an official federal holiday .
Really ?
That ’s the worst they could come up with ?
Anti-atheist bigotry is usually much more inventive than this .
No claims that atheists want to ban prayer from all public schools , or outlaw parents ’ teaching their children about God ?
No wild - eyed assertions about how the Evil Atheist Conspiracy will send jackbooted thugs to break down little old ladies ’ doors and take away their Bibles ?
Frankly , I could make a better attack ad against me .
But what this ad does show is that the Republican party is the party of theocracy , and proud of it .
The worst innuendo they could come up with is a GAMPAC spokesman ’s statement that atheists have no real representation in Congress , but “ we fully intend to change that ” ; and my claim that Kay Hagan deserves praise for being willing to meet with atheists and consider our concerns .
In their eyes , these are crimes , and atheists should be condemned and reviled merely for seeking political representation .
Kay Hagan has made no statement to the effect that she ’ll support any part of the atheist political agenda ( I have no illusions about that ) – in fact , she ’s an elder of the Presbyterian church – but that has n’t stopped the Republicans from targeting her in this smear campaign .
They want to make it so that politicians are afraid even to listen to us .
With this ad campaign , the Republican party has clearly stated that not only will they not represent the interests of nonbelievers , they will actively stir up hate against us at every opportunity and use demonization as a tool to win votes .
Not just the Dole campaign , but the entire party is complicit in this .
Our country is in the midst of an economic crisis not seen since the Great Depression ; thousands of people are losing their jobs ; our health - care system is crippled , our infrastructure is collapsing , we are still utterly dependent on imported oil , and we are still pouring blood and treasure down the sinkhole of an unnecessary war – but the only thing the Republicans have to offer is crying , “ Atheist ! ”
Their campaign strategy appeals to the worst in people rather than the best .
America stands at an unprecedented crossroads , and the serious decisions about our country ’s future can no longer be put off .
The decisions we make in the next few years , for better or for worse , will shape our national destiny for decades , possibly longer .
But even now , the only thing the Republican party wants to do is hurl epithets and crawl around in the mud .
When the dilemmas we face demand national consensus , still the only thing they want to do is to foment hate and division .
That policy is how we got into this mess in the first place !
This November , Americans have a chance to decisively reject this know - nothingism and show that we ’re ready to start taking this country ’s future seriously .
This ad shows what ’s at stake , though not in the way its makers intended .
The Republican party , the party of bigotry and theocracy , is already on the ropes , and their electoral fortunes this year are dim .
Let us do all that we can to make their defeat as crushing as possible , and show that America is ready to leave the phony controversies of the culture wars behind and start confronting the issues that genuinely matter to people ’s lives .
UPDATE ( 11/4 ) : Good riddance , Elizabeth Dole … welcome , U.S. Senator Kay Hagan !
Palin says she has never heard a single angry shout against Obama from the crowds she has been whipping up .
Why am I not surprised ?
Say what you will about Palin , but she can lie more baldly than a Clinton .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Like all wars , the dark , untold stories of the Iraqi conflict drain from its shattered landscape like the filthy waters of the Tigris .
And still the revelations come .
The Independent has learnt that secret executions are being carried out in the prisons run by Nouri al - Maliki's " democratic " government .
The hangings are carried out regularly – from a wooden gallows in a small , cramped cell – in Saddam Hussein 's old intelligence headquarters at Kazimiyah .
There is no public record of these killings in what is now called Baghdad 's " high - security detention facility " but most of the victims – there have been hundreds since America introduced " democracy " to Iraq – are said to be insurgents , given the same summary justice they mete out to their own captives .

The secrets of Iraq 's death chambers lie mostly hidden from foreign eyes but a few brave Western souls have come forward to tell of this prison horror .
The accounts provide only a glimpse into the Iraqi story , at times tantalisingly cut short , at others gloomily predictable .
Those who tell it are as depressed as they are filled with hopelessness .
" Most of the executions are of supposed insurgents of one kind or another , " a Westerner who has seen the execution chamber at Kazimiyah told me .
" But hanging is n't easy . "
As always , the devil is in the detail .
" There 's a cell with a bar below the ceiling with a rope over it and a bench on which the victim stands with his hands tied , " a former British official , told me last week .
" I 've been in the cell , though it was always empty .
But not long before I visited , they 'd taken this guy there to hang him .
They made him stand on the bench , put the rope round his neck and pushed him off .
But he jumped on to the floor .
He could stand up .
So they shortened the length of the rope and got him back on the bench and pushed him off again .
It did n't work . "
There 's nothing new in savage executions in the Middle East – in the Lebanese city of Sidon 10 years ago , a policeman had to hang on to the legs of a condemned man to throttle him after he failed to die on the noose – but in Baghdad , cruel death seems a speciality .
" They started digging into the floor beneath the bench so that the guy would drop far enough to snap his neck , " the official said .
" They dug up the tiles and the cement underneath .
But that did n't work .
He could still stand up when they pushed him off the bench .
So they just took him to a corner of the cell and shot him in the head . "
The condemned prisoners in Kazimiyah , a Shia district of Baghdad , are said to include rapists and murderers as well as insurgents .
One prisoner , a Chechen , managed to escape from the jail with another man after a gun was smuggled to them .
They shot two guards dead .
The authorities had to call in the Americans to help them recapture the two .
The Americans killed one and shot the Chechen in the leg .
He refused medical assistance so his wound went gangrenous .
In the end , the Iraqis had to operate and took all the bones out of his leg .
By the time he met one Western visitor to the prison , " he was walking around on crutches with his boneless right leg slung over his shoulder " .
In many cases , it seems , the Iraqis neither keep nor release any record of the true names of their captives or of the hanged prisoners .
For years the Americans – in charge of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad – did not know the identity of their prisoners .
Here , for example , is new testimony given to The Independent by a former Western official to the Anglo - US Iraq Survey Group , which searched for the infamous but mythical weapons of mass destruction : " We would go to the interrogation rooms at Abu Ghraib and ask for a particular prisoner .
After about 40 minutes , the Americans brought in this hooded guy , shuffling along , shackled hands and feet .

" They sat him on a chair in front of us and took off his hood .
He had a big beard .
We asked where he received his education .
He repeatedly said ' Mosul ' .
Then he said he'd left school at 14 – remember , this guy is supposed to be a missile scientist .
We said : ' We know you 've got a PhD and went to the Sorbonne – we'd like you to help us with information about Saddam 's missile project ' .
But I said to myself : ' This guy does n't know anything ' bout fucking missiles . '
Then it turned out he had a different name from the man we 'd asked for , he'd been picked up on the road by the Americans four months earlier , he did n't know why .
So we said to the Americans : ' Wrong gentleman ! '
So they put the shackles on him and took him back to his cell and after 20 or 30 minutes , they 'd bring someone else .
We 'd ask him where he went to school and he told us he had never been to school .
" Wrong person again .
It was a complete farce .
The incompetence of the US military was astounding , criminal .
Eventually , of course , they found the right guy and brought him in and took his hood off .
He was breathing heavily , overweight , pudgy , disoriented , a little bit scared . "
On this occasion , the Americans had found the right man .
The British and American investigators asked the guards to remove the man 's shackles , which they did – but then they tied one of the man 's legs to the floor .
Yes , he had a PhD .
Again , the official 's testimony : " We went through his history , what he'd worked on – he was obviously just a minor functionary in one of Saddam 's missile programmes .
Iraqi scientists did n't have the knowledge how to make nuclear missiles nor did they have the financial support necessary .
It just remained in the dreams of Saddam . "
The scientist - prisoner in Abu Ghraib miserably told his captors that he'd been arrested by the Americans after they 'd knocked on his front door in Baghdad and found two Kalashnikov rifles a woman 's hijab , verses from the Koran and , obviously of interest to his captors , " physics and missile textbooks on his bookshelves . "
But this supposedly valuable prisoner was never charged or previously interviewed even though he admitted he was a rocket scientist .
" I do n't know what happened to him , " the former official told me .
" I tried to tell the UK and the US military that we 've arrested this man but that he 's got a wife , children , a family .
I said that by locking up this one innocent person , you 've got 50 men radicalised overnight .
No , I do n't know what happened to him . "
For many of the investigators working for the Anglo - American authorities in Baghdad , the trial for the crime for which the Iraqi dictator was himself subsequently hanged was a fearful experience that ultimately ended in disgust .
Through captured documents , they could see the dark , inner workings of Saddam 's secret police .
The idea of the Saddam trial was less to bring members of the former regime to justice than to show Iraqis how justice and the rule of law should operate .
" It was exhilarating to see Saddam being cross- examined , " one of the court investigators said .
" The low point was when he was executed .
What drove me on was seeing how Saddam dealt with his victims – I was looking at a microcosm of all the deaths that had taken place in Iraq .
But when he was executed , it was done in such a savage way . "
Saddam Hussein was hanged in the same " secure " unit at Kazimiyah where Mr al - Maliki 's people , in an echo of Saddamite Baathist terror , now hang their victims .
Iraq
The death penalty
* The death penalty in Iraq was suspended after Saddam Hussein was deposed in 2003 .
It was reinstated by the interim government in August 2004 .
* The United Nations , the European Union and international human rights organisations all spoke out against the reintroduction .
* At the time , the government claimed the death penalty was a necessary measure until the country had stabilised .
Amnesty International claims that " the extent of violence in Iraq has increased rather than diminished , clearly indicating that the death penalty has not proved to be an effective deterrent . "
* Saddam , left , his half - brother Barzan al - Tikriti and Iraq 's former chief judge Awad Hamed al - Bandar were hanged at the end of 2006 for their part in the killings of 148 people in the mainly Shia town of Dujail in 1982 .
Illicit videos of all three executions later became public .
Saddam 's body could be seen on a hospital trolley , his head twisted at 90 degrees .
Barzan – Iraq 's former intelligence chief –was decapitated by the noose .
Officials said it was an accident .
* According to Amnesty , there were at least 33 executions reported in Iraq last year .
About 200 people were estimated to have been sentenced to death .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices fell again , tumbling to the lowest price in a year , according to a daily survey of credit card swipes released Saturday .
The average price of unleaded regular fell to $ 2.735 a gallon , down four and six - tenths of a cent , according to the Daily Fuel Gauge Report issued by motorist group AAA .
Prices have fallen $ 1.12 , or 29 % , in the last 38 days .
The current national average is $ 1.37 , or 33.5 % , off the record high price of $ 4.11 that AAA reported July 17 .
The decline comes as hurricane season winds down and oil prices drop over concerns that a prolonged economic slump would curb demand for energy .
The last time the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was close to this price was October 18 , 2007 , when the price averaged $ 2.795 .
Alaska has the most expensive gas with prices averaging $ 3.78 .
The cheapest gas is found in Oklahoma with prices averaging $ 2.33 .
So much has taken place over the past 32 years and only you know the impact Patrick and Marian have had on your life .
Maybe Patrick baptized you or performed your wedding ?
Did his music or certain message speak to you ?
Maybe Marian dropped by with a meal and words of comfort or you served with her in one of the many areas of ministry she was involved in over the years ?
Did one of them lead you to the Lord ?
We all know Patrick is a kid at heart and loves to joke around with people big and small – maybe that one time still brings a smile to your face .
Were you there on Good Friday when his hair caught on fire ?
Or maybe you just want to say , “ Thank you ” or “ Well done ” in your own words .
Searching for that truly virtuous cup of coffee ?
If you ’ve looked into the impact of your morning cup of joe recently , chances are you know that most coffees are their greenest when they ’re still on the plantation , or maybe the tree .
Roasting , shipping , marketing , bagging and processing all take a lot of energy , and most coffee in the world travels a fair distance before it ends up in our french presses .
Coffee is an equatorial crop , and we do n’t all live on the equator .
A coffee roaster in Seattle has decided that the bitter aftertaste of unsustainable coffee production has got to go .
So they did something about it .
Grounds for Change , a family - owned company , has become the first coffee roaster to offset 100 % of their global warming emissions produced in bringing their coffee to market .
That ’s right , carbon - neutral coffee .
Grounds for Change has recently worked with Carbonfund.org to tally up their carbon footprint from production and distribution of their coffee .
Carbonfund.org , a nonprofit that provides carbon offsets and carbon emissions calculation services , has now certified Grounds for Change as 100 % CarbonFree .
This certification makes Grounds for Change the first coffee roaster to attain this certification .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Banking giant Citigroup said Thursday it had ended talks with Wells Fargo about reaching an agreement to acquire parts of the struggling bank Wachovia and is no longer looking to buy any of Wachovia 's assets .
Citigroup also said that it would not seek to block the merger agreement between Wells Fargo and Wachovia but that it would still seek damages from the two banks for breach of contract .
Wells Fargo has submitted an application to the Federal Reserve Board seeking expedited approval of its merger with Wachovia , the company in a joint statement with Wachovia .
Citigroup , Inc. ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) have been competing to purchase all or part of Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) for the past week .
Citigroup announced on Sept. 29 that it was taking over Wachovia 's banking operations for $ 2.2 billion with backing from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
However , Wells Fargo offered just four days later to buy Wachovia outright for $ 15.1 billion with no federal assistance whatsoever .
Citigroup first tried to stop the Wells Fargo deal in court last weekend and subsequently decided to seek up to $ 60 billion in punitive and compensatory damages .
Wachovia , meanwhile , also sought in court to keep Citigroup from blocking the deal with Wells Fargo .
The three banks agreed on Monday to halt any legal action until Wednesday to allow room for negotiation .
On Wednesday , they extended this legal standstill until Friday .
However , Citigroup said in its statement Thursday that the two companies ' acquisition plans were too different to come to a mutually acceptable agreement .
" We did not seek the Wachovia transaction ; Wachovia brought it to us , " said Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit in a statement .
" We will redouble the focus on our five core businesses . "
After Citi said it would n't attempt to block the rival merger , the Federal Reserve said in a statement that it would start the regulatory approval process needed for Wells Fargo to buy Wachovia .
" We are delighted to stride ahead with Wells Fargo in creating a coast - to - coast financial institution -- one of the strongest financial firms in the world , " said Wachovia Corporation President and CEO Robert K. Steel in a statement .
The head of the Hillsborough GOP , David Storck , distributed an email from a Republican Party volunteer saying the voters are a threat .
That 's because , as the volunteer says in the email , he sees " car loads of black Obama supporters coming from the inner city to cast their votes for Obama . "
It goes on to say , " This is their chance to get a black president and they seem to care little the he is at minimum a socialist and probably Marxist in his core beliefs . "
The Republican volunteer says that is because , " After all he is black - no experience or accomplishments but he is black . "

Everyone who lives in San Francisco loves to rave about the Bay Area to anyone who will listen .
My friend and fellow ex -Ann Arborite Reed is on a personal campaign to convince everyone in Michigan to move out here .
Maybe it ’s some sort of way to cope with the fact we ’re all likely to die in a natural disaster , but there ’s one thing that never comes up in these SF love fests : the weather in the city sucks .
The fog rolls in unpredictably , it gets chilly quick , and overcast skies are the norm .
Although recently it ’s started getting nicer and nicer : apparently , September and October are the prime summer months .
Of course in the East Bay where I live , it ’s about 15 degrees warmer and always sunny .
So in honor of the beginning of the summer here , and the end of the summer everywhere else , I want to take a look at one of George Gershwin ’s ( and all of pop music ’s ) most durable songs , the oft - covered “ Summertime , ” through the extremely convenient lens of another pop culture phenomenon , YouTube .
The Best
1. Sam Cooke ( 1957 )
Choosing a favorite rendition of a song that ’s been covered by so many was tough , but in the end it came down to two , and this one is impossible to deny :
“ Summertime ” was the a -side of the very first secular single Cooke put out under his own name ( “ Lovable ” was credited to Dale Cook ) , but for whatever reason DJ ’s across the country found the b-side much more appealing .
Normally , that ’d be a bad sign for the strength of your single , but when the b-side is “ You Send Me , ” there ’s room for two classics on one 7 - inch .
On the strength of both cuts the record shot up to # 1 and a new type of music was born : soul .
The story of soul is n’t quite that simple — but Cooke ’s impact on music is undeniable .
Many people , me included , have made the case for him as the greatest singer of all - time and while not everyone might agree on that , everyone can agree that this version is the one that sounds the most like summer .
2. Billy Stewart ( 1967 )
Billy Stewart does n’t quite have a spot in the soul pantheon like some of his Midwestern peers ( Marvin Gaye , Curtis Mayfield ) , but you ’d be hard - pressed to name someone with a more distinctive voice and fresher takes on old standards .
He had a fairly solid run of singles for Chess , but it was his version of “ Summertime ” that launched his career and would be his biggest single .
Well actually , playing piano for Bo Diddley launched his career , but his soulful scat runs are what immortalized him .
This version is not nearly as iconic as Cooke ’s , but it flips the song on its head in a way that no one else has been able to match .
3. Billie Holiday ( 1936 )
Lady Day recorded her own version “ Summertime ” less than a year after George Gershwin debuted the area in 1935 ’s Porgy & Bess , and her interpretation shows how it became such an exalted standard .
Like most of her best material , it ’s playful , yet mournful .
She smolders and her band , especially Cozy Cole on drums , sound about two degrees from melting .
Haruki Murakami puts it pretty well in an excellent essay for the new Believer : this is Holiday when she was “ brimming with imagination and acrobatic flights of song .
The whole world was swinging in time to her swing .
I mean , the planet was actually swaying .
I am not exaggerating .
We are talking magic here , not just art .
The only other musician I know with such magical virtuosity was Charlie Parker . ”
4. Charlie Parker ( 1949 )
Sure enough , Bird also put his indelible mark on “ Summertime . ”
This version comes from his 1949 sessions with a small string ensemble , and at the time , the concept of pairing Parker with classical musicians must have seemed ballsy .
It ’s speaks a lot about the power of his music that Parker ’s alto has n’t aged a day , soaring over string arrangements that have every opportunity to seem schmaltzy , but never do .
5. Keith Jarrett ( 1987 )
I ’d never heard this version until recently , and really the only reason it ranks so high for me , is because it ’s so fun to watch .
The 80s were a rough time for a lot of people , and here Jarrett is firmly in his Urkel phase , and you ca n’t help but laugh at his constipated turtle squirming routine .
Still , his playing drips with soul , and he ’s got the most important ingredient in abundance : a dark edge .
Or maybe it ’s just the thought of thousands of invisible Japanese jazz aficionados in the unlit expanses of this Tokyo concert hall .
Either way , between his dancing , heavy breathing , outfit and venue , this doubles as both the funniest and creepiest interpretation on this list .
6 . The Zombies ( 1965 )
The Zombies cover proves a theory I ’ve been kicking around for awhile : everything sounds better with some Rhodes electric piano .
Colin Blunstone ’s hypnotic lead vocal and the ethereal backing harmonies do n’t hurt either , and it ’s great to see a rock band capable of pulling off a song that most leave to jazz and soul singers .
7. Bill Evans ( 1965 )
From the same year as the Zombies cover comes this jazz reading from the inimitable Evans .
Though what really sets apart this version from a lot of other typical piano trio arrangements is the strident bass playing of Chuck Israels .
He picks up the pace where many other bass players might be tempted to belabor the groove , and his solo is icing on the cake .
Or ice cream cake , whatever sounds better when the humidity makes you want to crawl inside of your air conditioner .
8. Joe Pass ( 1975 )
I normally hate solo jazz guitar ; it ’s inherently indulgent and wanky .
But Joe Pass ’ take here live at the Montreux Jazz Festival is equal parts gritty and show - offy , and plus it reminds me of my dear friend and guitar obsessive , Gary Prince ( although Gary ’s guitar face is definitely even more epic ) .
9. Larry Adler & Itzhak Perlman ( 1980 )
I ’m frequently pegged as a know - it - all when it comes to music , and I do n’t mind , but even I have to admit I had no idea who either of these legends of their instruments were before I stumbled across their unique collaborations on YouTube , but I ’m thoroughly intrigued .
After all , you do n’t hear world - class violinists and incredibly skilled harmonica players joining up all too often .
Apparently prominent composers would write pieces specifically for Adler and his harmonica — he clearly has major chops .
10 . Ella Fitzgerald ( 1968 )
Ella and Louis Armstrong ’s duet of “ Summertime ” is the obvious choice , but I like this video even more .
Ella makes it look , and sound , so easy , as if such a heavenly voice just flowed out of her .
But her sweat belies her efforts as she takes a rather straightforward reading to a sublime place without histrionics .
The Worst
1. Boy George ( 2008 )
I ’m really sorry ; do n’t even try to watch that .
2. Devendra Banhart ( 2006 )
I can normally tolerate Devendra , but this is ridiculous .
It ’s like , dude , how did you ever think this was a good idea ?
The stereotypical dancing hippie guy ?
Your paper thin , quivering melisma ?
How do you expect to be taken seriously ?
Yet you still landed Natalie Portman , so I guess you must be doing something right .
3. Tom Waits ( 1978 )
Tom Waits is the last person you ’d expect to see on a list after Boy George and Devendra Banhart , but I ’m sad to say he thoroughly deserves it .
This performance of “ Burma Shave ” to the music of “ Summertime ” is a case study in rambling .
It actually starts out quite captivating , but Waits ’ shtick here runs a bit thin when you realize it ’s not going anywhere .
I love the guy , but this is one of those times he coasted on his magnetic personality instead of his talent .
And for a palate cleanser , we 'll end with a related and no less canonical tune .
Bring on Autumn .
When the world ’s largest news organizations toe the line with U.S. officials on highly unpopular government policies , you do n’t have a press : you have a Ministry .
In its declaration of journalistic ethics , The Associated Press demands , “ Anyone who works for the AP . . . must refrain from declaring their views on contentious public issues in any public forum . ” [ 1 ]
That has not prevented AP ’s Baghdad bureau from promoting the belligerent U.S. occupation of Iraq .
Judging from Robert H. Reid ’s latest report — “ Will Iraq squander the gains of the surge ? ” [ 2 ] — an AP bureau chief is n’t “ anyone who works for the AP ” ; the U.S. occupation of Iraq and the so - called surge are not considered “ contentious public issues ” ; and AP news reports do not count as “ public forums . ”
Chief H. Reid , according the editor ’s footnote , “ has covered Iraq since before the U.S. - led invasion ” ; perhaps in a cynical way , this exempts him from having to qualify the opinion stated as fact once again in the first sentence : “ The U.S. troop surge did what it aimed : Calm Iraq down . ”
Of course Reid , as usual , is merely agreeing with U.S. officials ; a rising number of whom , according to sentence two , “ are worried that the hard - won drop in violence may be only temporary . ”
Indeed , the term hard - won is appropriate , insofar as it modifies the U.S. - sponsored ethnic cleansing by sectarian militias .
Neighborhoods will become quiet , once their human populations have been killed or driven to desperate refuge , and once the human remnants are terrorized into submission .
And , quite naturally , refugees do tend to at least attempt to return home ; at which time , violent “ reconciliation ” occurs , thereby possibly threatening that “ period of calm ” when U.S. militants take relatively few or zero casualties .
So the word temporary is perfectly apt here as well .
But , for AP to suggest that the tentativity of the “ calm ” is some unforeseen phenomenon is ludicrous and insulting to readers ; it implies that we were all hinging the long - term stability of Iraq on what amounts to the U.S. military ’s damming and redirecting of the flow of internecine genocide .
Though Reid refers to those militant groups and the U.S. government ’s support of them , in true AP form he omits the dubious nature and impact of their actions in the so - called surge .
His editorial suggests that some of those thousands of U.S. - backed fighters are turning tail against the U.S. occupation , then trumpets the fears of U.S. officials about flaring violence ; yet it fails to contextually analyze the two related phenomena .
It ’s as if there is no relationship between the thoroughly detested U.S. occupation and anti-U.S. violence .
This is typical of AP on Iraq ; to wit , a September 16 report , “ US soldiers battling hard in Iraqi city ” :
Although security in Iraq has improved , it remains fragile , Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin , the No. 2 U.S. commander in Iraq , told reporters in the capital Monday .
And nowhere is the fragility more apparent than here in Mosul , 225 miles northwest of Baghdad .
Sunni Arab insurgents , routed or weakened in Baghdad and other urban centers since last year , are making a stand in this former bastion of support for Saddam Hussein .
. . .
“ Honestly , I do n’t know who we are fighting , ” said Staff Sgt. Tim Carter , who has survived six roadside bomb attacks .
“ If I see them placing a roadside bomb or firing at us , then that ’s who we are fighting , but otherwise there is no way to tell if he is a civilian or al - Qaida .
Here , a kid can run up to shake your hand and then later throw a grenade at you . ” [ 3 ]
So that ’s success ?
To any sane person with a pulse , after 5 ½ years , thousands dead , and astronomical costs , Staff Sergeant Carter ’s death - defying dilemma is only more reason to end the logic - defying occupation of Iraq .
To the shrewd followers of these stories , it means that the U.S. government must also stop committing and funding ethnic cleansing .
But to U.S. officials and their lapdog media , legal precedents and contextual lessons are for the “ bad guys ” ; blowback is a function of a vacuum cleaner , not a consequence of wrongheaded foreign policy .
According to their story , the numbers of “ insurgents ” and “ terrorists ” have diminished , and the metropolitan streets have grown “ relatively quiet ” except for all those happy families frolicking in the parks of course — all due to an increase in troop numbers and the savvy diplomatic maneuvering of U.S. officials .
While dutifully highlighting U.S. government ingenuity , this likewise ignores the greater number of civilian deaths and flights caused by the U.S. occupation and intervention in the first place , and diminishes the Iraqi and Iranian roles in the surge ’s “ gains . ”
Also not - surprisingly missing from Reid ’s report is that the U.S. government supplemented the efforts of those ironically - named Awakening groups ( or “ Sons of Iraq ” ) by bombing neighborhoods , allegedly targeting “ terrorist hideouts ” but killing mostly civilians .
But it is hardly a coincidence that the more difficult the facts are for U.S. officials to concede , the less likely they are to be contextualized in AP ’s news reports .
AP ’s coverage of U.S. foreign policy , in a nutshell , is a win - win narrative for the fringe minority in favor of fascist empire .
Issues are kept at superficial levels ( ethnic , sectarian ) .
U.S. imperial exceptionalism is an understood reality — the U.S. Constitution , treaties , and international law be damned .
The initial victims ( Iraqi people ) of state violence ( U.S. invasion , occupation ) and the losses they ’ve suffered are disregarded completely , as is the economic impact on the American people .
And there is no such thing as an anti-U.S. Iraqi resistance .
The word resistance is put in scare quotes , or related from the quote of a marginalized figure , if mentioned at all .
How politically convenient for those U.S. officials , that the world ’s largest news wire service has its coverage zeroed - out at their sensibilities .
But , if you ’re going to editorialize at all , then of all things , why do it on behalf of the empire ?
Simple .
Though it already has all the military , political , and financial wherewithal under its command , the U.S. empire — and especially its corporatist state , of which AP and other corporate news media are parts — would not thrive without a propaganda ministry .
And , of course , AP , like all news organizations and journalists in Iraq , operate , ultimately , at the mercy of the U.S. occupation .
That ’s why AP ’s editors are happy to hold the feet of Iraqi officials to the flame on behalf of U.S. officials .
The entire second half of Reid ’s report does so to the point of self - contradiction .
Opening with a supposition that the Iraqi government is too powerful and that it may be abusing that power for sectarian and political reasons , it closes with the hypothesis that the same Iraqi government is not powerful enough that it can control sectarian political violence in the long run .
Either way , true or not , and relevant or not , the necessity for a longer U.S. presence is once again suggested .
Ironically , when news editors habitually agree with U.S. officials and their policies , they usually disagree with the supreme law binding those officials : the U.S. Constitution , which denies the U.S. federal government the authority to run an empire in the first place !
AP and corporate news media must never note this , lest the criminality and hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy , with which they concur , becomes evident .
That ’s also why you ’ll rarely see U.S. foreign interventions juxtaposed with the U.N. Charter , Geneva Conventions , or Nüremberg Principles .
To even attempt to would be to suggest the self - defeating truth : U.S. foreign policy is morally , legally , and philosophically bankrupt .
Instead , we are inundated with struggles based on myopic time - lines and false choices — civilian v. terrorist , pro- or anti-U.S. , surge v. no surge , pro- or anti-Iranian — to hide the root - level issues .
Fantastic demons and false prophets are hyped beyond question to make sure there is always a more - evil “ other guy ” to take the focus .
They ’re fighting “ al - Qaeda in Iraq ” and “ Iranian - trained insurgents ” — every last one of them .
Though who knows how we can believe that the bad guys were what the good guys said they were .
And do n’t forget to blame Iran .
Heaven forbid that the Iraqi government should be friendly with one of the U.S. government ’s chosen enemies , even if the friendliness was beneficial to the Iraqi people and “ regional stability . ”
After all , Maliki ’s Iranian counterparts are doing all the supplying and training of those anti-U.S. militants , according to evidence - deficient U.S. officials and corporate media .
General David Petraeus and other U.S. officials are credited with preventing a civil war in Iraq — stunningly discarding that the same geniuses have sponsored and overseen internecine mini-wars to that phony end .
The prevent - civil - war - through - civil - war efforts began when civil war was , arguably , already at hand ; so if “ relative calm ” is a victory , they do n’t get much more hollow or disingenuous .
Meanwhile , the relatively low U.S. casualty rate is used to paint the surge successful .
And when it ’s time to account for the ongoing fratricide , send in the political wedges .
Ignoring the negative impact of U.S. foreign policy , the Iraqi government is reportedly seen as “ weak ” due to its failure to accomplish “ national reconciliation . ”
The U.S. presence is suggested to thus be necessary .
Recall the 18 benchmarks .
They were sold as a collective yardstick for a “ diplomatic ” or “ democratic ” surge : the fewer benchmarks met by the Iraqi government , the “ weaker ” and more “ ineffective ” and less democratic it was painted .
You ’ll notice that those benchmarks are not quite newsworthy as they used to be ; that ’s because the Iraqi government ’s “ failure ” to meet them demonstrates fundamental flaws in U.S. foreign policy .
Yet the surge is a “ success , ” according to U.S. officials and AP .
They just have to stay longer to babysit that incompetent and pro-Iranian Iraqi government , you see .
Corporate news media simply refuse to admit that nobody likes to live under foreign occupation or be told how to run their political , economic , and social affairs .
It can not be fathomed that the almighty democracy - spreaders can be so wrong that they are the prime source of adversity .
“ What occupation ? ” [ 4 ]
But what kind of success is the “ hard - won drop in violence ” for Americans and Iraqis , when it is achieved on top of more than a million dead Iraqi civilians , more than 4,000 U.S. soldiers , and a burning heap of trillions in U.S. taxpayer dollars ?
A cherry atop a turd does n’t make dessert .
And what is an editor ’s personal code of ethics saying here : to objectively and comprehensively make sense of why U.S. foreign policy is so overwhelmingly unpopular and faulty , or to more - conveniently apologize for it , making a personal surge of his or her own up the career ladder ?
Shame on the empire , but shame on Robert Reid , AP , and their peers .
It is not righteous “ success ” when high crimes are committed to achieve it ; nor are they “ gains ” when so much life and sustenance is lost — immolated and discarded for glittering generalities .

From Countdown , Monday Oct. 27 , 2008 .
Keith tells John McCain that he needs to speak out against those who would use Friday 's racist hoax attack perpetrated by Ashley Todd as a means to re-open the racial divide in America .
Transcript available here :
And much more disturbingly , so was her calculation .
At least until her story , in retrospect a ludicrous confection , fell apart and she had to confess her crime .
She had inspired dozens , perhaps hundreds of journalists and bloggers and all those in between on both political sides to stand over this nation 's ever present tinderbox of racial prejudice and racial fear and racial hatred .
And she had brought them all matches .
We already know what the executive vice president of Fox News had written while his organization was perched next to that tinderbox waiting for the slightest excuse to light it and our nation ablaze .
The over the top , caveat thrown in for window dressing balance with not the slightest intention that it ever be taken seriously .
Quote , " If the incident turns out to be a hoax Senator McCain 's quest for presidency is over , forever linked to race - baiting . "
That is the well - known part of what John Moody wrote .
What preceded it was far less publicized and far more important .
" Part of the appeal of , and the unspoken tension behind , Senator Obama 's campaign , " he wrote , " is his transformational status as the first African - American to win a major party 's presidential nomination .
That does not mean that he has erased the mutual distrust between black and white Americans and this incident could become a watershed event in the 11 days before the election .
Moody wrote that .
It would n't be racism to suddenly blame Barack Obama for an attack on a white woman by a black man intending to punish her for not supporting another black man .
It would instead by a watershed moment because it somehow meant , " They suddenly feel they do not know enough about the Democratic nominee . "
Its only connection would have been racial .
But the response would not be racism .
The tinderbox again , and a very large match provided by John Moody .
I know that man .
He is not stupid .
Not careless .
He has in fact an education background identical to my own , right down to the same college radio station .
He knew what he was writing .
A rationalization for racism .
That Moody should be fired goes without saying .
But if not fired that he should resign in shame is also obvious .
Neither will happen because there is no one of sufficient authority to reproach him .
And the others , who but for Ashley Todd 's inability to maintain her inner hoaxster for more than two days would have solemnly and grimly and some secretly , happily set this presidential campaign on its ear and knocked this nation 's tenuous grip on the relationship between the races off its axis .
Because there was nobody to say , " No. Don't . "
This is where you come in , Senator McCain .
No histrionics from me to you this time , Senator .
No yelling .
Just a plea .
Say something about this .
Now .
Say something strongly and succinctly about the unacceptability of what happened , and how some of your supporters tried to exploit it .
I am not asking you to assume the responsibility for this .
No matter how your campaign pushed this story , I have no doubt that in the mirror image scenario many of Senator Obama 's supporters would have done the same .
But I also have no doubt that by this point in that mirror image scenario , Senator Obama would have said something to try to stop the next Ashley Todd , or the next John Moody .
Senator , of all the things I do n't like about you or your campaign , I have never thought you a racist .
As imperfect as was your moment with that Minnesota woman mumbling about Arabs , I thought it was the finest moment of your campaign .
I believe that you feel as I do , that racial prejudice and hatred have no place in this campaign , nor in this country .
I believe that you feel as I do , as Clarence Darrow said in a different time and a different context , " I am pleading for the future .
I am pleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the hearts of men .
When we can learn by reason and judgment and understanding and faith . "
Sometimes , Senator McCain , it is as if we are almost there .
And then some unthinking act like the one by that Ashley Todd throws us back against the rocks and we barely escape with our ship intact .
In that time of foundering , Senator McCain , far too few of us have a chance to personally right the ship .
To heal instead of to stand idly by .
To make a difference in this oldest and most wearying of our struggles as a nation .
This chance , sir , is yours .
Say something .
Or better yet , say something with Senator Obama , about race and how we live with one another and how we can .
Let this last week of the campaign be remembered , no matter how it turns out next Tuesday , as something other than the time Ashley Todd lied , and the John Moodys threatened , and you said nothing .
Senator McCain , once again , grab the microphone .
Thank you .
Dead Celebrities are always a fascinating subject to many , and this celebrity art created using actual fonts deserves praise .
These four posters of Marilyn Monroe , Charlie Chaplin , Marlon Brando and James Dean in some of their most famous poses is nothing short of spectacular .
They provide another tribute to the dead actors ( and actress ) in a way we do not pass by often .

Apocalypse Now ? :
New world order could have devastating implications for Western nations
Almost exactly seven years ago Al Qaeda terrorists targeted their hijacked planes into the Twin Towers at the heart of New York ’s financial centre — and the world was transformed .
There were no deaths this week , but the effects of the carnage on the financial
markets will be far more profound and destabilising than the 9/11 atrocity .
For almost all of us , it will , I predict , be a change for the worse , and for a large
minority the consequences will be extremely distressing .
Here comes the apocalpse :
Is the Western world entering a nightmare scenario , as depicted by Edvard Munch ?
The Western world — Britain , Europe and the U.S. — has moved from excess to
austerity overnight .
This week ’s financial typhoon will savagely impact living
standards .
In due course , it will topple governments and lead to a permanent transfer of
economic and political power from Europe and America to the emergent and , in some
cases , such as China , semi- barbarous economies in the East .
I know I will be accused of being unnecessarily apocalyptic and irresponsibly
negative , but I believe that the greatest mistake we can now make is to
downplay the seriousness of the situation and bury our heads in the sand .
The seismic events which have seen the near - destruction of the investment banking sector and the collapse of insurance giant AIG are on the scale of the Great Crash of 1929 .
That was such a disaster because it created conditions for the emergence of fascism in continental Europe and then World War II .
Although it is hard to predict the consequences , we should expect ramifications of equal significance — including the re-emergence of violent Far Right parties across the globe .
Some experts were talking this week as if the financial crisis was nearly over .
They
could not be more wrong .
The downturn has only just begun — and for most citizens
uninvolved with finance the consequences have not been felt at all .
But they will be felt very soon and very brutally .
The British economy is in the same position as the Texan coast earlier this month as Hurricane Ike approached — apparently calm , with life going on as normal , but an almighty storm is raging just
over the horizon and heading our way with terrifying speed .
We can expect a sharp increase in personal bankruptcies .
Yet the numbers will not peak until this time next year at the earliest .
Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs , with many forced to sell their houses .
Property prices will slump .
There will be extreme human suffering , panic and despair .
Many careers will be
destroyed .
This is considerably worse than the downturn of the early 1990s .
The orthodoxy from the British Government , the Confederation of British Industry and elsewhere that there will be a mild slowdown ending late next year is nonsense .
This crisis is vicious , dynamic and only just beginning .
Even those of us lucky enough not to lose our jobs and our homes will have friends and relatives who do .
Let us examine , first , the fate of City bankers from firms such as Lehman Brothers — all summarily dismissed when their firm went under this week .
They will receive no severance payment and almost no chance ever again of benefiting from the six - figure salaries and massive bonuses they have taken for
granted over the past few years .
That means they cannot service the huge mortgages they have taken out on hugely expensive houses .
So this weekend they have become forced sellers — which means that thousands of new For Sale signs will be going up in London and the South - East
in the coming weeks .
Personal bankruptcy : Traders and investment bankers face an uncertain future
If these unemployed investment bankers had the misfortune to buy anywhere near the top of the market , they now face the prospect of personal bankruptcy .
This is because they will find that their houses are worth much less than they paid for
them , and will therefore be unable to repay their loan .
With so many vendors on the market obliged to sell at any price , it can be assumed that any London house will fetch 25 per cent less this weekend than it would have done this time last week .
Many of the younger bankers — those in their 20s and 30s with young families — now face utter disaster .
Of course , there is scant public sympathy for these former ‘ masters of the universe ’ who enjoyed good times .
But we already know that Thursday ’s merger of Lloyds Bank and HBOS ( supposing it
is completed : contrary to statements by Chancellor Alistair Darling , this is by no means certain ) will lead directly to the loss of some 40,000 jobs among
bank workers .
There will be bloodletting on every High Street where there is both an HBOS and Lloyds outlet — one branch will undoubtedly be closed .
But that body - blow is just the start .
Over the coming months , the financial typhoon will mercilessly spread outwards and wreak devastation on the economy .
Banks will foreclose on thousands of small businesses .
Massive corporate failures are inevitable .
These disasters will then rebound on the financial sector , as company bankruptcies
and plunging house prices force fresh balance sheet write - downs and yet more sackings .
Unemployment — already rising fast and up 80,000 over the summer — is set to surge ahead and will increase well above the two million predicted by economists .
This will produce a vicious spiral .
Every worker out of a job means less tax receipts and higher welfare payments .
In last March ’s Budget ( a work of fiction when it was published ) , Alistair Darling forecast borrowing this year of £ 43 billion .
Even at the time , this figure was shockingly large .
It meant that only Egypt , Pakistan and Hungary among significant world economies had more profligate government spending than Britain .
As of this weekend , Government borrowing is out of control .
It will soar nearer £ 100 billion next year — more than double Darling ’s estimate .
This will cast doubt about Britain ’s ability to finance our debt in the international
credit markets .
The International Monetary Fund has already warned Darling about his reckless spending .
In the months to come , it will demand cuts in government spending , just as it did in the 1970s when the then Labour Chancellor , Denis Healey , had to beg for an IMF loan .
Warned : Government borrowing is twice Chancellor Alistair Darling 's estimate and has bought a rebuke from the IMF
Darling will have to take urgent , painful action to reverse the splurge of recent expenditure — welcomed by financially ignorant Labour MPs — on public services , in particular health and education .
And whereas the responsible wing of the Labour Government , as it did in the 1970s , will support this prudence , the Left will call for extra spending to save jobs .
It is likely that the Labour Party will split on this issue — just as it did in the aftermath of the Crash in 1931 and again at the start of the 1980s .
In the medium term , the only resolution to this debt crisis is a rise in inflation , as governments are forced to print money to fend off depression .
Savers should thus brace themselves for the return of double - digit price rises not seen since the early 1980s .
Driven by poverty , crime will also soar — particularly crimes against property .
We should also brace ourselves for a return of political violence to the streets .
Certainly the British National Party will use the economic downturn to agitate against
immigrants , accusing them of having ‘ stolen British jobs ’ .
The BNP made some striking gains at last May ’s elections , and these will continue in the European elections next June .
This is the troubling prospect we face .
But the worldwide consequences are just as
significant and we can expect the Euro to fail under the strain of economic collapse .
The Euro has never been tested by adversity .
The single currency ’s architects made one foolish mistake when they set it up ten years ago : they established monetary union ahead of political union .
In long - established democracies such as Britain and the United States , it is natural for one area of the country to help the other in times of difficulty .
For instance , there was no strong objection when taxpayers in the South were asked to bail out Northern Rock , even though its operations were concentrated in the North - East .
Fascist threat :
Far right parties such as Jean - Marie Le Pen 's FN in France could exploit the situation
However , that is not the case in mainland Europe where French taxpayers would refuse to contribute huge sums to bail out , say , the Italian banking sector .
That is why the Euro is likely to be destroyed by the coming economic storm — just as Britain ’s membership of the European monetary system was smashed on Black Wednesday 1992 .
The truth is that this week ’s seismic events will come as a crashing humiliation to the European political class .
Like in Britain , this crisis will be exploited by the Far Right in countries such as France , Holland and Austria .
These countries have powerful neo - fascist parties which will relish recession , in particular singling out for blame ethnic minorities , just as the Nazis did in Germany after the 1929 crash .
The good news is that Britain — despite the efforts of Tony Blair and others — remains outside the Euro .
It means we can control our interest rates and allow the pound to depreciate , unlike so many European countries , some of which ( such as Ireland ) are already being devoured by recession .
Wall Street Crash :
The US became more insular after the stock market crashed in 1929
But the biggest worry is what will happen in the U.S.
Ever since the end of World War II , America has been the world ’s policeman .
It has been able to play this role , and see off perceived enemies , such as Soviet Russia and Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , because for the past 60 years it has been the greatest global economic power .
The most important question facing the world today is whether the U.S. — already crippled by the estimated $ 2 trillion cost of financing the Iraq occupation — can afford to continue its global role .
The historical precedent is far from encouraging .
After the 1929 crash , the U.S. turned in on itself , resorting to protectionism .
It re-engaged with the world only after the attack by Japan at Pearl Harbour in December 1941 .
It is too early to say for sure , but it is possible that America is at a similar turning point in its history .
President Bush ’s decision to pour taxpayers ’ money into so many bankrupt financial institutions has led to an explosion of U.S. national debt which will be hugely exacerbated by yesterday ’s move in Washington .
As a result , U.S. global creditworthiness is in jeopardy , and it is likely that at some stage over the next decade the dollar will lose its unchallenged status as the world ’s reserve currency .
There are signs that this process has already begun .
For this weakening of the currency was the fate of sterling in the economic crisis of the 1930s .
Indeed , the subsequent decision to take the pound off the Gold Standard in 1931 marked the effective end of the British Empire .
Rising power : China has emerged as a threat to US power , and the recent Beijing Olympics have only added to its stature
America ’s global dominance — already threatened by the emergence of rival economic powers such as China — may soon be coming to its end .
The U.S. will probably retreat inwardly , becoming isolationist , at any rate temporarily — opening the way to a new and even more menacing global order .
It is inevitable that America will soon withdraw from Iraq , leaving its bitter enemy , Iran , unchallenged as the dominant regional power .
China will become ever more assertive and will want to humiliate Washington by seizing control of Taiwan , something the White House will be powerless to resist .
It will move on to threaten nearby India .
Africa will become the scene of proxy wars between China and the West , just as it was the scene of proxy wars between the United States and Soviet Russia for much of the post - war period .
China , much to U.S. fury , will also start to meddle in Latin America .
The world that will emerge from the Great Crash of 2008 , therefore , will be dark and unpredictable .
This weekend , all sensible families will go through their finances , anticipate the inevitable problems that lie ahead , and cut back at once on unnecessary spending such as eating out , second cars and foreign holidays .
For the past 25 years we have lived through a glorious party .
We have all — governments , companies , banks and , of course , consumers — lived beyond our means and are paying the price .
This weekend the hangover begins .
It will be prolonged .
Life will be much closer to the austerity that followed World War II than the frenzied , debt - fuelled boom of the past two decades .
Perhaps our lives will be none the worse for all this .
Our values will certainly change — many will say not before time .
Material objects should count for much less .
Almost overnight we have entered a new world , and we must learn to make the best of it .
Stereotype much ?
It 's turning out to be a really good week to be a mother .
I mean , there 's still a lot of laundry , I 'd really like to know what made the coffee table so sticky overnight and if anybody has any idea where Sam 's glasses might be I 'd be thrilled , but overall ... this week it 's a nifty gig .
( Yeah , I know .
These moments in motherhood are really just filling me up with warm emotions and good memories of my daughters , so that I 'll actually go post bail when the police call a couple of years from now .
I understand what 's going on , I 'm just choosing the happy path of denial . )
Sam 's choir sang the anthems at the Skydome last night .
( Blue Jays vs Kansas City Royals .
We thumped them 10 - 3 , nothing personal ) .
Seeing your kid on the jumbo - tron is pretty freakin cool .
I put a little circle around Sam .
I realize that not even one of you gives a whit about which one of those fuzzy blobs is my child , but I 'm still pretty happy about my kids doing nice , wholesome things ... like knitting , singing in the choir and going to baseball games .
The whole of Team Harlot ( man ... we should get tee - shirts ) went to the game .
Ken knit
and my super - fun brother Ian and his lovely wife Ali drank beer in a supportive fashion .
( Hey ...everybody has a skill . )
This brings us to today 's topic .
What do you believe that people think about you when you knit in public ?
What assumptions do they make about your personality , values or politics ?
How do you think this is related to your gender ?
I think that when I knit in public I 'm usually viewed as someone who 's clean living , conservative and generally a " good girl " .
Little old men who do n't speak English are drawn to me and smile at my knitting and pat my arm and try to introduce me to their sons .
Other women sometimes want to talk to me about being " counter - feminist " .
( Here 's a funny thing , both of those generalizations about me make me want to knit pasties and a thong , just to shake everybody up . )
Now when Ken knits in public , I think people think several things about him ( it is worth noting that Ken thinks differently , I 'm sure he 'll pipe up ) .
I think they assume he is gay .
Men think they could take him in a fight , and women , well , here is where Ken and I part ways , I think that women find it an attractive quality .
( Not sexually attractive , since they think he 's gay for knitting too ) but attractive in a friendly sort of way , like " Oh what a sensitive , lovely , artistic man . "
Let 's sum up .
For the record , Ken and I are in the same age bracket , and possess a similar " hipness " factor .
( Give it up Ken , I 'm at least as cool as you )
Stephanie knitting in public = conservative , good marriage material , traditional , anti-feminist , probably boring .
Ken knitting in public = liberal , terrible marriage material ( except in Canada and a couple of states ) , absolutely non-traditional , open - minded and artistic .
Clearly , I 'm generalizing , the world is filled with people who assume nothing based on your gender , sexuality or hobby ... and by far and away , those are the people I meet .
All I 'm saying is that when I do run into somebody whose interested in stereotyping us knitters by gender ... this has been my experience .
Your milage may vary , especially according to where you live and what you have pierced .

ORLANDO , Fla. , Oct. 19 ( UPI ) -- Republican U.S. presidential nominee John McCain is being hammered by some within his own party and the conservative media for the way he has run his campaign .
Conservative Bill Kristol , editor of The Weekly Standard , has said McCain was " flailing around , " while former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson , when asked whether he was happy with McCain 's campaign , replied , " No. I do n't know who is . "

For his part , Washington Post columnist George Will said it was " too late " for McCain to " come up with a new persona . "
The comments were put together in an e-mail from Florida Democrats , The Orlando ( Fla . ) Sentinel reported Sunday .
The newspaper reported that many Republican heavyweights in Florida wonder whether McCain 's national campaign has taken the state for granted .
" My question would be , ' What campaign ? '
I just do n't see one , " said Bill Negron , an Orlando member of McCain 's regional Hispanic steering committee .
" To me , it looks like people are working hard to ensure that McCain does n't get elected . "
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has led in 10 of the past 11 polls , while McCain has struggled to gain traction .
Obama has 300 staffers in the state working alongside thousands of volunteers .
The Illinois senator has also outspent McCain 3 - to - 1 on television advertising .

Indian Pudding was on the menus absolutely everywhere we went in Sturbridge , Massachusetts .
We finally tried it the day we had lunch at the Old Sturbridge Village Tavern .
We were expecting a dish something like southern classics corn pone ( an eggless corn bread ) , corn pudding ( somwhere between a quiche and a souffle ) , or spoon bread ( a pudding - like bread ) .
We could n’t have been more wrong !
It turns out that Indian Pudding , which originated in New England , is a spicy baked pudding made chiefly of cornmeal , milk , and molasses .
The name Indian pudding comes from the addition of cornmeal — early colonists called most everything made with corn “ Indian . ”
Originally the pudding was cooked in a pot over the open hearth and was very dense .
And it is NOTHING like the southern dishes we had in mind .
Indian pudding is traditionally serviced with ice cream , whipped cream , or hard sauce for a reason .
We declined all of the above , and quickly regretted our choice .
What we received was essentially big bowl of warm molasses , slightly diluted with cornmeal and ginger .
It was astoundingly strong in flavour .
Neil , a molasses fan , thought the Indian Pudding was amazing .
I found it too sweet to eat .
I also got so loopy from the iron and sugar in just a spoonful that I spent the afternoon running and whooping up and down the dirt roads of historic Old Sturbridge Village ( OSV ) .
( Picture an overstimulated child the day after Halloween : that was me .
Parents and school teachers will know exactly what I ’m talking about . )
To put that phenomenal sugar rush into perspective , the OSV tinker told us that the early settlers at Sturbridge ate an average diet of 5,000 calories a day , and yet had life expectancies into the 70’s and 80’s : they burned off the calories with hard physical labour .
Indian Pudding had to go a long way to making up those 5,000 calories .
This is a good dish to serve on the crisp autumn weekend you fill your cellar with wood for the winter .
Or the day you shovel driveways for your entire zip code .
It should also be a big winner with any anemics or vegan vampires you have over for Thanksgiving dinner .
You can find recipes for Indian Pudding in both Fanny Farmer and the Joy of Cooking , or you can try this recipe from Jasper White ’s Cooking from New England via Steven Frederick ’s blog .
Indian Pudding
2 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cups milk
5 Tablespoons yellow cornmeal or johnnycake meal
1/3 cup molasses
1/3 cup maple syrup
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground ginger
1 egg beaten
1 cup cold milk
Heavy or light cream for serving
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees .
Grease a 1 ½ quart soufflé mold or baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter ; set aside .
Heat 3 cups of milk in a saucepan until it is close to a boil .
Add the cornmeal and reduce heat to low .
Stir until the mixture thickens ( about 5 minutes ) .
Remove from the heat and add the remaining butter , the molasses , maple syrup , salt , cinnamon , ginger and egg .
Pour into buttered mold or dish .
Place in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes .
Pour the cold milk over the pudding and return to the oven .
Cook for 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes more or until the top is brown and crisp .
Serve hot with cream .
Serves 6 to 8 people .
And if Indian Pudding is n’t hearty enough for your tastes , you might want to try flumadiddle : a baked main course pudding from New England made with stale bread , molasses , spices and pork fat .
Enjoy your taste of Massachusetts !

A Turkish court has blocked access to the popular blog hosting service Blogger ( Blogger.com and Blogspot.com owned by Google ) , since Friday , October 24th , 2008 .
According to BasBasBas.com , a Dutch blogger based in Istanbul , who alerted us to the issue :
It is suspected that the reason for this has something to do with Adnan Oktar , by some considered the leading Muslim advocate for creationism , who has in the past managed to get WordPress , Google Groups , as well as Richard Dawkins ’ website .
Turkish Internet users are seeing this message when trying to visit Blogger.com and all blogs hosted on blogspot.com hosting service : “ Access to this website has been suspended in accordance with decision no .
2008/2761 of the TR Diyarbakir First Criminal Court of Peace . ”
Screenshot of the Turkish blockpage .
Source : BasBasBas.com
This is the second instance of a popular blogging service being blocked in Turkey .
In August 2007 , the Turkish Fatih Second Civil Court of First Instance blocked access to the entire wordpress.com domain after alleged libel of Turkish Islamic - creationist , Adnan Oktar , aka Harun Yahya .
Adnan Oktar has been very harmful to the access of Turkish Netizens to the Internet .
He has succeeded in getting a variety of major websites banned by court decisions .
Next to these two blogging services , Adnan Oktar also filed a complaint against Google Groups , which led to the ban of the website .
Turkey also blocks access to both video - sharing websites , Youtube and Dailymotion over videos deemed insulting to the country ’s founding father , Kemal Atatürk .
Slide , the maker of social networking widgets , has also been blocked by a Turkish court for “ harboring pictures and articles that are considered to be insulting to Ataturk . ”
Update # 1 via Cyber - Rights .
Org.TR :
It is now being reported by Turk.
internet.com that the blocking order is related to an intellectual property infringement .
Digitürk is a subscription based digital TV platform in Turkey which owns the right to transmit the live coverage of the Turkish football league games .
Digitürk obtained the blocking order through the Diyarbakir court according to the Turk.
internet.com news as there were blog entries providing information and links to known websites which transmit pirated transmission of the live football league games .
Update # 2 via CyberLaw Blog : CyberLaw Blog reported today ( October 28 , 2008 ) that the ban on blogspot.com blogging platform has been lifted by the Diyarbakir First Criminal Court :
Startup chipmaker Quantenna Communications says that it can push 1 Gbps over regular WiFi without defying the laws of physics .
This is n't as hyped up as it sounds at first glance .
The company 's initial goal is to cover houses with a combination of high bandwidth and mesh networking , making it possible to push multiple streams of video and data without glitches at slower rates — as fast as 100 to 200 Mbps .
Their future sights are set on the enterprise market where 1 G bps might mean something .
Quantenna can claim to have made the most interesting announcement about WiFi since Draft N devices started to ship in earnest .
By providing twice or three times the current throughput , Quantenna might allow WiFi to step into businesses — as well as the homes they 're initially targeting .
The company 's founder , chairman , and chief executive Behrooz Rezvani said in an interview that WiFi used as a point source in a home is n't very effective .
He said , " One source point can not cut it — you cannot solve the whole networking problem by having one source , one radio . "
This was one of the reasons Draft N was developed in the first place : greater coverage through several different improvements .
( That 's the preratification marketing name for the engineering group IEEE 's 802.11n protocol ; the standard wo n't be formally approved until next year . )
Quantenna fits four to eight radios , a processor ,
a DSP , and other components into a tiny package
But Draft N still can't cut it by itself , even though it marked a large improvement over 802.11g .
" You can not light the house with a single lightbulb , " he said .
As with lighting , even a bright bulb leaves some areas in shadow , while others are well lit .
Draft N might reach two to four times further than 54 M bps 802.11g , but that still leaves some parts of a home in the dark .
Solving problems
Rezvani said that Quantenna wants to solve three separate problems for home Wi -Fi networks : overcoming interference from dense arrays of networks in apartment buildings , penetrating the thick walls often found in European homes , and spreading a signal out to cover expansive American houses from basement to upper floors .
Its solution was to use optional elements in the 802.11n standard that let them add more antennas and radios than any system sold today for the home or enterprise .
Rezvani said several times in the interview that his far - larger competitors like Broadcom or Atheros could choose to enhance their products in the same way , but had n't yet done so ; I 've heard nothing publicly or privately about a roadmap including these features , either , even though they have long been under discussion .
Most Draft N access points currently have either two or three send - and - receive antennas .
This provides enough diversity to steer signals through beamforming — a kind of " body English " for radio waves — and to hear and differentiate fainter signals or those overlapping with other networks .
Draft N also requires two separate signal streams for spatial multiplexing .
With spatial multiplexing , the multipath reflection of signals across space are used to WiFi 's advantage to as much as double throughput .
Devices on the market currently use two spatial streams , each of which can use ( depending on country - specific regulation ) up to 40MHz " wide " channels , which are twice as wide as the normal channels used in 802.11a , 802.11 b , and 802.11g .
With other improvements over 802.11g , Draft N in its mandatory basic form can push 300 M bps of raw data between a gateway and a client .
Quantenna 's improvements
Where Quantenna improves on this is by using four antennas each for sending and receiving and four radios for each band .
With a " 4x4 " array , " You can shape the beam a lot better , " Rezvani said .
Rezvani says that their 4x4 quadruples the area covered by a current device using the same power .
You can " double throughput for the same radius , or double your radius for the same throughput , " he said .
More antennas increase effective antenna gain .
Quantenna has initially announced three chipsets , all of them far smaller and requiring fewer external components than the equivalent products assembled from components made by other WiFi chipmakers .
The QHS450 ( 2.4GHz ) and QHS600 ( 5GHz ) both have four radios and work in a single band ; the QHS1000 has eight radios and works concurrently in both 2.4 and 5GHz bands .
They 'll ship in 2009 .
For the home , Rezvani expects that manufacturers will use the firm 's chips in 4x4 mode where the four radios are split into two sets , each transmitting the same data .
This redundancy lowers real throughput , maxing out at 100 Mbps in 2.4GHz and 200 M bps in 5GHz , but increases reliability by sending each bit along two separate paths .
But the same chips can give up redundancy in favor of performance , useful in an enterprise where nodes may be closely spaced .
In that scenario , each set of two radios would pair with a 2x2 antenna array , allowing the single - band chipsets to handle two wide channels at the same time , and the dual - band chipset to handle four separate channels across two bands concurrently .
This allows the QHS1000 to deliver a raw aggregate over 1 Gbps .
The company has developed a reference design for a small , concurrent dual - band mesh node that could be used to extend signals through a home .
The device uses the QHS1000 so that it can use whichever band and channels are most appropriate to spread data in a mesh among nodes , and feed out the highest throughput to devices that need it , such as streaming high - definition or high - speed data transfers .
The company 's mesh technology is built on 802.11s , another IEEE standard that 's still working its way to market .
( Mesh nodes exchange data among routes that they agree on among themselves , rather than through a hub - and - spoke layout . )
Because the design can use multiple channels at once , the mesh nodes can coordinate on changing channels in band — keeping data flowing over one band while they switch to another — or dynamically reconfigure the number of active channels by switching among 2x2 and 4x4 configurations while continuing to send data .
This overcomes limitations in single - radio mesh nodes that have to reuse the same spectrum by sending the same data twice or more times to reach more distant nodes .
Rezvani pointed out that the company is more interested in getting chips into equipment makers ' hands than in proscribing what their products do .
He expects a lot of different kinds of products to appear , because of how Quantenna 's chips can be configured for different uses from one second to the next .
Quantenna is estimating a cost of about $ 20 for its single - band and $ 40 for their concurrent dual - band chipsets in large quantities in 2009 .
Those prices are far higher than current Draft N chipsets , but Quantenna has integrated components that are n't usually included in the basic chipset costs .
Startup chipmakers in an established market like the WiFi realm have to come with products that are instantly mature , unique , and easy to work with .
Quantenna may be far ahead of its less nimble brethren , or it may be days away from announcing similar products themselves .
In either case , WiFi is about to take a big leap forward in range , speed , and flexibility without a commensurate jump in price .

The biggest ever sale of oil assets will take place today , when the Iraqi government puts 40bn barrels of recoverable reserves up for offer in London .
BP , Shell and ExxonMobil are all expected to attend a meeting at the Park Lane Hotel in Mayfair with the Iraqi oil minister , Hussein al - Shahristani .
Access is being given to eight fields , representing about 40 % of the Middle Eastern nation 's reserves , at a time when the country remains under occupation by US and British forces .
Two smaller agreements have already been signed with Shell and the China National Petroleum Corporation , but today 's sale will ignite arguments over whether the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a " war for oil " that is now to be consummated by western multinationals seizing control of strategic Iraqi reserves .
Al - Shahristani is expected to reveal some kind of " risk service agreements " that could run for up to 20 years , with formal offers to be submitted by next spring and agreements signed in the summer .
Gregg Muttitt , from the UK - based social and ecological justice group Platform , says he is alarmed that the government is pushing ahead with its plans without the support of many in Iraq .
" Most of the terms of what is being offered have not been disclosed .
There are security , political and reputational risks here for oil companies but none of them will want to see one of their competitors gain an advantage , " he said .
Heinrich Matthee , a senior Middle East analyst at the specialist risk consultant Control Risks Group , also believes there are many pitfalls for those considering whether to make an offer .
" Currently it is unclear which party in Iraq is authorised to award a contract and at the same time to deliver its side of the bargain , " he said .
" Any contract with an independent oil company will be subjected to opposition and possible revision after pressure by resource nationalists . "
Oil companies will find their reputations at risk from the actions of their Iraqi counterparties , such as joint venture partners , suppliers and agents .
They will also have to contend with oil smuggling and the possibility that the ruling alliance could collapse , Matthee said .
He said that if the conspiracy theory that western oil companies egged on US and British governments to invade Iraq were true , the plan could backfire on them and benefit rivals in Asia instead .
" It is possible the American army has provided the economic stability that will encourage Malaysian , Chinese and other Asian companies to become involved , " he said .
There is no precedent for proven oil reserves of this magnitude being offered up for sale , said Muttitt .
" The nearest thing would be the post - Soviet sale of the Kashagan field [ in the Caspian Sea ] , which had 7bn or 8bn barrels . "
China 's state - owned oil group , CNPC , has already agreed a $ 3bn ( £ 1.78 bn ) oil services contract with the government of Iraq to pump oil from the Ahdab oil field .
The deal is the first major oil contract with a foreign firm since the US - led war and was followed up by an agreement with Shell , potentially worth $ 4bn , to develop a joint venture with the South Gas Company in Basra .
This deal has also triggered controversy .
Issam al - Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister between 1987 and 1990 , questioned why there had been no competitive tendering for the gas - gathering contract and claimed it had gone to Shell as the spoils of war .
" Why choose Shell when you could have chosen ExxonMobil , Chevron , BG or Gazprom ? " he asked .
" Shell appears to be paying $ 4bn to get hold of assets that in 20 years could be worth $ 40 bn .
Iraq is giving away half its gas wealth and yet this work could have been done by Iraq itself . "
The Baghdad government says it aims to increase crude oil production from 2.5 m barrels a day to 4.5 m by 2013 , but faces internal opposition from regional governors and political opponents .
The sale today comes as oil prices have plummeted after stockmarket turmoil on Friday .
The price of crude fell by more than $ 4 at one point to $ 75 a barrel - the lowest point since September last year and a sharp drop from its peak of $ 147 in July .
Opec , the oil producers ' cartel , has called an emergency meeting to agree a cut in output to bolster prices in spite of protestations from politicians including Gordon Brown .
Brown said on Friday : " We 've had some success in getting the price of oil down : the price this morning is roughly $ 80 , about half what it was a few months ago .
I want these price cuts passed on to the consumer as quickly as possible .
" I 'm concerned when I hear that the Opec countries are meeting , or are about to meet , to discuss cutting production - in other words , making the price potentially higher than it should be .
" I 'm making it clear to Opec it would be wrong for the world economy and wrong for British people who are paying high petrol prices and high fuel prices to cut production and therefore keep prices high . "
A government source said : " The one chink of light has been the fall in the price of oil .
The last thing we want is to head into a difficult period with a return to high oil prices .
People need to act responsibly . "
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s capital started pumping “ emergency ” water from its long - parched neighboring province on Thursday , with officials speaking of a “ grim ” shortfall weeks after the Olympics when they said the city had enough water .

Hebei , which surrounds
Beijing , will pump 300 million cubic meters of water to the capital from three dams which usually supply nearby farms , towns and cities , the province water office said on its website ( www.hebwater.gov.cn).
Officials said the capital faced a serious shortfall but made no secret of the strains the transfer places on Hebei , which faces its own chronic water scarcity .
“ Owing to continuous drought in recent years , the water situation in the capital Beijing is grim and water sources are quite strained , ” said a statement on the website , adding that the two government had reached an agreement on the supplies .
“ This water is being transferred in circumstances when our province ’s water resources are extremely scarce and is an emergency transfer . ”
The water will flow through a 309 - km ( 192 - mile ) canal quickly built for the Beijing Olympics that will later form part of the larger South - to - North Water Transfer Project .
During the Games in August , city officials said they did not need the “ emergency ” supplies that Hebei and nearby provinces set aside in case the “ green ” Games host city faced shortages .
“ I believe the Olympic Games will not pose a big challenge to water supplies in the city , ” Water Ministry official Hu Siyi told reporters in mid-August .
But as north China approaches the dry winter season , officials said Beijing now needs the supplies .
Hebei will pump the extra supplies for 174 days until March 2009 , the provincial water office said .
“ This transfer is all part of a plan , ” Lu Shengfang , a deputy director of the South - North Water Diversion Project , which is overseeing the transfer , told Reuters .
“ With the unusually rainy wet season ending , we believe Hebei has enough water to supplement Beijing . ”
Beijing , with 16 million inhabitants , used 3.5 billion cubic meters of water in 2007 , according to city statistics .
Much of that comes from dams and underground reservoirs sourced in Hebei .
The capital ’s plans to pump the water during the Games met with grumbling from provincial officials , protests and complaints from Hebei farmers and criticism from environmental advocates , who said it encouraged waste .
Vice Minister of Water Resources Jiao Yong urged Hebei officials to avoid fresh tensions .
“ Strengthen security and protection work for taking the water ... do well in protecting stability , ” he told them , according to the province water office website .
Hebei ranks near the bottom of China ’s 31 provinces and province - status cities in water resources per head , with one eighth of the national average , according to province estimates .
Dai Qing , a Beijing environmental activist who has long criticized the city ’s water policies , said she was mystified by the sudden announcement .
“ I ’m puzzled why now , after they said they would need Hebei ’s water for the Olympics , and then said they would n’t , ” she said .
“ The authorities said they had enough for the Olympics , but I think now that ca n’t be believed . ”

How psychological warefare was used during the Caucasian War by western corporate media against Russia Tlaxcala published these evidence weeks ago .
It is time to realize the dimension of effect on our minds by modern media warfare .
On September 1 the European Union is going to meet in Brussell to debate sanctions against Russia who has been attacked by NATO - backed Georgia .
On September 2 US Vice President Dick Cheney will arrive in Georgia to support this President Saakashvili who has started all this .
May the worldwide public not sleep this time .
A few days after these pictures had been analyzed by the Russian blog " Russia Insider " and the Serbian blog " Byzantine blog " as fake ones , staged by the photographer David Mdzinarishvili , some of them have been simply removed from the website of " Reuters " .
Here the deconstruction made by " Byzantine blog " .
This ( upper ) photo was first published by the Reuters as an image of a " dead woman being carried from the town of Gori " .
But this " dead woman " , incredibly , is clutching the nurse�s arm .
This man exhibiting rage and grief happens to sit in the exact same place where the earlier picture was taken : the same pile of garbage is behind his back and scraps of metal from the picture of a " dead " woman being ' rescued � are lying around like in the earlier photo � plus some , additional , unidentified scraps of metal .
What are these supposed to represent ?
The caption Reuters gave to this photo is " Georgians stand next to the body of their son in the town of Gori " .
The woman is looking up towards the sky from where , presumably , death had stricken " her son " .
But for the purposes of this photo the body of the " son " has been obviously moved quite a bit away from the curb .
This was clearly not done in order to cover up the naked parts of the dead man�s body , nor to allow some measure of dignity to the dead .
Was it done for the light ?
( One should challenge Reuters to find a mother � any mother � who would allow the body of her child to be dragged through dirt half naked like this , while she is taking instructions from a photographer where to stand , where to look and what to do next ) .
Then there are a few more photos of the male actor shown up above in the same area like the " dead woman " .
And then , then there is a further actor , a female , who arrived in time on a bigger film set in Tbilisi .
And then , just like in Iraq ( but only in the beginning ) , some supernumeraries ( formerly called " people " ) would like to say " Thank you , Mr.Bush " .
And of course , we also want to thank the academy �
You did a great job .. ( � ) related article ( German ) : 21.08.08 Die Kunst des Krieges

A very young Republican Karl Rove is born in Denver in 1950 .
His father , Louis , is a mineral geologist and travels extensively for work , and the family moves several times during Rove 's childhood .
At age 9 , Rove is a vocal supporter of Richard Nixon 's presidential campaign -- so vocal , in fact , that an older girl , a would - be Kennedy voter , beats him up .
" Karl Rove , I think , was a Republican before he was anything else , " says Wayne Slater , author of Bush 's Brain .
" His sister recounts a story when he was a little kid and other kids had posters of football players or basketball players and sports heroes on the wall , Karl had a poster on his wall , she said , that said , ' Wake Up , America ! '
He was a conservative , politically conservative person I think well before he could vote . "
High school politics Karl Rove ( with arms outstretched ) on high school trip to capitol Rove 's family moves to Salt Lake City , where he enrolls at Olympus High School .
Often seen at school carrying a briefcase and wearing a coat and tie , he hones his skills in debate tournaments .
He is good at intimidating his opponents -- sometimes bluffing by bringing boxes of index cards that are actually blank .
He quickly becomes one of the state 's best young debaters .
Running successfully for president of the student senate , he beats out a more popular rival with a campaign that pokes gentle fun at professional politicians ' tactics .
And for a class project , Rove helps out on Senator Wallace Bennett 's re-election campaign .
A Senate campaign Rove enters the University of Utah and joins the College Republicans , who send him to Illinois to work on the successful Senate bid of Ralph Smith .
Rove will later admit that during the campaign , he goes into the offices of a Democratic candidate for state treasurer , steals stationery , and uses it to mock up fake invitations advertising a party with " free beer , free food , girls and a good time for nothing " -- at the same time as the Democrat 's campaign headquarters is scheduled to open .
Rove distributes the invitations at hippie communes , concerts , and soup kitchens , and twice as many people as expected show up at the opening .
Rove 's reputation grows in the College Republicans , but at home he is going through a difficult time .
During his first year of college his parents divorce and not long after , he learns that Louis Rove , the man he thought was his father , is not .
He does not meet his biological father until he is in his 40s .
A talent for direct mail Rove serves as national executive director of the College Republicans .
A master at condensing a complicated message into a few forceful points , he puts together direct - mail programs and brochures for the organization .
" I did n't know anyone of his age that could put together these type of materials , " says Joe Abate , who was chair of the College Republicans at the time and was a mentor to Rove .
" It turned out [ that it ] became his business , his direct mail .
And I could see why he became one of the best direct mail political consultants in the country years later .
But , his energy , I mean he was 24/7 . "
During this time , Rove also travels extensively , teaching weekend seminars for campus conservatives across the country .
" Dirty tricks " for the College Republicans ?
Rove leaves school to campaign for chair of the College Republicans and he gets help from a young Lee Atwater , who would later run George H. W. Bush 's presidential campaign .
The heated campaign splits the College Republicans into warring factions at the national convention where Rove and his team challenge the credentials of delegates who oppose them .
Both Rove and his opponent claim victory and the matter is sent to Republican National Committee Chairman George H. W. Bush for resolution .
In the meantime , one of Rove 's opponents leaks a tape to The Washington Post of a Rove college seminar , in which Rove recounts a tale of dirty tricks .
At Bush 's request , an FBI agent questions Rove .
Atwater signs an affidavit swearing that the dirty tricks story was told only in jest .
A GOP investigating committee eventually clears Rove , and he takes the reins of the College Republicans .
Politics has become his passion .
But because of this , Rove never gets his college degree .
As the College Republicans ' chairman in Washington , the 22 - year old Rove also performs small tasks for Bush , who is becoming one of his mentors .
In November , Bush asks Rove to take a set of car keys to his son George W. Bush , who is visiting home during a break from Harvard Business School .
Rove is instantly taken with the young Bush 's charisma .
The two hit it off .
Raising money -- and his profile Rove moves to Virginia in 1976 to serve as finance director for the state GOP , which does not have a single fundraising event on its schedule .
Within a year , Rove has pulled in more than $ 400,000 through direct mail .
Oil well in Texas In January 1977 , he relocates to Texas to work as a fundraiser for George H. W. Bush 's presidential - exploration political action committee .
Rove also serves as an informal adviser to George W. Bush , who is making his first run for Congress .
Money flows into the young Bush 's campaign , but Texas is a tough ground for Republicans -- the state is so dominated by Democrats that the number of Republicans in its senate can be counted on one hand .
Bush loses .
Rove fares better with another of his candidates , Bill Clements , who is running for governor .
Clements wins , becoming the first Republican elected to that office in 104 years , and he makes Rove his chief of staff .
Shortly after his move to Texas , Rove marries a Houston socialite , Valerie Wainwright , who is friendly with the Bush family .
But Rove 's busy schedule keeps him away from home much of the time .
She files for divorce in 1979 .
Two years later , Rove 's mother commits suicide .
A growing business , a growing political party Rove opens a direct - mail business , Rove + Company , in Austin in 1981 .
He handpicks Republican candidates to run for statewide races and throws the firm 's efforts behind them .
At first , he is widely regarded as backing hopeless cases -- " funny , charming , but in a futile situation that no one thought would change very soon , " recalls Kim Ross , a lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association .
In 1982 , every Republican running for a statewide office loses ( including Gov. Clements , who is seeking re-election ) .
But Rove sees that demographics in Texas are beginning to shift , and the burgeoning suburbs are fertile ground for Republicans seeking new voters .
In 1983 , Rove engineers U.S. Representative Phil Gramm 's switch to the Republican Party and helps him win a Senate seat a year later .
By the mid-'80s , thanks to Rove , the Texas GOP has the nation 's first voter database and Rove has become a key player in state politics .
A blueprint for winning Rove , eager to see Clements in the governor 's seat again , drafts a memo that foreshadows future Rove campaigns .
He quotes Napoleon , advising candidates to put forth " a well - reasoned and extremely circumspect defensive , [ sic ] followed by rapid and audacious attack . "
In a later memo , he tells his candidates to focus on suburban voters , emphasizing education , traditional values and lower taxes and to take pains to appear " compassionate . "
Using Rove 's strategy , Clements regains the governor 's office in 1986 .
That year , Rove marries Darby Hickson , a graphic designer who works for his company .
Rove helps remake the Texas Supreme Court Rove finds a neglected issue , tort reform , and turns it into a campaign weapon .
The state Supreme Court , dominated by Democrats , regularly issues rulings that reward plaintiffs with huge amounts of money .
The story is pushed to " 60 Minutes , " which runs an expose probing the influence of campaign money , particularly from Democratic trial lawyers , on judicial decisions in Texas .
The issue receives widespread attention .
Aided by an aggressive grassroots campaign called " Clean Slate ' 88 , " Rove engineers the election of a Republican as the state 's chief justice , and conservatives go on to win five of the six open seats on the court that year .
The judicial wins also help Rove build up a group of donors in the business community , and it has the added benefit of shutting down the trial lawyers -- and cutting off their money to the Democrats .
Bush puts off a run for office ; Rove focuses elsewhere Rove begins to nudge George W. Bush toward a run for Texas governor , bringing in experts to tutor him on policy and introducing him to local reporters .
But Bush worries that voters will cry nepotism if he runs during his father 's presidency and he postpones his candidacy .
Rove backs another Republican for governor , but his candidate loses in the primaries and Democrat Ann Richards ultimately wins office in 1990 .
Still , Texas Republicans are increasingly finding that they can succeed in statewide races .
Other Rove candidates are winning : Rick Perry , the future governor of the state , becomes agriculture commissioner , and Kay Bailey Hutchison becomes treasurer .
" [ Rove ] ultimately , by the early 1990s , was the single most powerful political figure in Texas in determining who was on the ballot and who was not … " says Wayne Slater , author of Bush 's Brain .
" Karl 's imprimatur was absolutely needed .
Because unless you had the okay from Karl … then it was clear to the rest of the Republican Party that you would not have the money you needed to run a successful campaign . "
Bush wins the governorship Rove helps Hutchison win a special Senate election in 1993 .
He also has interests in Alabama , where he helps the GOP try to take control of the state Supreme Court , much as he did in Texas .
But his real focus is still on George W. Bush .
In 1993 , he again urges George W. Bush to run for governor against Richards -- and this time , Bush agrees .
According to Washington Post reporter Dana Milbank , Rove gives Bush a book , The Dream and the Nightmare by Myron Magnet , that will later form the basis of " compassionate conservatism . "
He also relies on many of his time - tested strategies , such as campaigning in small towns and the growing suburbs .
Bush runs on four major issues : juvenile justice , tort reform , welfare reform , and education .
Ann Richards
" So you had this model of four issues , " says Slater , " so whenever George Bush was asked in the governor 's race about a fifth issue or a sixth issue or a seventh issue , he invariably stayed on message , and moved back to these four issues . "
Bush is a longshot to beat Ann Richards , the extremely popular incumbent .
But he rides a wave that also sweeps Republicans into power at the federal level , and in 1994 becomes Texas governor .
Power in Texas and victories in Alabama Newly installed as governor , Bush pushes hard for the policies he campaigned on , but he also reaches out to Democratic legislators .
Soon , buzz begins about an eventual presidential run .
Rove 's influence is still felt in the state legislature ; in 1996 , with the victory of Rove candidate Robert Duncan , Republicans gain control of the Texas senate .
Rove 's efforts in Alabama also bear fruit .
According to The Atlantic Monthly , Rove allegedly arranges for the printing of anonymous fliers viciously attacking Harold See , his own candidate for a state Supreme Court seat .
The ploy makes
See 's opponent look bad , and See wins the race .
The bigger contest ahead Running for re-election in 1998 , Bush wins by a wide margin and Republicans also win every other statewide office .
But Rove has a bigger contest on his mind : the presidency .
Rove turns his full focus toward a Bush presidential run .
As he did with Bush 's gubernatorial campaign , he brings in teams of experts to tutor the candidate .
He also ensures that reporters see Bush talking with luminaries from across the country -- a tactic modeled on William McKinley 's 1896 " front porch " campaign .
A year later , Bush officially announces he will run for president .
By June of 1999 , he and Rove have raised $ 36.3 million , nearly triple the previous record .
According to the New York Review of Books , around this time Rove begins making national media contacts and forges an alliance with anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist , a renowned coalition builder within the Republican Party .
Embarrassment in New Hampshire , success in South Carolina Sen .
John McCain surrounded by the press Partly due to his fundraising juggernaut , Bush becomes the early favorite to win the Republican Party 's presidential nomination .
But he faces unexpectedly stiff competition from Arizona Sen .
John McCain , a " straight - talking " Vietnam War hero who appeals to moderate Republicans and independents -- and whose campaign is being run by one of Rove 's biggest rivals from his Texas days , John Weaver .
Rove underestimates McCain 's appeal , particularly in a state with open primaries , and is caught off - guard when McCain trounces Bush in the New Hampshire contest .
" I think that any almost other campaign would not have survived that defeat .
We lost by 19 points , " says Republican strategist Mark McKinnon .
" Guys that worked with me in that campaign who have worked on other presidential campaigns were literally packing their bags . "
Instead , Rove and Bush move on to the South Carolina primary , where they run a much tougher campaign , questioning McCain 's commitment to pro-life policies , baiting him into going off message , and co-opting his own image as a reformer .
In South Carolina , McCain faces a brutal whispering campaign about his mental health , his wife 's admitted battle with a dependency on prescription drugs and whether he had fathered a black child out of wedlock .
( The McCains had adopted a Bangladeshi child from Mother Teresa 's orphanage . )
Bush , whose campaign denies any role in the rumors , wins by a wide margin in South Carolina , and by March , McCain is out of the race .
The 2000 Campaign Rove feels that although the GOP is divided into several factions , the special interests within it can be brought together by their common views on certain issues .
As a result , George W. Bush runs on some of the same planks that served him well in his Texas campaigns -- particularly education , which complements his " compassionate conservative " image -- and Rove encourages him to also emphasize faith - based initiatives .
" They felt that the compassionate conservative notion provided an umbrella that let them not only speak to the base , but to speak to others who might be swing voters , others who might be a little more moderate in the party … , " says Washington Post reporter Dan Balz .
" [ The ] issues always fit in , but it was always a sense of those issues as a way of stitching together the strongest Republican base you could have and build out from there . "
Election Day Despite the last - minute revelation of Bush 's 1976 DUI charge -- a development that Rove blames for a sudden dip in Bush 's numbers -- the Republican camp projects confidence on Election Day .
" You have Karl Rove travelling with the press , throwing a football around with the press , giving these predictions of these amazing Electoral College totals , " says Washington Post reporter Mike Allen .
" And it was an effort to build momentum . "
As the exit - polls and election results come in , and the networks first give Florida to Gore and then recant , Bush grows worried and calls his parents to warn them it could " be a long night . "
Rove , watching the results , knows that the networks are forgetting the Florida Panhandle , which he expects to show strong turnout for Bush .
At 2 a.m. the morning after Election Day , the first of many Bush staffers are dispatched to Florida .
Already the plan for re-election …
With votes still being counted in Florida , Bush operatives are already planning their strategy for the 2004 election .
Bush finally gains the presidency on Dec. 12 .
A month later , Rove -- now a senior adviser to the president and occupying the White House office that formerly belonged to Hillary Clinton -- launches the " 72 - Hour Task Force , " an experiment in using grassroots efforts to win a campaign in its last three days .
Rove has already realized the importance of evangelical Christians to the Republican coalition .
He believes that 4 million of them failed to vote for Bush in 2000 , partly because of the Bush DUI charge .
Rove begins to formulate a new strategy : Energize the conservative base and go after the evangelicals , Hispanics , Catholics , and other potential affinity groups to build a Republican majority .
" The 72 - hour project was designed , in a way , to get a piece here and a piece there , " says Washington Post reporter Dan Balz .
" How do we get social conservatives more significantly than we 've been able to get them ?
How do we get people who have just moved into an area , who ought to be our voters , but who may be irregular voters ?
How do we get Hispanics ?
How do we get Roman Catholics ?
And there are pieces for all of that . "
Arriving at the White House , 50 - year old senior adviser Karl Rove sets up an informal network -- comprised largely of consultants and unknown state legislators around the country -- to keep him abreast of political opinion in their regions .
He also calls meetings once a week with the chiefs of staff at the cabinet agencies .
" This is a White House that very much made sure that each one of [ the agencies ] out there is a mouthpiece for the president [ and that they ] do exactly as they 've been told to do , " says Washington Post reporter Dana Milbank .
" So as another layer of White House control Karl has these meetings to find out what 's being planned at the Cabinet agency , and more importantly , to tell them what they should be planning in the Cabinet agencies . "
Gearing up for ' 02 and ' 04 In seminars with White House officials , Rove lays out his goals for the 2002 and 2004 campaigns , including appealing to minority voters , union households , and technology - sector workers .
But Bush , who has by now withdrawn from the Kyoto Treaty negotiations and decided to limit stem - cell research , is already becoming a polarizing president .
In reaction to Bush 's policies , Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont leaves the Republican Party , eliminating the Republican majority in the Senate .
The increasing opposition to Bush influences Rove 's new strategy .
" They made this decision that there was going to only be a 7 percent swing vote , " says Washington Post reporter Thomas Edsall .
" Given that , it was much more important to shift the focus from past focuses on persuasion … and switch it to motivation … of your own people , but ones who are not getting out there to vote , either because they 're not registered or because they 're just too lazy . "
Sept. 11 , 2001 ; Rove steps back President Bush at Ground Zero , a few days after 9/11 Domestic policy and politics take a backseat after the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" I think what you felt in the early moments at least , after 9/11 , was the absence of Rove , " says Washington Post reporter Dana Milbank .
" He has plenty of things to say about welfare , economic policy and taxes .
He 's not a military guy .
…
He receded quite a bit as a public figure . "
But Rove continues quietly planning for Bush 's re-election .
In November , the 72 - Hour Task Force tracks five different elections around the country .
The chief finding : grassroots get - out - the - vote efforts really can work .
The return of Rove With the war in Afghanistan won , Rove starts to re-assert his influence .
Karen Hughes , Bush 's campaign communications director who sometimes competed with Rove for power , resigns as a White House counselor and is replaced by Dan Bartlett , a Rove protégé since the age of 22 .
Some observers notice a more confrontational tone emanating from the White House and more aggressive appeals to its conservative base .
In June , a PowerPoint presentation written by Rove -- and describing the war on terror as a crucial campaign issue -- is mysteriously found in Lafayette Park , across from the White House .
The 72 - Hour Task Force and a historic victory
In the 2002 midterm elections , the GOP focuses on turnout , volunteer activity , and early voting , implementing lessons it learned from the 72 - Hour Task Force 's experiments the previous year .
Rove , who handpicked many of the candidates and the issues they have run on , also hammers Democrats for their opposition to the Republican homeland security bill .
Conventional wisdom is that the president 's party typically loses seats in the midterm elections , but Republicans pick up seats in both houses , winning back control of Congress , and enhancing its numbers in statewide races in North Carolina , Florida , and Georgia .
The president 's approval ratings are also still high in the wake of 9/11 .
Laying the groundwork for Bush 's re-election Rove 's original plan for Bush 's race now looks outdated .
In May , Rove meets with the president and lays out a new strategy : Raise $ 170 million or more .
Maximize the turnout from the base .
Energize suburban voters .
In July he tells Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie that the key will be registering previously unaffiliated voters as Republicans .
By the end of the year , Rove has resolved to bury Howard Dean ( he is less concerned about John Kerry ) and is pushing Bush to raise ever more money .
Dean 's loss in the Iowa caucuses -- and his resulting infamous " scream " speech -- is only a month and a half away .
Reconciling with old foes -- and making new ones Democratic presidential nominee , John Kerry Rove finds himself in an awkward position .
After pounding McCain in the 2000 primaries , he must find a way to bring the senator , who is also being pursued by John Kerry , into Bush 's camp .
To do so will require
Rove to make peace with an enemy from his days in Texas politics : John Weaver , McCain 's chief adviser .
Rove succeeds , McCain publicly embraces the president the next month .
Meanwhile , Rove and the Bush campaign turn their efforts to discrediting Kerry , emphasizing the candidate 's seeming " flip - flops " in his position over the war in Iraq .
[ For more on this , see FRONTLINE 's interview with Bush strategist Mark McKinnon . ]
The last big push Rove pushed for the Republican convention to be in New York so as to capitalize on the memory of 9/11 , and he gets his wish .
He is also pleased with Bush 's performance in the presidential debates .
He begins to make more time for personal appearances and talking with the press .
But as the election gets closer , he feels the stress of the campaign and obsesses over " metrics , " or precise , constant measurements of voter registration numbers and many other indicators of voter turnout for those groups the Republicans have targeted .
A week before the election , some Republicans are concerned , but Rove predicts victory .
" They had it , in their own mind , down to a science , " says Washington Post report Dan Balz .
" Call this many people , you 'll get this percent vote . …
They seemed to believe they had more options on the table than Kerry did . "
Election day
The Bush family on election night , 2004 Rove is initially upset by the early exit - poll numbers , which he receives via phone on Air Force One .
They indicate a Kerry landslide .
But he quickly realizes that they are not an accurate picture of the actual results .
His get - out - the - vote strategy is in full swing , and he has recruited hundreds of thousands of volunteers , particularly in fast - growing rural and suburban areas , a throwback to his early success in Texas .
Crunching numbers late into the night , Rove deduces Bush will win both Ohio and Florida .
Around 10:30 p.m. , he tells Bush to hold back on declaring victory -- but he nonetheless makes his own triumphant announcement to the senior staff .
" The Architect " Rove in his White House office , Dec. 6 , 2004
In his acceptance speech , Bush thanks Rove , calling him simply " the architect . "
" Everyone in the room knew what that meant , " says Washington Post reporter Mike Allen .
" He was the architect of the public policies that got them there , he was the architect of the campaign platform , he was the architect of the fundraising strategy , he was the architect of the state - by - state strategy , he was the architect of the travel itinerary .
His hand was in all of it . "
A few days later , Rove tells reporters this has been his last presidential campaign .
A week later , he backtracks , noting that people in the White House have told him it was " a really stupid thing to say . "
" They are n't kidding around " Rove is promoted .
President Bush announces that he will now be assistant to the president , deputy chief of staff and a senior adviser , the title reflecting influence over both politics and policy .
Rove also gets a new office , just steps away from the Oval Office .
With Bush re-elected , Rove is thinking long - term .
He intends to use both politics and policy to create a permanent Republican majority .
He designs a legislative agenda that he hopes will lead to future Republican gains .
High on the list : an overhaul and partial privatization of Social Security , and the appointment of " strict constructionist " judges who will reverse what many Republicans see as judicial activism .
" I think what they are trying to do is bigger than the Great Society , and approaches the New Deal , " says Washington Post reporter Thomas Edsall .
" They are n't kidding around . "

Todd Palin , husband of Sarah , was a member of the secessionist Alaska Independence Party from 1995 through 2002 .
That ’s the information we just got from the Alaska Division of elections .
Probably not coincidentally , 2002 was the first time Sarah Palin ran for statewide office in Alaska .
Airline passengers on both sides of the Atlantic could be free to carry larger bottles of liquids in carry - on luggage under a two - year plan to relax current security rules that sharply restrict the amount of shampoo , hand lotion , and other types of liquids that can be brought in a plane cabin .
Under an oft - criticized plan implemented a few years ago , liquids must be stored in containers no bigger than three ounces .
Those containers , in turn , must be stowed in a clear , zip - locked bag no bigger than one quart , and each passenger is limited to bringing a single bag in carry - on luggage .
Critics have referred to the highly inconvenient restrictions as " security theater , " saying they do little to actually prevent terrorists from smuggling explosives onto planes .
The US Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) wants you to know it feels your pain and is taking steps to end it .
Under a plan outlined here , an official said size restrictions will be removed by the end of 2009 , although liquids will still have to placed in a separate bin when passing through security checkpoints .
By the end of 2010 , there will be no restrictions .
" We are deploying the best technology and training as fast as we can get it , " the official wrote .
" The goal is to remove all the restrictions on liquids when we have automated systems that can accurately separate threat from non-threat liquids . "
The TSA is working with its counterparts in Europe , Canada , and Australia to design " common design standards " to ensure the new policy is in harmony with those in other countries .
Enabling the change , the TSA official wrote , is new screening technologies that can tell the difference between hair gel and liquid explosives .
The TSA is in the process of installing advanced technology X - ray machines throughout the country .
The new machines should be in place by the end of 2009 , but it will take an additional year for them to be outfitted with software that can identify threatening liquids .
Computed tomography scanners , explosives trace detection equipment , and spectrometers are also being deployed in increasing numbers to ferret out threatening liquids . ®
CoRoT finds other stars with Sun - like vibrations
24 October 2008
The CoRoT ( Convection , Rotation & planetary Transits ) spacecraft is equipped with a 27 - cm diameter telescope and sophisticated instruments capable of highly accurate photometric observations of stars .
Variations in the light from these stars can be measured at the level of 10 .
An international team of astronomers led by Eric Michel from the Observatoire de Paris has used the photometric accuracy of CoRoT to obtain detailed light curves of the three stars HD49933 , HD181420 and HD181906 in a search for solar - like oscillations .
Solar - like oscillations
In the upper layer of the Sun 's interior – directly beneath the visible surface or photosphere – energy generated in the Sun 's core is transported by convection .
Here large cells of hot gas rise to the surface where they release their energy and the cooler gas subsequently sinks back down again .
This continuous cycle of rising and falling gas generates the characteristic granulation pattern at the Sun 's surface .
The same convection process also triggers sound waves that travel through the Sun 's interior and cause the entire Sun to vibrate at different frequencies or modes .
These vibrations result in periodic variations in the Sun 's surface temperature and luminosity .
Because the frequencies of these waves and their relative amplitudes depend on the interior make up of the Sun , observing them gives valuable information on stellar structure and energy transport within the star .
Other stars with masses and luminosities differing from our Sun , but with a similar convective upper layer , are expected to also display these characteristic luminosity variations driven by the convection .
These solar - like oscillations have now indeed been found with CoRoT in stars of a type that significantly differs from our Sun 's which is a G2V star ( see table below ) .
CoRoT results
In an article in today 's issue of the Science magazine , Eric Michel and colleagues present results based on light curves that were obtained over a period of 60 days for HD49933 and 156 days for both HD181420 and HD181906 .
They found and identified the contribution of solar - like oscillations to the variations in the light curve .
These variations are caused by the superposition of all solar - like oscillations that are present in the star .
To reveal the contributions in light variations at the different oscillation frequencies a Fourier power density spectrum is obtained from each lightcurve ( Figure 1 ) .
Detailed analysis of the individual frequencies and frequency profiles is ongoing , and in today 's article Michel and colleagues present already global characteristics of the oscillations .
The measure for the maximum amplitude of the solar - like oscillations is found to be higher than in our Sun by a factor of about 1.5 for all three stars .
This is 25 % smaller then was anticipated from theory for these types of main sequence stars .
This finding underpins the value of space - based asteroseismological observations for verifying and refining current models of stellar structure and evolution .
Space - based observations are not hindered by Earth 's atmosphere and can observe a star for long uninterrupted periods of time .
Both these factors allow the required level of accuracy for detecting the minute variations in the star 's light to be obtained more easily from space than from ground .

Sometimes serendipity makes history .
In this case , it may have uncovered history .
This year , Israeli writer Yaron Svoray came to Germany to research the underground operation that whisked Nazi officials to South America to escape justice after World War II .
Svoray was chatting with a local about his project when the man mentioned that a nearby plot of land had served as a dump during the Third Reich .
The man said items looted during the pogrom known as Kristallnacht , or “ Night of Broken Glass , ” were disposed of there .
Thousands of Jewish homes , shops and synagogues were ransacked and burned that night 70 years ago today in an orgy of hatred considered by many to be the start of the Holocaust .
Svoray ’s investigative instincts were immediately aroused .
On return trips , he examined old maps to confirm the dump ’s location here in Klandorf , about 40 miles north of Berlin .
In May , he went to the site , now thick with tall grasses , picked a spot at random and dug .

“ We just pointed to one heap and said , ‘ Let ’s start , ’ ” Svoray recalled .
“ Within an hour I had a [ metal ] swastika in my hand and Jewish porcelain and a bottle with a Star of David , which could have been a Jewish wine bottle . ”
Historians in Israel judged the finds to be authentic prewar pieces , enhancing the possibility that Svoray may have stumbled on a trove of Nazi-era artifacts , including rare physical evidence of Kristallnacht .
Svoray , the son of Holocaust survivors , has organized a traditional Jewish service at the dump site to mark and mourn the brutality of the Nov. 9 , 1938 , pogrom .
But beyond remembrance , his goal is to prod the German government into action .
Since he went public with his discoveries last month , Svoray said , nothing has been done to protect the site from looters , and authorities have shown no interest in investigating further .

“ There is enough stuff here to warrant an initial search , ” Svoray said by telephone from Israel recently .
“ And the initial search can not be done by neo - Nazis after drinking beer on a Friday night and then putting it up for sale on EBay . ”
The dump site sprawls across several acres , an uneven terrain of wooded copses and bushy ravines .
Wooden watchtowers jut out from the overgrowth , lookouts for hunters who come in search of wild boar and deer .
For Svoray , an author whose book on neo -Nazism was turned into a TV movie in the U.S. in the 1990s , knowledge of the dump site came as a surprise .
Not so for some residents of Klandorf , a quiet village of about 200 people where unfamiliar cars can attract curious stares from behind curtained windows .

Arno Gielsdorf , a burly , friendly mechanic whose family has lived here for 150 years , owns some of the land that the dump site occupies .
He has always known of its existence .
“ My father told me that [ at the time ] the population from the town would scavenge what was useful , ” said Gielsdorf , 49 , adding that his grandparents went out there “ almost every day , ” picking up silver utensils , tankards and other reusable scraps .
That is , until the day authorities abruptly barred people from the dump .
It was November 1938 .

“ For several days we did n’t know what was happening , ” Gielsdorf said his father , who died in 2001 , told him .
“ At this time of the Reichspogrom [ Kristallnacht ] , it was forbidden to go there and take out what you wanted . ”
The refuse pit in use then was 25 feet deep .
But when residents were finally allowed back in , “ it was covered with regular garbage , so that nobody could get to the items beneath , ” Gielsdorf said .
If physical evidence of what happened the night of Nov. 9 was indeed brought here , from Berlin or beyond , there may have been plenty of it .
Rampaging Germans smashed the windows of Jewish houses and businesses , giving Kristallnacht its name .
Temples were desecrated , their furnishings tossed into the streets or set ablaze .
Inspired by Adolf Hitler ’s fanatical fascism , rioters pulled Jews from their homes , destroyed their belongings and beat some of them senseless , in a campaign of violence that the Nazis said was spontaneous but was in fact cultivated and encouraged by the regime .

At least 91 Jews were killed , and 30,000 were arrested and sent to camps in Buchenwald , Sachsenhausen and Dachau .
“ It ’s really the turning point of the intensification of the violence against Jews in Nazi Germany , ” said Ann Millin , a historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington .
Positively identifying any finds as property plundered from Jews on Kristallnacht and not simply thrown out or confiscated at some other date would be difficult .
Svoray said , “ If someone says , will you find a piece of paper saying , ‘ Save me , ’ . . . from the 9th of November ?
I think not . ”

But “ if someone says I ca n’t start a dig until I know it ’s Kristallnacht , that ’s nonsense , ” he added .
“ You have enough evidence to make a serious undertaking . ”
Exposed and half - buried artifacts are certainly not hard to find .
On a recent visit by a foreign reporter , after a day of heavy rain , one small patch of the dump site was littered with jagged shards of porcelain , a delicate pink floral pattern still visible on one piece .
Bottles made of colored glass , which might once have held perfume or a tonic , were strewn about .
Within minutes of scraping at a small mound of dirt , Ako Hintzen , a bodyguard who travels with Svoray in Germany , unearthed an old bottle with the raised inscription “ Apotheke Zander , ” a pharmacy .
Another large bottle bore the name “ Josef ” and a worn - away surname , plus the word “ Berlin ” and the charming figure of a cat .

The items Svoray found last spring , including the bottle with the Star of David , were taken to the Ghetto Fighters ’
House museum in Israel , which documents Jewish resistance to the Nazis .
Museum officials examined the pieces and pronounced them genuine prewar objects , although lab results of some kind would be more conclusive , said Simcha Stein , the museum ’s director .
“ I was so excited , ” Stein said .
“ It was like a scream [ from the past ] in front of my eyes . ”
He acknowledged the problems in trying to determine the artifacts ’ provenance .
“ To tell you that this part of the bottle was taken from this Jewish table , from this street , from this family -- I ca n’t tell you that .
But that ’s not important , ” Stein said .
“ What is important is that it can be another way to bring the Holocaust story ” to life and to the attention of a new generation of young people .

That is something Svoray too would like to see .
But it will take the resources of the German government to make it happen : to secure the site , which he identifies as the first priority , and then to mount an excavation .
“ I ’m convinced that this is a worthwhile historical , academic endeavor .
There is no downside to it , ” Svoray said .
“ I will not rest until this becomes a proper historical investigation . ”

As the weather cools and Halloween approaches , creaks in the stairs and scary stories become more believable -- but not to physics professor Costas Efthimiou .
The laws of physics and math debunk popular myths about ghosts and vampires , according to a paper published by Efthimiou and Sohang Gandhi last year .
Using Isaac Newton 's Laws of Motion , Efthimiou demonstrates that ghosts would not be able to walk and pass through walls .
Basic math disproves the legend of humans turning into vampires after they are bitten , Efthimiou explains , because the entire human population in 1600 would have been wiped out in less than three years .
Doomed by mathematics
" These popular myths make for a lot of Halloween fun and great movies with special effects , but they just do n't hold up to the strict tests of science , " Efthimiou said .
In movies such as " Ghost , " starring Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore , ghosts often walk like humans , pass through walls and pick up objects .
But that portrayal cannot be accurate , Efthimiou says .
For ghosts to have the ability to walk like humans , they would need to put a force upon the floor , which would exert an equal and opposite force in return .
But ghosts ' ability to pass through walls and have humans walk right through them demonstrates that they cannot apply any force .
Movies such as " Blade , " featuring Wesley Snipes , suggest that vampires feed on human blood and that once a human has been bitten , he or she turns into a vampire and begins feeding on other humans .
To disprove the existence of vampires , Efthimiou relied on a basic math principle known as geometric progression .
Efthimiou supposed that the first vampire arrived Jan. 1 , 1600 , when the human population was 536,870,911 .
Assuming that the vampire fed once a month and the victim turned into a vampire , there would be two vampires and 536,870,910 humans on Feb .
1 . There would be four vampires on March 1 and eight on April 1 .
If this trend continued , all of the original humans would become vampires within two and a half years and the vampires ' food source would disappear .
Efthimiou did not take into consideration mortality rates , which would have increased the speed at which the human population would have been vanquished .
And even factoring in a birth rate would not change the outcome .
" In the long run , humans cannot survive under these conditions , even if our population were doubling each month , " Efthimiou said .
" And doubling is clearly way beyond the human capacity of reproduction . "
Efthimiou also provides a practical explanation for " voodoo zombiefication , " which suggests that zombies " come about by a voodoo hex being placed by a sorcerer on one of his enemies . "
He reviewed the case of a Haitian adolescent who was pronounced dead by a local doctor after a week of dramatic convulsions .
After the boy was buried , he returned in an incoherent state , and Haitians pronounced that a sorcerer had raised him from the dead in the state of a zombie .
Science , however , has a less - supernatural explanation .
A highly - toxic substance called tetrodotoxin is found in a breed of puffer fish native to Haitian waters .
Contact with this substance generally results in a rapid death .
However , in some cases , the right dose of the toxin will result in a state that mimics death and slows vital signs to a level that is unable to be measured .
Eventually , the victim snaps out of the death - like coma and returns to his or her regular condition .
Scientific analysis has shown that oxygen deprivation is consistent with the boy 's brain damage and his incoherent state .
" It would seem that zombiefication is nothing more than a skillful act of poisoning , " Efthimiou said .

A study published last year in The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found that dermatologists in 11 American cities and one county offered faster appointments to a person calling about Botox than for someone calling about a changing mole , a possible sign of skin cancer .
And dermatologists nationwide are increasingly hiring nurse practitioners and physicians ’ assistants , called physician extenders , who primarily see medical patients , according to a study published earlier this year in the same journal .
“ What are the physician extenders doing ?
Medical dermatology , ” Dr. Allan C. Halpern , chief of dermatology at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan , said in a melanoma lecture at a dermatology conference this year .
“ What are the dermatologists doing ?
Cosmetic dermatology . ”
There are no published studies showing that the rise of beauty procedures has caused harm to medical dermatology patients .
If patients with skin problems have difficulty getting appointments , it is because over the last 30 years the demand to see skin doctors has far outstripped the number of physicians trained in the specialty , said Dr. Jack S. Resneck Jr. , an assistant professor of dermatology at the medical school of the University of California , San Francisco .
Dr. Resneck , who researches professional issues in dermatology , said about 10,500 dermatologists now practiced in the United States , the majority devoting little time to vanity medicine .
Even so , dermatologists perform several million beauty treatments annually , according to estimates by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery , including more than two million anti-wrinkle injection treatments last year — an increase of 130 percent over 2005 .
Several patients interviewed for this article said that they believed the dermatologists they visited for medical care treated them as potential cosmetic consumers .
Dianne Ryan , who works for an airline in Dallas , went to a dermatologist in her insurance network three years ago after her husband pointed out a mole growing on the side of her foot , she said .
The doctor dismissed the mole as benign , she said , but recommended she buy his brand of bleaching cream for pigmentation on her face .
A junior doctor has been suspended by academic authorities for a month for branding a senior medical establishment figure a " fucking shit " on a web forum .
The trainee surgeon at the centre of the controversy , known to supporters as " Dr Scot Junior " , works at Inverness ' Raigmore Hospital .
He laid the " shit " charge against Professor Dame Carol Black on the professionals - only social network Doctors.net.uk .
As chair of the powerful Academy of Medical Royal Colleges , Black has attracted anger from young doctors for her role at the head of the government 's Modernising Medical Careers ( MMC ) fiasco .
The MMC regime has been applied to post - graduate medical training with " the aim of bringing more structure into the career path for doctors and better training towards the very best care for patients " .
Last year , it meant thousands of newly - qualified junior doctors were unable to find work and hospitals were unable to recruit the staff they needed .
Black also acts as the government 's first " Director for Health and Work " , running a quango created in 2006 to oversee the Health , Work and Wellbeing Strategy .
Widely viewed as an apparatchik of high - ranking NHS managers , she is unpopular among grassroots doctors .
When Professor Elisabeth Paice , dean director of postgraduate medical and dental education at the London Deanery , saw Dr Scot Junior 's comment , she reported him to authorities in Scotland .
Her opposite number at Highland Deanery , Professor Gillian Needham , immediately suspended the aspiring surgeon .
Contacted for comment , NHS Highland told El Reg : " We do not discuss issues relating to individual members of staff in public and therefore are unable to help you with your story . "
Needham did not return a call requesting comment .
Last month Paice told the medical magazine Pulse : " No one wishes to curtail doctors ' right to free speech .
But it is right that , as in any other walk of life , they do so without recourse to unrestrained personal abuse . "
A spokeswoman for the London Deanery said today : " From our point of view it was a very minor incident .
[ Professor Paice ] acted in accordance with the General Medical Council 's good practice guidance . "
The spokeswoman said Paice made no recommendation as to how the Highland Deanery should react to Dr Scot Jr's posting , and speculated that there may be more to the suspension than publicly known .
Dr Scot Jr 's supporters say there is n't .
They are worried that the suspension will appear on his permanent record and damage his future employment or promotion prospects .
Under the Department of Health 's guidelines on suspension , brought in in 2003 , doctors should only be barred from work in order :
to protect the interests of patients or other staff ; and / or to assist the investigative process when there is a clear risk that the practitioner 's presence would impede the gathering of evidence .
The guidlines also state that no doctor should be suspended for more than four weeks .
The status of Dr Scot Jr's suspension was clouded when people close to him said he had been reinstated by this NHS Trust , but then resuspended by the Highland Deanery in late August .
The ongoing incident has sparked an online campaign to highlight and safeguard doctors ' rights to free speech and making criticism .
The vocal anti-establishment wing of the medical blogosphere has adopted the case as a cause célèbre , repeating the original insult with glee and calling on the Highland Deanery to account for its position .
A complaint about the suspension has been made to the General Medical Council .
Dr Matt Jameson - Evans , co-chairman of RemedyUK , a 13,000 - strong doctors ' pressure group formed in response to the MMC debacle , told El Reg that dissent against medical authorities has been building .
" The medical establishment is unregulated and unchallenged .
It is a very small group of people making very important decisions about junior doctors ' lives .
" The sort of outburst that Dr Scot Junior made is not unprecedented .
The feeling is he 's been gagged and made an example of ... it appears the usual lines of discipline have not been followed . "
Doctors have prepared a letter to the Scottish Chief Medical Officer protesting against the suspension .
Some 60 doctors have agreed to sign so far . ®

Mountain rescue teams were scouring the Lake District last night searching for runners stranded by high winds and floods .
They were trying to account for hundreds of fell runners taking part in the Original Mountain Marathon , an annual race in which participants deliberately take on testing , hilly terrains .
It was feared that some may have been stuck in the torrential rain , battling the elements on their own through the night .
The marathon was cancelled yesterday lunchtime due to the adverse conditions but only after several hundreds had already set off .
Up to 2,000 may have been on the course .

Even though the race was abandoned , runners were thought to be still scattered across hillsides near Keswick .
Many had taken refuge in remote farmhouses , with some reportedly suffering from hypothermia after spending a day in soaking clothes .
Around 700 were holed up in Gatesgarth Farm in Borrowdale , while 100 more spent the night in Cockermouth School .
The whereabouts of others were unknown .
Mark Weir , owner of Honister Slate Mine , which is situated at the top of a steep mountain pass and became another emergency shelter , said : " We have had people coming in throughout the day in pretty bad states .
They were dripping wet and very cold .
I advised the organisers not to go ahead with the event .
Emergency services are overwhelmed .
The mountain rescue teams are out trying to find people on the side of the mountain in the dark .
It 's just been a bizarre day . "
Some of the runners argued that tackling harsh conditions like heavy rain was part of the challenge and the reason the marathon was held later in the year and not in the summer .
Adrian Hall , one of the competitors , said : " The OMM is not any old charity run .
It is a serious race for experience fell runners .
The organisers do a very good job sorting out the safety issues .
More importantly , all the competitors know the risks . "
Another runner , Lewis Peattie , said : " My mate and I were in the race but quickly realised everything was going pear - shaped and made the difficult decision to come back .
We had difficulty due to streams becoming fast torrents of water and waterfalls springing out of nowhere . "
Cumbrian police said the wind made it too dangerous for RAF helicopters to help the search teams .
They appealed to runners to call home when they could .
The Ambulance Service said 13 people had been taken to hospital with either minor injuries or hypothermia .
Poor mobile reception on the hillsides meant some relatives of runners struggled to contact them and left messages on the event 's website appealing for help .
Other messages called for runners to chip into a fund to go to the rescue services and apologise for going ahead with the event .
The 40 - year - old endurance test sees teams made up of two people run with tents , sleeping bags and basic supplies strapped to their backs so they can camp out overnight .
The event 's website insists teams are " totally self - supporting " , with " no GPS or outside support allowed " .
The organisers posted a statement on the website saying : " Race director Jen Longbottom made the decision [ to cancel ] just before midday after several hours of torrential rain had resulted in extreme conditions on the mountain and severe flooding . "
" Sex for £ 15 " and other such findings , including on the availability of unprotected sex , have made the headlines after the release of the Big Brothel report , the culmination of the Poppy Project 's research into off - street prostitution .
Due to the fact that such " findings " have been reported out of context – for example , only in 2 % of cases was unprotected sex on offer , as highlighted in Diane Taylor 's brilliant article Really lifting the lid ?
– all this report has served to do is to paint a very bleak picture of the off - street sex scene which any socially - conscious individual would quite rightfully abhor .
There are many problems with the report , not least the fact that the research was conducted by male researchers posing as prospective clients .
Given this , such findings as the average age of the women being 21 have to be taken with a large pinch of salt .
It is not unheard of for women in their 30s to be " advertised " as being 21 .
At the very least , knocking five years off a woman's age is accepted as an industry standard ; thus , adding five years to the woman 's advertised age will give a more accurate picture .
Furthermore , the report found that 75 different ethnicities were " on offer " .
I do n't doubt this is true , but parlours have been known to try to pass off
Thai women as Japanese , to give but one example .
I would suggest that , knowing the industry as I do , the actual number of women of different ethnicities on offer is somewhat smaller .
Somewhat predictably , the Big Brothel report also slams the likes of the ITV2 series Secret Diary of a Call Girl as depicting an unrealistic , glamorous off - street sex industry quite removed from the reality .
But can a group of male researchers posing as clients , conducting telephone research and not even visiting the brothels in question , really claim to have uncovered the truth about " what is going on " in the industry ?
I am an off - street sex worker .
I do n't live a Belle de Jour - type existence , but nor am I the trafficked / drug - addled / pimped victim the Big Brothel report would have you believe .
The reality of my working life lies somewhere between the two .
I feel obliged to state at this point that I have a good degree from a good university , as so many people assume we do this job because we are poor , uneducated souls .
I say " we " because I am not alone – I know many , many women who work the length and breadth of the UK in the same way as I do .
I cannot speak for all these women , of course , and I do not intend to try to do so , but suffice it to say that my situation is not an unusual one .
So , what is my situation ?
I am a single mother with two young children aged 4 and 6 .
Prior to doing this job – and it is a job – I was employed as a PA in a large , city - based firm .
My job was a typical 9 - to - 5 – which , as everyone who has ever worked in such a job will know , means 7:30 am to 6:30 pm by the time you take into consideration travelling and ( unpaid ) overtime .
I was dropping my children off at breakfast club at 8 am and collecting them at 6 pm , by which time we would all be completely knackered .
The children go to bed at 7:30 pm , meaning we were left with precisely 90 minutes to prepare and eat our evening meal , have baths , get ready for bed and read bedtime stories .
It was like we were living in a whirlwind .
I felt I never saw my kids – let 's face it , I did n't ( much ) – there was certainly never much time for playing or talking or simply just sitting cuddling on the sofa .
The guilt was getting to me .
I was unhappy .
I hoped they were n't , but I was never sure .
Yet , despite the long hours I spent away from home , I was earning just enough to make ends meet .
Sure I could pay the mortgage , but we 'd never had a family holiday .
By the time my monthly pay packet came around , I would have literally just a few pounds in the bank .
It was by no means a desperate existence – we always had enough food , and the house was always heated – but it was quite empty from my point of view .
My children are fantastic human beings and I wanted to spend more time in their company without us suffering financially , it was as simple as that .
I wanted a job which would allow me to work flexible hours to fit around the children 's schooling , fewer hours , but without taking the drop in wages which a part - time office job would have lead to .
Escorting seemed like the natural solution .
I say " natural " because it felt natural to me .
I am well aware that this is not a job everybody could do .
But as a sexually - aware and sexually - experienced woman in her mid-30s , the thought of having sex with strangers did not terrify me .
I remember thinking that I might even enjoy it ( and that has proved to be the case ) .
I work from a flat on which I pay the mortgage – I do not have any landlord to worry about .
I charge £ 150 per hour and I get enough enquiries to enable me to choose my own working hours .
In a typical day I drop my children off at school at 9 am , return home , shower and get changed into my alter - ego , Lara ( we never use our own names ) .
I then might have an hour 's appointment at 11 am and another at 1 pm , leaving me with a break of an hour in between to shower and refresh myself .
I then fetch myself a late lunch and am at the school again to collect my children at 3:30 pm .
It works .
I never see more than two clients a day ; most days I see only one ; on other days none at all .
Yet in just three hours ' work I can earn the same as I used to earn in a week working at the office .
Such is the taboo of sex work , that it is difficult to tell anybody what I do for a living .
These taboos are created and exacerbated by reports in the media of all prostitutes being drug addicts and " dirty " .
Promiscuity amongst women is still deemed to be something to be frowned upon .
In order to make excuses for our behaviour ( because excuses have to be made , of course – no " normal " woman would choose prostitution for a living ) reports such as Big Brothel promote the victim status of prostitutes , making such sweeping generalisations such as " if the women do not have pimps as such , their money will likely go to fund their coping strategies , such as drugs and alcohol " .
I find such a statement both patronising and offensive .
I do not have a pimp , and nor do I feel the need for " coping strategies " .
I am not au fait with drugs and drink only on social occasions .
Contrary to what Big Brothel would have you believe , my money pays the mortgage and bills ; it pays my income tax and national insurance ; it buys food and clothing for my family and , this summer , it paid for the first holiday my children have ever known .
My clients are on the whole middle - aged businessmen .
I have never been treated with anything less than respect by any one of them .
I have not been physically or sexually abused by any of them .
Of course I have my security systems in place should anything go wrong , but so far nothing has .
My children have their mother now , and not just on a part - time basis .
I have time with them to enjoy their childhoods , without any of us suffering financially .
I am not making big bucks – but I am earning a little more money to boot .
Big Brothel calls for the purchase of sex acts to be criminalised , in order to stem what it calls the " rise in demand for prostitution " which , it asserts , " fuels trafficking " .
The report does not seem to take into consideration that the type of people who benefit from trafficking , be it for prostitution or otherwise , are likely to pay scant regard to the law ; as , indeed , are the men who wish to purchase sex from trafficked women .
Criminalisation would only serve to drive the industry further underground , leaving the women who are victims of trafficking even more vulnerable .
Conversely , making criminals of all men who pay for sex would result in myself and thousands of other women who choose to work in this industry becoming unemployed , and thus instead of contributing to the state ( through our taxes ) we would be taking from the state in the form of income support , housing benefit and so on .
This is how we make a living ; it 's an industry that prevents many , many women and their children from living on the breadline .
If you are going to take our livelihoods from us , the consequences will be devastating .
Senator Barack Obama ’s announcement on Sunday of his record - shattering $ 150 million fund - raising total for September underscored just how much his campaign has upended standards for raising money in presidential campaigns .
His campaign has now raised more than $ 600 million , almost equaling what all the candidates from both major parties collected in private donations in 2004 .
It is a remarkable ascent to previously unimagined financial heights 
Mr. Obama ’s September total more than doubled the record $ 66 million he collected in August  that has been cheered by some and decried by others concerned about the influence of money in politics .
The impact on the way presidential campaigns are financed is likely to be profound , potentially providing an epitaph on the tombstone of the existing public finance system .
Campaign finance watchdog groups said Sunday that Mr. Obama ’s September haul bolstered their arguments for the need to revamp the presidential public financing system to restore its relevancy .
It is an effort that has recently faltered in Congress .

In the final presidential debate , Senator John McCain repeated long debunked lies about Sen. Barack Obama ’s record on the Illinois Born Alive Protection Act , lies that have been repeated and promoted since Alan Keyes lost to Obama in the US Senate race in 2004 .
This full frontal effort may appeal to the extreme far - right of his base , but it was a dial test loser on CNN .
The CBS insta-poll shows Obama winning the debate 53 percent to 22 percent .
The extreme fringe of anti-choice community has been pushing this attack for months , in television and radio ads from 527s and special interest lobbyists like the National Right to Life Committee .
The ads suggest that in voting against the Illinois Born Alive Infant Protection Act Senator Barack Obama is " responsible for killing a bill to provide care and protection for
babies who are born alive after abortions " and that " he later
misrepresented the bill ’s content . "
NRLC has filed a request for an advisory opinion from the FEC as to whether the ad falls within FEC guidelines , TPM reported .
The anti-choice movement says it needs to correct the record .
The Obama campaign maintains that the Senator opposed the state bill but would have supported the federal version because the federal bill , unlike the state bill , could n’t have affected or undermined existing abortion law .
In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network ’s David Brody ,
Obama said of National Right to Life Committee ( NRLC ) , " here ’s a situation where folks are lying . "
Then in August , NRLC produced documentation showing that the 2003 version of the Born Alive bill
included an amendment protecting Roe , rendering the state bill virtually
identical to the federal bill , which Obama says he would have supported .

But , points
out the non-partisan , independent FactCheck.org , since state , not federal law , governs the actual practice
of abortion care , even with the stipulation that the bill does not provide
protections to " any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to
being born alive as defined in this Section , " the bill could still have been
used to interfere with abortion provisions .
A 2003 Planned Parenthood fact sheet explained :
SB 1082 & SB 1083 are NOT the same as the so - called
" Born Alive Infant Protection Act " which was recently passed in the U. S .
House .
The federal legislation is considered to be a restatement of existing
federal law .
It does not amend or change current Illinois law .
Federal law does not regulate
abortion practice .
That is left to the states .
Therefore , it is state
legislation that would affect abortion practice in Illinois .

1083 creates new provisions in Illinois
law .
Although the definition is similar to the proposed federal legislation ,
its application would have a different impact on state abortion law .
Also unlike the federal bill , the package of bills under
consideration by the Illinois State Senate included a measure that would have
permitted legal action " on the child ’s behalf . "
In other words , doctors and
health care facilities could be held liable for damages , " including costs of
care to preserve and protect the life , health and safety of the child , punitive
damages , and costs and attorney ’s fees , " if the hospital , health care facility
or health care provider " harms or neglects the child or fails to provide
medical care to the child after the child ’s birth . "
Planned Parenthood ’s Pam Sutherland told
the New York Times , " I can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire
package of bills , which were introduced together and analyzed together …
They never wanted them separated , because
they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing
abortions for fear of going to jail " ( emphasis mine ) .
When a 2005 version of the bill with the explicit protection for state abortion law Obama had held out for was considered , it passed the state Senate unanimously .
Obama had left the State Senate for Washington by the
time
the bill came to a vote .
But Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor has
said
that Obama would have voted for that bill if he had been a state
legislator
when it was considered , much as he says he would have supported the
federal
bill , which would n’t have impacted non-existent federal law .
Existing Law Protected Infants
Pam Sutherland of Planned Parenthood of Illinois explains
that there is no way to verify how many , if any ,
abortions result in viable live births , as Illinois does not track these
statistics .
Still , regardless of the number of such births , these infants
deserve to be protected .
But existing law in Illinois
clearly required doctors to provide medical care in the unlikely event that a
viable fetus was born as a result of an abortion procedure .
" Nothing in BAIPA
addressed this situation in some way that was n’t already covered , " explains
Mary Dixon , legislative director at the ACLU of Illinois .
In any such instance ,
Illinois law
stipulates that the child receive medical care by pediatric specialist to
maximize chances of survival .
Obama acknowledged
this when registering his opposition to BAIPA .
To the state Senate on April 4 , 2002 , Obama explained , " This issue
ultimately is about abortion and not live births .
Because if there are children
being born alive , I , at least , have confidence that a doctor who is in that
room is going to make sure that they ’re looked after . "
In addition , BAIPA was riddled with provisions that alarmed
both defenders of abortion rights and the mainstream medical community in Illinois , including
the Illinois Hospital Association and the Illinois State Medical Society , both
of which opposed the package of bills .
Defenders of abortion rights said that the state law could come into
conflict with existing law regulating abortion , and could potentially be used
to undermine or challenge Roe v. Wade .
Hospitals
and physicians ’ associations , meanwhile , decried the bill ’s interference with
the physician - patient relationship and the harsh civil and criminal penalties
that could be imposed on physicians and hospitals who perform abortions that
result in a " live - born " fetus .
Equally troubling is the fact that the law Obama opposed
would have required doctors to make efforts at life - saving for any infant that
shows a " sign of life " even when there was no chance the baby would survive , a
practice that Dr. Lauren Streicher , an obstetrician at Northwestern Medical
Hospital who often
delivers pre-term babies who will not survive , refers to as " torture . "
" When
you deliver a baby " – either through labor or termination – " that is clearly
not going to be viable , we knew 100 percent it would not survive , there are two
courses you could take , " explains Streicher .
" You could wrap the baby up in a
blanket , give him or her comfort care , let the parents hold the baby , say
goodbye , and go through the grieving process .
Or , if we were required to make
survival efforts , the baby is whisked away by the high - risk pediatrician and
tubes start going in .
It ’s torture for
the baby , terrible for the parents , who have most often lost a desperately
desired pregnancy . "
Says Dr. Streicher , " A fetus that can clearly be ‘ not
viable ’ could potentially be born with a stable heart - beat .
Is that a sign of life ?
Yes .
Is that fetus
then viable ?
No . "

Ads
Obama ’s votes on the Born Alive Infant Protection
Act have been subject to attack ads dating as far back as his race for the U.S. Senate against Alan Keyes in 2004 .
Current television ads targeting voters in Ohio and New Mexico feature
thirty - one - year - old Gianna Jessen imploring Barack Obama , " Sen. Obama , please
support born alive infant protections . "
Jessen ’s story ?
She
was born through a " failed abortion , " and she and BornAliveTruth.org , the 527 " independent " political committee
responsible for the ads , maintain that by voting against BAIPA , Obama neglected to
support the highest possible standard of care for infants in Illinois .
Beliefnet.com editor - in-chief Steven Waldman observes , " the one thing [ the ad ] does not prove is its central political claim … the key legal goal [ of the Born Alive Infant Protection Act ] was not protecting viable infants –
who already were protected under law – but non-viable infants and those
on the borderline .
Gianna Jessen , by her own account , was a clear ‘ viable ’ infant .
She was
aborted at seven and half months , and therefore would have almost
certainly been covered by any existing statute . "
BornAliveTruth was founded by Jill Stanek , the anti-choice
blogger and a nurse who testified in front of Congress that she witnessed
infants not provided appropriate medical care after abortion ( Stanek ’s testimony
does not specify whether the infants were viable ) .
The ads are bank - rolled by abstinence - only profiteer Raymond Ruddy , who
has supported far - right anti-choice and anti-gay initiatives across the
country , and whose company , Maximus , has received over $ 100 million in federal
contracts from the Bush administration to promote abstinence - only - until - marriage programs .
Obama , for his part , has responded
directly to BornAliveTruth ’s ads .
The ad , which began
airing September 21 , tells viewers , " Now votes taken out of context , accusing
Obama of letting infants die ?
It ’s a despicable lie . "
FactCheck.org
has weighed in with a clear - eyed assessment of the volley , writing that :
In
the ad , Jessen says that " if Senator Obama had his way , I would n’t be
here . "
She ’s wrong .
Anyone born in Illinois
under the same circumstances as Jessen ( who was actually born in California ) would have
been protected under the state ’s law as it stood , with or without the
legislation that Obama opposed .
But
FactCheck.org also points out that Obama ’s response included misstatements .
Obama ’s ad implies that the McCain campaign
itself had sponsored the ad , when BornAliveTruth.org did ; it also accuses McCain of
opposing abortion including in cases of rape and incest , which running mate Sarah
Palin does but McCain does n’t .
Will Palin Bring Up BAIPA ?
GOP Vice - Presidential nominee Sarah Palin suggested that Obama has n’t heard the end of BAIPA from her , either .
In an interview with Katie Couric , Palin suggested that passage of BAIPA was necessary to ensure the provision of life - saving medical care to viable babies and , moreover , that Obama would allow medical help not to be administered in such situations .
" And those who , like Barack Obama , would support measures that would
actually allow in a botched abortion , late - term abortion , that child
being born alive , to allow it to not receive medical help to save that
child ’s life , " said Palin , " That ’s extremism to me . "
If Palin throws another punch at Obama on BAIPA to stoke her religious right base , and if the FEC okays the National Right to Life Committee ’s radio ads , we ’ll undoubtedly see a new round of distortion over what BAIPA would actually do , and what Obama supports and believes .
While some universities restrict the use of BitTorrent clients , others embrace the popular flilesharing protocol and use it to spread knowledge .
Stanford University is one of the few to realize that BitTorrent does not equal piracy .
They use BitTorrent to give away some of their engineering courses , with some success .
Always wanted to learn more about Robotics , Linear Dynamical Systems or Programming Paradigms ?
Now you can , for free , thanks to Stanford Engineering ’s online courses .
The University not only gives away videos of lectures , but also syllabi , handouts , homework and exams .
In addition to offering torrents , the courses are also available on YouTube , via iTunes and Vyew .
With the project Stanford aims to spread knowledge on technology worldwide .
Thus far , the online courses have been a great success .
Over 200,000 people from all over the world have visited the site already .
Most foreign visitors come from Canada , according to a recent news release , followed by Brazil , China , Italy and the UK .
For now , only the 10 most popular computer science and electrical engineering courses are published online , but additional courses will be added later .
All course materials are published under a Creative Commons license , which allows others to adapt , remix and share them as long as it is for noncommercial use , and if they link back to the university .
As P2P - blog points out , there is one downside to the torrents Stanford is offering .
They do not use regular trackers , but only Vuze ’s DHT tracker .
This means that people who use BitTorrent clients that do not support DHT , such as Transmission , BitLord and BitTornado , are not able to download the files .
Of course , uTorrent and Azureus users will have no problems .
While Stanford recognizes the benefits of BitTorrent , it is also cracking down on students who use it to download copyrighted material .
Students who get caught for the first time have to pay a $ 100 fine , the second offense costs $ 500 , and those who get caught three times will have to pay $ 1000 to regain access to the university network .

WASHINGTON  As Congress prepares to debate expansion of drilling in taxpayer - owned coastal waters , the Interior Department agency that collects oil and gas royalties has been caught up in a wide - ranging ethics scandal  including allegations of financial self - dealing , accepting gifts from energy companies , cocaine use and sexual misconduct .
In three reports delivered to Congress on Wednesday , the department ’s inspector general , Earl E. Devaney , found wrongdoing by a dozen current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service , which collects about $ 10 billion in royalties annually and is one of the government ’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes .
“ A culture of ethical failure ” pervades the agency , Mr. Devaney wrote in a cover memo .
The reports portray a dysfunctional organization that has been riddled with conflicts of interest , unprofessional behavior and a free - for - all atmosphere for much of the Bush administration ’s watch .
The highest - ranking official criticized in the reports is Lucy Q. Denett , the former associate director of minerals revenue management , who retired earlier this year as the inquiry was progressing .

Some Michigan Republican officials are questioning why McCain appears to have abandoned the state .
Michigan GOP opposes McCain pullout
In the aftermath of John McCain 's decision to pull out of Michigan , Republicans in the state are expressing shock and bewilderment at his move — and are n't willing to cede the state 's 17 electoral votes just yet .
“ We ’re blindsided , along with everybody else in Michigan , ” said Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson .
“ I feel like I woke up this morning , and there was a note on my pillow . ”
Advertisement
“ When the general leaves the battlefield when the fight ’s still going on , it creates a lot of chaos , ” he said .
Saul Anuzis , the chairman of the state party , sent out a fundraising message Friday morning that called McCain ’s decision “ a tough blow . ”
“ The McCain campaign announced they were shifting resources and staff out of Michigan to other targeted states .
Other states ‘ today ’ offer a better opportunity for the campaign , ” Anuzis wrote on his blog , paraphrasing the McCain campaign ’s explanation .
“ We do not agree . ”
Michigan had been seen as one of McCain ’s top targets among the states Sen. John F. Kerry won in 2004 , along with Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and New Hampshire .
The Republican now appears resigned to the state 's electoral votes — which Kerry claimed by a little more than 3 percentage points and the Real Clear Politics polling average now shows Barack Obama leading by 7 points — going to the Democrat .
Mike Duhaime , the McCain campaign ’s political director , explained the decision as a necessary tactical choice .
" It 's been the worst state of all the states that are in play , " he said in a conference call Thursday .
" It 's the obvious state , in my perspective , to come off the list . "
Some Democrats were hesitant to declare victory and viewed McCain ’s move with suspicion , suggesting sinister motives behind the Arizona senator ’s very public departure from the state .
“ Who announces with such fanfare that they ’re leaving , other than to let you think that they ’re gone ? ” asked Democratic Lt. Gov. John D. Cherry , who predicted that McCain ’s announcement could be a prelude to a flurry of anti-Obama advertising by independent groups .
“ I think the announcement you ’re reading is an invitation for independent groups to come in and do that sort of thing , ” Cherry suggested , adding that , for McCain to win the state Republicans , he would have to engage in “ some very outrageous stuff . ”
In September , a group called Freedom ’s Defense Fund launched a small buy of independent anti-Obama ads in Macomb County , Mich. , where working - class “ Reagan Democrats ” are a powerful voting bloc , that attempted to tie Obama to his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , and indicted Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick .
Thus far , though , Michigan has yet to see any statewide or well - funded independent effort aimed at tilting the race against either candidate .
State Rep. Tonya Schuitmaker , the assistant Republican floor leader in the Michigan House of Representatives , said Cherry ’s theory was not implausible .
“ I do n’t have any knowledge as to whether that will happen or not , but I think that ’s definitely a possibility , ” Schuitmaker said , though she explained that she thought McCain ’s pullout was ‘’ the wrong decision to make . ”
“ Obviously he has to make it based on the financial information and the polling numbers , but I think it might ’ve been a little premature , ” she said .
“ He still has a fighting chance here . ”
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , McCain ’s running mate , seemed to agree with that assessment Friday , expressing dismay at her own campaign ’s decision in an interview with Fox News Channel .
“ I want to get back to Michigan , and I want to try , ” she told reporter Carl Cameron .
“ Todd and I , we ’d be happy to get back to Michigan .
We ’d be so happy to speak to the people there in Michigan who are hurting . ”
McCain supporter Chuck Yob , a former Republican National Committeeman for Michigan , underscored Palin 's sentiments in a public e-mail Friday .
" There will still be a campaign for John McCain in Michigan whether it is sanctioned by the professionals in Washington , D.C. , or not , " Yob wrote .
As much as some Republicans might want McCain - Palin back in Michigan , McCain ’s poll numbers have dropped precipitously in recent state polling .
And while his campaign ’s decision to leave the state was abrupt , it was not completely unforeseeable .
Since the crisis on Wall Street began two weeks ago , Obama has steadily widened his advantage over McCain .
In a poll taken Sept. 14-17 by the Michigan firm EPIC - MRA , McCain trailed Obama by just 1 point .
In a new poll taken from Sept. 20 - 22 , that gap had widened to 10 points .
And in an even more recent survey conducted by the Iowa firm Selzer & Co. , Obama led McCain 51 percent to 38 percent .
“ Among whites , I still think he is lagging among older white men without a college education , but everyone else , including independent women , [ is ] moving toward Obama , ” EPIC - MRA President Bernie Porn .
Porn suggested that shift could largely be explained by the reemergence of economic issues as the central focus of the general election campaign — and McCain ’s shaky response to developing events on Wall Street .
“ As much as it was about any positive messages Obama might have had , I think it also involved miscues on the part of the McCain campaign , inconsistencies , contradictions , ” he said .
“ Calling off his campaign and everything , I ’m not sure people responded to that the way the McCain campaign expected them to . ”
Democrat Bill Crouchman , chairman of the Macomb County Commission , agreed that economic issues were driving McCain ’s numbers down .
“ Southeast Michigan has really been in a recession now for about three years , ” he said .
“ What the country ’s feeling now , we ’ve been going through for quite a while , so the economy , around here , is the issue . ”
“ Of course , ” Crouchman jabbed , “ [ McCain ’s ] quote that he did n’t know much about economics did n’t help things for him . ”
Patterson acknowledged McCain could have had a stronger response to the economic meltdown .
“ Maybe he ’s not as quick on the draw as everyone would want him to be , but Obama ’s given him many opportunities to respond and knock it out of the park , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know how the hell [ the economic crisis ] got laid off on Republicans .
McCain just was n’t up to the task for some reason . ”
Though he sounded similarly frustrated in an entry on his blog , Anuzis did his best to buck up Republican spirits , claiming the party would do its best to stay in the game .
“ We will have a revised plan in effect by next week and are not conceding an inch to the Obama campaign or any Democrats in Michigan , ” he wrote .
“ This is a battleground state , the numbers always tighten up and we will bring the McCain campaign back to Michigan by our own efforts statewide . ”
( CNN ) -- Former NBA star Charles Barkley spoke Monday to CNN's Campbell Brown about politics , race and his plans to run for governor in his boyhood home state of Alabama .
Here is a transcript :
Charles Barkley tells Campbell Brown some whites will vote for Obama , but tell their friends they did n't .
Campbell Brown :
To start off , let 's talk about something that has been getting a lot of attention , which is the Bradley effect .
You know , the idea that the polls do n't tell us the truth about this election and that people will say I am willing to vote for a black man but they go into the booth and they wo n't .
They are telling pollsters one thing and doing something else .
Do you thinks that 's real ?
Do you think that is going to be an issue ?
Charles Barkley :
Of course that 's real .
I think if you ask ... first of all , racism is the greatest cancer of my lifetime .
I think anybody who is racist is an idiot whether they are black or white .
Anybody who is racist I just I think they are an idiot .
But if you ask any white person on television , they are not going to say I 'm not going to -- well , actually , some people have said they are not going to ever vote for a black guy , but quietly .
There are some people who say yes , [ who ] come on television and say they would vote for a black guy who are not going to vote -- they are going to vote for [ Republican presidential candidate Sen . ]
John McCain .
Brown :
So you do not believe the polls ?
Watch Barkley talk to Brown »
Barkley : I think the polls are absolutely useless .
I do .
Seriously .
Most people who are racist , they are not going to answer that question correctly either on the phone call or on camera , so I 100 percent believe the polls are flat out useless .
I think this race is going to be neck and neck down to the wire .
I also think there is a reverse thing .
I think there are some white people who say [ they ] are gonna vote for [ Democratic presidential candidate Sen . ]
Barack [ Obama ] because he is going to be better for their financial situation .
So I think the Bradley factor is a bigger factor , but I do think that there are some white people who say they are not going to vote for a black person around their friends , but when they get in the booth they are going to vote for him because it is going to be better for their economic situation .
Brown :
If he does go on , if Barack Obama does pull this off , tell me what it will mean for African - Americans ?
Barkley :
Well ,
It would be great for -- it would just be great that white America elected a black president .
Because the truth of the matter is , unless he gets a certain percentage of the white vote , he is not going to be elected , so that would be cool that white people had enough confidence in him .
But Campbell , unless we , we as black people stop killing each other , not getting our education , we have to do better .
Racism does exist .
It is always going to exist , but until we as a people stop killing each other and stop not getting our education we are never going to be successful .
I mean , because realistically , whoever the president is does n't have a huge effect on anybody 's life , to be honest with you .
Brown :
You really believe that ?
Barkley : I really believe that
Brown :
He is the most powerful man in the free world ?
Barkley :
But he does n't have an effect on people 's everyday lives .
He does not .
I mean , think -- it 's not -- I mean that sincerely .
Whoever the president is does not have an effect upon people 's everyday life .
Brown :
So you see him more as a role model ?
Barkley : I see him as a great role model ' cause we got to get more black kids educated .
And you know we have this terrible thing going on in the black community about if a black kid does well in school we make fun of him .
We 've got to get more black kids getting their education , carrying themselves with great dignity , and self esteem .
I 've always looked at this as bigger picture .
I mean , because if he wins , it ain't like -- really , I think he 's just a great role model for young black kids .
I do n't mean that in a negative as far as , like , who the president is is really not going to have a huge effect on people 's everyday life .
Brown :
What about the counter to that ?
If he does n't win this election , ultimately , how much of a disappointment is that for African - Americans in this country in your view ?
Barkley : I think it will be a great -- first of all , I never thought in my lifetime I would see a black president .
Brown :
You did n't ?
Barkley : I did not .
And I 'm surprised , happily surprised he got this far .
It would be very disappointing , but , listen , we 're in terrible economic situation .
And first of all whoever 's president , the next four years is gonna be a really difficult time and a really difficult situation .
You know they 're shipping all our jobs overseas , the public school system is in disarray , they 're spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq .
Whoever the president is , it 's gonna be really rough for the next four years .
Brown : Uh , do you think ... do you think that John McCain , do you think the Republican Party has used race as an issue in this race ?
Barkley :
Oh , no question , and they 've used cold words like welfare and things like that .
When people pick on welfare , first of all when they use the word welfare , that is really swaying , trying to use that as a minority thing , because people assume -- if they really knew anything about the numbers .
There seven times as many white people on welfare as black .
Because there 's more white people in America .
But when I see a story on welfare on television , they only show black people .
But most white people do n't know that sometimes there 's as many whites on welfare as black people .
And they just use cold words , they use the terrorist thing now .
You know , they try to use the Muslims thing .
Those are racial innuendos , of course , and I 've said it from the beginning , the only way with the economy in the situation it is -- we 've had eight terrible years under the Bush 's administration , with the war in Iraq -- I 've said it from the beginning .
The only way they can win this election is make it about race .
That 's the only way they can win .
I wrote a chapter in one of my books about what happens in a race , when things are going bad , everybody kind of goes with their own tribe and the only way the Republican party can make this thing work is they get their tribe to get together and of course they use racial innuendo .
Brown :
You live in Arizona and you 've said in the past that you have a lot of respect for --
Barkley : I do .
Brown :
Has his campaign changed your view at all , given the way it has gone , given what you have said ?
Barkley : I do n't blame him .
I blame the Republican Party .
First of all because --
Brown :
But he 's the head of the Republican Party .
Barkley : I know that , but this thing did n't start with him .
It started with President Bush and these gifts to rich people like myself -- all these tax cuts and things like that .
That 's my biggest problem .
Uh listen , John McCain , you gotta respect anybody who goes to war .
But these Republicans who ran this economy into the ground .
We 've got to end the war in Iraq and we got to stop giving rich people like myself and people who run big companies tax breaks .
We 've got to do that .
Brown :
You , there has been a lot of polarizing rhetoric on both sides , frankly throughout this campaign .
You yourself have called the evangelical base of the GOP fake Christians .
Barkley :
Well , because they are so judgmental .
And you know what is really interesting about that ?
I was actually defending John McCain when I said that , because they were saying when he first got nominated that he is not part of the evangelicals .
You got to respect Sen. McCain .
What I meant by that and I still stick by it -- my idea of religion is we are supposed to encourage people to love other people .
I am a big pro-choice guy .
I am a big gay marriage guy and they are so divisive and that is not my idea of religion .
My idea of religion is we are supposed to bring people together .
We are not supposed to judge other people .
Brown :
But are n't you judging them ?
Barkley :
They judge me .
First of all the notion that you would vote for a president because he is against abortion or against gay marriage is absurd .
I think politicians have three jobs .
No .
1 they should fix our public school system , they should make sure our neighborhoods are safe and they should give people economic opportunity .
I do n't care who is gay , I do n't care who is pro-choice .
I really think that is the only three jobs that our government and our elected officials should have and we obviously got to do something about the health care and this situation .
But to elect a president and vote for a president just because he is against abortion and against gay marriage is absurd .
Brown : [ Republican vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. ]
Sarah Palin has gotten an enormous amount of attention in this campaign .
What do you think about her ?
Barkley : I think they did a great disservice because they never let her speak .
They are trying to do it now , but they did her a great disservice .
Yes , I think he selected her to try to get the Hillary Clinton vote and I do n't know that much about her because they never let her talk and when they do let her talk they let her talk to a fan friendly audience .
So you can snip it how you want to .
So , I have n't seen enough and they have n't let her do enough for me to really form an opinion , but I do think they selected her just to get the Hillary Clinton vote .
Brown :
Talk to me a little bit about your own political aspirations .
You said in the past that you want to go back to Alabama .
That is home for you .
Barkley : Alabama needs a lot of help .
You know Campbell , the reason I have become really pro-active -- and to be honest with you I never really got involved with politics until John Kerry and John Edwards last time .
And the reason I 'm supporting the Democratic Party [ is ] no more than I like Barack .
I think he is a friend of mine .
I think he is a wonderful , wonderful person .
The reason I voted for John Kerry last time and have been more out there this time , I look at the -- it 's really about rich people versus poor people and I think it is a travesty what they have done to poor people in this country .
And lets be realistic , it does n't , George Bush -- I do n't care .
It 's not going to have any effect realistically on my life who the president is .
The reason I am supporting the Democratic Party , I think it is a bona fide tragedy what has happened to poor people in this country and the gap between the rich and the poor is wider than it has ever been .
You got this bailout situation , I just think it 's a travesty .
Brown :
So are you going to run for governor ?
Barkley : I plan on it in 2014 .
Brown :
You are serious .
Barkley : I am , I can't screw up Alabama .
Brown :
There is no place to go but up in your view ?
Barkley :
We are number 48 in everything and Arkansas and Mississippi are n't going anywhere .
Brown :
And the top priority for you would be education ?
Barkley :
All the way education , the public school system in this country is the worst it has ever been and what that does is that hurts crime , it hurts the judicial system .
You know if you do n't give people education and hope , they become criminals .
They get involved in drugs .
So we have got to fix the public school system .
I think we need to make these neighborhoods safer .
And the third thing , you have got to give people economic opportunity .
America for far too long has a small group of people who have got all the money and then we got a bunch of poor people who have no money .
And because we have killed the public school system they can't get the education to make money and that is just not right .
Brown : Charles Barkley , good to see you , appreciate it , good luck to you .
Barkley :
Thank you very much , thanks for having me .

Interview Questions
When preparing for an interview , it ’s important that you familiarise yourself with the kinds of questions that are most likely to be posed , and think about how you might approach your answers .
These articles offer detailed explanations and examples relating to the most used interview questions to help you prepare .
MoonSaddle 's latest crescent - shaped bicycle seat design promises to improve your riding comfort and up your sperm count .
If you 're a man and that did n't just make you sit straight up in your seat , you may need to get checked out .
The 2008 MoonSaddle has improved the design from last year 's model but the principle remains the same : to avoid putting pressure on the perineum by sitting back on your butt bones .
The 2008 model comes with a 140,000 high tensile strength stainless steel tubing set up a 20 - 30 - degree angle and also raises the rider up slightly .
This model also provides more space between the saddle and the rails , which supposedly allows for easier seat adjustment .
According to bike forums online , it appears that this seat shape is gaining momentum in the bike community , despite early difficulties .
For example , the back - end nature of the seat has forced some riders into slipping off the seat , and the angle required by different - sized riders is forcing riders to take them to bike shops for correct adjustment .
Also , some people have said the seat is just too " hard and uncomfortable , " despite fewer instances of numbness .
Several studies have declared that regular nose - shaped bike saddles contribute to erectile dysfunction .
In a study cited in the MoonSaddle website , Dr. Steven M. Schrader of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health says that traditional seats create " nerve entrapment and vascular occlusion , " and significantly reduces penile blood flow and sensation .
Other studies have found that women cyclists also experience ' decreased genital sensation , ' and are under the same long - term risk for decreased sexual performance as men .
However , it 's important to note that most instances of the perineal - based problems are a function of long , daily riding and racing .
So if you 're a 15 - minute rider with only a couple runs per week , that 's probably not enough to cause you significant problems .
The 2008 MoonSaddle is currently available for about $ 85 .

Is it just us , or do you also remember reading a headline a few weeks ago saying that Morgan Stanley was saved by a Mitsubishi investment ?
( Update : It was such a bad investment that Mitsubishi now needs a bailout ) .
And then , a few days later , reading another headline saying Morgan Stanley was saved again by another $ 10 billion from the taxpayers ?
So why on earth is Morgan Stanley stock trading as if the company is going out of business again ?
It was down to $ 13 yesterday !
As Mr. Incredible might ask , why ca n't Morgan Stanley just stay saved ?
Now that GM , Chrysler , the insurance industry , and Lord knows who else are lining up at Hank Paulson 's door with hats in hand , we really do n't have time to worry about Morgan Stanley anymore .
If Nouriel Roubini is right and Morgan Stanley is going to zero , we wish it would just go ahead and go there .
Hank Paulson wo n't let it declare bankruptcy , of course , given the global consensus about how he blew the Lehman decision .
So if taxpayers are now going to have to pump in tens of billions of additional capital , why do n't we just stop telling each other happy stories and do it now ?
That way we can finally write all of Morgan Stanley 's " assets " down to fair value and be done with it .

So , you ’ve got your scope creep , and you ’ve got your feature creep .
Lately , though , I ’ve been thinking a lot about a little gremlin I ’ve been calling “ future creep ” .
Future creep is not about adding features to your products .
At least , it is not directly about that .
Rather , it is about adding infrastructure to your products in preparation for features that may or may not be added later .
In the future .
This is really subtle , because it can happen even ( or perhaps especially ) when the feature list for a product has been frozen .
So , sure , you ca n’t add any more new features for this release , but there has been talk about some new feature X being added eventually , and if you just tweak the code a bit here and here , and maybe there , the way can be paved for X that much more easily !
That feature X can be anything : a programmer interface ( API ) , a drag - and - drop UI , element categorization , data export / import , batch processing , anything at all , anything that you do n’t intend to implement immediately , but which has been bandied about as a possible addition someday .
Paving the way does n’t sound bad at all , though , does it ?
In fact , it sounds proactive and laudable .
And if that feature X goes through in a timely fashion , exactly as you envisioned , I ’m sure you ’ll be praised for your foresight .
BUT .
Even the simplest of potential features can be implemented in a number of ways .
Or not implemented at all .
At best , your “ foresight ” can result in wasted time , where you spun your wheels for a few hours ( or days ! ) playing “ what if ” and “ let ’s pretend ” , trying with too little information to think of how best to architect your code to accommodate that future feature .
A FIVE - year - old girl who contracted a sexually transmitted infection was allowed to return to the family home after a judge ruled that he could not be certain her father had abused her .
But the Department of Community Services yesterday argued that Judge Jonathan Williams did not need to be certain whether the abuse occurred and that he had erred in law by allowing the girl , now 7 , to continue living with her parents .
In the District Court , both parents successfully appealed against the DOCS finding , although an undertaking was made that the girl would not live with her father again until the end of all proceedings , the court heard .
LONDON , Nov. 9 ( UPI ) --
Al - Qaida cells in London , Birmingham and Luton , England , are planning mass casualty attacks in Britain , a government intelligence report indicates .
The restricted document , authored by the Ministry of Defense , MI5 and the British Special Branch , maintains al - Qaida operatives based in Britain will attempt another " spectacular " event targeting major transport facilities , such as airports and train stations , the Sunday Telegraph said .

The report said there are " some thousands " of extremists active in Britain , who are mostly British - born young men of Pakistani and Middle Eastern descent between the ages of 18 and 30 .
Many of them , it said , are believed to have been trained in overseas terrorist camps .
" For the foreseeable future the U.K. will continue to be a high - priority target for international terrorists aligned with al - Qaida , " the government report said .
" It will face a threat from British nationals , including Muslim converts , and U.K. - based foreign terrorists , as well as terrorists planning attacks from abroad . "
After a surgeon removed a cancerous lump from Karen Medlock ’s breast in November , he recommended radiation , a routine next step meant to keep cancer from recurring .
But he did not send her for the kind of radiation most women have received for decades .
Instead , the surgeon referred her to a center in Oakland , Calif. , specializing in a newer form of treatment where radioactive “ seeds ” are inserted in the tumor site .
It could be completed in only five days instead of the six weeks typically required for conventional treatment , which irradiates the entire breast using external beams .
To Ms. Medlock , it seemed an obvious choice .
The newer treatment  given through a system called MammoSite  has been performed on about 45,000 breast cancer patients in this country since the Food and Drug Administration cleared it for use in 2002 .
Only when Ms. Medlock , 49 , sought a second opinion did she learn a startling truth : MammoSite is still highly experimental .
When I read it now , I barely recognize myself as the author .
I ’d need to have a serious talking - to with the young man who wrote that article .
I ’d tell him that just because an endeavor is sprinkled with the blood of good people , that does n’t make it just , or noble , or even worthwhile .
He should not have so quickly abrogated the responsibility of answering the question : “ What are we fighting for ? ”
To me , now , “ Email from Iraq ” reads like war propaganda — an illustration of the energy and character and goodwill of its participants , while beckoning the reader to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain .
I think I recognize the lens through which he saw the conflict : “ Look , Ma. I ’m at war ! ”
After all the hype and fear associated with armed conflict , it ’s difficult to get over the reality of participating in it .
The theses of the contemporary military biographies I ’ve read seem invariably to be : “ Look what a bad - ass I am . ”
This is understandable , as war presents problems which are both interesting and important — fatally important .
They create geniuses in solving those problems .
It is easy to so thoroughly absorb yourself in their solutions that you never think about , say , the Constitution — which , on a completely unrelated note , military officers have sworn to support and defend against all enemies foreign and domestic .
I guess I believed a little , too .
Upon redeploying from Iraq , an influential friend of a friend of a friend got me an interview , which might have resulted in me returning to Iraq as a civilian .
I was absorbed in the problems I ’d worked on there , and unwilling abandon them .
I bought a suit .
When the White House Liaison to the State Department told me these types of jobs generally go to people who ’ve “ proven their loyalty to the president by working on his campaign , ” I could have pointed out that I ’d been off fighting his war for the duration of the re-election campaign .
I could have said one of many things , but instead produced a noise indicative of a peach pit stuck in one ’s throat .
In Iraq , I was making a first impression with the locals .
I believed I would bring them a good future , and so did they .
The United States has been in Afghanistan seven years , a Provincial Reconstruction Team has been in Kunar for three .
The locals have seen us come and go , and it ’s difficult to tell what they believe .
One local made my interpreter laugh during a visit to the governor ’s compound .
“ He asked if you guys are the new PRT , ” my interpreter explained , “ then he asked if this cow has a lot of milk . ”
IV .
It turned out only 25 % of inactive reserve call - ups report for duty .
I ’m still trying to decide whether I ’m a sucker .
Probably not .
I ’ve emerged unscathed with nearly a year ’s worth of tax - free income in the bank and a few stories to tell .
I also anticipate enjoying the free respect and credibility given to all veterans regardless of whether or not they were complete shit - bags .
Of course , my answer would be different if I ’d been , say , on the wrong convoy up the Deywagal Valley .
Driving up a capillary valley
It was hard preparing to risk your life for something you do n’t believe .
It eats away your soul .
Or maybe it was just fear .
In November , America will vote for a new President .
The next President , whomever it is , has said he will overturn the restrictions President Bush placed on use of federal money for human embryonic stem cell ( hESC ) research that does not meet criteria established in 2001 .
The controversy surrounding hESC research is too much to go into here but here are 5 things you should know about the science of stem cell research , including the hESC kind .
embryonic stem cells , tissue / adult stem cells and induced pluripotent ( or “ reprogrammed ” ) stem cells .
Around the world , these three kinds of stem cells are under intense study for possible treatments for conditions from spinal cord injuries to juvenile diabetes .
Because embryonic stem cell research is unknown territory , scientists and medical researchers hope it could bring new insight into cancer or make it possible to avoid birth defects .
Much of the controversy has focused on embryonic stem cells ..
These embryos are created in fertility clinics for the purpose of fertility treatment .
But for a variety of reasons , not all embryos can be used for fertility treatment .
Many of these surplus embryos , which number about 400,000 nationwide , are otherwise discarded .
The cells scientists use come from embryos just five days after fertilization .
Embryos at this stage , called blastocysts , are spheres containing about 100 cells that have not yet differentiated into more specialized cells .
If some of these cells are placed in a lab dish in the right conditions , they can become stem cell lines that can be maintained indefinitely in an undifferentiated state , or guided to become specific types of cells .
Scientists want to use these embryonic cells because they have the capacity to turn into any of the 200 cell types in the body .
These “ master cells ” promise to provide large enough quantities of specialized nerve , pancreas or other cells to effectively help patients whose own cells are not functioning .
Scientists in most states are allowed to use embryos from these clinics to create stem cell lines and develop disease therapies in their laboratories ..
' Adult ' stem cells does not mean they are only in adults or even just in children ; they are also present in developing fetuses .
They are more specialized cells that arise from embryonic stem cells .
Also known as tissue - specific stem cells , they have the ability to make one or two kinds of cells , such as blood and immune system cells , brain or muscle cells .
Adult stem cells have a more limited capacity to replace themselves than do embryonic stem cells .
Decades of work with adult blood stem cells have led to successful bone marrow transplant treatments that are used today to treat people who have leukemia , lymphoma and some inherited blood disorders .
Today , blood stem cells can often be isolated from the blood rather than bone marrow .
Although scientists continue to try to expand the use of adult stem cells , so far it has been very difficult to get many types of adult stem cells to reproduce in sufficient amounts to lead to effective treatments .
Recently , Japanese and American scientists have developed a third type of stem cell , which are skin cells that have been ' reprogrammed ' to be similar to embryonic stem cells .
These induced pluripotent cells ( iPS ) are reprogrammed using viruses , which may predispose those cells to cancer .
To date , none of the reprogrammed lines that have been used in patients .
iPS cells are an exciting discovery but it is unknown whether the reprogrammed cells can function the way embryonic stem cells do .
Bush was the first President to fund embryonic stem cell research .-
The derivation process ( which begins with the destruction of the embryo ) was initiated prior to 9:00 P.M. EDT on August 9 , 2001 .-
The stem cells must have been derived from an embryo that was created for reproductive purposes and was no longer needed . -
Informed consent must have been obtained for the donation of the embryo and that donation must not have involved financial inducements .
State and private companies not using federal funds are exempt from these restrictions .
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , as the Federal government 's leading biomedical research organization , implements the President 's policy .
The NIH funds research scientists to conduct research on existing human embryonic stem cells and to explore the enormous promise of these unique cells , including their potential to produce breakthrough therapies and cures .
Investigators from 14 laboratories in the United States , India , Israel , Singapore , Sweden , and South Korea have derived stem cells from 71 individual , genetically diverse blastocysts .
These derivations meet the President 's criteria for use in federally funded human embryonic stem cell research .
The NIH has consulted with each of the investigators who have derived these cells .
These scientists are working with the NIH and the research community to establish a research infrastructure to ensure the successful handling and the use of these cells in the laboratory .
Sean Morrison outlines several key facts that citizens can keep in mind as they navigate through a flood of often conflicting information about stem cell research .

How to ... Booty Call with Aplomb ( in 25 Steps )
Most people do n't talk about booty calls .
That 's part of their appeal : " We do n't have to endlessly com - mu - ni - cate because we 're not in a serious relationship . "
People rely on a tacit understanding when it comes to casual sex with their friends and neighbors , and especially their exes .
But it 's silly to assume that everyone " understands " the exact same set of personal guidelines .
The implicit , unlegislated booty call is a complicated procedure , due to varying agendas , the likelihood of miscommunication , and the chance of emotional intimacy .
The smart people know that without rules , there are expectations , and those , by definition , make things messy .
Even if you do n't think you have any expectations , that in itself is an expectation :
That you not expect anything of me , that you not sleep over , that you not get mad if I do n't call you back .
So let 's once and for all manage those expectations with The 25 Rules of the Modern Booty Caller :
1. Separate sex from love .
2 . You do n't need to have anything in common .
The ability and / or desire to converse with each other is only necessary if one party requires that as foreplay .
3 . Both parties must be either single or in open relationships .
4 . Exes you are currently friends with make ideal booty call partners .
However , if one party broke the other 's heart , pursuing a booty - call arrangement is a no - no ( at least for 24 months ) .
5 . Unless otherwise agreed upon , after midnight on a school night is too late to call .
On weekends , all calls should be made at least five minutes before closing time .
6 . If you do n't want an overnight guest , then make the booty call before sundown .
After the sun sets , you 've got to resign yourself to the possibility of entertaining all night long -- unless you have express rules to the contrary , it is the only polite thing to do .
7 . It 's best to store your booty call 's number in your phone and NOT memorize it , should you someday wish to delete the number ( and the person ) from your sex life .
8 . Booty calls are best made via caller - ID - friendly devices .
That way , the receiver can decide whether or not to take the call .
If the receiver is not prepared to say yes , he or she should not pick up lest the answer offend or embarrass the caller ( e.g . " I 'd rather watch Survivor than fuck you tonight " ) .
9 . Whenever possible , opt for text messaging a booty call request -- it 's the most civilized ( i.e safest , i.e. cowardly ) form of booty call communication .
10 .
Though it 's understood that most booty calls are made after hours , the world would do well to remember that calls may also be made sober and in the light of day .
11 . Ideally , booty callers should alternate who calls whom so that mutual interest is constantly re-established .
If you have been the initiator more than three times without reciprocation , it is safe to assume they 'd almost rather watch Survivor than have sex with you .
And if you 'd rather watch reality TV , then it 's okay to simply stop calling ( or stop picking up ) - - especially if it was not a monogamous set - up .
12 . You probably should n't draw on one booty source more than once a week .
Two weeks is ideal .
An more often and you risk drifting into a common - law relationship .
13 .
It 's okay to be tipsy , but if you are stumbling drunk and unable to perform the basic duties of the booty call , do n't make the call in the first place .
It 's is the height of rudeness to call if there is ANY chance you may vomit on or near your booty call .
14 . Both parties should be armed with condoms and dental dams at all times .
15 . Do n't leave personal items behind .
16 . Faking is a no - no ( that is reserved for the most dysfunctional relationships and miserable one - night stands ) .
Each party deserves at least one real one .
17 .
If you 're not having fun , then by definition , it is n't a proper booty call .
18 . Never call a fuck buddy just to say hi .
19 .
If your booty call is in the same social circle , and your are out together in a group , then either go home together or go home alone .
20 .
Just because the sex is casual does n't make it an appropriate topic for casual conversation .
Be discreet .
21 . Assume that you are not the only booty call in your b.c. partner 's rotation .
If this is not cool with you , then you must communicate your desire for casual yet monogamous sex and then negotiate from there .
22 . Do n't assume that duration implies relationship progression .
23 .
You should always be honest about where this is going , other booty call partners you may have , sexual health history , etc. , but keep unsolicited details about your other partners and sexual experiences to yourself .
24 .
The above rules may be amended at any time if both parties are in explicit agreement .
25 .
No matter how casual the set - up , remember that your booty buddy is a human being , and not a fucking machine .
If you can't play well with others , get yourself a sex toy .
This final rule may not be amended and trumps all others at all times .
More on booty call rules can be found in our book , " Sex Etiquette for Ladies and Gentlemen . "

No American election for many years , maybe none since 1960 , has been as gripping as this year 's , outside as well as inside the country .
It is of course the astonishing and wonderfully unlikely figure of Barack Obama who has captivated everyone from Europe to China to his ancestral Africa .
But seen from here in the United States itself , the real story of the election is not so much the irresistible rise of Obama as the implosion of American conservatism .
Although his team has been brilliantly organised in terms of mastering the internet , fundraising and motivating younger voters , Obama has fought an almost passive campaign .
Some of what he has done this year has actually been dull or mediocre , from his choice of Joseph Biden as running mate to his feeble speech in Berlin .
Now and again he has stung like a bee , but more often he has floated like a butterfly , displaying preternatural coolness and calm .
He has been less a boxer raining blows than a judo playeer using the other 's bulk and ungainliness against him , waiting for his opponent to self - destruct and defeat himself .
As he duly has .
John McCain 's campaign has almost petered out amid gross incompetence , fatuous invocations of Joe the Plumber , foolish stunts – his short - lived promise to suspend the campaign altogether in response to the financial crisis –and ugly spite .
And if Obama 's choice of running mate was uninspiring , McCain 's choice was ludicrous .

" Do n't worry too much about Sarah Palin , " the neoconservative Robert Kagan has just said in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel .
But many Americans worry deeply about this ignorant and bigoted woman , not least because , were McCain to win , her actuarial chances of succeeding as president would be quite high .
In the words of Kagan 's fellow neocon David Brooks of The New York Times , Palin is a " cancer on the Republican Party " , and even some of McCain 's own aides have now turned on her .
Their campaign teams have fallen out among themselves , bickering , backstabbing and holding " pre-mortems " .
" There are many ways to lose a presidential election , " says David Frum , a former Bush speechwriter .
" John McCain is losing in a way that threatens to take the entire Republican Party down with him . "
There will be much scapegoating to come after a defeat all Republicans now privately expect .
Besides that we have the highly diverting parade of defectors , the " Obamacons " or Republicans for Barack .
The most eminent is Colin Powell , President Bush 's sometime Secretary of State , although there are also William Weld , a former Republican governor of Massachusetts , and Scott McClellan , once George Bush 's press secretary .
Even some Republicans running for office , such as Joel Haugen , an Oregon congressman fighting a tough battle for re-election , have backed Obama .
All of this is only symptomatic of the deeper bankruptcy of the American right .
They do n't know what they are doing or where they are going .
The Cold War is over , won by the West , even if the outcome in Russia and east Europe has n't been much of an advertisement for the capitalist market economy , and even if proclaiming " the end of history " now looks hubristically premature .
Large political parties , especially under the American ( as the British ) electoral system are bound to be coalitions , often of highly disparate elements .
That was true of the Democrats in their heyday under Roosevelt to which many are now harking back , a weird alliance of organised labour , city bosses , intellectual progressives and Southern segregationists .
But the Republicans have become an equally improbable mixture of fiscal conservatives , religious reactionaries and neocons , who really have little in common beyond a shared enemy in the form of " liberalism " or what passes for such in America .
The nomination of McCain himself was a sign of the conservatives ' difficulties .
He defeated his rivals because of his seeming authenticity and decency , but many on the Right greatly dislike him as ideologically unsound .
Then came the anointing of Palin , which may prove to have been a decisive moment .
In a most entertaining article in The New Yorker , Jane Mayer describes not one but two sea cruises to Alaska in the summer of last year arranged by right - wing magazines of different hues , National Review and Weekly Standard .
There they met Palin and fell for her – " my heartthrob , " says William Kristol – even though the advocacy of this gormless backwoodswoman by clever rightist intellectuals was the height of cynicism .
It was also a mark of despair .
" Nothing is inevitable , " McCain said on Tuesday , but a victory for Obama now looks very likely indeed , and if the turnout of younger voters rises sharply it could be a landslide .
We may all yet be disappointed by President Obama , but this election will still be a thrashing from which the Right will take a long time to recover .
Geoffrey Wheatcroft 's books include ' The Strange Death of Tory England '
Heather Mallick , an opinion columnist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ’s Web site , is known for her use of humorous exaggeration .
But last week after removing a column by Ms. Mallick , which said that Gov. Sarah Palin has “ a toned - down version of the porn actress look ” and suggested that Republican men were sexually inadequate , the government - owned CBC ruled that its opinion writers had to stick to the facts even when they were joking around .
Although the broadcaster ’s Web site , www.cbcnews.ca, has relatively few readers in the United States , Ms. Mallick ’s comments became an issue last month on the Fox News Channel , which , because of Canadian cable TV rules that limit its distribution , has relatively few viewers in Canada .
Greta Van Susteren , the host of “ On the Record , ” condemned the column as “ beyond vicious ” and repeatedly referred to Ms. Mallick as “ a pig . ”
A right - of - center columnist for The National Post , of Toronto , also criticized the column .
The CBC ombudsman , Vince Carlin , said in a report that his office had received more than 300 complaints about the column .
In an e-mail message , Ms. Mallick said she believed that the complaints had been “ orchestrated ” by Fox News and came largely from Americans .
Blasphemy is a victimless crime .
A 16 year old was arrested , in the Gold Coast , on Monday for wearing an offensive T shirt .
The T - shirt in question is a Cradle of Filth band T - shirt .
The T - shirt depicts a semi- naked nun masturbating , with the words “ Vestal Masturbation ” , on one side and the words JESUS IS A C**T on the other .
For those of a sensitive nature the picture of the T - shirt is at the end of this post .
The story has been in several news media , but Ben Dillaway reported at goldcoast.com .au that it was blasphemous .
In his article there was also the following quote from a local minister :
The Reverend Matt Hunt of the Helensvale Baptist Church said it was sad people spoke about the Lord in such a way .
“ It ’s fairly common language these days to express sadness , anger or hurt , ” he said .
“ It ’s a degrading word to use and Jesus is anything but that .
It ’s like calling white black . ”
Mr Hunt said using the Lord ’s name in vain was a serious sin .
I tend to agree somewhat that the C word can be considered degrading and / or offensive by some .
However , the rev will have to get over the fact that a very large number of us do n’t believe Jesus exists .
Thus it ’s no more a ‘ sin ’ calling Jesus a bad word than it is calling the tooth fairy a bad word .
The goldcoast.com.au article has a comments page which understandably has had a large number of comments .
Over 300 at time of writing , perhaps this might beat the Unleashed article which currently has over 1180 ( see my post How to get 1000 + Comments ) .
The comments basically fall into one of three types :
The religious person who thinks it ’s blasphemous and evil and the guy should have been charged
The people ( religious or not ) who think that anything goes , freedom of speech and all that , and the guy should not have been charged .
The people ( religious or not ) who think that the C word and / or pictures of semi- naked women masturbating is / are offensive .
Then there are all the off topic arguments .
Personally the C word is one of the few swear words I try not to use in the public arena .
I have been told by several women they find it the most offensive of all the swear words .
However I do use it occasionally , but if someone says to me they do n’t like hearing that word , or any other swear word , I will do my best not to use it in front of them .
Some call this the “ Grandmother Test ” , would you use the word in front of your grandmother ?
I have no problem with people ‘ insulting ’ Jesus as a ) he is n’t real and b ) religion should not be above critique or criticism , just because it ’s religion .
However the C word could be considered offensive , as could a picture of a , mostly naked , woman masturbating ( the fact she is depicted as a nun should be immaterial ) .
Especially when displayed in a open public arena .
If the guy has been charged for offensive behaviour then it ’s up to the courts to decide if he ’s guilty ( based on current acceptable standards ) .
Any charge of blasphemy or insulting imaginary beings should be , quite rightly thrown out of court .
Do I find the T - shirt offensive ?
I think its funny but a bit too rude to be wearing in general public .
Do I think the police should have charged him ?
I think that unless the police had had complaints , and not from religious people being offended by the supposed blasphemy , they should not have charged him .
Do n’t the police have more important things to do ?
The police should not be the sole arbiter of public decency , perhaps they should have just cautioned the guy in the first instance ?
Here ’s the offending T - shirt ,
What do you think ?
Offensive ?
Blasphemous ?
Should anyone be charged with offensive behaviour for wearing it ?
Would you wear it ?
Is Jesus a Cunt ? ( see I can say the word )

I had heard about this on the radio , but hat tip to Nut Watch for bringing the offensive T - shirt story to my attention again .

When John McCain embarrassed himself last month by declaring that the “ fundamentals of our economy are strong , ” he quickly claimed that he was talking about his belief in the American worker  and darkly implied that anyone who disagreed was less than patriotic .
For all of that concern , it ’s a shame that Mr. McCain has n’t come up with policies that would actually help workers .
Instead , he ’s served up the same - old trickle - down theories and a government - is - wrong , markets - are - right fervor that helped create this economic disaster .
Wednesday night ’s debate was another chance for Mr. McCain to prove that he is ready to lead this country out of its deep economic crisis .
But he had one answer to almost every economic question : cut taxes and government spending .
Unfortunately , what Mr. McCain means is to cut taxes for the richest Americans and , inevitably , to reduce the kinds of government services that working Americans need more than ever .
Mr. McCain also stuck to his campaign ’s nasty tone .
He could not let go of the “ Joe the Plumber ” parable , saying his opponent ’s plan was “ to take Joe ’s money , give it to Senator Obama and let him spread the wealth around . ”
Mr. McCain then accused Barack Obama of engaging in the sort of “ class warfare ” that has , in fact , been a focus of his own campaign .
" This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather , " the Democratic senator from Illinois , who is bidding to be America 's first black president at the tender age of 47 , said to huge cheers

Multimedia Design
Welcome to Multimedia Design ’s Companion web site .
This 15 - week course is designed to challenge your preconceptions regarding New Media and to force you to think about New Media in an entirely new way .
The first two weeks , Experience Design , will closely follow the ideas of Nathan Shedroff as presented in his book , Experience Design .
The next two weeks will explore the Information Design concepts of Edward Tufte .
Using his classic work , “ Envisioning Information ” as the basis for the class , we will explore how data is transformed into information .
Week Five will examine the Art of the Interactive Storyteller .
We will look at how the oral tradition of communication provides the roots for what we do as the story tellers of the digital age .
From how the Inuit start fires with gunpowder to “ The Rock ” of the WWE we will examine how a story is told in the realm of Digital Media .
New Media actually started in a living room in Berlin during the 1930’s .
Week Six will trace the evolution of New Media from a loom to a Chrysler CD .
What may surprise you is that not much has changed in 150 years .
The term “ Interactive ” has been tossed around so much , it has lost all meaning .
This class , in week seven . will focus on the Three Principals of Interactivity .
Week Eight will introduce you to the various “ Design Styles ” used on the web .
Ranging from “ Gothic Organic ” to “ Drafting Table / Transformer ” you will discover you are n’t necessarily confined to the constraints of the computer screen .
Though design implies a solitary pursuit , this is n’t the case when it applies to the creation of New Media .
Week Nine introduces you to the team - based approach driving the creation of New Media and the new breed of designer and developer resulting from this shift in work flow and production .
The balance of the course will be devoted to the technologies of New Media .
Though you may think you know what you are talking about , do you really know hat you are talking about .
The line up is as follows :
Week Ten : The Technology of Colour
Weeks Eleven and Twelve :
The technology of Typography
Week Thirteen : Animation on the web
Weeks Fourteen and Fifteen : Video and Audio .
Nobody should be confused that John McCain ’s campaign is dizzying in its gyrations , seemingly without direction and sputtering .
McCain ’s basic problem is that he does not really have politics .
He has a sense of honor and an instinct for revenge when he feels his honor has been besmirched .
That is the heart of his “ politics . ”
He has no feel for them .
His career consists of episodes where he finds himself trapped in affairs of honor or dishonor , from Vietnam to the Keating Five , from his campaign against George W. Bush to the one against Barack Obama .
As the son and grandson of admirals and with a lineage tracing back to George Washington ’s staff in the Revolutionary War his code is military .
In that respect he is the opposite of George W. Bush , son and grandson of politicians , and Barack Obama , who has found his home and identity in politics despite his “ post - political ” rhetoric .
McCain truly hates only Republicans , from Bush to Tom DeLay .
McCain is the Republican Party nominee only because of the party ’s disintegration , the shattering of the party ’s center as Bush had constructed it , and the conservative inability to coalesce even as a faction amid the ruins .
For the same reason , McCain ’s difficulties — all of them — stem from the implosion of the Republican Party under Bush , t he strange death of Republican America .
McCain ’s most virulent enemies have not been Democrats .
Some of his best friends are Democrats — and not just Joe Lieberman .
He is a maverick as a Republican in that he has few if any enemies on his left but only on his right .
He truly hates only Republicans , from Bush to Tom DeLay .
And the feeling is mutual .
Since the dirty tricks campaign in the GOP South Carolina primary of 2000 , he has sought vengeance against those who violated him — the gang of operatives who aided and abetted Bush ’s campaign against him , many of them close to DeLay — including Jack Abramoff , whose crimes McCain through his chairmanship of the Indian Affairs Committee exposed .
McCain chose Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate as an impulsive act to assert his own authority against Bush and Rove who were pushing Romney on him and in defiance of his staff ’s insistence of the madness of his preference for Lieberman .
The Bush White House intensely dislikes him today , more than a few months ago , regarding him as a hopeless politician .
Despite his selection of Palin , the right remains wary of him .
They back him out of the desire for power , not shared values or politics .
Mistrust continues to plague McCain within the GOP .
McCain mixes extreme individualism into his anti-political core .
A natural - born fighter pilot , a solo operator , he is highly temperamental , easily upset , often unmanageable , loves to gamble ( including at the craps table ) , and willing to plunge into risk .
He has never been anything else .
He has always flown on a wing and a prayer .
Unsurprisingly , he does not think logically in policy terms .
His erratic and impulsive pattern is utterly predictable .
Hardly anybody within the Republican Party trusts him — not the White House , not Bush ’s close allies , not business , not evangelicals , not conservatives generally .
As a presidential candidate , whenever McCain ’s alienation from his party is threatened , he desperately runs to embrace the conservative wing by doing something , almost anything to satisfy it .
Many of McCain ’s shifts have been necessary to allay the right ’s long - held and well - founded suspicions of his betrayals .
Every time McCain moves to his right , it is because he ’s not trusted within his own party .
Every time he swivels away from the right , the mistrust between McCain and Republicans signals a larger collapse of ideology .
On one level , the more McCain ’s incoherence has been exposed , the more erratic and impulsive he has become .
But , on another level , he ’s predictable .
McCain inevitably comes to regard the objects of his scorn as dishonorable .
His contempt for Obama is rooted in his ingrained military sensibility .
Obama is trying to become commander - in - chief without having earned his stripes .
His campaign against Obama has turned into an effort to disqualify him as dishonorable .
Caught in a vicious cycle , McCain returns to his “ politics ” of honor .

What follows is a background document on slavery in Niger compiled by Anti-Slavery International .
It assisted Hadijatou Mani in bringing her landmark court case against the government of the country .
Background
Slavery was abolished in Niger in 1960 ( upon independence from France ) , prohibited in 1999 and criminalised in 2003 .
How many slaves are there in Niger ?
The minimum estimate is that 43,000 people are in slavery across Niger .
It is based on research by Timidria , a local human rights organisation , and Anti-Slavery International .
The research involved more than 11,000 face - to - face interviews in six regions of the country , constituting the most comprehensive survey of slavery in Niger to date .
Who practises slavery ?
Slavery remains deeply embedded in Niger society .
It exists across the country , in rural and urban areas , and is practised predominantly by the Tuareg , Maure ( Berber Arab ) and Peule ( also known as Pulaar , or Fulani ) ethnic groups .
Some Hausa follow the " fifth wife " practice - a form of slavery ( see below ) .
The Hausa ( both in Niger and Nigeria ) are sold their " fifth wife " by Tuareg masters .
How do people become slaves in Niger ?
Virtually all cases of slavery documented in Niger concern individuals whose ancestors were enslaved many generations ago .
Slavery status is ascribed at birth and passed on through the generations .
The Tuareg follow a complicated caste system that incorporates slaves at the bottom of society .
Tuareg culture does not allow people to marry outside their caste .
It is significant that , in Niger , slaves identify themselves as Tuareg even if their ancestry technically belongs to African people enslaved by Tuareg raiders .
Nobles and warriors are at the top of Tuareg culture , and Islamic clerics , or marabouts , come next .
Below them are free men , followed by casted groups such as blacksmiths and other occupations .
Below all these are freed slaves ; the lowest rung is reserved for slaves .
All these free and casted groups can have slaves - even slaves themselves , if they have the financial means .
A slave can be freed in Tuareg culture by his or her master , if they wish to appease Allah to make amends for an indiscretion , or simply out of kindness .
Historically , slaves could be freed if they acted with distinction and valour in battle .
Despite this , freed slaves remain near the bottom of the Tuareg caste system , above only slaves .
What does it mean to be a slave ?
Slaves have no rights and no opportunities in life .
In Niger , people are born into slavery and forced to work without pay for their so - called masters throughout their lives , primarily herding cattle or working on farmland , or as domestic servants .
Slaves are denied fundamental rights , and their masters exercise powers of ownership over them .
Slaves are inherited , and given as gifts .
Children may be taken away from their mothers at an early age .
Girls are forced to start work as domestic servants at a very young age , and are at the continual beck and call of their masters .
They may be sexually abused by men in the household or forced to marry at a young age .
Women have spoken of living in constant fear of abuse , and rape is common .
Masters also consider that they have the right to demand the marriage dowry of their former slaves ( which may consist of a bed , a tent or kitchen utensils ) .
When a former slave dies , the master can demand the inheritance , even if the former slave has children .
Even when former slaves have been free for many years , the master will assume the right to approve their marriage or inherit their property .
Many slaves are not on the electoral roll , and so are not entitled to vote .
This political exclusion enables those in power to maintain the status quo .
Slavery and the misuse of Islam
Slaves are told that , under Islam , their paradise is bound to their master , and that if they do what the master tells them , they will go to heaven .
This is a powerful mechanism of control , teaching those who are enslaved to follow orders and accept their fate or they will be forsaken by God and live outside Islam .
Without access to education or alternative means of subsistence , many believe that it is Allah 's wish for them to be slaves when in reality Islam dictates that a Muslim may not enslave a fellow Muslim .
' Fifth wives '
Islam allows a man to take a maximum of four wives .
However , in Niger , the practice exists of taking a fifth wife .
These women are known as wahiya among the Tuareg and sadaka among the Hausa .
Sometimes men take several fifth wives .
The fifth wife does not receive any of the status benefits of being a wife , as there is no actual marriage .
She is , in effect , a slave to her " husband " .
In 2006 , Timidria helped release 34 women known to have been sold as fifth wives in the Canton of Douguerawa .
A further 12 were released in 2007 .
Anti-Slavery International was able to interview 10 of the women , who complained they had been subjugated to forced and unpaid labour , rape and daily insults .
Boehner bashes Justice Dept. for not doing enough on voter fraud
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) is slamming the Justice Department for not doing enough in response to GOP complaints of potential voter fraud .
In a letter today to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , Boehner said he had just been told that Justice has reversed its 2002 policy of sending prosecutors along with election - observer teams into certain states .
" I have just been advised of your department ’s decision to reverse its longstanding policy of assigning criminal prosecutors to serve on all federal election observer teams , " Boehner wrote .
" I am deeply concerned about this decision , particularly in the wake of a steady stream of reports highlighting voter registration fraud and potential fraudulent voting activities that have dominated the news in recent weeks . "
The Ohio Republican also referred to a Washington Times story that said DOJ employees had donated $ 268,000 to Sen.
Barack Obama 's presidential campaign , including several senior members of the Voting Rights section , which would oversee voter - fraud allegations .
Boehner suggested pro-Obama officials within the Justice Department may be influencing policy decisions .
" I am particularly dismayed to learn that several DOJ officials with important responsibilities for overseeing enforcement of the nation 's voting rights laws – from access to the polls to protecting against voter fraud – are significant financial contributors to the Obama presidential campaign , " Boehner said .
" According to published reports , approximately $ 250,000 has already been contributed by DOJ employees to the Obama campaign , including personal contributions from several senior officials in the Voting Rights Section of the DOJ .
This news does nothing to inspire confidence by the American people in the DOJ 's ability to assure fair elections and the equal application of the nation 's voting laws .
Boehner added : " Frankly , the real motive behind the Department ’s decision is undeniably suspect given that Obama partisans in key positions at the Department of Justice may well have played a pivotal role in making it .

John McCain 's campaign has received $ 97,400 from DOJ employees .
Apple 's mobile iTunes store will soon face competition from Amazon 's MP3 store on Google 's upcoming T - Mobile G1 device , pictured to the right – the first cellphone to run Google 's Android mobile operating system .
Owners of the device will be able to browse , search , preview and purchase music on the Amazon MP3 store using the phone 's cellular connection .
In order for purchased MP3s to download , the phone must be connected via Wi -Fi .
( The mobile iTunes store , on the other hand , remains completely offline without WiFi . )
" Amazon wants to make it easy for customers to discover , buy , andplay their music wherever they happen to be – whether sitting at theircomputer or on the go , " stated Amazon digital music and video president Bill Carr .
" We look forward to the release of theT - Mobile G1 , which will put Amazon MP3's vast selection of low - pricedDRM - free music at the fingertips of even more customers in moreplaces . "
The phone is expected to go on sale next month .
This Amazon MP3
Store partnership , announced on Tuesday , speaks volumes about how hard it must be to launch a music store these days .
With Apple 's dominance of the space increasingly threatened by Amazon 's 100 percent DRM - free approach to music ( a result of concessions to the labels on variable pricing ) , there does n't seem to be much room for another major new music store .
Google seems to have decided it would be much easier to integrate with Amazon than to seek licensing from the labels and consumer mindshare on its own .
Like Apple , Google plans to offer an application store that toallow developers to take the device 's music ( and other ) capabilities innew directions .
For years , Apple has remained the digital music market leader – in North America , anyway – by designing stuff that many listeners find easier and more pleasant touse .
The T - Mobile G1 features a hardware QWERTY keyboard that slidesout from under the touchscreen .
Windows Mobile and Blackberry userscould find the design more familiar than Apple 's when they nextconsider upgrading .
As for this music store , the ability to queue up purchases for laterdownload via WiFi while on the go gives Google and Amazon an edge overiTunes .
Plus , iPhone application developers have told Wired.com that onepoint of frustration with that device is that Apple does n't give themaccess to the iPod application on the iPhone .
If Google allows third - party developers to design stuff for its application store that integratesmore tightly with the music store and player on T - Mobile G1 than Appledoes on the iPhone , Android - powered phones could develop other musical advantages over Jobs ' device .
For example , picture a mash - up ofShazam , GPS , timestamp and the camera that identifies songs you 've identified and matches them with pictures takenin a similar time or place with the ability to buy any 30 - second samples of unpurchased songs that are in the slideshow and other ideas along thoselines . )
Analysts expect the device to sell somewhere in the neighborhood of 250,000 to 400,000 units by the end of 2008 ( by comparison , the iPhone sold one million units in the first 74 days . )

Bad Credit ?
Why You Should n't ' Rent to Own ' " Rent to own " and , in many cases , wind up overpaying .
Aug. 25 , 2008  --
As Americans , we 've been flogging ourselves plenty lately for our addiction to credit , and how it gives us the ability to get things now that we would n't be able to afford until later .
There 's another version of that , and it's the world of " rent to own . "
It can be convenient for people with poor credit , but in the long run it is a lousy way to buy something .
I once priced a 25 - inch television at a rental store and a regular retailer .
The rental store wanted $ 86.25 a month for twelve months .
That 's a total of $ 1,035 .
The cash price for the same TV at the regular retailer was just $ 500 .
Plus , when you rent to own , it 's possible that the TV is several years old and has been rented to countless other people before you .

Even paying by credit card and carrying a balance can be a better deal than renting to own .
( Much as it pains me to suggest it . )
That 's because if monthly rental fees were expressed as an annual percentage rate they would range from about 100 percent to 350 percent .
Credit cards typically do n't top 24 percent .
( Then again , if you pay by credit card and carry the balance for years and years , you could eventually end up paying more that way . )
The best thing to do is take the same amount that you would pay a rental company each month and put that money in a savings account instead .
Take the 25 - inch television example , above .
If you save $ 86.25 a month , after six months you would have enough to pay cash for the TV .
The one disadvantage is that you have to wait .
If you need the item today , you might want to consider buying something at a garage sale or thrift store instead .
After all , it 's quite possible the rental store is going to provide you with used merchandise , so what 's the difference ?
Questions to Ask :
2 . How many rental payments will you have to make to own the item ?
3 . How much will each payment be ?
4 . What will the total of all the payments be ?
5 . Will the item be new or used ?
6 . If you 're late with a payment , will the store repossess the item ?
7 . If you have trouble making your payments , can you return the item without a penalty ?
8 . Are you allowed to pay off the item early to save money ?
Or is there a penalty ?
Do Your Homework About ' Rent to Own '
Shop around .
Compare the same item at different rental stores and at retail stores .
Consider saving for the item or buying something used instead .
If you must rent to own , pay the item off early if you can to save money .
Make sure the rental store gives you a written contract and keep a copy .
Try to get the questions above answered in writing .
Some states require it .

October 11 , 2008 -- Academics and researchers from Argentina , Australia , Belgium , Canada , Chile , China , Cuba , Ecuador , France , Mexico , Peru , Phillipines , South Korea , Spain , United Kingdom , United States , Uruguay and Venezuela participated in the International Political Economy Conference : Responses from the South to the Global Economic Crisis , held in Caracas October 8 - 11 , 2008 .
The conference stimulated a wide - ranging debate on the current economic and financial health of the global economy , the new perspectives and the challenges to the governments and peoples of the South posed by the international financial crisis .
The meeting concluded that the situation has worsened in the last few weeks .
It has progressed rapidly from being a series of crises in the financial markets of countries in the centre and has turned into an extremely serious international crisis .
This means that countries in the South are in a very difficult situation .
The crisis threatens the real economy and , if energetic and effective actions are not taken immediately , all peoples in the world could be drastically punished ; especially the least - protected and most - neglected sectors .
The vulnerability of our currencies , the financial imbalances and the serious recession that looms large give the lie to the neoliberal myth about the benefits of deregulating markets and the solidity and trustworthiness of the existing financial institutions ; the former also clearly bring into question the foundations of the current capitalist system .
The contributions made to the conference shone the spotlight on the way the crisis , which began in August 2007 , has developed and on the failure of the ever larger concessions , bailouts and privileges provided by state intervention in developed capitalist countries to save the dregs of an already non-functional world financial system .
We denounce the attempt to make the overall world system carry the cost of the financial bailout thus aggravating the situation of poverty , unemployment and exploitation experienced by the world 's workers and peoples .
Neither the colossal state interventionism seen over the last few weeks to rescue institutions dismembered and drained dry by speculation , nor massive public indebtedness are plausible ways to get out of the crisis .
The existing dynamic encourages new rounds of capital concentration and , if the peoples do not firmly oppose this , it is becoming perilously likely that restructuring will occur simply to save privileged sectors .
This could mean there is a danger of capitalism returning to an authoritarian way of functioning , since in the North an increase in discrimination and racism towards immigrants from countries in the South has already been noted -- which is something extremely regressive .
If the current restructuring the capitalist system continues down the same road , there will be enormous productive and social costs and the already fragile sustainablity of the environment may suffer even more damage .
The need to reform the international economic and financial structure is today unavoidable .
Those who think this also believe that it is necessary to find a post - capitalist solution ; in Venezuela this is referred to as 21st Century Socialism .
In a moment as critical as this , national and regional policies must give priority to social spending and to protecting natural and productive resources .
States must introduce urgent financial regulation measures to protect savings , to keep stimulating production and must fight off the dangers implicit in a lack of regulation by immediately implementing exchange and capital movement controls .
It will therefore be essential to develop the highest possible degree of balanced regional complementation and trade integration by reinforcing industrial , agricultural , energy and infrastructural capacities .
Initiatives such as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) and the Bank of the South must extend their radius of action and move their perspective towards that of a alternative form of greater integration which includes a new common currency .
This is so we can move towards creating a new word financial architecture which will make it viable for the south to be involved in a different way in the international division of labour .
In this context it is necessary to evaluate a series of contributions and proposals from the social economy which seek to dignify labour and encourage local coordination to combat the impact of the crisis .
On an international level , we must not cease to demand a far - reaching reform of the international monetary and financial system ; this entails defending savings and channelling investments into serving the peoples ' essential needs .
The continued re-emergence of a system which favours the central role of speculation , increases economic differences and especially punishes those countries and sectors which are least protected must be prevented .
Therefore new ( multilateral ) economic institutions must be created on new bases ; they must have the authority and the instruments to be able to act against the anarchy of speculation .
Hence it has become indispensable that national authorities intervene urgently in ways that challenge the basic workings of the market and protect the finances of the peoples affected .
The crisis has created common interests among the peoples of all nations .
Based on these analyses and considerations , the International Political Economy Conference : Responses from the South to the Global Economic Crisis has reached the following conclusions and recommendations for action .
Conclusions and recommendations for action
We begin with the following characterisation of the international economic situation :
We find ourselves in an unprecedented international situation .
The economic and financial crisis has worsened and accelerated greatly in the last few days .
Its future development , as well as being difficult to foresee could take on , from one day to the next , dramatic overtones .
The initial epicentre of the crisis was in the United States and on the stock markets but the crisis is now a world crisis which is affecting the whole financial system and is increasingly contaminating the productive apparatus .
The crisis is having a particular impact now on Eastern and Western Europe .
In spite of the initial expectations that Latin America could remain outside the crisis and that it is ``shielded '' , today there are very convincing signs that the subcontinent is certain to be affected .
We cannot only expect a prolonged decrease in foreign trade but are certain to be hit by a very violent financial crash -- and soon .
We are making these suggestions well aware that in any crisis there are always winners and losers .
We are strongly in favour of taking those measures which ensure the welfare and rights of our peoples , of citizens in general and not in favour of coming to the aid of the bankers responsible for the crisis as they are doing in Europe and the United States .
Given this new situation and the fact that it is worsening at an accelerated rate we think it is necessary to make the following recommendations for action , some of which will have to be implemented by taking urgent political decisions at the very highest levels .
Therefore , consideration should be given to calling an immediate Extraordinary Summit of Latin American and Caribbean Presidents or at least of those of the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) .
Either or both of these would be presided over by a large popular mobilisation of our peoples .
On the banking system
Given the collapse of the international financial system , states in the region should immediately take charge of the banking systems using controls , intervention and nationalisation without compensation following the principle enshrined in the new Ecuadorian constitution which forbids the state to accept responsibility for private debts ( Article 290 , point 7 ) .
The reason for these measures is to prevent capital fleeing abroad , a run on currencies , the transference of funds from the branches of foreign banks to their head offices and to prevent banks from freezing credit by not lending the funds they receive .
The offshore banking systems of every country must be shut down , for under current circumstances , when liquidity problems are causing money to be siphoned off from the periphery , they are an extremely dangerous haven from regulations and fiscal controls .
The banks ' books must be opened ; bank oversight must be strengthened as must the mechanisms of strict regulation which make the real situation of national banking systems transparent for they are the institutions into which the populations ' savings are deposited .
( Given that financial services are public services . )
One of these measure must guarantee there is a minimum amount of domestic investment in the liquid assets of the system ( coefficient of domestic liquidity ) .
Popular economic activities for development and not for profit must be encouraged and administered by populations living in the areas where such bodies are located .
If the state does intervene they must recover the costs of the bailout from the banks ’ property and have the right to do so from the property of the shareholders and managers .
The new financial architecture
The lack of coordinated monetary policies causes a “ competitive devaluations ” war which makes the crisis worse and unleashes rivalry between our economies thus preventing a coordinated response from the region and even creates structural threats to the progress of initiative towards integration , such as UNASUR .
Therefore , clear signs that there will be a Latin American monetary agreement should be given which will straight away make evident the additional opportunities for “ shielding ” our macro-economies .
Thus , defining a system of payment settlements based on a basket of Latin American monies will provide each country with additional sources of liquidity which will allow them to distance themselves from the logic of the dollar crisis .
Along the same lines as creating institutions to “ shield ” our economies we will need more coordination between our central banks and must go beyond neoliberal dogma by managing our international reserves in a much more efficient and timely way .
So it is important to move forward on the proposal for a Fund of the South that is an alternative to the IMF with liquidity available for emergencies in exchequers ( national treasuries ) or balance of payments .
Making good use of the bigger surplus reserves of each country brought about by the creation of a payment settlement system ( regional credit transfer rights ) and by the existence of the Common Fund of the South , resources can be mobilised to get the Bank of the South up and running straightaway ensuring that it will function democratically and not reproduce the logic of the multilateral financial credit organisations .
This bank must be the heart of this process of transforming the already existing network of Latin American banks whose mission is the reproduction of productive apparati based on fundamental human rights .
We understand all of the foregoing is something similar to what was emphasised in the Quito Ministerial Declaration of May 3 of this year where it said , “ The peoples gave their governments the mandate to provide the region with new tools for integration for development .
These should be designed on transparent , participatory bases and accountable to those who issued the mandate . ”
It is essential to ratify exchange controls in the countries where they exist and to establish them where there do n’t to protect reserves and prevent capital outflows .
In the context of the suspension of payments imposed by the crisis on the international financial system it is imperative that the countries of the region consider suspending payment of public debt .
This measure is intended to temporarily protect sovereign resources threatened by the crisis and avoid an emptying out of the national treasuries .
Latin America and the Caribbean should learn from what is happening in Europe where each country is trying to solve the crisis on its own .
This makes it imperative to bolster the mechanisms of integration being developed in the region .
Social emergency
We propose setting up a Regional Social Emergency Fund to ensure food and energy sovereignty right away and to deal with the acute problems of migration and reduction in remittances .
This fund could operate out of the Bank of the South or the Alba Bank .
Pursuant to the principle of not rescuing bankers but rather our populations , public budgets must be maintained for social spending and we must contemplate an increase in these budgets to combat the imminent effects of the international crisis on our peoples ; our priorities are employment security , universal income , public health and education , housing .
Establishing anti-inflationary mechanisms , such as price controls which conserve and increment low wages and pensions , subsidies etc. , which play a role in redistributing income and wealth .
Financial organisations
The international financial crisis has revealed the complicity of the IMF , the World Bank and the Inter - American Development Bank with transnational bankers who have caused the current collapse with its horrific social consequences .
The loss of prestige of these bodies is obvious .
This is the opportunity for the countries in the region to follow Bolivia ’s example and withdraw from International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID ) .
And to go back to Venezuela 's call to withdraw from the IMF and the World Bank and begin to help to build a new international financial architecture .
We convene a second International Political Economy Conference : Responses from the South to the Global Economic Crisis , to be held in the first four months of 2009 .

A smiling Barack Obama shakes hands with white supporters in Indianapolis Thursday .
White support for Obama at historic high
Barack Obama , the first black major - party nominee , is positioned to win the largest share of white voters of any Democrat in more than three decades , according to an exclusive Politico analysis of recent Gallup and Pew Research Center polling .
The most recent two weeks of Gallup polling , which includes roughly 13,000 interviews , show 44 percent of non-Hispanic white voters presently support Obama — the highest number for a Democrat since 47 percent of whites backed Jimmy Carter in 1976 .

Until the stock market swoon in mid-September , Obama had never reached 40 percent among white voters .
No Democrat has won a majority of white voters since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 .
John McCain has shuffled between 48 percent and 50 percent support in recent weeks — which would be the lowest share for a Republican candidate in a two - man race since Barry Goldwater 's run .
If Obama 's share holds , it would top the 43 percent of white voters who backed Bill Clinton in 1996 , when the Democrat won a plurality among white females and 38 percent of white men , the best performance by a Democrat in all those categories since 1976 .
Before the party conventions , Obama 's support among white men had never passed 35 percent .
In September , he matched Clinton 's level of support , and last week he jumped 5 points to 43 percent .
“ That is amazing , ” Obama campaign pollster Cornell Belcher said after those numbers were read to him .
“ It was already a change election and now you have a cross pressure of the economy , ” he said , causing whites “ who have not been voting for white Democrats " to back Obama .
A Politico breakdown of the Pew polling shows dramatic improvement for Obama among whites since early September on the question of who would do a better job " improving the economy . "
White women , who last month were split , now believe Obama will do a better job “ improving the economy ” by a 49 percent to 35 percent margin .
White men , who had favored McCain by 10 points , are now split , with 41 percent preferring Obama and 43 percent McCain .
About half of whites say the economy is the most important issue in this campaign , while 8 percent said Iraq and 6 percent terrorism , according to the ABC News / Washington Post tracking poll covering Monday through Thursday .
In a similar poll in mid-October 2004 , white voters were evenly split , with 26 percent citing the economy as the most important issue , while 25 percent said Iraq and 21 percent said terrorism .
A new Public Policy Polling report shows Obama 's newfound leads in North Carolina , Virginia and Florida result from gains among white voters .
“ Even as Obama continues to trail by a good amount with whites overall in these states , he ’s winning with them on the issue foremost on voters ’ minds this year , ” the report concluded .
“ There ’s not much doubt the economy is the main factor causing whites who voted Republican for president in 2004 to go Democratic this year .
That is the single biggest factor driving his lead in the polls across the country right now . ”
Only 7 percent of voters today are satisfied with the direction of the country , the lowest number in Gallup ’s history .
The reason , Gallup repeatedly notes , is the economy .
A new report by the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research found that in 13 battleground states , rural voters — nine in 10 of whom are white — were split , with 46 percent backing Obama and 45 percent McCain .
In September these voters favored McCain by 10 points .
The report found that Obama ’s “ improvement is driven by rising voter concerns over the economy in the aftermath of the collapse on Wall Street . ”
A recent analysis by Gallup of some 40,000 interviews found that Obama 's lead over McCain “ has risen proportionately when the percentage of Americans who are negative about the U.S. economy increases . ”
McCain maintains large advantages over Obama with white voters on issues ranging from instituting a “ wise foreign policy ” to “ defending the nation ” to “ dealing with immigration . ”
But all of these issues , which have tended to draw whites toward the Republican party , have been eclipsed amongst voter concerns by the market dives .
Pew recently found that 35 percent of whites said they are “ most concerned about the financial markets ” specifically , compared with 17 percent of blacks .
Eight - six percent of white Democrats now support Obama , roughly equal to what John F. Kerry earned in 2004 .
Until the economic crisis began , that number had been in the 70s , on par with Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Clinton in 1992 .
More than eight in 10 white working - class Democrats now back Obama , roughly a 20 - percentage - point rise compared with the week before the Democratic convention .
Obama also splits white independents with McCain , with 46 percent backing each candidate , a performance unseen by a Democrat since Clinton in 1996 .
In the past week , Obama ’s support has slightly waned with independent white working - class men , the largest group of independents .
But he has gained with women in the same bloc .
Until the market collapse , Obama was narrowly losing white Catholics .
He 's now opened up a 54 percent to 39 percent lead , according to Pew .
While Obama ’s support among whites under age 30 has long been stronger than recent Democratic nominees , he 's now within single digits among white voters age 50 to 64 as well as seniors , according to Pew .
It remains to be seen if Obama 's polling numbers among whites translate into support within the privacy of the election booth .
About one in five voters say they “ personally ” know someone who will “ not vote for Obama because he is black . ”
But the economy , in Belcher 's view , has mitigated even the role of race .
“ We are seeing race being trumped by economic concerns and overall changes in the direction of the country in a fundamental way , ” he said .
“ That is perhaps pushing aside , for the first time in our cultural history , race as a debilitating obstacle . ”
Yesterday I posted a story about a family in San Jose who donated $ 30,000 — correction , over $ 60,000 total — to support Yes on Proposition 8 .
I hesitate to make this a daily Mormon rant , but here goes .
Fred Kager , who runs the Californians Against Hate website which provides a detailed ( and publicly available ) list of contributers who support Proposition 8 , revealed today that Mormons have donated a staggering 18.6 million to deny same - sex couples the right to marry .
That ’s 77 % of all total documented donations .
Mormons also account for 88 % of all individual money raised .
Mormons , instructed by their leaders in Salt Lake City Utah , are leading the charge to take away the rights of same - sex couples , both here in California and Arizona .
How do we fight this ?
How do we shed light on this , without looking religiously intolerant ?
At this point , do I really f*@cking care ?
It also astounds me that the campaign to defeat Proposition 8 only has only amassed 30,000 donors out of an estimated 1 million LGBT Californians .
And many of them are our straight allies .
Is marriage just not that important to our community ?
Do n’t they realize that if we let them strip away this one right , it gives them license to strip away all the rights we ’ve worked so hard for and now enjoy ?
( at least here in California )
I ’m angry with the Mormon church for muscling their way into California politics in an attempt to steal away our rights and invalidate my marriage to my partner of 8 years .
And I am angry with the members of my community , who wo n’t stand up to them .
Everyone needs to donate time , or donate money today .
Put down the cosmopolitan .
Skip the gym at least for a day .
Reschedule that facial ( lord knows I ’ve done all of these things ) .
And please make a difference .
Getting married may not matter to you now my LGBT friends , but trust me , it will .

3 adopting energy efficient school and infrastructure repairs .
In total , Obama ’s $ 25 billion investment will result in 1 million jobs created or saved , while helping to turn our economy around .

Partner with America ’s automakers to help save jobs and ensure that the next generation of clean vehicles is built in the United States .
Senator Obama pushed for $ 50 billion in loan guarantees to help the auto industry retool , develop new battery technologies and produce the next generation of fuel efficient cars here in America .
Congress passed only half of this amount – it is critical that the administration speeds up the implementation of the first half and that Congress move q uickly to increase certainty by enacting the second half .
In addition , Obama believes that with the tremendous uncertainty facing the auto industry , and the small and medium business suppliers who depend on them , it is critical that we keep all options on the table for helping them weather the financial crisis .
2. IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR STRUGGLING FAMILIES
Even when the overall economy was growing , most American families were not sharing in this growth .
The typical non-elderly household saw its income decline by more than $ 2,000 from 2000 to 2007 as expenses skyrocketed .
Weekly wages , adjusted for inflation , are now lower than they were a decade ago .
Barack Obama ’s overall economic plan will relieve the squeeze on families and foster bottom - up growth .
But he is proposing that we implement several measures immediately :

A tax cut for 95 percent of workers and their families – plus seniors .
Barack Obama proposes a permanent tax cut of $ 500 for workers and $ 1,000 for families .
A first round of these tax cuts could be mailed out quickly by the IRS based on tax returns already filed for tax year 2007 .
In addition , Obama would extend these expedited tax credits to senior citizens who are retired as a down payment on his plan to eliminate taxes for all seniors making up to $ 50,000 .

Extend unemployment insurance benefits and temporarily suspend taxes on these benefits .
Millions of Americans are looking for work but unable to find it in the weak economy .
Today , more than one in five unemployed workers has been out of work for more than half a year – the highest level since early 2005 .
Obama supported extending unemployment insurance this summer , but already 800,000 jobless workers have exhausted those benefits and are being left without any unemployment compensation .
Obama believes Congress should immediately extend unemployment insurance for an additional 13 weeks to he lp families that are being hit hardest by this do wnturn .
In addition Barack Obama believes that we should temporarily suspend taxes on unemployment insurance benefits as a way of giving more relief to families .

Children ’s toys used to be very simple , quite easy to play with , not at all noisy , and often prohibitively expensive – meaning many kids had to do without .
Times have changed , and now any scrawny necked , lanky legged individual of an underdeveloped social nature , can pound parents into submission to obtain a legitimate weapons superiority .
Lets take another look at some of the candidates of this tactical arsenal – this list , of course , follows on from our Top 10 Toys Parents Dread .
10 Kids Karaoke Machines
A recent addition to our list , nothing hits the spot more than a 7 - year - old screeching out half the words to a Cheeky Girls or Britney Spears number – perhaps only with the exception of four 7 - year - olds trying to do the same thing ‘ in harmony ’ .
House parties have never been so much fun , especially when you can close the patio doors behind you , and walk several hundred miles in the opposite direction .
9 Bangers
A small firework made illegal in most parts of the world .
Popular in the 1950 ’s and 60’s , the banger was the staple implement of torture for many boys who wished to make a huge impact on society .
Generally , the banger was used to inflict fear , trauma , and – as a best - case scenario – a severe cardiac arrest on victims of a sensitive disposition .
8 Play Makeup
By looping the words – “ Get that off your face ! ” onto a cassette , it is technically possible to save over 200 hours worth of mental and vocal stress caused as a result of abusing these substances .
As the term ‘ wo n’t be seen dead wearing that !’ does n’t appear to affect the young , many displays of tragically disheveling art can often be seen on the faces of the innocent .
7 Paint
Many parents have learned to patiently applaud the appalling efforts of their offspring when it comes to painted art ; much of which finding it ’s way to the sides of fridge - freezers everywhere .
Paint runs – as fast as it can – into clothing , rugs , doors and pets , and scientific experts have calculated that a single sheet of blank A4 paper typically needs to be surrounded by 8 square miles of yesterdays newspapers to save the carpet receiving the traditional Sunday afternoon makeover .
6 Stickers
Aside from the sheer volume of children ’s magazines which pile up under the beds of pre-teens , by far the worst side effect of this type of behavior is often the infamy of the included stickers .
Many wardrobes have suffered in recent years under the sheer weight of stickers festooned over their exteriors .
Nothing escapes the tyranny of the sticker , and to date , no blend of bio - hazardous toxin chemicals have proven effective at removing their blight on humanity .
5 Nursery Rhyme Players
When Mums and Dads are busy , they may inadvertently place their faith in musical toys to satisfy the hungry minds of their immediate descendants .
Unfortunately , this is counter - productive , and leads to a condition doctors have known for years as ‘ loosing one ’s rag ’ .
If taking out frustrations on inanimate objects is your kind of heaven , please send in your address and you will receive your just deserts .
4 Voice ‘ Learners ’
Learning the alphabet or the numbers using an annoying female voice has been around for centuries , but if your mother - in - law is busy , try to avoid using one of these machines at all costs .
Listen ; as an endless series of discordant jingles , similes and phonics are played repeatedly by the delicate touch of a child ’s whole hand over all the buttons .
3 Musical Instruments
Use successfully by the CIA since the turn of the century , nothing works more effectively and damagingly on human levels of tolerance than a 12 - year - old playing the violin , a 4 - year - old playing a miniature drum kit , or a 9 - year - old blowing into a recorder ( or flute ) .
Scientists in Russia have termed parental exposure to this kind of treatment ‘ neurological meltdown ’ or ‘ cranium critical mass ’ , and victims have often resorted to quite drastic feats of human strength in order ensure these kinds of instruments are never capable of playing ‘ music ’ ever again .
2 Play Doh
What can you do with play doh that you ca n’t do with plasticine or real dough ?
Experts were baffled for weeks when set this question during the late 20th century .
That was until one man dejectedly pushed the material into a salt shaker and it ‘ looked a bit like hair ’ .
Since then , millions of children of all ages have sat this same simple test ; all of whom failed to come up with anything at all .
The legend of play doh was born .
1 Lego
Where is the best place to find Lego ?
In the vacuum cleaner of course !
This was the winning entry of many in this competition ; runners up include – on the stairs , between the cracks in the patio , in the bathtub , and of course , in beds .
There are several ways in which Lego has taken the crown of ‘ the most annoying toy ’ .
First of all because Lego is so easy to consume , many ‘ consumers ’ have found their Lego products have made it all the way down the toilet and into the sea – where they continue to annoy sea life in the same way .
Secondly , because Lego is so small , adult fingers can often loose their ability to manipulate the material ; similar to trying to pick up a coin using a bunch of bananas .
Many triumphs of model engineering have been crushed under - foot , under car tires , under bottoms , and between fingers – sometimes sending lethal Lego shrapnel in all directions at once .
Avoid .
Sony did n't have a terrific second quarter .
If the electronics / entertainment conglomerate ran a milk business , its cartons would read thusly : " Have you seen me ?
90.1 per cent of our Q2 profits . "
The cash abduction was n't unexpected , however .
Sony gave warning earlier this month that global economic woes were deflating stock , increasing price competition , and making the Yen stronger against the US dollar and the euro .
Total operating income for the July - September quarter was ¥ 11bn , compared to ¥ 111.6 bn the same period last year .
Sales and revenue decreased 0.5 per cent year - over - year to ¥ 2,072.3bn in 2008 from ¥ 2,083bn in 2007 .
Games
Video games continue to be Sony 's checkbook hero – that is , revenue actually increased by a fair amount .
But if you 're looking for actual , tangible cash here , the princess is in another castle .
Giant enemy hardware costs
Total revenue increased 10.3 per cent compared to same quarter last year , thanks to increased sales of Playstation 3 and PSP consoles .
But Sony 's game segment still operates at a loss thanks to – yes – increased sales of PS3 consoles .
Trouble is , Sony sells the PS3 at a loss .
Nothing terribly unusual about it .
That 's really just the nature of the beast until later in a console 's life cycle .
Sales and revenue was ¥ 268.5 bn , compared to ¥ 243.4 year - over - year .
Operating loss was ¥ 39.5bn , a fair improvement over losing ¥ 96.7bn during the same period last year .
Sony is already cutting PS3 hardware costs , which contributed significantly to the improvement in the game segment 's ( still negative ) income .
Sony also reports strong PS3 software sales and PSP hardware sales helped too .
PS3 units sold worldwide in Q2 was 2.43 million , an increase of 1.12 million units year - over - year .
PSP units sold was 3.18 million , increasing by 0.6 million year - over - year .
PS2 unit sales predictably continue to fall , this time by 0.78 million units compared to last year to 2.5 million units sold total .
PS3 software sales increased to 21.1 million , although Sony 's total software sales dropped over last year due to decreased PSP and PS2 software sales .
Electronics
Revenue decreased by 0.6 per cent year - over - year to ¥ 1,653.3bn despite higher sales of BRAVIA LCD televisions , VAIO PCs , and cheaper consumer cameras .
Sony blames the drop on a strong Yen against the US dollar .
Operating income decreased 40.5 per cent year - over - year to ¥ 75.6 m .
Profitability took its beating from " severe competition " and lower prices for VAIO PCs and decreased sales in Handycam video cameras and Cybershot digital cameras .
Pictures
Second quarter sales increased 3.4 per cent year - over - year to ¥ 196.1 bn .
Sony credits the boffo box office performance of Hancock .
But let 's be fair here , Sony did n't have a similar theatrical release in Q2 2007 .
Other notable releases for sales were Step Brothers and Pineapple Express .</
p
Operating income was ¥ 11bn , up 199.9 per cent from just ¥ 3.7 in Q2 2007 .
Again , there were n't any big releases at the time .
Music
Sales at Sony BMG Music Entertainment dropped by 11 per cent to $ 762 m in Q2 ( it tracks music sales in US dollars ) .
Sony claims it 's largely due to the timing of new releases , combined with the growth in digital music sales not keeping up with declining sales of physical music .
Net income was a loss of $ 57 m , compared to a loss of $ 8 m in the same period last year .
Sony says completing the deal of buying Bertelsmann 's half of Sony BMG cost about $ 600 m . ®
About four years ago , much of the world was shocked when three controversial historians were seized and imprisoned by " anti-hate " thought police .
Holocaust reductionists Ernst Zundel , Germar Rudolph , and David Irving all served jail time for the " speech crime " of suggesting the total number of Jewish dead in World War II might not be six million or necessarily caused by gas chambers .
On October 1 , well - known historian Dr. Frederick Toben , an Australian , was seized for the same " crime " at London 's Heathrow airport .
He is now being held and will probably be deported to Germany .
There , he faces almost certain conviction and imprisonment .
How will we respond to this latest assault on the free speech liberties of us all ?
There is not much time to answer that question .
Toben 's bail hearing is October 10 .
His final hearing is October 17 .
If he is delivered to German authorities , there is virtually no hope for his freedom .
Every American , especially Christians , should protest this outrageous attack on freedom of speech .
Although most Americans do not think like Dr. Toben , his arrest is just a taste of what will come - for Americans like you and your family - if we do not defend freedom now .
International Hate Crime Enforcement Toben 's case is a terrifying precedent .
He did not commit a crime in Germany , so why is he being deported ?
A European Union ( EU ) warrant says that because his writings have traveled by internet into Germany , he violated German speech laws !
This means an international warrant may be served against a person because his " internet presence " is everywhere .
England does not yet forbid questioning the numbers and methods of the Holocaust , but it is cooperating with the EU .
It claims it is treaty - bound to deliver anyone EU requests .
Tobin 's arrest is also an ominous precedent because he faces deportation and trial for the " crime " of anti-Semitism .
Anti-Semitism is loosely ( and falsely ) defined by society and even modern dictionaries as criticism of Jews or matters Jewish .
( See , < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/whatsantisemitism.html>What is Anti-Semitism ? )
Jewish watchdog groups such as the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) use it as a smear term to silence opposition .
Now , incredibly , governments of Europe wield it as a basis for arrest , deportation , and imprisonment .
Germany : History of Twisted Hate Laws Dr. Toben was seized for exercising free speech and free thought because of a dark agenda .
After the Third Reich collapsed in 1945 , Jewish activists saddled post - WWII Germany with thought crime laws so stringent that anyone who doubted the 6 - million figure - even an overheard Australian tourist - could be arrested and jailed .
This happened to Dr. Toben in Germany in 1999 ; he spent seven months in prison for expressing his views to German citizens .
Israel 's Knesset continues to ponder legislation that would empower Israel to demand deportation to Israel for trial of anyone who publicly doubts the 6 - million figure .
The ultimate objective of ADL - inspired hate and thought crime laws is to make " anti-Semitism " an internationally indictable offense .
( Watch , < http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7217700265038533779>Hate
Laws : Making Criminals of Christians )
Their goal is to internationally enforce the definition of " anti-Semitism " now held by the US State Dept . 's Office of Global Anti-Semitism .
According to this definition , the New Testament 's claim that Jewish leaders killed Christ is anti-Semitic !
Unthinkably , this puts a hate crime noose around tens of millions of Bible - believing Christians .
( See , < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/usgovcondemns.htm>US Government Condemns ' Unintentional ' Anti-Semitism ) Are Christians " Domestic Terrorists " ?
Ernst Zundel was deported to Germany by Canada on the charge of being a " domestic terrorist " because he questioned establishment history about the Holocaust .
Sen . Edward Kennedy , ADL , and now the FBI allege that " hate crimes " are a form of domestic terrorism .
( See , < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/fbirisinghatelawgestapo.htm>FBI: Rising Hate Law Gestapo ? )
In Canada , it 's a hate crime to publicly allege Jews had Christ killed ; it is punishable by at least a $ 5000 fine , with imprisonment for repeat offense .
In the US , Bible - believing Christians , considered anti-Semitic by our own government , could similarly become " hate criminals . "
The next step is to also be labeled domestic terrorists under Homeland Security and its ADL - sympathic Jewish czar , Michael Chertoff .
Thus the net is slowly tightened by ADL and international " anti-hate " laws to bind Christians , thought / hate crimes , terrorism and anti-Semitism into one despised package .
This will help fulfill Christ 's prophecy concerning
His church in the last days : " And you shall be hated by all men for my name 's sake . "
( Luke 21:17 ) Hate Crimes Tribunal in Jerusalem Already in Israel a revived Sanhedrin aspires to become an international legal body capable of such prosecutions .
This Sanhedrin was founded in 2004 under the predominant leadership of Rabbi Moshe Halberstam , " a man steeped in the secrets of the Kabbalah . "
( See , < http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php/Sanhedrin_Initiative> " The Sanhedrin Initiative " )
It is now led by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz , world - renowned Kabbalist and Talmudic scholar .
Recently this Sanhedrin issued court judgments supporting proliferation of Israel 's illegal settlements in the West Bank , opposing war between Israel and Iran , and against Israel 's participation in the Chinese Olympics .
Convening " as an international court of law , " its 71 judges condemned China 's murder of dissident athletes and citizens and profit from medical sale of their body parts .
Considering itself " sovereign " over Chinese objections , it exhorted China to submit itself to Talmudic Noahide laws , which forbid such behavior .
( See , < http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3569675,00.html> " Sanhedrin Against Beijing Olympics " )
The Sanhedrin wants power as an international court like the UN or International Criminal Court .
Its ambition is to preside over the whole earth and judge " according to the laws of the Torah " ( Talmud ) .
( See , < http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php/The_Nascent_Sanhedrin> " The Nascent Sanhedrin " )
Embodying this sense of prerogative , Israeli Knesset member Rafi Eitan recently suggested that Israel might kidnap Iran 's president and bring him to trial in the Hague as a war criminal .
( See , < http://www.jewishharrisburg.org/page.aspx?id=183625> " Israeli minister :
It 's OK to kidnap Ahmadinejad " )
If the Sanhedrin 's international authority is realized , trial would take place not in the Hague but in Jerusalem .
There , the Sanhedrin will attempt to enforce Jewish - created hate laws and Talmudic Noahide law worldwide .
Talmudic laws mandate capital punishment for " idolaters . "
( Sanhedrin 55a , b , 57a ) ( See , < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/comingjewishutopia.html>Coming Jewish ' Utopia ' Ruled by Noahide Laws )
According to the Talmud , this includes Christians who affirm an idolatrous " three in one " conception of God and worship the " false prophet " Jesus .
The Talmud says Jesus now languishes in hell , writhing in boiling semen ( Gittin 56 b ) and His followers deserve death ( Abodah Zarah 26 b : Sanhedrin 58a , b ) .
Why Protest ?
Why should American Christians protest the arrest of Dr. Toben and the violation of international law to which ADL hate laws aspire ?
Dr. Toben 's arrest paves the road toward eventual mass indictment of Christians .
The Bible says Christians will be ruthlessly persecuted someday , with deportations to Israel .
Jesus prophesied of His followers that someday evil Jews " shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into the prisons " ( Luke 21:12 ) That day will come sooner if assaults on freedom , such as Dr. Toben 's arrest , are uncontested .
At first they came for the racists , but I was not a racist .
Then they came for the Holocaust questioners , but I never questioned anything I was told about the Holocaust .
Then they came for bigoted , homophobic Christians , but I was " tolerant " of the gay lifestyle .
Then they came for " anti-Semitic " Christians who believed the Jews killed Christ .
But I believe we all killed Christ .
Finally , they padlocked all churches , liberal and evangelical , burned our Bibles , and took us away .
No one was left who would hear our cries .

Ecstasy could be downgraded to a class B drug
Government advisers will investigate whether Ecstasy should be downgraded to a class B drug
Ecstasy could be downgraded to a class B drug after government advisers meet next week .
The Home Office 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) will seek evidence from experts before deciding whether to recommend reclassifying the dance drug .
One of the council 's most senior figures has already indicated his support for the move .
It would follow a 2006 report by the Commons science and technology committee which recommended urgent action for a downgrade review .
The committee 's view is based on a Police Foundation inquiry in 2000 which found toxicity levels were several thousand times less dangerous than heroin and involved less than 10 deaths a year .
The inquiry heard evidence from experts , including former Medical Research Council chief Colin Blakemore , who said Ecstasy was 'at the bottom of the scale of harm ' .
Other experts including incoming ACMD chairman Professor David Nutt agreed that alcohol and tobacco were more dangerous .
Ecstasy is the third most popular illicit drug in the UK .
According to The Guardian , government advisers will hold a special evidence session next Friday to hear the latest findings on the drug 's neuropsychological effects and its toxicity .
The ACMD is not expected to produce a final report until next year .
However , any move to downgrade the drug is expected to be blocked by government ministers .
Drugs minister Vernon Coaker said he believed the drug should remain a class A but would consider the ACMD recommendation .
Sarah Palin is in Toledo ,
Ohio this morning talking about energy policy – and taking up all the major news networks .
Who gives a policy speech 6 days out from an election ?
Talking about energy independence is n’t going to win over Ohio .
And how often does the VP nominee make policy speeches ?
Note the podium – this is a policy speech , no doubt about it .
What ’s really at work here ?
Well , when the circular firing squad has set up in your camp , the smart ones start to look to the next election .
Sarah Palin may be saying “ we ” and “ our administration ” but it ’s clear that this is the first speech of Sarah ’s 2012 run .
NOTE FROM JOHN : Oh she means “ our administration ” all right – her administration in 2012 .
If you add up all the things that Ron Paul believes are unconstitutional , there would literally be no reason to have a government at all :

Hall ’s life reads like a spy movie .
She worked for America ’s first spy agency , the Office of Strategic Services , during WWII .
Virginia organized spy networks , assisted escaped prisoners of war , and provided essential information to help us win the war .
She had to stay one step ahead of the Nazis , who desperately wanted to capture her .
For her cunning and courage , she was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross — the only civilian woman in America to be so honored .
After WWII , Virginia joined the CIA .
She continued to work on secret operations , one of only a few women at the time to do so , until she retired in 1966 .
And she did it all despite having a prosthetic leg , which she named Cuthbert .
In 2002 Westside High School in Los Angeles paid $ 13,000 for a sushi robot .
Who knew robots could make sushi ?
Anyone for a Terminator roll ?
The school faculty had hoped to give the students healthier lunches .
Instead , the sushi robot went completely unused .
The sushi robot was recently discovered hiding in a storeroom .
No wonder the economy is a mess , with schools wasting our taxpayer ’s money .
Hopefully the school will now use it as part of their culinary arts program .
This begs the question , who makes better sushi , humans or robots ?

There was a terrific duo playing live music at the farmer ’s market the other day .
They were well - rehearsed , enthusiastic and really good .
Being a patron of the arts , I bought a CD .
I hated it .
I ’ve thought a lot about what turned me off , and I think it ’s the curve above .
Faced with the excitement of making a CD and all the knobs and dials , they overproduced the record .
They went from being two real guys playing authentic music , live and for free , and became a multi- tracked quartet in search of a professional sound .
And they ended up in the dead zone .
Not enough gloss to be slick , too much to be real .
This happens at restaurants all the time .
Give me a handmade huarache and it ’s fine if it ’s on a paper plate .
Or give me something from Thomas Keller .
But I have no patience for the stuff in the dead zone , the items that are too slick to be real , but not slick enough to be a marvel .
Who , exactly , wants an industrial tuna sandwich wrapped in plastic wrap ?
You can send me a hand - written note ( but do n’t write it in crayon with words spelled wrong ) and I ’ll read it .
And you can send me a beautifully typeset Fedex package .
But if you send me mass - produced junk with a dot matrix printer , out it goes .
The dead zone again .
That ’s why really well done HTML email works , as does unique , hand - typed text email .
It ’s the banal stuff in the middle that people do n’t read .
And yet , 95 % of what I see is precisely in the dead spot of the middle zone .
The Blair Witch Project and Pi both felt authentic .
The Matrix was perfectly slick .
The new Star Wars cartoon is just dumb .
That ’s why a personalized letter works better than a generic resume .
We crave handmade authenticity and we adore perfectly professional slickness .

Somehow it took more than twenty years to honor a man who saved us all .
If you were alive on September 26 , 1983 , when I was 12 years old , you almost did n’t make it through the day .
If you are too young to have lived that day , you were almost never born .
Accounts vary , as the facts of historical events often become jumbled over the years .
What we believe we know for fact , if there is such a thing in history , is that there was a man in a bunker whose inaction saved the world from a full scale nuclear war .
His name is Stanislav Petrov , he was a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Air Defence Forces .
The Soviets , whose scientists were considered extremely honorable and elite human beings , had recently put into place a new system to detect missile launches — first strike type missile launches .
The system was largely untested , but with the arms race constantly escalating during the paranoid time of the Cold War , there was n’t always time for second guessing .
The Soviet Union and the United States were both desperately keen on keeping the upper hand — as well as maintaining the sickening notion of “ mutually assured destruction . ”
MAD .
The most appropriate acronym ever in all of history .
Lieutenant Petrov was in a bunker monitoring for what every Soviet feared : a US first strike .
To his surprise , it happened .
A missile .
Another .
More .
A total , according to some accounts , of five nuclear warheads were dashing toward the Soviet Union .
There were protocols to follow .
There were buttons to push .
There were launch officers to alert — the only appropriate response to a US first strike was full scale retaliation .
As hundreds of Soviet missiles filled the air , the US would have countered with everything it had .
The survivors would be the unlucky ones .

10.15 pm . This is Obama 's sucker - punch .
" Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran . "
Ouch .
Pow .
Oof .
Nothing aloof about that right hook .
10.11 pm . " We will kill bin Laden .
We will crush al Qaeda . "
This is a Democratic candidate .
Can you remember the last one who used rhetoric like that on national security ?
10.07 pm. McCain 's response on the surge and genocide was a good one .
I 'm not sure that the surge has solved anything rather than simply freezing the civil war in place , but he has a decent moral point on this .
But Obama 's measured mix of moral concern with pragmatic alliance - building was very strong .
It 's really a return to Niebuhrian realism .
10.02 pm .
It would have been a strong moment for McCain when he cited " no on the job training " in the White House .
And then he picked Palin !
She can't even hold a press conference and he thinks she can be trusted with national security at a moment 's notice .
It makes no sense .
9.59 pm . On CNN , Obama has reached the maximum with women voters a few times and literally could n't go up any further .
The gender gap is very powerful in these debate insta-reax polls at least .
Even Palin ran well behind with women .
9.56 pm. Mandates ?
I thought I sat through countless debates with Hillary when Obama was opposed to mandates , while Hillary was in favor of them .
His response about his mother was very powerful .
9.55 pm . Hair transplants ?
Where on earth did that come from ?
9.54 pm. McCain : " Obama will find you . "
He 's treating him like the Boogeyman .
People know he is n't .
So it just makes McCain look paranoid .
9.51 pm . Why is McCain wandering around the stage while Obama is talking ?
It 's weird .
He looks like an old man pacing aimlessly .
And he does n't look at Obama while Obama talks the way Obama looks at him when McCain talks .
This is not that important but I do n't think it helps McCain .
9.49 pm . Two flashes from McCain so far : " that one , " referring to Obama , and citing Obama 's " secret . "
Nasty , uncivil and not even effective .
9.48 pm . The format : I 'm surprised because frankly , I think this format is helping Obama , especially since it emphasizes movement .
And Obama is physically very fluent .
McCain sadly is n't .
9.42 pm . I like McCain on social security .
The old pre-Rove McCain was someone I loved .
But I can't trust him on this any more after this campaign , I 'm afraid .
Alas : " have a commission " is a little lame as an answer .
9.41 pm. Obama got a little muddled on taxes there .
9.38 pm. Memo to McCain : do n't talk about Herbert Hoover .
The Abraham Simpson problem .
9.33 pm. Obama 's response on the question of sacrifice of citizens was out of the park .
He was able to ask for sacrifice without seeming like a scold or a doom - monger .
That 's tough .
And his insistence that he too favors off - shore drilling and reveres military service and wants others to shoulder the burden now uniquely born by the military was exactly right .
This is overwhelmingly now in Obama 's favor .
" We may know a lot of what was going on prior to the killing , but I , for one , am not going to say any more , " he said .
TDS Telecom , a telco with 3,500 employees and a presence in 30 states , is suing the town of Monticello , Minnesota , for trying to put in a fiber optic network of its own .
Why would a company try to prevent a town from building itself a faster network ?
TDS tells us that it 's really just looking out for the taxpayer ( and its own infrastructure investment ) .
Not satisfied with the current DSL and cable offerings , Monticello hatched an ambitious plan to wire up its entire town with fiber , build an interconnect station , and allow ISPs to link up to the site and offer Internet access over the city - maintained fiber links .
After a vote on the measure passed overwhelmingly last year , Monticello moved to break ground and was promptly sued by the local telephone provider , Bridgewater , a unit of TDS .
We 've already covered the legal filings in that case ( which is ongoing ) , but were also interested in hearing from TDS .
Fiber backers see the lawsuit and a recent announcement to install a TDS - built fiber network in town as strategy designed largely to prevent the Monticello experiment from being repeated across Minnesota ( " See , you 'll get sued , and neither of us wants that !
Also , we 're already building fiber networks , so no need to do it yourselves !
Please stop thinking about it ! " ) .
But TDS insists it 's in the right .
Andrew Petersen , the director of legislative and public relations for the company , told Ars in an e-mail that the company 's " first " reason for filing the lawsuit was because such projects have failed in other communities and " we 're hoping to prevent the citizens of Monticello from becoming the shareholders of a $ 25 million tax burden . "
Second on the list was the company 's desire to " protect our corporate assets and investments in Monticello , " and TDS believes that the city has crossed legal lines in starting the project .
When I spoke to Petersen by phone , he stressed that TDS was committed to its local communities ; when it heard the voice of the people , it took action .
Just as the city prepared to begin digging in May , TDS announced that it would wire Monticello for fiber and would do it by the end of the year .
Given that the city had embarked on a multiyear process , at significant expense , to investigate and then approve such a project , why did TDS wait until all that time and energy had been invested in the idea before suing ?
Petersen says it 's because TDS did n't yet know that people really wanted fiber ; once the referendum was a success , the company moved quickly to give people what it now knew they wanted .
I asked Petersen to speak more generally about his company 's objection to the city 's plan , which would have kept the network open for hookups to any private ISP that wanted to provide service .
But Petersen says that 's not an attractive offer ; a company like TDS really wants to own ( and control ) its own network so that it 's certain of the network architecture and can address last - mile complaints from subscribers .
Municipalities are better at " streets and snowplowing , " Petersen says , than at highly technical network design and maintenance .
TDS has nine crews in town right now to build the 100 - mile network ; 20 + miles have already been laid .
Meanwhile , the city has hardly been pleased with the entire process , and seems determined to pursue its original plan .
While the main residential buildout is on hold during the court case , Monticello broke ground last week on a smaller fiber ring and an interconnection point for the network .
This more limited project will link local government facilities .
In an August proposal , the city had asked TDS to partner on the work .
While both entities were building their own networks , it hardly made sense to do the most expensive , most labor intensive work twice — tearing up the ground , inserting ducting , and running fiber .
TDS said no , alleging that such cooperation could be anticompetitive , though it did offer free fiber links to all government buildings and redundant fiber links to schools ( which are already served by a state system ) .
So the parallel fiber buildout goes on apace even as the parallel legal teams battle it out in a Minnesota courtroom .
Such battles are being fought around the country , and most boil down to the limits of municipal services in each state .
Has broadband become a utility service , so indispensable to the public that a city should at least have the right to offer it to everyone who pays taxes ?
Christopher Mitchell , who works for the Institute for Local Self - Reliance and has been heavily involved in the Monticello fiber issue , argued in a piece for the local paper on July 31 that broadband is a utility and that local communities should be involved in providing it .
" TDS , a phone company headquartered in Madison , has filed a complaint with the laughable charge that the fiber network is neither a ' utility ' nor ' public convenience , ' " he wrote .
" Minnesota ’s legislature has explicitly listed telecommunications and ' cable television and related services ' in its definition of public utilities .
Everyone who has ever used the Internet knows it is a public convenience .
" TDS cannot win this case , but it can stall Fibernet Monticello 's start - up to buy time for its own hasty upgrades and attempts to lock subscribers into long - term contracts .
The City must stand strong during these trying times .
The landslide network referendum was not merely about having a faster network .
It was about a faster network featuring local services and accountability to the community . "
TDS , for its part , says the fiber build out shows its own accountability to the community , and Petersen argues that TDS is n't some unaccountable , much - loathed corporation .
It has " extremely high customer satisfaction in all of our markets , " he says .

The US government is funding research into using LED lighting as data network access points .
Room or street lamps would link with devices using visible light , carrying data beyond over existing power lines .
" This is a unique opportunity to create a transcendent technology that not only enables energy - efficient lighting , but also creates the next generation of secure wireless communications , " said Prof Thomas Little of Boston Uni .
" As we switch from incandescent and compact florescent lighting to LEDs in the coming years , we can simultaneously build a faster and more secure communications infrastructure at a modest cost along with new and unexpected applications . "
The initiative is known as the Smart Lighting Engineering Research Centre , and will be carried forward at Boston University , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of New Mexico .
The US National Science Foundation is providing $ 18.5 m in funding .
Little and his colleagues envisage affordable devices which would replace existing lamps and light fittings , usually requiring only the already - present power lines for backhaul .
Devices equipped with visible - light ports not unlike IrDA kit would have a data connection whenever such a lamp was in line of sight .
The data would be transmitted by the same LEDs which provided white - light illumination , flickering like tremendously fast signal lamps .
The data flicker would be imperceptible to humans .
As visible light does n't penetrate walls or travel round corners , the developers say that the system would be more secure than present - day WiFi , and would avoid the problem of multiple radio networks competing for bandwidth .
Furthermore , the much higher frequency of visible light compared to radio waves would mean there was much more wireless bandwidth to use .
Meanwhile , the lighting function of the LED access devices would also save useful amounts of power for users , being much more efficient than existing filament or even fluorescent bulbs and tubes .
The Smart Lighting advocates reckon that their kit could become truly ubiquitous , present in almost every place there is a light today - on cars and in streets as well as inside buildings .
" The era of hyperconnectivity is upon us , " commented Inder Monga , network - research chief at Nortel .
" This visible light - based networking ... with its energy efficient qualities , privacy and its ubiquitous nature is very exciting . "

Guns a blazin ' , the McCain folks have had it .
They 're pretty much having a Greg Focker " meltdown on the plane " moment .
They 're not saying , " I 've had it with the checking - of - the bags conversation . "
But they are saying , " We 've had it with the vetting - of - the - Sarah Palin conversation . "
Steve Schmidt , aka " the bullet , " aka McCain head honcho , sent Politico an email this morning saying no more .
" This vetting controversy is a faux media scandal designed to destroy the first female Republican nominee for vice president of the United States who has never been a part of the old boys ' network that has come to dominate the news establishment in this country ...
The McCain campaign will have no further comment about our long and thorough process .
This nonsense is over . "
Not only did they say ' talk to the hand ' on the vetting issue , they launched a new :30 commercial that is not exactly a Christmas card from Wasila .
It 's a comparison ad starring the new almost - vice - presidential nominee .
Comparison ads are standard .
What 's not so standard is who Palin is taking on .
Forget Biden .
They 're going for Palin versus Obama , mano - a- mano .
The ad – creatively called " Alaska Maverick " – brags about Palin 's accomplishments in bringing about reform while standing up to special interest groups .
" While Barack Obama talks about change , Governor Sarah Palin has actually done it , " said the release announcing the new spot .
The spot goes :
The Journal ( as in Wall Street ) says : Governor Palin 's credentials as an agent of reform exceed Barack Obama's .
They 're right .
She has a record of bi-partisan reform .
He 's the Senate 's most liberal .
She took on the oil producers .
He gave big oil billions in subsidies and giveaways .
She 's earned a reputation as a reformer .
His reputation ?
Empty words .
Watch the ad yourself here :
Let 's add up the extraordinary announcements this morning .
1 ) Taxpayers are injecting £ 37bn of capital into just three banks , RBS , HBOS and Lloyds - with RBS and HBOS taking £ 31.5 bn of that ( this is nationalisation Jim , though perhaps not precisely as we know it ) ;
2 ) RBS and Lloyds TSB / HBOS have promised to the government that they 'll maintain mortgage lending and small - business lending at 2007 levels - which is massively more than they are currently lending ( this is hugely significant - given that a shortage of credit is to a large extent behind the economy 's deceleration into recession levels ) ;
3 ) Lloyds TSB is paying less to buy HBOS than it originally announced , to reflect the disclosure that HBOS 's problems are rather worse than it thought just a couple of weeks ago ;
4 ) Barclays is raising £ 10bn from selling new shares and securities to private - sector investors , abandoning its dividend for the second half of this year , and taking other actions ;
5 ) So total capital raising today , including fairly modest amounts being raised from private sources by the UK businesses of HSBC and Santander , is nudging £ 50bn ( wow ) ;
6 ) The Bank of England and other central banks have announced they are lending as many dollars as are needed by banks ( phew ) ;
7 ) Eurozone governments are today fleshing out their plans to inject capital into their own banks and to guarantee lending between banks ( double phew ) ;
8 ) Stock markets and money markets are in slightly better shape this morning - which is something of a relief , because if they can't be buoyed by so much taxpayers ' money being chucked at the banks , then we would be in rather more serious trouble than I feared .
Scientists from the University of Colorado , Boulder , and the United States Geological Survey have provided Dot Earth with a closeup view of the remarkable rate of erosion along parts of Alaska ’s thawing Arctic Ocean coast .
The video clip below is one month of crumbling , from late June through late July this year , at a point east of Barrow , the northernmost community in the United States .
It ’s clear that simple thawing is much more of an influence than wave action at this spot .
Several influences are speeding the land loss , according to Cameron Wobus , a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the university ’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences .
He answers a few questions below :
Q . Any idea how this rate of land loss compares to the long - term trend ?
A . There are only a couple of studies documenting long - term trends in coastal erosion rates in this chunk of Arctic .
Both of them suggest that rates have been increasing in recent decades .
Mars and Housenecht at U.S.G.S. in a 2007 Geology paper looked at Landsat imagery that suggested that erosion rates between 1985 - 2005 were about twice the rates documented between 1955 - 1985 ; more recently Ben Jones at U.S.G.S. has suggested in a paper in review that rates over just the past decade are faster and more uniform than historical rates .
But certainly the 20 + meters / year we ’ve seen over the past couple years cannot have been sustained too far into the past .
Q. What are biggest contributors ?
A . We ’re still in the midst of quantifying the relative roles of thermal vs. mechanical ( i.e. , wave ) energy in driving that you ’ve now seen , it ’s clear that simple melting away at the base of the bluffs followed by topple - failure is a major contributor .
But in imagery we ’ve obtained for the latter part of the summer , it ’s also clear that episodic storm events can do a lot of damage , as well .
We were stymied this summer in our attempts to deploy wave sensors offshore to document the wave energy inputs because ( ironically ) the sea ice along the northern N.P.R.A. coastline actually hung around long enough that we could n’t get out in our Zodiac to deploy them .
Q . Are other areas GAINING land through sediment accretion ?
( That silt has to go somewhere … )
A. I should emphasize that we ’ve so far been focusing only on this ice - rich , silty section of coastline .
In this particular environment , it does n’t look like there are strong negative feedbacks on erosion rates because the material appears to be simply too fine - grained and ice - rich to be redeposited locally and form barriers , bars , etc .
However , there is some indication from previous work that there are parts of the Beaufort coast where more sandy material is being redeposited by long - shore currents .
Next summer we plan to focus our field work on a more sandy section of coastline to try to understand the dynamics there .
Crop breeders have harnessed polyploidy to increase fruit and flower size , and confer stress tolerance traits .
Using a Brachypodium model system , researchers have sought to learn the origins , evolution and development of plant polyploids .
The work recently appeared in Nature Communications .
High quality genomes of the five major cotton lineages have been assembled by a multi-institutional team and are available for comparative analysis on JGI ’s plant data portal Phytozome .
“ The goal has been for all this new cotton work , and even the original cotton project was to try to bring in molecular methods of breeding into cotton , ” said JGI Plant Program head Jeremy Schmutz .

BBC News , Washington
Illinois congressman Rahm Emanuel will be chief of staff .
Although Barack Obama will not take office until 20 January 2009 , he is already moving to fill the key posts in his administration .
With the US economy still in crisis , and US troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , he is expected to act quickly to fill national security and economic posts .
He is also likely to reach out to Republicans and independents to attempt to build a centrist administration .
ECONOMIC TEAM
The selection of the next treasury secretary will arguably be the most important appointment for the president - elect .
POSSIBLE KEY APPOINTMENTS
Treasury : Larry Summers , Paul Volker , or Timothy Geithner State : Chuck Hagel or John Kerry Defence : Robert Gates Chief of staff : Rahm Emanuel Chief advisor : David Axelrod
Whoever fills the post will have almost unlimited authority to spend the $ 700bn allocated by Congress to help avert a financial meltdown .
Among the top contenders for the job of secretary of the Treasury are Larry Summers , Timothy Geithner , and Paul Volker .
Larry Summers was treasury secretary under President Clinton and more recently president of Harvard University .
He is known for his outspoken views which have sometimes landed him in trouble , but his international experience would be a plus in dealing with a global crisis .
Lawrence Summers was Treasury Secretary under President Clinton Paul Volker would be a less partisan choice .
He was chairman of the Federal Reserve in the l980s , he clashed with Ronald Reagan and his supply - side economics philosophy of tax cuts .
Timothy Geithner is the head of the New York branch of Federal Reserve , which has been deeply involved in the recent series of financial bail - outs .
He is also a former Clinton administration treasury official .
If President - elect Obama wanted to reach into Wall Street , the traditional place to find treasury secretaries , he might call on New Jersey governor and former senator , Jon Corzine .
Mr Corzine was a former boss of Goldman Sachs , like his successor Hank Paulson , the current treasury secretary .
Wall Street Another Wall Street possibility would be Jamie Dimon , chief executive of JP Morgan Chase , one of the few banks to survive the sub - prime crisis relatively unscathed .
Lower down , Mr Obama is likely to retain Jason Furman , his chief economic advisor , as head of the National Economic Council .
Mr Furman , a protege of former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , is known as a budget deficit hawk and a strong supporter of free trade .
And there are reports that he will name Penny Pritzker , the billionaire Chicago business tycoon who was head of his campaign finance organisation , as commerce secretary .
Overall , the range of choices suggest that Mr Obama will be governing from the centre , with people with experience in dealing with the financial crisis at the top of his list .
However , he may attempt to reward his support from the trade unions by appointing Andy Stern of SEIU as labour secretary .
Mr Stern was an early supporter of Mr Obama when other trade unions backed Hillary Clinton .
Another possibility would be former Democratic House leader Richard Gephardt , who has strong union links .
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
There is speculation that President - elect Obama will want to ensure a bi-partisan approach to foreign policy by appointing prominent Republicans to key positions .
Robert Gates was a former director of the CIA .
This could involve reappointing Robert Gates as defence secretary to help ensure a smooth transition during a time of war .
Alternatively , the president - elect might want to reach out to two moderate Republican Senators , Richard Lugar of Indiana or Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , who retired this year , and appoint one of them as Secretary of State .
Both were sceptical of the Bush administration 's approach to the Iraq war .
Mr Lugar has also played a prominent role in anti-proliferation efforts .
If he appoints a Democrat , the 2004 presidential candidate , Senator John Kerry , or New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , a former energy secretary , appear to be on the short list .
As national security advisor , Mr Obama might appoint Jim Steinberg , a former Clinton official who now works at the Brookings Institution , or Dennis Ross , Mr Clinton 's Middle East envoy .
Susan Rice , who was one of Mr Obama 's key foreign policy advisor , is reportedly being considered for the post of UN ambassador .
It is not clear whether Samantha Power , the Harvard professor who has written on the US response to genocide , will play a role in the new administration .
She resigned as an advisor in March after calling Mrs Clinton a monster .
However , Mr Obama may want to acknowledge the importance of the global justice movement in his coalition by choosing someone beyond the " realists " who make up the majority of his foreign policy team .
OTHER CABINET APPOINTMENTS
Mr Obama is believed to be keen to encourage diversity in his first cabinet , and may also want to include some Democratic governors from Republican states to emphasise his appeal for national unity .
Among the top contenders are two women governors : Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano , who may be under consideration at the Department of Justice , and Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius , an early supporter of Mr Obama , as head of Health and Human Services .
Also in the running is former Governor Tom Vilsack of Iowa , who may be agriculture secretary .
And Mr Obama may want to find a role for former Democratic Senate leader Tom Daschle , who lost his seat in 2004 , who has excellent Congressional connections .
But there is unlikely to be a role for Colin Powell , Mr Bush 's first secretary of state who backed Mr Obama in the election .
PERSONAL STAFF
For press secretary the president - elect may call on Robert Gibbs , a campaign aide whose combination of a jolly personal style and steely on - message discipline impressed reporters .
Mr Obama 's chief of staff will be Rahm Emanuel , the tough Chicago congressman who is a major political operative .
And his campaign strategist David Axelrod , the architect of his election victory , has also accepted the job of senior White House adviser - a post previously held by Karl Rove .

Fearsome Creatures
They 're creepy and they 're kooky , mysterious and spooky .
But Halloween 's creepiest creature customs did n't appear out of thin air , not even the ghosts .
Many of them once instilled real fear in medieval towns , when folklore reigned supreme and getting freaked out came easy .
Here we offer up some real science and history of the scary stars of Oct. 31 .
Jack - o'- Lanterns
A standout among freaks and monsters , the nutritious pumpkin may be Halloween 's most famous symbol .
The practice of carving and lighting the gourd is a Celtic custom brought to America by Irish immigrants , who used the more - plentiful turnip back home .
Glowing , frightening faces emanating from the pumpkins were meant to frighten off the evil spirits thought to roam the streets on Oct. 31 , the Celtic New Year 's Eve . [ In Images : Peculiar Halloween Pumpkins ]
Bats
They 're blind , they hang out in caves and they inspire masked crusaders .
But how did bats become associated with Halloween ?
The winged mammals can thank vampires for that .
Like their Draculian counterparts , a small number of bat species actually subsist on animal blood - vampire bats have been known to attack humans on occasion - using sharp teeth to cut into the sleeping victim .
Their nocturnal ways and connection to Ozzy Osbourne probably do n't help either .

Gargoyles
They 're one way to add a little freaky je ne sais quoi to otherwise lovely architecture .
But gargoyles , those frightening stone monsters protruding from cathedrals worldwide , do actually have a function .
They were incorporated into gothic stonework as early as the 13th - century to keep rain water off cathedral roofs , their mouths serving as the ejector spout .
More spiritually , gargoyles were supposed to protect the congregation from the ever - present evil forces lurking outside .
Killing two birds with one stone , so to speak .
Goblins
Made famous in fairy tales , the small and furry goblin is more mischievous than menacing .
Legend tells of goblins hiding out in forests , pulling pranks and sometimes switching human babies for their own changeling spawn .
Unlike some of the other creatures mentioned here and probably because of their disconnect from religion , goblins never quite crossed the threshold from the imaginary to cause real panic in medieval towns .
[ Related : The Science of Fairy Tales ]
Witches
Forget the pointy black hat and warty nose .
Those popular associations are relatively recent compared with the long and often tragic history of witches across the globe .
In the past , witches were thought to possess magical powers connected with the natural world .
Like all pagans , they were demonized as heretics by the Christian church , a hunt that reached its apex in medieval Europe and 17th - century America .
Good luck picking them out of a crowd today : witch costumes frequently top the list at Halloween . [ 13 Halloween Superstitions & Traditions Explained ]
Zombies
Kings of the b-movie industry , zombies are individuals who 've either had their souls sucked from their bodies or been revived from the dead through black magic .
Zombie culture stems from the voodoo religion of Haiti , where it is still believed that people can fall into mindless trances just like the walking dead we 've seen on film ( minus the missing limbs and snacking on human flesh ) .
An ethnobotanist investigating the claims in Haiti found a toxic drug that could actually induce a zombie - style catatonic state .

Ghosts
Do you believe in ghosts ?

Poke two eye holes in a bed sheet and you 've got the easiest Halloween costume around .
Becoming a real ghost is a bit more complicated .
First you have to die , maybe tragically , then leave part of your soul hanging around earth to spook relatives and haunt houses .
From a supposedly scientific angle , parapsychologists argue that energy - including what 's in the body - can never be completely destroyed .
Society seems to agree : various studies peg belief in ghosts at about 50 percent .
[ Countdown : Top 10 Most Famous Ghosts ]
Werewolves
Typically normal and well - mannered until a full moon kicks in , werewolves are cursed shapeshifters that have appeared in the legend set of nearly every culture going back to ancient Greece .
Like witches , they were hunted in medieval times and blamed for community murders that could n't be explained otherwise .
Though the violent werewolf stories of old seem to have fallen off the radar , except in Hollywood , there remains an excessive body - hair disorder lovingly nicknamed " the werewolf disease . "
Vampires
They vant to suck your blood , and have for quite some time .
Vampires have popped up in cultural folklore for thousands of years , though the fanged - and - coiffed version we know comes from the 18th and 19th - century myths of Eastern Europe .
There , it was believed that someone who was born with deformities or died an irregular death could , after burial , rise again to terrorize the living .
Vampires were considered " undead " and needed to feast on human blood to remain so .
Demons
One of those all - encompassing terms for an " evil spirit , " a demon can represent anything from a malevolent ghost or fallen angel to a puppet of Satan .
Like the notion of evil itself , they have ancient origins and appear in folklore and literature across the world .
The demon that possessed Linda Blair in " The Exorcist " is probably pop culture 's most famous and most talented , with levitation capability , rotating head and amazing , life - like spewing action !

In addition , speculators who think a financial firm will fail can buy credit - default swaps .
They will profit if they are right .
But even if the firm is not in trouble , an increase in the price of those swaps may scare other investors , and send the company ’s stock down .
That prospect has alarmed the S.E.C .
As the political debate was growing , the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , a trade group , reported that the amount of outstanding credit - default swaps declined in the first half of 2008 , something that had never happened before .
The 12 percent decline , to $ 54.6 trillion , still left the market vastly larger than the total amount of debt that can be insured .
The huge total reflects the way the market is structured , as well as the fact that someone does not need to actually be owed money by a company to be able to buy a credit - default swap .
In that case , the buyer is betting that the company will go broke .
Within that huge market , many contracts offset one another  assuming that all parties honor their commitments .
But if one major firm goes broke , the effect could snowball as others are unable to meet their commitments .
In regulated futures markets , contracts are centrally cleared .
If you buy an oil futures contract on Monday , and sell it on Wednesday , you have made your profit ( or taken your loss ) and you no longer have any stake in whether oil prices rise or fall .
But if you buy a credit - default swap on Monday from one firm , and sell an identical swap on Wednesday to another firm , you still face the potential of risk if the party that sold the swap to you is unable to pay when a default occurs , perhaps years later .
“ One of the major reasons that the government helped out in the Bear Stearns situation , ” Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. testified at a Senate hearing this week , “ was to avoid throwing it into bankruptcy with all the credit - default swaps . ”
Imagine meeting some friends at your local brewpub or coffee shop .
The talk turns to the war .
You criticize the President and his wealthy supporters .
Next thing you know , a couple of husky fellows at the next table grab you , hustle you out the door and down to the local police station .
You are arrested on a charge of sedition .
Within months you are indicted , tried and convicted .
The judge sentences you to 5 - 10 years in prison -- and off you go !
Think this could never happen ?
Well , it did , and not that long ago -- during World War I -- to scores of ordinary people in Montana .
They discovered very painfully that their free speech rights had been stripped away by the state legislature .
This site is about the 76 men and three women convicted of sedition in Montana in 1918 and 1919 .
The law they ran afoul of was possibly the harshest anti-speech law passed by any state in the history of the United States .
Forty of those men -- and one woman -- were locked up in the state penitentiary in Deer Lodge , sentenced to up to 20 years .
They were sent there for simply expressing their opinions about President Wilson , about America 's entry into World War I , about the armed forces , or about the flag .
One man was sentenced to 7 - 20 years for saying the wartime food regulations were a " big joke . "
The language these people were convicted for was often harsh and crude .
Some were contemptuous or disrespectful of the government or scornful of its war effort .
Many spoke without thinking or under the influence of alcohol .
But their words posed no danger to the government or its war effort .
Yet they received swift justice .
Collectively , they served 65 years in a prison whose warden had a particular hatred for them .
They should not have served a day .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer agreed .
On May 3 , 2006 , he signed a Proclamation of Pardon for 78 persons convicted of sedition in 1918 - 1919 ( one man had been pardoned in 1921 ) .
Here you can read their stories and learn about the conditions that led to this dark period in Montana 's history .
Their loss of liberty was a loss for us all .
In our country , the free exchange of ideas , which necessarily includes unpopular opinions , is at the heart of our democracy , and must be protected .
Only when free utterance is suppressed is it needed , and when it is needed , it is most vital to justice .

4 reasons why this may be the worst crisis since the 1930s � and 4 projections for what�s going to happen The Casey Report Webinar � Casey Research
I identify the foundational forces now driving our economy to establish a basis for the investment recommendations you�ll read in this advisory in the months to come .
The role of the U.S. as the world�s dominant economic superpower is now challenged by an out - of - control growth in debt and a deterioration in its reputation as a financial haven .
The dollar is losing its special status as the global �reserve currency , � is leading , in turn , to higher inflation , higher interest rates , weakening financial assets ( stocks and bonds ) and runaway prices for commodities .
Let the data and let them speak for themselves , with some interpretation along the wa y :
1. U.S. Government Deficits : From Bad to Worse
Government deficits are the root source of the creation of money � and its eventual debasement .
Simply , when the federal government spends more than it raises in taxes , it eventually has to create more money ( in complicity with the Fed ) in order to pay the bills .
Of course , it can borrow the money , but that often includes borrowing newly created money from the Fed .
The deficits remain and they accumulate and in time .
They must be resolved , either by payment or default , either overtly or covertly through the mechanism of inflation .
While some level of government deficits may be acceptable over modest periods of time , the U.S. deficit is now well past the point of being acceptable .
The deficit will soon grow to monster proportions as the baby boomer retirement obligations exceed the ability to tax the declining number of workers contributing to the Social Security and Medicare funds .
Projections of the likely deficit compared to GDP growth make it clear that the government is faced with hard choices .
The easy path of just letting the dollar fall is the most likely .
2. The Expanding U.S. Trade Deficit
It is consumers who primarily receive the money provided by U.S. government deficits .
In this globally interconnected world , they then spend a portion of that money on foreign goods .
An unintended consequence of the ballooning government deficits , therefore , is a large and growing trade deficit .
The foreign recipients of those dollars � whether Chinese manufacturers or Middle Eastern oil sheiks � have , in recent years , turned around and reinvested those dollars in U.S. Treasuries .
They have done so because of the perceived safety of those instruments , and because of the sheer volume of the dollars they have to invest .
In addition , it has been in their commercial interest to help finance the U.S. deficit .
With the trade deficit now running at $ 750 billion per year , and much of that money coming back into U.S. Treasuries , the U.S. government has grown dependent on foreigners to sustain the continuing deficits .
That level of debt would normally cause extreme weakness in a currency � just as it would in the value of debt owed by a deeply indebted individual .
However , the sheer magnitude of the foreign holdings provides something of a bastion against a total collapse in the dollar .
Even so , some foreign holders are easing toward the exits � through the purchase of an operating company or resource deposit here , or a landmark New York building there .
They might make a billion - dollar equity investment in a brand name company , or exchange some dollars for a basket of currencies or a ton or two of gold .
It �s a delicate balancing act , because if they get too aggressive , they risk triggering a mad dash for the exits , a nightmare scenario where the value of their trillions of dollars in holdings would be devastated almost overnight .
3. Rising Oil Prices Affect� Everything
The growing global demand for oil , coming as it is against a backdrop of limits being hit in production growth , is a major contributor to today�s big price rises .
The clear and present danger is that we are now using several times more oil than we are discovering .
The world currently produces about 310 billion barrels of oil per decade .
That amounts to about three times the current discovery rate of 100 billion barrels per decade .
According to the Peak Oil calculations , we have already used about half of the energy stored over the last 100 million years .
Against that , we have a steady increase in demand emanating from population growth and economic development , especially in Asia .
This , coupled with the dearth of major new discoveries , assures that energy markets will remain at high prices , for the foreseeable future .
The current big drop from almost $ 150 to $ 110 has happened from a slowing economy and from some conservation at the extreme high gas pump prices , but the long term view is that the lack of reasonable alternative to petroleum argues for continued higher prices returning to the previous peak in the year ahead .
As energy is a component in the manufacture of all goods and services , this is of no small consequence .
Energy has been the basis of the abundance of our current existence and has allowed human population to grow from 1.5 billion to 6 billion over the last century .
4. War Affects the Deficits and Hurts the Dollar
The war in the Middle East adds unwanted pressure on oil and ratchets up government spending .
Less obvious is the damage to U.S. prestige that is important in the ability of the U.S. to attract much - needed foreign investment .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the war will cost 3 to 4 trillion dollars , an amount of sufficient size that it will affect the U.S. financial system .
Regardless of the short term political ups and downs or even a new administration , the pressures from war for big deficits and for dollar depreciation are inescapable .
Where Is the Economy Going in the Next Six Months ?
Projections
1 . The housing decline is not yet done , because we will need another year to unwind foreclosures in the pipeline .
The housing bubble still has another 10 % to 20 % to go to fully deflate .
2. Consumers in the U.S. are not able to expand credit and are increasingly concerned about the outlook for the economy , so they will slow spending both at home and on imports , which means we are in a recession or about to confirm one .
3 . The financial / banking system is weaker than understood .
The global system and literally trillions of dollars in derivatives has left the world�s banks teetering on the edge .
Don�t jump back into financials .
4 . A slowing economy � recession � coupled with inflation , creates a condition referred to as stagflation , as the simulative bailouts compete with the debt implosion of overleveraged financial institutions and real estate , to leave us with stagnation and still high costs .
The result of this is that the inflation rate , interest rate , food , energy and precious metals are heading higher as the dollar is debased .
Higher rates are not good for housing and stocks .
Finally , it is important to recognize that the world remains in the throes of a deep and serious crisis .
While many analysts will express the view that the worst is over or that , after a modest downturn , things will bounce back just like they always have , our view is that what we will actually witness going forward is a fairly steady erosion of paper currency purchasing power and sluggish economic growth .
The crisis will accelerate , moving faster , even , than in previous major shifts such as that witnessed in the 1970s .
While history may find we are too pessimistic at this point in time , in our view it is far better to prepare for a worsening crisis and hope that it does not materialize , than to expect business as usual .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) -
The late Pope John Paul was wounded by a knife - wielding priest in 1982 , a year after he was shot in St Peter ’s Square , but the injury was kept secret , his former top aide says in a documentary film .
Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz also discloses that when John Paul was unable to pronounce words several days before his death in 2005 , he told his aides that if he could not speak any more the time had come for him to die .
Dziwisz , who is now cardinal of Krakow , Poland , was John Paul ’s private secretary and closest aide for nearly 40 years , including all of his 27 years as pontiff .
The documentary , called “ Testimony ” and narrated by British actor Michael York , is a film version of a memoir published by Dziwisz last year but with some additions .
It will make its official premiere at the Vatican on Thursday night in the presence of Pope Benedict .
On May 12 , 1982 , the pope was visiting the shrine city of Fatima in Portugal to give thanks for surviving a first assassination attempt a year earlier on May 13 , 1981 , when he was shot in St Peter ’s Square by Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca .
A crazed ultra-conservative Spanish priest , Juan Fernandez Krohn , lunged at the pope with a dagger and was knocked to the ground by police and arrested .
The fact that the knife actually reached the pope and cut him was not known until now .
“ I can now reveal that the Holy Father was wounded .
When we got back to the room ( in the Fatima sanctuary complex ) there was blood , ” Dziwisz says in the documentary .
The pope carried on with the trip without disclosing his wound .
Krohn was arrested and served several years in a Portuguese prison before being expelled from the country .
The documentary combines on - camera narration by York , interviews with Dziwisz , historical footage and re-enacted segments of the pope ’s life played out by actors .
It includes video of his last public appearance from his window overlooking St Peter ’s Square , when , debilitated by Parkinson ’s disease and other maladies and overcome with emotion , he did not manage to pronounce any words .
Dziwisz says that when the pope , who had undergone a tracheotomy to help him breathe , was wheeled back into his apartments , he regained some strength and managed to whisper : “ If I ca n’t speak any more , it ’s time for me to go . ”
He died several days later on April 2 , 2005 , aged 84 .
The 66 - year - old York , who acted in Cabaret , Romeo and Juliet and a dozens of other films and television productions , said he felt “ awe ” at being part of a production involving John Paul .
“ He had an extraordinary ability to communicate with people -- I think its called star quality and as a pope he had star quality in abundance , ” he told Reuters in an interview .
The documentary was shot in Rome , the Vatican and the cities in Poland where the John Paul was born and worked as a priest , bishop and cardinal before his election to the papacy in 1978 .

ISLAMABAD ( AFP ) – Asif Ali Zardari secured a large win in Pakistan ’s presidential elections on Saturday , capping a remarkable rise from jail , exile and his wife Benazir Bhutto ’s assassination just nine months ago .
The controversial front - runner swept a poll among lawmakers to become the 14th president in Pakistan ’s short but turbulent history , taking power in the world ’s only nuclear - armed Islamic state and frontline “ war on terror ” ally .
“ It is an historic win .
It is a victory for democracy , ” said Sherry Rehman , the country ’s information minister and a close aide of Bhutto .
“ This man suffered jail for more than 11 years for the sake of democracy and today he is elected as the president of the country and it is a sign of the strengthening of democracy . ”
Zardari secured 281 out of 426 parliamentary votes and won a thumping majority in three of the four provincial assemblies forming the presidential electoral college , officials said .
The 53 - year - old defeated retired chief justice Saeed - uz - Zaman Siddiqui , who was backed by former premier Nawaz Sharif , and Mushahid Hussain , a close aide of Musharraf .
He had been the clear favourite in a three - way race to take power after Pervez Musharraf ’s nearly nine - year rule marked by Islamic militancy and economic turmoil .
Security was tight as secret voting began shortly after 10:00 am ( 0400 GMT ) and ended at 3:00 pm in the two chambers of parliament and four provincial assemblies .
Rampant militancy was underscored in the northwestern city of Peshawar , where voting was taking place , as a suicide car - bomber rammed a police checkpost killing 16 people and wounding more than 80 .
Nearly 1,200 people have been killed in bombings and suicide attacks across Pakistan in the past year , in unrest seen as a backlash by militants angry at former president Musharraf ’s support for the United States .
Tensions rose further this week after a failed assassination attempt on Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani , whose car was hit by sniper fire as it drove to meet him at an airport on Wednesday .
Zardari himself had already moved house due to fears of attempts being made on his life .
His wife was killed in a gun-and - suicide attack at a campaign rally last December .
Voting in Peshawar was briefly interrupted as a 5.6 - magnitude earthquake shook parts of Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan , prompting lawmakers to flee outside .
Musharraf ’s August 18 resignation in the face of impeachment charges triggered the election .
Zardari will now face a series of challenges as president .
Pakistan ’s economy is backsliding with inflation rampant and a volatile political situation contributing to a 40 percent fall on the stock market since January , in a country already reliant on foreign aid .
The election also came amid mounting international concern about the stability of Pakistan which under Musharraf backed the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , and in its subsequent invasion of Afghanistan .
Billions of dollars of aid flowed to Islamabad in return .
However , the American military contends that Pakistan ’s tribal areas have become a safe haven for Al - Qaeda and Taliban militants to use as a launch pad for attacks on international soldiers based across the Afghan border .
As co-chairman of the PPP , Zardari already heads a fragile coalition government which , although still in office , recently lost the backing of Sharif ’s party .
He now gains wide powers including the right to dismiss governments and appoint leaders of the military , which has ruled Pakistan for half of its 61 - year existence .
Zardari , once dubbed “ Mr. Ten Percent , ” has spent a total of 11 years in jail on charges ranging from corruption to murder .
An amnesty signed by Musharraf cleared him of all corruption charges last year .

A Soyuz space capsule carrying two Russian crew and an American space tourist has returned to Earth .
It landed safely in Kazakhstan at 0336GMT , and the crew reported that they were " feeling well " .
On board were Russian cosmonauts Sergei Volkov and Oleg Kononenko , as well as American Richard Garriott .
Mr Garriott , who paid about $ 30 m ( £ 17 m ) for the 10 - day trip , is following in the footsteps of his father , who was a Nasa astronaut in the 1970s .
The flight took a new crew to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Shortly after Soyuz touched down , the crew were extracted from the capsule .
In the family
Garriott had a life - long ambition to go into space
Richard Garriott is a 47 - year - old computer games designer , and a board member and investor in Space Adventures , the firm that has brokered the ISS flights of previous millionaire tourists .
In 1973 , his father , Owen Garriott , spent 60 days on the Skylab station , the United States ' first orbiting space station .
Russian crew member Sergei Volkov also has a family space pedigree .
His cosmonaut father , Alexander , flew long - duration spaceflights to the Russian Salyut 7 and Mir orbiting stations .
The next shuttle mission to the space station launches in November .
Anthropologist John Lukacs shows a 250,000 - year - old " Kabwe skull " from Africa .
The sex is unknown , but this specimen has 15 teeth still intact or partially present .
12 of them have obvious damage from dental cavities .
Women had poor dental health compared to men back in the hunter - gatherer era , and it got worse as societies turned to farming .
Now an anthropologist is pointing to an overlooked explanation — hormonal and dietary changes related to higher pregnancy rates .
Anthropologists usually argue that women 's poor dental health resulted from culture - driven factors , such as cooking duties and the ongoing nibbling that can go along with that .
But that narrow focus may overlook biological factors connected to women bearing more and more children in agricultural societies .
Today , men are more likely than women to suffer from gum disease , possibly because men are more likely to ignore dental care , according to Delta Dental .
Nonetheless , women do not tend to have better oral health than men , for hormonal reasons , according to the American Academy of Periodontology .
New look back
" We deal with skeletons , " said John Lukacs , an anthropologist at the University of Oregon .
" There 's no saliva , no hormonal effects to be detected . "
Lukacs first reviewed studies of both living and prehistoric humans , and found a familiar story across different cultures and nations .
Women suffered more cavities than men as they became adults .
However , both sexes saw a dramatic boost in cavities as societies became agricultural .
" People do generally agree that a shift from hunter - gathering to agriculture includes a cost in terms of health and nutrition , " Lukacs told LiveScience .
" Dietary diversity decreases , and people become reliant on fewer crops . "
He then honed in on clinical evidence of how reproductive biology affects women 's dental health , especially as high estrogen levels trigger certain effects .
For instance , some studies show that women may produce less saliva during pregnancy .
Whatever saliva is produced also can't protect as well against bacteria that produce acid byproducts that eat away at teeth .
Those cravings
Other changes in the body and in dietary cravings may also play a role .
Women crave high - energy , sweet foods during the third trimester of pregnancy , meaning that they risk more cavities .
" Women eat more frequently during pregnancy because of having a smaller stomach , " Lukacs pointed out , calling it an " acid challenge for teeth . "
Lukacs added that cultural explanations favored by anthropologists are not necessarily wrong — he himself swore by them earlier in his career .
But he said that focusing just on those reasons and ignoring the biological changes that accompany increased fertility misses out on the big picture .
" One of the lessons to be learned is that anthropologists have to take a broader , more inclusive perspective on causation , " said Lukacs , whose results are detailed in the October issue of the journal Current Anthropology .

" More bars in more places , " reads the latest slogan from one of the largest mobile carriers in the US .
It 's plastered everywhere , from print ads to billboards to TV commercials .
At least here in the US , it 's pounded into our heads early on that bars = signal level = fewer problems overall .
And it 's kind of true .
Generally speaking , the number of bars being displayed on your cell phone gives a general idea of whether you have a good chance of making a call .
However , there are a number of variables that the phone takes into account when figuring out exactly how many bars to show you in the first place , and in fact , those variables can be ( and often are ) different among cell carriers , manufacturers , or even different devices from the same manufacturer .
Put simply , the number of bars displayed on your phone does not necessarily equal signal level ; rather , it would be more accurate to say that the bars are " correlated " with signal level .
Under most normal circumstances , the fact that bars are somewhat disconnected from signal level does n't really matter .
Most average people tend to use the same handset for years , and as long as it works , they 're not paying attention to whether one particular phone on one particular carrier displays one more bar than another phone on the same or a different carrier .
However , we geeks are not average people ( usually ) .
We pay attention to those tiny details , and we use that information to make judgments on how good or how crappy a phone or a carrier really is .
The topic of bars and signal strength has recently come to a head with the introduction of the iPhone 3G .
Some of you have written into us expressing dissatisfaction with your iPhone 3 G 's number of bars when compared to other handsets you have used , only to discover how to put the phone into field test mode and see that it 's reading the same level of signal that you 're used to .
Others have complained about experiencing dropped calls while having a full set of bars .
As a result , we took a close look at what makes up all the links in the chain that connect signal level with bars , and why bars are not as reliable an indicator as you might think .
Here 's what we found :
Signal , cell towers , and you
Wireless engineers talk about signal strength in terms of power : dBm , or decibels to the milliwatt .
At the very top of a cell tower , signal is transmitted at roughly + 43 d Bm ( 20 watts ) right at the antenna .
However , that power diminishes significantly as you move further away , because the power density of a radio frequency ( RF ) signal in a vacuum follows the inverse square law in free space .
Or , to put it in plain English , every time a signal doubles its distance away from the antenna , its power drops by a factor of four .
However , cell towers do n't really transmit signal in a vacuum .
And , on top of that , it 's being transmitted from an average of 100 to 300 feet above the ground , or 200 ft to 5,000 ft away , as the crow flies to your phone .
Therefore , the problem of dropped power is magnified significantly .
By the time a signal transmitted from the tower hits your cell phone , it will be in the µW ( microwatt ) or nW ( nanowatt ) range .
Since decibels are based on a logarithmic scale ( they merely indicate a change between two numbers ) , the actual power change between 0dBm and 3dBm is a power of two — the same between 3dBm and 6dBm , and so on .
A dBm of zero ( which is next to impossible unless you suddenly find yourself climbing halfway up a tower ) would be one milliwatt of power , and for every 3d Bm going down into the negatives , that power is being cut in half .
So , for example , a dBm of - 3 is about a half a milliwatt , - 6 is a quarter , and so on .
Once you get to - 90dBm , you 've reached the lower threshold of allowable signal level to connect to a tower .
You can see the number of dBm you 're getting by putting your phone into field test mode .
The method for doing this varies by phone and manufacturer , but generally speaking , it 's not difficult to find with a little digging on the Internet .
For the iPhone , for example , entering * 3001 # 12345 # * will let you enter field test mode and see your numerical signal level .
There are a couple of reasons why the user is n't shown these numbers outright , though .
For one , this can fluctuate by seemingly huge amounts with relatively little physical movement , which would cause confusion among users .
This is due , in part , to a phenomenon called multipath signal fading .
A cell tower signal can be reflected by any sort of material that is partially reflective to electromagnetic radiation ( i.e. , inorganic material , like certain types of stone , metal , glass , or water . )
Sometimes , a certain material can absorb a small part of a signal and reflect the rest of it off in another direction ; this reflection means that all these signals are bouncing around and taking different physical paths to your cell phone 's antenna .
Different signals taking different paths means that some take longer paths than others .
Since they all are traveling at the speed of light , multiple signal paths mean that some signals will arrive at your cell phone 's antenna at different times .
These signals interact with each other , canceling some parts of the signal out and amplifying others .
The typical result is that the power density of signals in these multipath environments will fade in and out .
In this respect , a typical urban environment plays hell with RF signals .
But multipath signal fading is n't the only thing that affects your ability to make clear phone calls .
The president elect 's wonkish new chief of staff is former Clinton aide Rahm Emanuel .
On this morning 's This Week With George Stephanopoulos , the media began its love affair with the swarthy Jew by asking him all the softball questions we have come to expect when former Clinton aides chit chat .
Barack 's relationship with the cute little guy began many years earlier .
At a 2005 event hosted by Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy , Emanuel was on the receiving end of a roast from the president - elect .
If we can't make good comedy out of Obama , we can at least be entertained by his jokes .
Click for the video .
The look of love in Rahm 's face as his favorite Democratic rising star keeds around with him is priceless :
Bob Novak jokes just never get old , nor does Obama 's knowledge of Entourage .
Pareene explained the story behind one of the jokes here .
I looked death in the face .
All right , I did n't .
I glimpsed him in a crowd .
I 've been diagnosed with cancer , of a very treatable kind .
I 'm told I have a 95 % chance of survival .
Come to think of it , as a drinking , smoking , saturated - fat hound , my chance of survival has been improved by cancer .
I still cursed God , as we all do when we get bad news and pain .
Not even the most faith - impaired among us shouts : " Damn quantum mechanics ! " , " damn organic chemistry ! " , or " damn chaos and coincidence ! "
I believe in God .
God created the world .
Obviously pain had to be included in God 's plan .
Otherwise we 'd never learn that our actions have consequences .
Our cave - person ancestors , finding fire warm , would conclude that curling up to sleep in the middle of the flames would be even warmer .
Cave bears would dine on roast ancestor , and we'd never get any bad news and pain because we would n't be here .
But God , Sir , in Your manner of teaching us about life 's consequential nature , is n't death a bit ... um ... extreme , pedagogically speaking ?
I know the lesson we 're studying is difficult .
But dying is more homework than I was counting on .
Also , it kind of messes up my vacation planning .
Can we talk after class ?
Maybe if I did something for extra credit ?
Why can't death - if we must have it - be always glorious , as in The Iliad ?
Of course death continues to be so , sometimes , with heroes in Fallujah and Kandahar .
But nowadays , death more often comes drooling on the toilet seat in the nursing home , or bleeding under the crushed roof of a teen - driven SUV , or breathless in a deluxe hotel suite filled with empty drug bottles and a minor public figure whose celebrity expiration date has passed .
I have , of all the inglorious things , a malignant haemorrhoid .
What colour bracelet does one wear for that ?
And what slogan is apropos ?
Perhaps it can be embroidered around the ruffle on a cover for my embarrassing little doughnut buttocks pillow .
Furthermore , I am a logical , sensible , pragmatic Republican , and my diagnosis came just weeks after Teddy Kennedy's .
That he should have cancer of the brain , and I should have cancer of the ass ... well , I 'll say a rosary for him and hope he has a laugh at me .
After all , what would I do , ask God for a more dignified cancer ?
Pancreatic ?
Liver ?
Lung ?
No doubt death is one of those mysterious ways in which God famously works .
Except , on consideration , death is n't mysterious .
Do we really want everyone to be around for ever ?
I 'm thinking about my own family , specifically a certain stepfather I had as a kid .
Then there 's the matter of our debt to death for life as we know it .
I believe in God .
I also believe in evolution .
If death were n't around to " finalise " the Darwinian process , we 'd all still be amoebas .
We 'd eat by surrounding pizzas with our belly flab and have sex by lying on railroad tracks waiting for a train to split us into significant others .
I consider evolution to be more than a scientific theory .
I think it 's a call to God .
God created a free universe .
He could have created any kind of universe
He wanted .
But a universe without freedom would have been static and meaningless - the taxpayer - funded - art - in - public - places universe .
Rather , God created a universe full of cosmic whatchmajiggers and subatomic whosits free to interact .
And interact they did , becoming matter and organic matter and organic matter that replicated itself and life .
And that life was free , as amoral as my cancer cells .
Life forms could exercise freedom to an idiotic extent , growing uncontrolled , thoughtless and greedy to the point that they killed the source of their own fool existence .
But , with the help of death , matter began to learn right from wrong - how to save itself and its ilk , how to nurture , how to love ( or , anyway , how to build a Facebook page ) , and how to know God and His rules .
Death is so important that God visited death upon
His own son , thereby helping us learn right from wrong well enough that we may escape death for ever and live eternally in God 's grace .
( Although this option is not usually open to reporters . )
I 'm not promising that the Pope will back me up about all of the above .
But it 's the best I can do by my poor lights about the subject of mortality and free will .
Thus , the next time I glimpse death ... well , I 'm not going over and introducing myself .
I 'm not giving the grim reaper fist daps .
But I 'll remind myself to try , at least , to thank God for death .
And then I 'll thank God , with all my heart , for whiskey .

Fears had begun to mount with a huge overseas sell - off that began in Asia , where big companies like Toyota , Sony and Samsung all disappointed investors with their earnings and their forecasts .
The Nikkei average in Japan closed down almost 10 percent .
The tide of bad news continued as markets opened in Europe , with Britain reporting that its economy shrank in the third quarter .
The pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar in five years .
European shares recovered some ground in the afternoon , with the losses in Frankfurt and London pared to 5 percent at the close .
The sell - off appeared to be driven by two broad forces .
First , investors are increasingly convinced that the global economy is headed for a long , painful recession .
Second , hedge funds and other investors are being forced to sell their stocks and bonds to pay off investors and lenders .
By the time investors awoke in New York , they learned that Wall Street stock futures had fallen so far  including a 550 - point decline in the Dow  that trading in them had been halted .
A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange had to affirm that it would indeed open for trading .
Everyone was on notice that the market could fall at least 6 percent and perhaps much more .
A few minutes before trading was set to open at the New York Stock Exchange , an unusually large crowd of camera crews and reporters jostled for space in the press gallery to catch glimpses of traders at the opening bell .
It was like a theme - park ride , except with bombs and bodily injuries .
The nation ’s premiere anti-terrorism museum opened in Denver on Tuesday , and somewhere between exhibit malfunctions and violent television panoramas reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange , there was presumably some sort of message .
But it all seemed to be more of an unintended satire on post - 911 culture in the United States than an exhibit sparking an intelligent discourse on terrorism .
The museum ’s lobby was located inside a unremarkable concrete building , and looked like it was inspired by Star Wars .
Yellow neon arrows marked the gray linoleum floor , pointing visitors to the ticket booth .
There were three large television screens placed in a horizontal row , with each screen showing a fluctuating collage of holographic images , most of which were faces of human beings crying or wincing in pain .
This was the first introduction a visitor got to the museum , officially named for the Center for Empowered Living and Learning ( longhand for ‘ The Cell ’ ) , a Denver - based nonprofit organization with the stated mission to educate people about the roots of terrorism and how to stop it .
Next , another display welcomed patrons to The Cell ’s first and only exhibit , called “ Anyone , Anytime , Anywhere : Understanding the Threat of Terrorism . ”
The display included a large pane of cracked glass with an accompanying message warning readers how terrorism “ shatters ” lives and telling them that “ throughout this exhibit you ’ll accompany one of these shattered lives . ”
Sure enough , when visitors purchased their tickets , they were given plastic white “ smart cards ” which carried the real life stories of terrorism victims .
The cards could be scanned at a variety of kiosks throughout the exhibit , with each location revealing a little more about the victims ’ stories and whether they lived or died .
With cards in hand , patrons were told to line up behind a futuristic - looking sliding door with the word “ Terrorism ” printed on it .
Once a staff member pushed a specific button behind the ticket booth , the door opened , ushering visitors into a small room where the walls were lined with 19 television screens in two different sizes .
The doors shut behind , locking the visitors in the room .
A presentation on the history of terrorism started on all of the screens , featuring ominous footage of a diverse array of organizations , ranging from white supremacists in the Ku Klux Klan to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation , a revolutionary group that fights for indigenous rights in Mexico .
Interjected between the images were taped interviews with urbane - looking terrorism experts who speculated on what exactly causes an individual to become radicalized and politically violent .
It would have been easier to pay attention to the 10 - minute presentation if it was n’t so hot in the cramped room .
By the time the program came off the screens , visitors were just happy to escape into a different exhibit room that did n’t make them sweat , and they were able to do so because another door automatically slid open after the presentation ended .
The next room featured various models of terrorist weaponry , including life - size depictions of a suicide bomber vest , a pipe bomb and a roadside explosive device .
Right across from the models was a painted mural with the large heading “ Tools of Terrorism . ”
Around the title were pictures of rocket launchers and AK - 47s blended with more innocuous items like a guitar , a small pocketknife and one of those electronic “ giga pet ” toys that has n’t been seen since the mid-1990s .
This room also featured one of the first card kiosks , introducing patrons to their victims .
The Colorado Independent pulled Yonatan Netanyahu , a Jewish man who had a happy childhood in the United States according to the first communique from the card reader .
Moving into the most climactic portion of the exhibit , visitors walked into another room where they were surrounded by 30 large television screens in the dark .
Again , doors behind visitors shut .
This was supposed to be the coup de grâce of the entire show , the actual simulation of a terrorist attack in Denver .
After a few seconds , the screens turned on and worked in conjunction to create the realistic surroundings of familiar city backdrops like the 16th Street Mall and areas near the Denver Art Museum where The Cell exhibit is located .
For a few moments , visitors could watch a simulated crowd of people on the television screens walk and converse around them .
Then all hell broke loose .
The audience heard a loud explosion , although the audience was probably imagining something more cataclysmic .
All of the screens became snow for a second before they all start to broadcast frequent spats of imagery similar to what first greeted museum visitors .
There are bloody bodies , faces wretched with agony , panicking crowds and the sound of desperate screams , all of it surrounding the visitors , who stand exchanging confused glances in the ricocheting light of the two - minute simulated attack .
Once the lights came on , a new door opened , leading dazed patrons into another exhibit room with a new kiosk .
The victim named Netanyahu was a supporter of Israel and an elite member of the Israel Defense Forces , the machine said .
Along one of the walls was a “ myth and fact ” display game about terrorism .
One plastic panel stated a detail about terrorism , and visitors were supposed to guess if it was true or false before pulling back the panel to reveal the answer .
“ Strong action against terrorist infrastructure will only increase terrorism , ” read one of the panels .
That ’s a myth , according to the exhibit , which claims implementation of “ strong action ” has helped to destabilize terrorists , though the meaning of the term is left ambiguous .
The final room and an exit to the exhibit featured one last kiosk station along with one last big television screen on which Denver mayor John Hickenlooper and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani — financial contributors to the museum — espoused their personal insights into terrorism .
But most patrons just wanted to swipe their cards and find out if their victims made it or not .
That was a problem .
When The Colorado Independent and other visitors tried to use the kiosks , the machines just ended up eating the cards .
Tech support staff with the museum jumped in and tried to fix the problem , offering visitors new cards to scan , but with the diversity in victim stories , it was impossible for most patrons to find out the fate of their initial victim .
If the museum ’s objective was to educate the public about terrorism , the message was completely lost in the hysterical media simulations and paranoid tone of many exhibit displays .
The kiosks were supposed to be able to collect contact details to reach out to visitors who requested more information about stopping terrorism , but that feature was n’t working either .
In the end , it was n’t the fact that The Cell was plagued by technical problems and an incoherent message that made the museum seem more like an entertaining curiosity than a serious depiction of reality and history .
It was the way the museum handled terrorism , painting the issue with an all too simple black - and - white plot of good guys against the bad guys , that made it seem so dated , even to kids who were in high school after the 9/11 attacks happened .
Our prayers each day are for the intentions of our readers , and for all those who visit here this week .
Especially we pray for those whose hearts are hardened against
His grace and loving kindness by greed , fear , and pride .
We pray that they may finally experience the three great gifts of our Lord 's suffering and triumph : repentance , forgiveness , and thankfulness .
And in so doing , obtain the peace that surpasses all understanding , and abundant life .
A HISTORIC TICKET ….
Now that Sarah Palin has been found to have abused her powers , violated state ethics , and lied about it , I did a little digging and found an interesting historical footnote .
The McCain / Palin ticket is the first in American history in which both candidates were found to have violated ethics standards before a national election .
McCain , of course , was admonished by Senate Ethics Committee “ for exercising ‘ poor judgment ’ for intervening ” with federal regulators on behalf of Charles Keating , as part of the infamous Keating Five scandal .
And now McCain ’s running mate has also been found to have violated state ethics laws and abused the powers of her office , as part of the “ Troopergate ” scandal .
The nation has had 102 major - party tickets covering 51 presidential elections over more than two centuries .
And we ’ve never had a ticket in which both candidates on the same ticket were responsible for ethics violations before a national election .
McCain / Palin is the first .
It makes the whole “ reform ” pitch a little more difficult , does n’t it ?

The GAO had warned that there would be some pretty massive e-voting problems this year , as election officials were not properly trained on the already problematic machines , so it should come as little surprise that over in West Virginia , the " early voting " procedures have resulted in numerous complaints that the e-voting machines selected the wrong candidate .
The scenario is depressingly similar to the one that predicted , where the voter selects one name , and the other one shows up as highlighted .
Poll workers told them to just keep clicking until the right one was chosen , and noted that the machines have " just been doing that .
" What 's more depressing is how everyone involved seems to brush this off as no big deal .
Officials claimed that these " were isolated cases and that poll workers fixed the problems so the correct vote was cast . "
That may be true of the two people that CNN spoke too , but who knows if others got the machines to work properly .
And then there 's West Virginia 's Secretary of State , Betty Ireland , who basically pulled a page from Sequoia 's playbook , of covering her eyes and ears and screaming loudly that everything is fine : Because you say so ?
As opposed to those who are actually voting and finding it 's not ?
That 's comforting .
In this case , the machines are supplied by ES&S whose machines ( like both Sequoia and Diebold ) have a relatively long history of screwing up at election time .
ES&S is also the company where an employee of the company showed up here to berate us and insist that no independent experts should be allowed to look at the machines and that they were safe and reliable because those working at these firms knew better than the rest of us .
It 's as if the e-voting companies and the politicians think that if they just keep repeating it , maybe it will become true .

RNC donors include Joe , No Name
One tidbit from the Republican National Committee 's attempt to shame the Obama campaign into more small - donor transparency : Joe Wurzelbacher is a GOP donor , to the tune of $ 100 .
The database does n't includes dates .
One Mr. No Name has also contributed on ten occasions .
( This , I guess , is the downside to transparency . )
Here ’s a partly digested [ … ] version of Obama ’s newly announced administration policies for the War on Terror– which overall will ‘ redouble ’ efforts ( i.e. budgets ) to ensure security , hunt down al qaeda and use ‘ tough diplomacy ’ with Iran

MIRANSHAH , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Suspected U.S. drones fired missiles into a Pakistani village early on Thursday , killing at least seven people , residents and an official said , the latest strike on a stronghold of a veteran Taliban commander .
Tribesmen hold pieces of a missile at the site of a missile attack on the outskirts of Miranshah , near the Afghan border , October 23 , 2008 .

The attack targeted a village in the North Waziristan region near the Afghan border where Jalaluddin Haqqani , an old friend of Osama bin Laden , had established a madrasa or religious school .
Haqqani ’s extended family used to live there .
Residents said three missiles were fired by pilotless drones and one hit the madrasa while the other two hit a house 500 meters away .
“ Eight militants were sleeping in the courtyard of the house .
All of them were killed .
They were local militants , ” a villager standing at the scene of the strike told Reuters on condition he not be identified .
An intelligence agency official said seven people , including militants , were killed .
Twenty - three people , most of them relatives of Haqqani , were killed in a similar attack on the same village in September .
U.S. forces in Afghanistan , frustrated over growing cross - border attacks from the Pakistani side of the border , have carried out about a dozen missile strikes and a commando raid in Pakistan since the beginning of September .
A large number of militants have been killed in the attacks but no senior al Qaeda or Taliban commander has been reported to have been killed .
Pakistan , an important partner in the U.S. - led campaign against militancy , objects to the U.S. strikes on its territory saying they violate its sovereignty and increase support for the militants .
MILITANTS SAID KILLED
Haqqani is a veteran of the U.S. - backed war against the Soviet occupiers in Afghanistan in the 1980s and his extended family had been living in North Waziristan since then .
Haqqani ’s links with bin Laden go back to the late 1980s .
One of Haqqani ’s sons had told Reuters that the elderly commander was in Afghanistan when the village was hit in September .
Taliban sources say Haqqani is in poor health and his son , Sirajuddin , has been leading the Haqqani group .

Separately , Pakistani artillery , backed by helicopter gunships , pounded militant positions in the Bajaur region overnight and early on Thursday , and residents and officials said nine militants were killed .
Bajaur is another militant sanctuary on the Afghan border , to the northeast of Waziristan .
The military says more than 1,000 militants have been killed in Bajaur since it launched an offensive in August but there has been no independent verification of that casualty estimate .
Nuclear - armed Pakistan is grappling with a surge of militant violence and an economic crisis that has raised fears for its stability .
Islamabad is expected to begin talks on a loan program with the International Monetary Fund in the next few days after the government approached the agency for help , having run out of options to rectify its economic crisis .
Pakistan ’s backing for the U.S. - led campaign against militancy is deeply unpopular though the government , led by the party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , has vowed to maintain support and root out terrorism , while offering talks with militants who give up arms .
The country ’s parliament passed a resolution late on Wednesday essentially endorsing the government ’s strategy though it said dialogue must be the highest priority .
1. Uplift health and environment of all family ( the Indian sub continent 's ) members .
2 . For the better economic status of our country ’s rural folk “ provide vision infrastructure ” .
3 . For making our nation wealthiest in the world ; “ create and provide an economic environment ” to our youth aged 13 to 26 years , leveraging their strength of curiosity and exploration .
1 . Wait for unsaved children to come to your door and hurl a bucket full of warm lamb 's blood ( goat or dog blood can be substituted later in the night if you run out ) all over their hair and faces .
Shout -
" I plead the power of the Blood of the Perfect Lamb over you !
Take that !
FOUL DEMON ! "
2. Dress up as the freshly resurrected Christ .
To make your costume as realistic as possible : ( a ) use your mother 's sewing needles to poke holes in your hands and stomach ; ( b ) wear bluish makeup to look like someone who has been dead and lying around in a cave for a couple of days ; and ( c ) stuff five pounds of week - old hamburger meat in your pockets to smell like rotting flesh .
Sneak up behind people , grab them , turn them around , look them in they eyes and scream , " Why have you forsaken me ! "
And then slap them very hard across the face with a palm - full of rancid hamburger meat .
It will usually scare the living Hell out of little children , and they are sure to remember their first experience with Jesus for the rest of their pathetic lives .
3 . Offer to exchange your giant treat bag with the small bag of an unsaved child - when he gets home , surprise !
BIBLES !
4 . Paint your face black , dress up in a flashy suit , and wander around a predominantly colored neighborhood - talking Ebonics into a cell phone about how the Lord Jesus saved you – in a voice loud enough to wake the sleeping winos !
This does n't have to be just for Halloween .
You can try this anytime .
When they ask what you are talking about , simply reply , " Yo , yo , yo wazzup ?
I be off da chain for Jesus !
I be pimpin ' for da playa JC on the fly with mad props . "
Then give them one of those arthritic hand signals the Bloods give their friends , the Crips .
Most likely , they will persecute you for righteousness sake .
5. Vincent Price may have thought he was scary , but nothing touches the Lord when it comes to the gruesome and macabre !
With baby dolls and ketchup , use your front lawn to stage a realistic reenactment of when the Lord got jealous of Samarians worshiping a rival god and ordered that their children be hacked to pieces and their pregnant women experience the Lord 's abortion - by - sword calling card .
( Hosea 13:16 ) .
6 . The only costume you should be wearing is " The Holy Ghost Halloween Costume . "
Jesus makes it quite clear in Matthew Chapter 12:31 that there is one unforgivable sin , and that is blasphemy of the Holy Ghost .
So , remember not to say anything unflattering about yourself while in this costume – or you will instantly damn yourself .
7 . Feed almonds to your Christian family dog for the two months leading up to Satan 's birthday , Halloween .
Follow him around with a pooper scooper .
Carefully place the dog - filth in Almond Joy candy wrappers .
Sealed in plastic , also insert a Bible verse .
At the end of the Bible verse , in very small type , provide a warning not to eat the " candy . "
That way , wicked children who choose candy over the Word of God will get exactly what they deserve !
8 . When trick - or - treaters come to your door , tell them you are no different than the Lord Jesus when it comes to playing host to sinners .
Then , take them into your basement ( where the heater is set as hot as it will go ) and torture them .
9 . One of the best ways to witness on Halloween is by banging on a door , running into the living room and declaring that you will not leave the home of the unsaved until they sit and listen to you read an entire Chick Tract !
Obama spokesman : McCain 's redistribution charge ' desperate , false ' Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008
Print This Email This Facing a rapidly disappearing path to victory in the presidential race , Republicans are using heavily edited , out - of - context quotes from several years ago to claim victory in their last - ditch campaign to smear Barack Obama as a socialist .
During a public affairs show on Chicago Public Radio in 2001 , Obama noted that none of the Supreme Court 's landmark civil rights cases had mandated any " redistribution " of resources to achieve their goals .
As an example he cited Brown v. Board of Education , which mandated equal opportunity education , regardless of race , but left funding decisions to the legislature .
The term " redistributive " came up a couple more times during the hourlong broadcast , which right - wing operatives spliced into a four minute YouTube clip .
Listening to the entire broadcast it is clear that Obama is in no way advocating any sort of radical redistribution of wealth , and he 's following a line of argument that sounds very similar to conservative appeals for judicial restraint and avoidance of legislating from the bench .
That did n't stop the Republican National Committee and the McCain campaign from parroting scores of conservative bloggers claiming that the clip was evidence he harbors some kind of subversive socialist perspective .
Claiming Obama 's support for a progressive tax system that has existed for generations is akin to socialism has been a leitmotif for McCain since " Joe the Plumber " first burst onto the scene .
Obama 's campaign pushed back , with a spokesman decrying the attack as one of the most dishonest yet from a campaign that 's been run almost exclusively on an attack strategy for months .
 This is a fake news controversy drummed up by the all too common alliance of Fox News , the Drudge Report and John McCain , who apparently decided to close out his campaign with the same false , desperate attacks that have failed for months .
In this seven year old interview , Senator Obama did not say that the courts should get into the business of redistributing wealth at all .
Americans know that the real choice in this election is between four more years of Bush - McCain policies that redistribute billions to billionaires and big corporations and Barack Obamas plan to help the middle class by giving tax relief to 95 % of workers and companies that create new jobs here in America .
That s the change we need , and no amount of eleventh - hour distractions from the McCain campaign will change that ,  said Obama - Biden campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
The campaign also pointed reporters to comments from Obama adviser Cass Sunstein explaining his position .
Sunstein argued that Obama is discussing redistribution in a relatively narrow legal context :
The discussion in the 1970s of whether the Supreme Court would create the right to a social safety net -- to things like education and welfare .
He also noted that in the interview , Obama appears to express support for the court 's rejection of that line of argument , saying instead that the civil rights movement should aim for the same goals through legislative action .
" What the critics are missing is that the term ' redistribution ' didnt [ mean ] in the Constitutional context equalized wealth or anything like that .
It meant some positive rights , most prominently the right to education , and also the right to a lawyer , " Sunstein said .
" What hes saying  this is the irony of it  hes basically taking the side of the conservatives then and now against the liberals . "
The edited YouTube video of Obama 's remarks was posted Sunday afternoon and quickly rocketed around the conservative blogosphere .
Fox News did several segments on the interview , and a link to the clip led the Drudge Report for much of the day Monday .
One wonders how long the RNC has been sitting on this little nugget of opposition research , waiting for the perfect opportunity to inject it into the conversation .
Judging by the amount of ground McCain has to make up with just a week until Election Day , the latest smear may be too late .

When you 're too whacked - out for the Ron Paul campaign , you really do have a problem .
Snip from an article about previous victim - hallucination hijinks by Ashley " A Giant Black Man Carved A B Into My Face for Barack " Todd :
In March , Ms. Todd was asked to leave a grass - roots group of Ron Paul supporters in Brazos County , Texas , group leader Dustan Costine said .
He said Ms. Todd posed as a supporter of former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and called the local Republican committee seeking information about its campaign strategies .
" She would call the opposing campaign and pretend she was on their campaign to get information , " Mr. Costine said last night .
" We had to remove her because of the tactics she displayed .
After that we had nothing to do with her . "
About a month earlier , he said , Ms. Todd sent an e-mail to the Ron Paul group saying her tires were slashed and that campaign paraphernalia had been stolen from her car because she supported Mr. Paul .
" She 's the type of person who wants to be recognized , " Mr. Costine said .
Andy Martin is the habitual politician and " researcher " who created the original smear of Barack Obama as a secret Muslim in a 2004 press release , begetting a mutating series of email forwards still coursing through the internet .
Last week , he was featured in a Fox News special that , in the words of the Times , " allowed Mr. Martin to assert falsely and without challenge that Mr. Obama had once trained to overthrow the government . "
But , hey , Martin is n't just worried about Obama and Islam , he 's also deathly afraid of the Jews !
The Times ' Jim Ruttenberg dug into Martin 's anti-Semitisim in this morning 's paper after Martin tried to deny and brush off the issue last week :
When asked Friday about an assertion in his court papers that " Jews , historically and in daily living , act through clans and in wolf pack syndrome , " he said , " That one sort of rings a bell . "
He said he was not anti-Semitic .
" I was trying to show that everybody in the bankruptcy court was Jewish and I was not Jewish , " he said , " and I was being victimized by religious bias . "
Also , in 1993 , Martin told CBS News ' 48 Hours " the record speaks for itself " when asked about a 1983 statement in court papers that " I am able to understand how the Holocaust took place , and with every passing day feel less and less sorry that it did . "
None of Martin 's statements are hugely surprising once you know that the law - school graduate was in 1970 denied entry to the Illinois bar on psychiatric grounds , specifically " moderately severe character defect manifested by well - documented ideation with a paranoid flavor and a grandiose character . "
But , really , would Fox News ' Sean Hannity have barred Martin from his special even if he'd known about that diagnosis ?
It 's practically his own job description !
Google has announced the availability of Chrome 03.154.9 , a beta release that fixes several security bugs and brings several other performance and usability improvements .
Google will deploy the new version through its automated update channel , but users who want to get it now can select the update option from Chrome 's About dialog .
A security vulnerability that enabled malicious web sites to spoof their addresses in popup windows has now been patched .
The bug , which was reported by security researcher Liu Die Yu , could have been used to make phishing schemes look more credible to victims , but there is no evidence that it has been used in the wild .
Google has also changed the behavior of file downloading to help protect users from malware .
When users attempt to download an executable , the browser will display a prompt , warning the user that the program could damage their computer .
In addition to fixing security bugs , the developers also worked on improving the performance and reliability of plugins , such as those used to view PDFs , Flash , and other rich media .
With previous versions , some users experienced problems where the browser would stall or consume 100 percent of the CPU while playing streaming Flash video .
A few other minor bugs have been fixed too , such as proxy performance problems and a bug that prevented users from scrolling with laptop touchpads .
The user interface has undergone some very minor adjustments .
The menus have been streamlined a little bit and the built - in spellcheck feature now supports adding words to the spellcheck dictionary .
The usability failures that we identified in our initial Chrome review , such as lack of support for proper tab overflow , still have n't been fixed yet .
Version 03.154.9 may be primarily a bugfix release , but it demonstrates Google 's commitment to continuing Chrome development , tackling security vulnerabilities , and addressing some of the complaints that have been raised by users .
Chrome 's market share — which reached a peak of 1.7 percent following the initial launch — has fallen to 0.78 percent , according to Net Applications .
This makes it the fourth most popular browser .
It trails behind Safari , which has 6.65 percent , and ranks higher than Opera , which has 0.69 percent .
It 's a different story at Ars .
We took a look at our own server logs to see how Chrome has fared with our audience of technology enthusiasts .
On the day of the launch , the percentage of Ars visitors using Chrome jumped to 13 percent , but over the past seven days ( October 22 - 29 ) it has fallen to 4.61 percent .
Firefox is the most popular browser at Ars , with 55.53 percent market share during the same period .
Safari was our second most popular browser , with 17.22 percent .
IE still lands ahead of Chrome with 16.2 percent , but Chrome beats Opera , which only has 2.66 percent .
Ongoing JavaScript optimization projects have pushed both Firefox and Safari a bit further ahead of Chrome .
The latest release moves Chrome forward , but Google still has a lot of work to do if it wants to catch up on performance and functionality .
For more information about this release , see the release notes .
The Federal Reserve Is Inflating at 341 % per Annum .
( Do n't Look for the Decimal Point . )
October 24 , 2008
I have never seen anything like this .
The adjusted monetary base over the last eight weeks has risen at 341 % per annum .
The increase in the monetary base is $ 300 billion
This indicates panic at the Federal Reserve .
The financial system is coming unglued .
The monetary base is high - powered money .
For every dollar injected here , the money supply can rise by at least 10 to one .
A 10 % reserve requirement is imposed on large urban banks , i.e. , a 10 - to - 1 multiplication factor .
This is the fractional reserve banking process .
This is from the Federal Reserve 's site .
The recession is pushing down the price of commodities .
So far , the new money has gone to banks and financial institutions .
They are not lending to businesses .
They regard businesses as too risky .
This is getting a lot of press .
These articles never mention the obvious : the banks can lend at any time .
They make no money if they do n't .
They can buy Treasury debt .
Central banks do .
So can commercial banks .
This explains why Treasury rates have not increased , despite the increase in the Federal debt .
The Federal government spends every dime it borrows .
This money will flow into the economy by way of Washington .
This money will not be lent to private businesses .
It will not re-capitalize the country .
How can it ?
It is not saved capital .
It is fiat money .
If the banks are not lending at all , the monetary base sits there , ready to be used by the banks .
At the first sign of economic recovery , they will start making loans .
The money multiplication process will take over .
If this expansion of the monetary base does not stop , it will create mass inflation when the banks begin to lend ( assuming they are n't lending to the government now ) .
To stop it later , the FED can sell assets to shrink the monetary base .
Which assets ?
Toxic waste loans ?
Who is going to buy them ?
Who wants toxic waste assets in the any stage of the recovery ?
It can sell Treasury debt , but only until it runs out .
It has a little over $ 450 billion remaining .
If the banks will not lend at all , then the FED is " pushing on a string . "
But why wo n't they lend ?
They are legally allowed to .
Why borrow in the federal funds market if you have legal reserves ?
Yet banks are borrowing in this market .
They borrow because they have no reserves remaining .
Banks can buy Treasury debt , which is liquid .
The debt pays some interest .
Something is better than nothing .
Not to buy Treasury debt is to throw money away .
Banks do not throw money away .
Banks buy Treasury debt ; the government spends it .
Businesses seeking loans find that they must pay higher interest , because the Treasury gets the money .
So , the government 's share of the economy grows .
This reduces productivity .
An economy in a recession needs productivity to get out of the recession .
The fractional reserve process takes over .
The money supply grows .
We can see this happening now .
Here are the latest M1 statistics .
You can see that the figure is headed straight up after years of being flat .
Alert anyone you think should see this .

People can monitor these statistics free of charge on my site .

thanks to the kudos from fellow bloggers as well as from other costumed Halloween lovers at the Boston Pizza Costume Contest I won October 31 .
Therefore , I thought a post on how I made my Bender costume was in order .
homemade Bender costume started off as a hope .
I knew it would be difficult even if I could find the parts I needed .
But more importantly , I knew it was going to be impossible if I could n't find the proper head .
That 's why I started in August .
through a Zellers one afternoon Suz stumbled across a $ 7 plastic garbage can , quite by luck .
I popped the top off and slid it over my head .
It was perfect . working on the body first .
I bought a Quick - tube , or sono - tube , for pouring concrete footings from Home Depot for $ 9 .
I bought the largest one they had , 12 " diameter .
As most people would agree , 12 " is too small , so I split it open .
It was also too tall for my torso , so I cut it almost in half .
It was also too yellow , but that was easy to fix .an angled strip from the bottom half , I wedged it into the backside , where my shiny metal ass would be , and screwed it together from the inside .
I used other small curved bits of leftover tube as the joiners .
The cracks were filled with Polyfilla and I later sanded them smooth .
See Bender 's body here .
glorious amounts of Polyfilla dried , I worked on the footcups .
They were easy .
I bought a pair of plastic salad bowls from the dollar store , flipped them upside down and , using a Dremel , cut feet holes out of them .
I took an old pair of Nike 's and glued the toe to the front of Bender 's footcup .
The glue ( Goop ) was flexible and allowed me to move the shoe around a bit .
Finally , I painted them with grey primer , and attached a flap of grey fabric to cover my black shoes .
on the body , I carefully measured where my arms should go , and using a jigsaw , cut out arm holes in the sides .
The tube would sit on my shoulders , so I attached a couple of spongey rubber pads that were a family heirloom , passed down from my grandpa to my dad , and finally to me .
True story .
inside it I realized I could neither sit nor walk up stairs .
With the jigsaw , I cut a flap in the front , but left it attached in the middle .
Using carpenter 's glue I attached a tab on either side of the flap and glued a pair of attracting neo magnets to each one plus the flap .
The flap could be popped open with my thigh and would slam back down and be held in place by the expensive magnets .
is unique and instantly recognizable .
I knew I had to get it right so I was very careful and spent the most time here .
First , I made the visor where the eyes would go .
I made it from cardboard and added popsicle sticks for strength and a smoothness that bent cardboard is not known for .
I filled in the little gaps with Polyfilla and sanded till it was perfect .
Bender is 30 % iron , but in my case , he was 30 % filler & adhesives .
Using more Goop glue , I sealed the garbage flap in the top of the dome .
Then I filled in the gap with , yep , you got it , more Polyfilla .
I sealed the finished visor to the garbage can and smoothed it with my supreme caulking skills .
I cut the top of a spray - paint can in half - horizontally - and glued it to the top of the garbage can to form the base of Bender 's antenna .
On that I attached a tapered tube of rolled paper .
Finally , I mounted a wooden doll 's head , which I purchased at Michael 's for about $ 1.69 .
was too crazy and unpredictable to cut the mouth out , so I carefully drilled about 40 pilot holes around the mouth perimeter , then cut through them all with a nice blade .
Once I sanded the edges smooth the head was ready for paint .
Again , I used grey primer , as it matches Bender 's colour perfectly .
provided Bender 's eyes .
I used the domes off the packaging of two micro remote control cars , carved them to fit the contour of the garbage can , and spray painted them white .
I painted the inside of the visor black , then glued the eyes in place .
Once dry , I used a black Sharpie to draw his square pupils .
for Bender 's arms & legs was cheap .
I found 1.7 metres of the most perfect grey material at Fabricland for about $ 7 .
I had a friend of Suz 's family sew this fabric onto some cheap clothing I picked up at Value Village for about $ 10 .
She also sewed the most excellent 3 - finger square gloves from the same material .
Here I am trying it on .
area is where I see out .
I used a hot glue gun and attached some sheer fabric that used to hang in our bedroom window .
Suz hated it , so it came down , and this seemed like a great use for it .
I drew Bender 's teeth with a black Sharpie .
Inside the helmet I glued two strips I cut from popsicle sticks .
The first reason was to add strength incase the mouth was poked from the other side , and secondly , to hold a neo magnet in place .was the key to awesomeness .
I glued the magnet 's mate to the end of a big plastic novelty cigar that I picked up at Party Packager 's for 49 cents .
With the magnets , I could put the cigar " in " my mouth whenever I wanted .
It worked flawlessly , and the Boston Pizza patrons agreed with their cheering .
the most elaborate costume , by far , I 've ever attempted .
Total cost was close to $ 100 which included a few extra parts I ruined and had to buy again .
Total labour was about 25 fun and stressful hours .
Everyone but my dad thought I was crazy .
But it all paid off in the end when I won enough money to cover the cost of making it , plus more .
if you ever want to attempt a Bender costume , I hope this helps .
If not , well , you know what you can bite .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking report finds registered voters preferring Barack Obama ( 50 % ) to John McCain ( 43 % ) when asked who they would vote for if the presidential election were held today .
These results , based on Oct. 9-11 polling , represent a narrowing of Obama 's lead over McCain .
Obama led by double - digits for three consecutive days last week , but now his advantage is down to seven percentage points .
Obama has led in each of the last three individual days ' polling , but by less than double - digits each day , suggesting that the race is , in fact , tightening .
Obama has generally held an advantage over McCain since mid-September , when the imminent failure of several large financial institutions made the economy an even bigger concern than it had previously been .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Likely Voter Estimates
Obama 's current advantage is slightly less when estimating the preferences of likely voters , which Gallup will begin reporting on a regular basis between now and the election .
Gallup is providing two likely voter estimates to take into account different turnout scenarios .
The first likely voter model is based on Gallup 's traditional likely voter assumptions , which determine respondents ' likelihood to vote based on how they answer questions about their current voting intention and past voting behavior .
According to this model , Obama 's advantage over McCain is 50 % to 46 % in Oct. 9 - 11 tracking data .
The second likely voter estimate is a variation on the traditional model , but is only based on respondents ' current voting intention .
This model would take into account increased voter registration this year and possibly higher turnout among groups that are traditionally less likely to vote , such as young adults and racial minorities ( Gallup will continue to monitor and report on turnout indicators by subgroup between now and the election ) .
According to this second likely voter model , Obama has a 51 % to 45 % lead over McCain . -- Jeff Jones
( Click here to see how the race currently breaks down by demographic subgroup . )
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 9 - 11 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,783 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on this sample of 2,134 likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on this sample of 2,286 likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
A digital - rights advocacy group is challenging a controversial law that granted immunity to telecom providers that participated in the government 's domestic surveillance program .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) yesterday filed a brief with a federal court in California seeking to overturn the amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which shields companies such as AT&T from lawsuits for disclosing their customers ' communication records to the government .
Lawyers for the group are claiming that the FISA Amendment Act ( FAA ) , signed into law earlier this year , gives the executive branch more power than the U.S. Constitution provides , running counter to the idea of a separation of powers .
Under the law , the U.S. attorney general can intervene to dismiss a lawsuit against a telecom provider by certifying to the court that no law was broken .
The EFF contends that job properly belongs with the judiciary .
" Our constitutional argument is that the Congress and the executive have overstepped their bounds , " Kevin Bankston , a senior attorney with the EFF , told InternetNews.com .
The U.S. District Court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear the challenge on Dec. 2 .
A spokesman for AT&T declined to comment .
The EFF has been at the forefront of the legal opposition to the warrantless wiretapping program .
Along with the American Civil Liberties Union , the group is coordinating litigation in 47 cases involving the government 's surveillance activities .
In the principal case , Hepting vs. AT&T , the EFF is representing AT&T customers seeking an injunction against the surveillance and statutory damages from the telecom giant .
President Bush has defended the program as a necessary weapon in the war on terror , and said that it is subject to periodic review to ensure that it protects Americans ' civil liberties .
Last month , Attorney General Michael Mukasey filed a certification ( PDF ) with the California court calling on the judge to dismiss all civil cases against the communications providers working in concert with government surveillance agencies .
" While confirming the existence of the [ Terrorist Surveillance Program , the administration 's official name for the effort ] , the government has denied the existence of the alleged dragnet collection on the content of plaintiffs ' communications , " Mukasey wrote .
Bankston sees it differently .
" The administration is attempting to sweep under the rug the massive illegality of the program , " he said .
" It does involve a massive content vacuum sucking up millions upon millions of communications from innocent Americans . "
Frustrated with the slow progress of the litigation against the telecoms , the EFF last month filed a lawsuit against the president , vice president , the National Security Agency and other officials and agencies involved with the program .
Bankston said his group will call on the next Congress to repeal the FAA .
The latest movement on the domestic surveillance front follows revelations from two military whistleblowers about excesses in the foreign eavesdropping program .
Adrienne Kinne and David Murfee Faulk , two former military intercept operators , last week told ABC News that they routinely listened to recorded conversations of military personnel , aid workers and other Americans in the Middle East .
Kinne and Faulk said that many of the conversations were salacious in nature , involving phone sex or " pillow talk . "
The whistleblowers described how they would flag these conversations for their coworkers and joke about their contents .
Sen . Jay Rockefeller , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said the charges were " extremely disturbing , " and pledged to launch an investigation .

Pro-Tibet protests grow — why Tibet deserves justice
By Tony Iltis
April 19 , 2008 -- Australian Capital Territory ( ACT ) police have been given enhanced stop - and - search powers for dealing with protests planned for the Canberra leg of the global Olympic torch relay on April 24 .
This comes as protests by the Tibetan diaspora and their supporters have turned the torch ’s world tour into a public relations disaster for the Beijing Olympics .

Tibet protests in Canberra
By Amy McDonell
Created with Admarket 's flickrSLiDR .
In London and Paris , protesters attacked the flame with fire extinguishers and attempted to wrest it from the torch - bearers .
In San Francisco , last - minute route changes meant that direct confrontation was avoided , but activists scaled the Golden Gate Bridge to display banners .
Furthermore , torch - bearer Majora Carter unfurled a small Tibetan flag , causing her to be evicted from the relay ( and handed over to the police ) by the attendants who have been accompanying the torch around the world .
“ Apparently , I ’m not a part of the Olympic torch - bearing entourage anymore ” , she said .
‘ Sacred Flame Protection Unit ’
These attendants flanking the torch are officers of China ’s paramilitary police .
Euphemistically styled the “ Sacred Flame Protection Unit ” , they attracted attention in Paris and London with their snappy blue tracksuits and the zeal with which they carried out their duties .
A British Olympic official privately described them as thugs .
In Canberra , they will not be running alongside the flame , but confined to a bus .
ACT and federal politicians have indicated that local police , armed with their increased powers , will render thugs from overseas unnecessary .
On April 17 , the New Delhi leg of the relay took place , according to the BBC , without incident .
It also took place without an audience , other than a small number of dignitaries plus the 15,000 police and paramilitary forces who sealed off the city centre .
The distance covered by the relay in New Delhi was reduced from 9 km to 2.3 km .
These precautions reflect that India is keen not to alienate China , an important trading partner , but is also home to the world ’s largest Tibetan refugee community , which numbers more than 100,000 and includes the Dalai Lama and his “ government in exile ” .
More than 180 Tibetans were detained trying to breach the security cordon .
On April 16 more than 50 Tibetans were arrested in New Delhi at protests at the Chinese embassy , at the hotel at which the torch was kept and at the airport .
On April 17 Tibetans held an “ alternate ” torch relay elsewhere in Delhi , claiming that legitimising a dictatorial regime was contrary to the intention behind the Olympic torch relay tradition .
Olympic tradition Ironically , the Olympic torch tradition was , in fact , invented for precisely that purpose — by Hitler ’s propagandists for the 1936 Berlin Olympics .
The Beijing Olympics are not an aberration .
Neither were the Berlin games .
Since their inception at the beginning of the 20th century , the Olympics have been controlled by a committee drawn from the world ’s elites and accountable to neither athletes nor the public .
The antithesis of participatory sport , this mass spectator event is most of all about corporate sponsorship and marketing .
The April 16 Asian Times reported that a spokesperson for sponsor Coca - Cola condemned Majora Carter ’s display of the Tibetan flag , saying : “ It ’s unfortunate that Ms Carter used an invitation to participate in the torch relay as a platform to make a personal political statement .
We firmly believe the Olympics are a force for good that celebrate the best in sports , and we are proud to support the Beijing 2008 Olympics . ”
Undeniably , the Olympics are a “ force for good ” when it comes to the profits of the large corporations that sponsor it — something petty concerns over events such as the recent gunning down of more than 100 Tibetans struggling for self determination by Chinese authorities should not be allowed to interfere with .
The Olympics ’ purportedly non-political nature has never stopped tyrants from using them as a platform for self - aggrandisement , but it has been used to silence critics of the status quo .
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) had nothing to say about the massacre of student protesters that formed the backdrop to the 1968 Mexico City games .
However , when two African American athletes at the same games , standing on the podium to receive their medals after the 200 metre race , raised their fists in a “ black power ” salute in support of the civil rights struggle back home , the IOC expelled them from the Olympics .
Massacring protesting students is one thing , but a symbolic , peaceful , public display of anti-racism was a crime the Olympic officials could not be silent in the face of .
While Western politicians and media have expressed the pious hope that hosting the Olympics would improve China ’s human rights record , the opposite has happened .
An Amnesty International report released on April 1 revealed that the approach of the games has led to a crackdown on dissidents in Beijing , many of the victims being housing rights activists protesting against Olympics - related evictions .
Unfortunately , this too is in line with Olympic traditions .
For example , the 1996 Atlanta games were accompanied by laws criminalising homelessness that allowed authorities to remove poor people from run-down inner-city districts , facilitating highly profitable redevelopment .
The 2000 Sydney games were accompanied by the introduction of laws increasing police and security powers , including allowing the army to be deployed against demonstrators .
These laws anticipated the erosion of civil liberties under the “ war on terror ” that began a year later — culminating in the lock - down and “ police state ” - style siege of the city during the APEC summit last year .
Western hypocrisy
The pro-Tibetan protests against the torch relay have provoked counter - protests by Chinese migrants and overseas students in a number of Western cities , with protests occurring in Sydney and Melbourne on April 13 .
These were largely ignored by the Australian media , despite both rallies drawing crowds of 5000 .
Chinese students are planning to converge on Canberra on April 24 to stage a counter - demonstration against the anti-torch relay protests of Tibetans and their supporters .
The size and passion of these mobilisations by Chinese communities in the West reflects anger at Western media bias and hypocrisy .
In an April 7 article posted on Counterpunch.org , Israeli peace activist Uri Avnery contrasts the sympathetic Western media coverage of Tibet ’s struggle ( which he supports ) to that of other nations struggling for self - determination — citing Kurdistan , Western Sahara , the Basque Country , Corsica , Chechnya , Tamil Eelam and Palestine as examples .
He attributes this partly to the fact that China is an economic rival of the West , its regime “ hated … by capitalists because it is a Communist dictatorship , by Communists because it has become capitalist ” , and also that Tibet ’s history as a mysterious Himalayan kingdom has given it a romantic aura .
Indeed , the prominence of Tibet in Western consciousness owes much to the Dalai Lama ’s success in convincing entertainment industry celebrities such as Richard Gere and the Beastie Boys that Tibet was historically a spiritual paradise .
( It was , in fact , a country of impoverished serfs exploited by a theocratic nobility . )
Avnery contrasts this with Muslim nations struggling for self - determination who must contend with the fact that “ in the Western world , Islamophobia now occupies the place that had for centuries been reserved for anti-Semitism ” .
Interestingly , the cause of the Uighurs , whose struggle for self - determination against Beijing — in the face of brutal repression — broadly parallels that of the Tibetans , is largely unreported in the West .
The Uighurs are Muslim .
Self - determination struggle However , it would be wrong to conclude that this Western media bias indicates that the West supports Tibetan independence .
During the Cold War this was the case — the CIA gave support , including military support , to Tibetan independence groups as part of its attempt to undermine the Chinese Revolution .
However , with China reintegrating into the global capitalist economy , it is the destination for a huge amount of Western investment .
China ’s economy is subordinate to Western capital .
Imperialism may play the Tibet card to remind China of its place in the global capitalist hierarchy , but it would be against its interests to dismember China — which has become the industrial estate of global capitalism .
Western economic interests have increasingly penetrated into Tibet itself , which is facilitated by Chinese control of the region — maintained by repression .
Tibetans deserve the right to self - determination because it is a democratic right .
The desire of many Tibetans for independence reflects the fact that after 50 years of Chinese rule , Tibetans are marginalised second - class citizens in their own country .
That the Western media paints Tibetans more favourably than , for instance , Palestinians , does not make either people undeserving of democratic rights .
In fact , the simple , spiritual Tibetan Buddhist and the deranged Arab terrorist are equally racist stereotypes .
Everyone who supports the principles of social justice should support the growing global movement in solidarity with Tibet ’s struggle for self determination .

*** Tibet : The Olympic flame is extinguished in Paris !
Pierre Rousset
By April 8 , 2008 --
Under the pressure of demonstrators coming to defend the rights of the Tibetan people , the passage of the Olympic torch in Paris on April 7 became particularly chaotic .
The Olympic symbol was placed under high protection from 3000 police officers .
But Reporters without Borders could still display enormous black banners in full view , and the protesters ' incursions multiplied , piercing the police lines , to the point that the route of the torch had to be altered , then completely cut short .
The officials finally had to put it out and take it on a bus .
A beautiful spectacle !
In Paris , the Chinese government lost a battle in the communications war around Tibet and human rights .
The French government also lost face somewhat , unable to assure Olympic order in Paris .
Thus , the state secretary in charge of sport ``saw it as a bad blow for France ' ' according to the April 9 Le Monde .
In Beijing , the spokesperson of the Olympic Games organisation committee thundered against ``the blasphemy of Paris ' ' .
Amusing .
The first marijuana law found so far was a 1905 El Paso , Texas law .
It , and most of the other laws in the southwest that followed , was motivated by racial prejudice against Mexican immigrants .
These laws had nothing to do with the actual effects of the marijuana .
In fact , cannabis in the form of hemp was a common crop in many of these states , and tinctures of cannabis were included in hundreds of common medicines .
The purpose of the laws was to discriminate against Mexicans and other racial minorities .
This same purpose is also found in the history of the laws against opiates and cocaine .
The first state law was a 1913 California law that received little notice .
It was promoted by the pharmaceutical industry that saw marijuana as a competitor .
That was followed by a 1914 Utah level that was simply a Mormon religious prohibition enacted into law .
By 1930 , about thirty states had passed laws against marijuana for one reason or another .
In the southwest and south , it was primarily racial prejudice against Mexicans and other racial minorities .
In the northern states it was primarily the fear that heroin addiction would lead to the use of marijuana -- exactly the opposite of the modern marijuana gateway myth .
As far as the people involved , two people get primary credit .
One is Harry Anslinger , who actively promoted Reefer Madness because he knew the marijuana laws were unenforceable .
Therefore , he reasoned that the only possible method was to scare people so bad that they would never touch it .
His plan worked for a while .
The other is Dr. James C. Munch of Temple University .
There were only two doctors who testified for the congressional hearings .
One was the representative of the American Medical Association .
He said that there was no evidence that marijuana was a dangerous drug .
The committee basically told him to shut up and leave .
The other was Dr. James C. Munch .
His sole claim to fame was that he had injected some extract of cannabis directly into the brains of 300 dogs , and two of them had died .
When they asked him what he concluded from that , he said he did n't know .
However , he was the only doctor in the US who agreed that marijuana should be illegal , so his testimony was accepted , and he later became the US Official Expert on Marihuana .
While serving in that capacity , he also testified in court , under oath , that marijuana would make your fangs grow six inches long and drip with blood and , when he tried it , it turned him into a bat .
Anslinger served as director of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930 - 1962 .
Dr. Munch served as US Official Expert on Marihuana from 1938 - 1962 .

Advertisement Cars could soon come with parental controls that limit what younger drivers can do with a vehicle .
Developed by Ford , the MyKey system limits a car 's top speed , how loud its stereo can be and sounds warnings if seatbelts are not being worn .
Ford will introduce the controls on some US makes of car that are due to debut in 2009 but go on sale in 2010 .
The Ford Focus will be the first to have MyKey , but the car maker said it would become a standard feature .
Warning tones
The main element of the MyKey system is to limit the top speed of a car to 80 mph .
Ford says other options allow parents to limit the volume on the car stereo and make the car sound a continuous alert if drivers and passengers are not wearing a seatbelt .
Other options will let parents decide if warning tones should sound if a car goes faster than 45 , 55 or 65 mph .
The car giant said the system built on the ID chips it already used in car keys to hamper car theft .
" It 's making use of existing technology , and through the magic of software , we 're able to build features on top of the features we already have , " sad Jim Buczkowski , Ford 's director of electronic and electrical systems engineering .
Ford 's compact version of the Focus , which is due to go on sale in 2010 , will be the first to sport MyKey .
But a spokesman said it would spread to all cars in the Ford , Lincoln and Mercury range as models are updated .
" Research we 've done has shown that speeding is a major factor in teen crashes , especially novice teen drivers , " Anne McCartt , senior vice president for research at the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , told the AP news agency .
" So I think a system that tries to correct the speeding behaviour has the potential to improve safety , " she added .

The Federal Reserve has kicked off a much - awaited lending program aimed at jump - starting the $ 1.45 trillion commercial - paper market , but investors say it could take days or weeks before short - term financing for U.S. companies loosens up .
Under its new Commercial Paper Funding Facility , the Fed is offering to lend money to highly rated companies for as long as three months .
The goals are to persuade investors to lend to top - tier companies and give borrowers a backstop if funds can't be obtained in the open market .
The program 's impact was muted Monday .
Fewer companies came to market looking for financing than last week , and most were limited to uncomfortably short overnight loans .
Rates rose modestly for debt maturing in 30 days .
" It will be a few more days before we have a good idea on the impact , " said Ira Jersey , interest - rate strategist at Credit Suisse .
The test will be whether rates established in the commercial - paper market are lower than the somewhat punitive rates on the Fed 's loans , which are intended to be a source of financing in emergencies rather than the first stop for companies seeking funds .

Warning to all law students : DO NOT tell a judge it's " your opinion " if you do n't agree with the decision .
Here ’s the state of play as I see it : it is expensive and difficult to borrow and this shows no sign of change ; the US debt is rising instead of falling , propelled by the Iraq War and the reliance on China for material goods unreciprocated by a reliance from China on American goods ; and this adds up to difficult times for business in America for at least three years and possibly longer .
From these premises , it ’s possible to cautiously guess at what the future will hold .
( Bearing in mind that every day brings new revelations about the grim state of world finance , so the crystal ball is murky at best )
First , this recession will be good for innovation because recessions generally are .
During boom times , companies direct development and occupy great talent with at best evolutionary improvements over the state of the art .
Companies are great chasers of new things , but are n’t great at making new things .
A recession means technologists cease to be paid vast amounts to duplicate the work of others .
The Great Tech Bust of Ought Two gave us 37 Signals , Flickr , and del.icio.us and there ’s a strong argument to be made that many companies spent the next six years chasing what they created .
Second , this recession will be great for free and open source because of the shortage of cash .
Last recession saw the mainstream legitimisation of open source operating systems ( youngsters , take note : there was a time when it was n’t automatically okay for an IT department to use Linux ) because it was clear and away the most cost - effective choice .
The saying I use is , “ come for the price , stay for the quality ” .
Perhaps this recession will legitimise many of the applications ( CRM , finance , etc. ) higher up the stack .
( However , I ’m not about to stick my neck out and predict 2009 as The Year of the Linux Desktop )
Third , open source services and cloud computing will benefit from the tight financial situation where conditions will favour opex and not capex .
It wil be nigh impossible to borrow to buy hardware or a major software license .
An open source software product is free to get through the door , and services around it are delivered from opex not capex .
Similarly , cloud computing lets a company pay a little to use someone else ’s enormous capital investment .
It looks like , if the rumours are true , Microsoft will launch Windows Cloud just in time .
Do n’t expect to see anyone else putting in new data centres any time soon — in fact , the days of deep - pocketed investors covering high burn rates are over for a while .
Most consumer apps will be a harder sell with the US dollar in the gutter while the country haemorrhages cash overseas .
This is bad but wo n’t make profit impossible , you just have to really be making something consumers need .
Apps like Wesabe might find a whole new audience in a recession ( disclaimer : O’Reilly is an investor in Wesabe ) .
The conditions do n’t suit speculative acquisitions , so expect a return to the focus on the bottom line that ( very briefly ) characterised the fallout from the ’01 tech bust .
Sorry , dreams of getting people to pay for your toothpick collector social network may have to wait until the return of the stupid money in 2013 .
As Phil Torrone said , people will have more time than money .
This is good for open source software , but also for hardware and Make - style reconnection with the objects around us .
The low - cost high - impact physical events we ’ve created ( Ignite , hacker meetups , coworking spaces , foo / bar camps ) will thrive even as big - ticket conferences feel the effects of pinched pennies .
The killer app in the “ web meets world ” space may just come from a Maker with spare time who sees a great need .
That ’s how I see the world and what I think it might favour and disadvantage .
How do you see it ?

Pallavolo Modena 's libero players play with Monkey D. Luffy jerseys
Not -So -Daily Link of the Day : This season , the Pallavolo Modena team of the Italian Volleyball League is dressing two of its players in official jerseys emblazoned with Monkey D. Luffy , the young pirate captain that is the main character in Eiichiro Oda 's One Piece manga and anime .
Pietro Rinaldi ( 6 ) and Edoardo Ciabattini ( 2 ) play libero — defensive players who can freely ( " libero " ) replace any of the back - row players during a game .
Libero players are required by the sport 's regulations to wear different jerseys from the other players to set them apart .
In previous seasons , Modena 's libero players have worn Spider - Man and Iron Man jerseys sponsored by Marvel .
This year , Toei Animation is sponsoring One Piece designs on their jerseys .
The manga began publishing in Italy in 2001 , and the anime is currently airing five days a week with an average audience of 1.7 million .

Although I dearly wanted to obtain convictions against all the Weathermen , including Bill Ayers , I am very pleased to learn that he has become a responsible citizen .
Because Senator Obama recently served on a board of a charitable organization with Mr. Ayers cannot possibly link the senator to acts perpetrated by Mr. Ayers so many years ago .
I do take issue with the statement in your news article that the Weathermen indictment was dismissed because of " prosecutorial misconduct . "
It was dismissed because of illegal activities , including wiretaps , break - ins and mail interceptions , initiated by John N. Mitchell , attorney general at that time , and W. Mark Felt , an F.B.I. assistant director .
Digg it
I guess coming from him this is stronger than my letter :
The whole thing is nonsense .
Obama has no connection to Ayers .
Obama did nothing .
Obama and Ayers were both on the board of some do - goodnik organization , each appointed by other third party folks .
Ayers held a fundraiser for Obama .
Obama never sought his support .
McCain however was in effect holding fundraisers for Keating , and is connected to the Annenberg foundation that funded the same organization that Ayers and Obama worked for .
Unlike Obama , McCain actively sought the support of terrorist and criminal G. Gordon Liddy or served on the board of the neo -Nazi US Council of World Freedom .
Unlike Obama , Palin actively sought support of treasonous and violent ( revised per comment : founder killed in a plastic - explosives sale gone bad , while collaborating with Iran ) Alaska Independence Party .
------------------------------------------------
Updated : Since this made the Rec list , I feel obliged to do an update :
Here is the NY Times front page article that looked into the " connection " and was actually pretty good on calling it b.s. ( other than the fact that article was even done ; at least third time NY Times has done an Ayers piece , compared to none on McCain 's and Palin 's terrorist ties ) .
And here is the pathetic " balanced " with false equivalency NY Times editorial that followed .
--------------------------------------------------
Update 2 - fyi : I hope this is not considered unrelated , but over at TPMCafe , MJ Rosenberg has a short essay making the link between the McCain campaign and Republican noise machine 's current incitement ( and media 's promotion of it ) , to the sort of right wing incitement that included their mainstream right wing candidate Netanyahu , which led to Rabin 's assasination in Israel .
Also the right wing incitement against JFK , that led to Dallas .

No matter what defeatist tack liberals take , real Americans are behind our troops 100 percent , behind John Ashcroft 100 percent , behind locking up suspected terrorists 100 percent , behind surveillance of Arabs 100 percent .

Take the concept " anti-Americanism . "
It is a rather curious one .
Such concepts are typically used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships .
Thus " anti-Sovietism " was a grave crime in the halls of the Kremlin in the old days , and I suppose the Brazilian generals and their supporters charged their internal enemies with being " anti-Brazilian . "
In countries that have some respect for their freedom , the concept would be dismissed with ridicule .
Imagine the reaction in the streets of Milan or Rome to a book called " anti-Italianism . "
And then observe the actual reaction in the US and Britain to a book by a respected author called " anti-Americanism " — a scholar who specializes in the Soviet Union , incidentally , and therefore understands very well the model he is following .
No one should be surprised to discover that the book is a deceitful rant against those who fail to worship the Holy State with sufficient ardor , and that it is for that reason that it is highly praised in sober reviews in the New York Times and elsewhere .
Those who criticized the crimes of the Kremlin or the Brazilian generals were not " anti-Russian " or " anti-Brazilian , " surely .
And by the same token , those who oppose crimes of the most powerful state in the world are not anti-American ; in fact , the crimes are often strenuously opposed by a considerable majority of the population .
The term should be abandoned , as in the case of its ugly models .
— Noam Chomsky
I think you can only have anti-Americanism if you first have Americanism , which is certainly not the same thing as simple love of country .
Americanism is a cult centered on a belief in national exceptionalism .
In modern times , there has been no better representative of the cult than George W. Bush , its current Imperial Wizard .
Everywhere he goes , he projects the self - satisfied image of an America happy to dump its untreated effluent into the world 's supply of drinking water so long as Americans themselves feel they are doing the right thing .

Anti-intellectualism in American life
To those who suspect that intellect is a subversive force in society , it will not do to reply that intellect is really a safe , bland , and emollient thing .
In a certain sense the suspicious Tories and militant philistines are right : intellect is dangerous .
Left free , there is nothing it will not reconsider , analyze , throw into question .
" Let us admit the case of the conservative , " John Dewey once wrote .
" If we once start thinking no one can guarantee what will be the outcome , except that many objects , ends and institutions will be surely doomed .
Every thinker puts some portion of an apparently stable world in peril , and no one can wholly predict what will emerge in its place . "
Further , there is no way of guaranteeing that an intellectual class will be discreet and restrained in the use of its influence ; the only assurance that can be given to any community is that it will be far worse off if it denies the free uses of the power of intellect than if it permits them .
To be sure , intellectuals , contrary to the fantasies of cultural vigilantes , are hardly ever subversive of a society as a whole .
But intellect is always on the move against something : some oppression , fraud , illusion , dogma , or interest is constantly falling under the scrutiny of the intellectual class and becoming the object of exposure , indignation , or ridicule .
In the course of generations , those who have suffered from the operation of intellect , or who have feared or resented it , have developed a kind of counter - mythology about what it is and the role it plays in society .
Those who have made their case against intellect in our time have not found it necessary to originate a single new argumnt , since this mythology is deeply rooted in our historical experience ...
The case against intellect is founded upon a set of fictional and wholly abstract antagonisms .
Intellect is pitted against feeling , on the ground that it is somehow inconsistent with warm emotion .
It is pitted against character , because it is widely believed that intellect stands for mere cleverness , which transmutes easily into the sly or the diabolical .
It is pitted against practicality , since theory is held to be opposed to practice , and the " purely " theoretical mind is so much disesteemed .
It is pitted against democracy , since intellect is felt to be a form of distinction that defies egalitarianism .
Once the validity of these antagonisms is accepted , then the case for intellect , and by extension for the intellectual , is lost .
Who cares to risk sacrificing warmth of emotion , solidity of character , practical capacity , or democratic sentiment in order to pay deference to a type of man who at best is deemed to be merely clever and at worst may even be dangerous ?

Good Learnin ' in Murka
Two fairly random excerpts from United States History in Christian Perspective : Heritage of Freedom ,
The key reason for a turn to prosperity in Virginia was a change in the basic economic system .
In the early years , Virginia used a common - store system .
Under this system , what each man produced went into a public storehouse , and he received food from the storehouse as he had need .
Since each colonist was assured of being able to live off the labors of his fellow man , few of them had much incentive to work .
Their sinful Adamic nature told them to spend their time in leisure or looking for gold .
Since most colonists followed this same reasoning , there was soon little food in the common store for anyone .
Shortly , the administrators of the colony saw the wisdom of giving each man his own parcel of ground where he could produce his own food crops .
If he did not produce , he would go hungry .
Obviously , this sytem quickly gave the settlers the incentive they needed to plant and cultivate abundant crops .
In essence , the old common - store system was a communistic economic system , in which the fruits of one 's labors were to be shared with all .
The new system was a private enterprise ( capitalistic ) system , in which each provides his own needs .
Americans had a lesson very early in their history in the benefits of free enterprise , in which each man is allowed to reap the benefits of his own labor .

Here 's a excerpt from a sidebar entitled Rock Music — an Insidious Weapon
Any objective study of rock music and the culture that accompanies it will expose the satanic and ungodly philosophy behind the words in the song and usually behind the performer as well .
Any objective observance of the behavior exhibited at a rock concert or at a party featuring rock music will reveal the powerful and immoral effect rock music has on its subjects .
At the very least , the thought patterns have been infested and the hearts have turned cold toward the things of God .

Murka 's Centripetal Recidivism
Richard Hofstadter .
Anti-intellectualism in American life
... the McCarthyist era brought to a head several forces engaged in a long - standing revolt against modernity .
The older America , until the 1890's and in some respects until 1914 , was wrapped in the security of continental isolation , village society , the Protestant denominations , and a flourishing industrial capitalism .
But relunctantly , year by year , over several decades , it has been drawn into the twentieth century and forced to cope with its unpleasant realities : first the incursions of cosmopolitanism and skepticism , then the disappearance of American isolation and easy military security , the collapse of traditional capitalism and its supplementation by a centralized welfare state , finally the unrelenting costs and stringencies of the Second World War , the Korean War , and the cold war .
As a consequence , the heartland of America , filled with people who are often fundamentalist in religion , nativist in prejudice , isolationist in foreign policy , and conservative in economics , has constantly rumbled with an underground revolt against all these tormenting manifestations of our modern predicament .

On the Justice of Roosting Chickens : Reflections on the Consequences of U.S. Imperial Arrogance and Criminality
Much has been made , rightly enough , of how U.S. governmental agencies , corporate media and academic elites collude to provide only such information as is convenient to the status quo .
It is thus true that there is much of which the public is unaware .
No such excuse can be advanced with respect to the fate of Iraq 's children , however .
Not only was the toll publicly predicted before U.S. sanctions were imposed , but two high UN officials ... have resigned in protest of what Halliday described as " the policy of deliberate genocide " they reflected .
Asked by an interviewer on 60 Minutes in 1996 whether the UN 's estimate of child fatalities in Iraq was accurate , U.S. Ambassador to the UN cum Secretary of State Madeleine Albright confirmed it before a national television audience .
" We 've decided , " Albright went on in a remark prominently displayed in the New York Times and most other major newspapers , " that it 's worth the cost " in lives extracted from brown - skinned toddlers to " set an example " so terrifying in its implications that it would compel planetary obedience to America 's dictates in the years ahead .
Such were the official terms defining the " New World Order " George Bush the elder had announced in 1991 .
One wonders how information about what was happening in Iraq could have been made much clearer or more readily accessible to the general public .
Claims that average Americans " did n't know " what was being done in their name are thus rather less than credible .
In reality , Americans by - and - large greeted Albright 's haughty revelation of genocide with yawns and blank stares , returning their attention almost immediately to what they considered far weightier matters : the Dow Jones and American League batting averages , for instance , or pursuit of the perfect cappuccino .
Braying like donkeys into their eternal cellphones , they went right on arranging their stock transfers and real estate deals and dinner dates , conducting business as usual , never exhibiting so much as a collective flicker of concern .
In effect , the U.S. citizenry as a whole was endowed with exactly the degree of ignorance it embraced .
To put it another way , being ignorant is in this sense — that of willful and deliberate ignoration — not synonymous with being uninformed .
It is instead to be informed and then ignore the information .
There is a vast difference between not knowing and not caring and if Good Americans have difficulty appreciating the distinction , it must be borne in mind that there are others in the world who are quite unburdened by such intellectual impairments .
They , beginning with those most directly targeted at any given moment for subjugation or eradication at the hands of American " peacekeepers , " know above all else that professions of ignorance inherently preclude claims of innocence in such circumstances .

That the Germans did not rise to the occassion [ of riding themselves of the Nazis ] , saving themselves and others untold misery , was the result neither of apathy nor of cowardice .
Rather , their collective failure to meet even the most rudimentary of their obligations to humanity accrued from the fact that they , afflicted with their own Teutonic version of America 's triumphant exceptionalism , overwhelmingly applauded nazism 's imposition of a " new order " both at home and abroad , turning at best a blind eye to its " flaws " until Germany began to incur its first significant defeats during the winter of 1941 - 42 ( for most Germans , the " turning point in morale " ) did not really set in until the disaster at Stalingrad a year afterwards , and for many later still ) .
Thereafter , they were reduced first to fighting with increasing desperation to stave off a collective punishment they knew full well the lethal arrogance of their own behavior had earned them , then by - and - large — in a striking parallel to Americans ' perpetually sweeping assertions of a " national innocence " — to denying that the punishment was warranted .
& sdot &sdot &sdot
If " Good Americans " will not finally undertake the steps necessary to euthanize the genocidal instrumentalities of U.S. power projection , those on the receiving end will henceforth increasingly assign themselves the job , using any and all means available to accomplish it .
That they wield a right to do so is a fact made incontrovertible by the magnitude and duration of the suffering inflicted upon them , not just by U.S. governmental / military / corporate elites but by the unending ranks of average Iowa farm boys who have so willingly pulled the triggers , launched the missiles and dropped the cluster bombs ( or performed the technical functions necessary to converting the systematic starvation of brown - skinned children into the finance capital and lush stock dividends of the U.S. economy ) .
Should it prove necessary that the right of the victims be translated into a program best framed as " two , three , many 9 - 1 - 1s , " Good Americans , all whining pretenses to wounded innocence notwithstanding , will be entitled to no more complaint than were their Good German counterparts before them .

Reflections from America 's Leaders
[ The government ] ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority .
The Senate , therefore , ought to be this body ; and , to answer these purposes , they ought to have permanency and stability .
— James Madison ( 4th President , " Father of the Constitution " )
They have neither the intelligence , the industry , the moral habits , nor the desire of improvement which are essential to any favorable change in their condition .
Established in the midst of another and a superior race , and without appreciating the causes of their inferiority or seeking to control them , they must necessarily yield to the force of circumstances and ere long disappear .
— Andrew Jackson ( 7th President , discussing the need to remove aboriginal peoples from their native lands )
Ignorance and vice bred poverty which was as immutable as the seasons .
— Martin Van Buren ( 8th President )
What , sir !
Prevent the American people from crossing the Rocky Mountains ?
You might as well command Niagara not to flow .
We must fulfill our destiny .

Next to the right of liberty , the right of property is the most important individual right guaranteed by the Constitution and the one which , united with that of personal liberty , has contributed more to the growth of civilization than any other institution established by the human race .
— William Howard Taft ( 27th President )
Business underlies everything in our national life , including our spiritual life .
Witness the fact that in the Lord 's Prayer , the first petition is for daily bread .
No one can worship God or love his neighbor on an empty stomach .
— Woodrow Wilson ( 28th President )
American business is not a monster , but an extension of a God - given impulse to create , and the savior of our happiness .

The atomic bomb was no " great decision . " ...
It was merely another powerful weapon in the arsenal of righteousness .
— Harry Truman ( 33rd President )
Then listen to me , Mr. Ambassador .
Fuck your Parliament and your Constitution .
America is an elephant .
Cyprus is a flea .
Greece is a flea .
If those two fleas continue itching the elephant , they may just get whacked by the elephant 's trunk , whacked good .
— Lyndon Johnson ( 36th President )
What are our schools for if not indoctrination against communism ?
— Richard Nixon ( 37th President )
A tree is a tree — how many more do you need to look at ?
— Ronald Reagan ( 40th President )
I will never apologize for the United States of America - I do n't care what the facts are .
— George H W Bush ( 41st President , commenting on the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by the U.S. warship Vincennes , killing 290 passengers )
America does not need a religious war .
It needs reaffirmation of the values that for most of us are rooted in our religious faith .
— William Clinton ( 42nd President )
A submarine could take this place out .
— George W Bush ( 43rd President , while looking at a river next to the Clinton library )
Any departure is also an arrival .
I did n't just emmigrate from America — I immigrated to Canada .
This will be the subject of the diptych 's Northern Panel .
Q : How would you feel if Joseph Goebbels , Hitler 's Propaganda Minister , called you one of the worst Germans ?
a bad Nazi ?
a traitor to your country ?
What does such a question even mean ?
The entire concept of " anti-Americanism " or being a " worst American " is a pathetic rebuke made by authoritarians to shame citizens to shut up , fold their hands on their lap , and get them to behave like good little boys and girls .
I 've never considered myself an American .
It was only an accident of birth that made me one .
I consider myself a citizen of the world , and thus my allegiance is to all of humanity .
My ethics are such that I seek ways to prevent or minimize all needless injustice , misery and suffering , of all living creatures — human or otherwise .
That I was an accidental citizen of a country that is inarguably one of the greatest causes of human suffering in modern times was a constant source of dissonance and pain to me ; that my tax dollars were being directly used to inflict torture , to subjugate populations , to collude in mass murders and criminal wars , to overturn democracies and install autocratic puppet regimes , to line the pockets of infamous crooks , etc etc , was deeply abhorrent to me , and made me ashamed .
We human creatures are all , fundamentally , corporeal creatures first and foremost .
As such we all know what it is like to feel pain , to feel cold , to feel hunger , to cry , to laugh .
( " I am a Jew .
Hath not a Jew eyes ?
hath not a Jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer , as a Christian is ?
If you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ? "
Shakespeare , Merchant of Venice , Act 3 Scene 1 )
We all share a common language , the language of our physical existence , the language of our body .
We all know how to read pain on someone 's face , we all know what the sobs of misery and fear sound like , we all know what shouts of despair feel like .
If we have known pain and privation — and we have all known it in one way or another , it is part and parcel of our experience as organic , biological entities — then we can relate to the pain and privation of others .
Empathy is part of our makeup as sentient , feeling creatures .
Until , that is , we have allowed a culture 's ideological poison to seep into our system , a poison that blunts our empathy and teaches us to ignore the universal language of the body — specifically , the grammar of its pain .
Such cognitive blunting of our ability to empathize with the pain of The Other is a poison that allows one arbitrary group of people to place themselves above another for specious , self - deluding reasons ; and , like Phalaris putting his victims inside the brazen bull , such blunting transmutes the screams of anguish of The Other into background entertainment — rendered , in modern times , as TV war coverage we watch while snacking , or images on a page next to ads for toothpaste or SUVs .
Such blunting serves to heighten the victimizers sense of superiority by creating a cycle that blames the victim for their own continuing victimhood .
It is sociopathy on a cultural scale .
America is a land built on misery and suffering , founded by religious kooks , genocidalists , and rapacious , corrupt , amoral mercenaries seeking fortune for their wealthy benefactors , decimating entire populations in its pursuit .
It is a land that encourages competition to pit citizen against citizen , wherein the most ignorant , neurotic and selfish are consistently rewarded with ever more power and riches .
Such a system is a plutocratic kakistocracy , an insider 's club whose members are wealthy philistines devising rules to reward themselves for their clever , corrupt cronyism by stealing the spoils of their proudly stupid constituents .
Of course this is n't just peculiar to America .
This is a common feature of most nation - states and their political institutions .
But the American incarnation of it is particularly virulent since it is founded upon a most peculiar sort of anti-intellectualism and anti-humanism .
Subjugated people are generally cognizant , to some degree , of their subjugation by a ruling oligarchy .
But Americans ' pride in their stupidity and ignorance creates a unique situation in which those who are most oppressed are so arrogantly proud of their stupidity that they embrace their subjugation all the more without even knowing they are doing it .
They are kicked and beaten dogs who help their master tighten their own leash about their neck — then master and dog both go on a hunt for the scapegoat of the month on which to blame their social ills .
I am ashamed of America , and I apologize to the world for whatever way I contributed to any misery and suffering I helped support , wittingly or not .
There were several factors behind my move to Canada , and the need to be able to live with a clear conscience was a major one .
I needed to know that I was no longer aiding and abetting a criminal government responsible for causing so much heinous , needless , and ultimately futile misery and suffering , and all to make the undeserving ever wealthier .
I needed to know that I was no longer benefitting from the evils my country committed in my name , nor to serve as an accomplice to its crimes : even though I abhorred the actions of " my " country , I nevertheless felt complicit in them by the mere fact of my citizenship .
To be an American meant to be part of the support staff for a group of sociopathic , mean - spirited , rapacious , small - minded sadists bent on subjugating vast populations for demonstrably false and truculent ideological reasons .
I could no longer live with myself as an American — my conscience forbade it .
( Note : I would like to make it crystal clear that I am speaking for myself , and not for anybody else .
I am speaking aboutconscience .
My statements are not meant — in any way — to be construed as an indictment against fellow citizens with open eyes who choose to stay in America .
If anything I encourage and applaud those who continue to try to effect change facing such insurmountable odds — it is a testament to the human spirit , and I wish them Zeusspeed ! )
All Americans have heard the expression " America — Love it or Leave it ! " I left .
And if this makes me one of the Worst Americans , then I wear it proudly , just as a German leaving Nazi Germany might proudly wear the label of Worst German .
The world needs more Americans who are defined as the " Worst " Americans by those who dare define what constitutes a " Good " or " Real " American .
( " It seems that American patriotism measures itself against an outcast group .
The right Americans are the right Americans because they 're not like the wrong Americans , who are not really Americans . " — Eric Hobsbawm ) Unfortunately a Good American is a Bad World Citizen .
My allegiance — as a human being first — is to my fellow ( wo ) man , not to the criminal tribal group that I was accidentally born into .
I'm one of those pathetic losers in America that never had representation in America 's putative democracy .
Never .
That 's because I 'm the kind of person who values intelligence , truth , justice , beauty .
The kind who questions authority , materialism , business , consumerism .
The kind who tries to live , to the best of his ability , according to the adages " live and let live " and " do unto others as you would have others do unto you . "
The kind who is mystified by the zealous embrace of superstitious beliefs , and is distrustful of those who put faith before reason .
The kind who repudiates " tradition " as an excuse to perpetuate any injustice , oppression , or foolishness .
The kind who puts people before social institutions , before profit , before property , before any " principle . "
The kind who believes a citizen 's most patriotic duty is to question the criminal acts of his country .
The kind who believes we should strive to make the world a better place for all peoples , not just those who have money , or share our belief systems .
The kind of person who believes education is a never - ending vocation that involves learningto think , notto think .
The kind of person who believes in the scientific method , both hard and soft , and believes that if studies prove there is such a thing as global warming , or that opportunity rather than punishment prevents crimes , then policies should be implemented based on these studies .
The kind who believes the best way to create a world of justice is to seek to understand The Other with both respect and an open ear , and not to foist our attitudes on them by fiat at the point of a gun .
The kind who believes that surplus food and medical aid should be freely distributed , and not destroyed to keep prices high to make the greedy wealthier .
The kind who believes that gross inequalities in wealth will lead to increasingly greater and intractable social problems .
The kind who believes " From each according to his ablity ; to each according to his need . "
The kind who believes that our food supply should not be toyed with until rigorous tests prove beyond a doubt that genetic engineering is completely harmless .
The kind who believes that anyone should be allowed to do absolutely anything they wish with their own body .
The kind who believes there is no such thing as a victimless crime .
The kind who believes that whatever consenting adults do in the privacy of their own home is nobody 's fucking business but their own .
The kind who believes that one 's right to do whatever they wish ends at harming others — including animals and mother nature .
The kind who believes in true equality — including economic .
The kind who wishes to see a world in which every person is allowed the opportunity to live as fully and authentically as they are able to in their attempts to actualize themselves .
The kind who believes in the fundamental dignity of all life .
The kind who believes that there is no meaning in life other than what we ourselves choose to believe in ; and that since we all suffer and die , each in our own way , we should have a fundamental respect , sympathy , and empathy for others .
The kind who believes people do the best they can , and generally mean well , and would , in the right circumstances , live peacefully together — for what human beings desire most of all is to feel connected to each other .
The kind who does n't seek to mock or punish those who are different , or those who make honest mistakes .
The kind who believes that putting a dad in prison for smoking a joint is not good for a family .
The kind who believes that white collar criminals cause far more harm to society that some poor black kid stealing a bike — and that putting the kid away in prison for the rest of his life for it is evil .
The kind who believes that love takes many beautiful forms .
The kind who believes that there are some things more important than profit and property , such as love and beauty and respect and justice ; and that our primary role as human beings should be to employ what reason and talent we have to seek ways to prevent misery and suffering , and to aid in our mutual actualization .
There is no place in America for those like me — never has been , and never will be .
I have never had any " representation " in my supposed democratic society , and the possibility that a candidate could be elected who shares my views are nil .
What point is there to live in a society in which the chances of my having any kind of voice are negligible ?
My society has abandoned me — thus I find I must abandon my society .
Only a fool or a blind optimist continues to fight an unwinnable fight .
Since I lack the desire to deceive myself with sufficient vigor to believe that there is any hope of change in the culture in which I was born I have decided to pursue the path of self - actualization as the best thing I can do for my worldly compatriots .
Granted , this is n't a standard , mainstream history book — this is a textbook used by homeschoolers and private schools .
But if the wingnuts have their way this kind of indoctrinating poison would be required reading for all high school students in America .
Just recently a public school board in Pennsylvania — a blue state — passed a resolution that " intelligent design " must be taught alongside evolution in its science curriculum .
BushCo's entire educational plan , No Child Left Behind , is based upon the premise of standardized testing , an excellent way to compel conformity of thought , teachto think instead ofto think , and prevent the development of critical thinking .
This kind of education is nothing less than indoctrination that rewards the rote recitation of bland facts .
( " And what is a good citizen ?
Simply one who never says , does or thinks anything that is unusual .
Schools are maintained in order to bring this uniformity up to the highest possible point .
A school is a hopper into which children are heaved while they are still young and tender ; therein they are pressed into certain standard shapes and covered from head to heels with official rubber - stamps . "
— H. L. Mencken )
And schools that fail to live up to snuff in properly indoctrinating their kids will lose funding — which is all part of the plan to defund public schools and turn them into for - profit charters and religious schools .
The battle for the minds of children in America is fiercely waged .
Judging from recent polls America is getting just the kind of thinking - disabled citizens it wishes .
55 % believe every word of the Bible is literally accurate and 62 % say they favor teaching creation science in addition to evolution in public schools [ 12/04 ] 47 % of Bush 's supporters believe Iraq had WMDs ; and 70 % believe in compulsory student drug testing .
After all , critical thinkers do not make good consumers , do not make good canon fodder , do not make pliable flatworms that are trained to move toward light .
This kind of education has long been standard in America , particularly in those red states that voted for Bush .
There has always been a very large subculture in America raised on this kind of stuff .
And they have just recently come out of the woodworks and assumed control .
It 's payback time for the Scopes trial , for the Hippie 's cultural revolution , for Roosevelt 's New Deal , for Reconstruction , for any measure , in fact , that increased a citizen 's freedom , a freedom painfully wrenched from backwards puritans afflicted with the " 100 % Mentality . "
( " There is only one honest impulse at the bottom of Puritanism , and that is the impulse to punish the man with a superior capacity for happiness . "
— H. L. Mencken )
Those who reside in metropolitan areas or in blue states really do live in oases of relative education and culture ; they had little idea just how anti-intellectual their more homebred citizens were — that is , until the most recent " election " finally revealed to them just how deeply backwards and deluded their fellow countrymen are .
And it shocked them to their core .
America has never been a " reality - based community . "
It has always prided itself on its ability to delude itself about its moral superiority while decimating populations both native and foreign .
Andrew Jackson , his wildhaired visage adorning the $ 20 bill , has long been considered one of America 's greatest presidents .
Andrew Jackson , the great backwoods Indian killer , responsible for untold carnage , death , and misery .
The Spanish - American War , devised as a great way to sell papers while grabbing more territory , wherein a quarter - million Filipinos were exterminated in the process .
BushCo's war in Iraq is nothing new or unique in America 's history — almost all of America 's wars have been started for outright falsehoods .
Time and time again the most stupid and outlandish lies have served to hoodwink a gullible , willfully ignorant and pliable citizenry ( the desired end of American education , remember ) to enter one war after another .
There is not one year in America 's history in which its military muscle is n't used in one way or another , whether through declared wars or not .
And what have all these wars been for ?
As Marine General Smedley Butler says : " I was a high class muscleman for Big Business , for Wall Street and for the Bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism . "
( He also said ' War is a racket ... A racket is best described , I believe , as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people .
Only a small " inside " group knows what it is about .
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few , at the expense of the very many .
Out of war a few people make huge fortunes . '
Al Capone , Jesse James , and Cornelius Vanderbilt are different incarnations of the same fundamentally vulgar , mean - spirited , rapacious , selfish , ruthless , stupid , arrogant , sociopathic , base , clever , monomaniacal mindset that the American culture consistently rewards and reveres .
Ken Lay , Ted Bundy , and Dick Cheney are the contemporary avatars of such infamous personalities .
The image of the gangster , the outlaw , the robber baron , are sources of pride to Americans .
America 's greatest heroes are often men of base and mean morals with small , crabbed minds that crave shiny things , excelling at hoodwinking their public by telling them lies they want to believe about themselves .
Americans have always been suspicious of the intellectual , the cultured , the educated ; they generally detest those who do n't adequately reflect back to them their narcissistic sense of perfection , and are deeply fearful and resentful of those who see behind America 's fragile ego , threatened by those who make them feel in any way at fault or inferior .
Like its current leader , America refuses to acknowledge that it has ever made a mistake , and does not have the shame or dignity to apologize for anything .
It is this hubris that is bringing America crashing down .
America is a country that is responsible for inflicting untold horror and misery on the world , and all in the name of profit for the few .
It is a mean - spirited grade - school bully that gets mad if anyone defies it , and will lie and cheat and do anything to get its way — overtly if it can , sneaking around proscriptions if it can't .
It will sing hosannahs to democracy and freedom while overturning democracies they do n't approve of , replacing them with criminal autocracies that torture and pillage their own citizens .
It is narcissistic and seemingly incapable of introspection ; it is arrogant and drunk on its own display of power ; it can dish it out , but it can not take it ; it cries and whines when it does n't get its own way ; it must always blame somebody — anybody — else for the messes it creates for itself .
Blame America first ?
Damn right !
Why was this phrase even created ?
For the same reason " compassionate conservatism " was created — to mask and deflect obvious truths .
America has given itself and the world cause to look to it first when assessing blame .
America should be considered guilty until proven innocent .
Chile , Nicaragua , the Philippines , East Timor , Iraq , Iran , Honduras , Guatemala , El Salvador , Venezuala , Cuba , Zaire , Indonesia , Greece , the Dominican Republic , Haiti , Laos , Cambodia , Angola , Afghanistan , Vietnam , Kosovo ; Agent Orange , MK - Ultra , the Phoenix program ; Hiroshima , Nagasaki , the Trail of Tears , the Long Walk , Kaibai Creek Massacre , Marias Massacre , Washita Massacre , Wounded Knee Massacre , Sand Creek Massacre , Mai Lai , the Highway of Death , No Gun Ri , Abu Ghraib ; Kent State , Haymarket Riot , COINTELPRO , Iran / Contra , WMD , Watergate , " He Kept Us Out Of War !

And that the American public has no knowledge of the crimes committed in the names of its citizenry is criminal as well .
But what can one expect of a citizenry in which one in seven can not locate their own country on a blank map of the world a citizenry that admires a man who 's lies are responsible for the death of their own offspring ?
The American public , as is proven beyond a doubt by its most recent presidential " election " , willfully chooses to remain in a state of blissful ignorance about the evils committed in their name .
I , for one , do not wish to join the party on The Ship of Fools as it heads over the waterfall .
Fortunately for me I 'm one of the " Worst Americans " and thus suffer no such delusions about " wounded innocence . "
As one of the " Worst Americans " I have refused to drink the kool - aid that would allow me to share in the mass psychosis of my fellow countrymen , a drink that magically transforms America from homicidal gangster into victim of motiveless evil , attacked out of the blue by heathens who " hate our freedoms . "
America got a tiny symbolic taste of what it dishes out — generally at far worse orders of magnitude .
And as one of the " Worst Americans " I do n't harbor any illusions that there is any hope for change in present - day America , since ignorance , arrogance , megalomania , and sanctimonious self - righteousness are woven into the very fabric of its cultural identity — and which are now in full , rapturous blossom thanks to self - destructive sociological defense mechanisms that kick in when a culture 's cherished world - views cannot cope with ineluctable challenges from reality .
( " Men insist most vehemently upon their certainties when their hold upon them has been shaken . " — Reinhold Nieburh ) .
And , because I am one of the " Worst Americans , " I can leave my homeland with nary a look back .
Yes , I am ashamed to have come from a country such as this .
I will not miss it .
Not one bit .
I am proud to be amongst the worst Americans , and America deserves the fall that is coming to it .
Unfortunately it will take down countless innocents with it , both home and abroad , during its long , painful , yet well deserved fall .
Do I hate America ?
Yes and no — " Condemn the Sin , not the Sinner . "
But for an interesting thought experiment apply this concept to the Nazis .
Dissonant , is n't it ?
It raises a vitally important point .
Cultural and political groups are comprised of individuals .
The psychological motivations of any individual can be sympathized and empthatized with , and , as such , this concept of condemning the sin and not the sinner becomes tenable : we can understand how Jim or Tom or Susan can think the way they do , and thus can come to understand how circumstances can lead them to become a willing cog in a genocidal machine .
In coming to this understanding we can then learn to forgive them their sins .
But on a sociological level , no matter how understandable the reasons may be for a culture 's reprehensible deeds , condemning not just the sin but the sinner becomes not only warranted — our humanity demands it , if , in fact , it ever truly hopes to evolve to a place where the ideal of peace can be made a reality .
( " I have ever hated all nations , professions and communites , and all my love is towards individuals ...
But principally I hate and detest that animal called man ; although I heartily love John , Peter , Thomas , and so forth . " — Jonathan Swift )
A drop of water is not the same thing as a cataclysmic tsunami .
The son of an abusive alcoholic may revile the damage and pain his dad inflicts during his drunken rampages and may understandably wish to leave his dad 's clutches — especially if his dad refuses to even acknowledge his aberrant behavior .
He may understand the reasons for his dad 's behavior , and with understanding comes empathy and compassion ; any hatred felt towards his dad would necessarily be qualified .
But understanding does n't prevent his dad 's abusive behavior .
The son has a choice , and choosing to leave his family is , thus , a positive , self - affirming act .
The son may hate his dad 's behavior , and may even hate his dad as he watches him beat his sister or mother , but leaving may have been necessary for his self - preservation — particularly given his dad 's unpredictable nature .
The son is pained by leaving his sister and mother , and may seek to help them in any way he can from afar — possibly by encouraging them to leave as well , perhaps using himself as an example ... hopefully before something really bad happens to them .
Is there nothing good about America ?
Is it unremittingly evil ?
Of course not .
There are many great and wonderful things about America .
I spent two years of my life driving throughout the country , and have gotten to know its vast grandeurs as well as its intimate beauties .
I 've met and chatted with people from all walks of life in truck stops and local bars , in the city and in the country .
I have a great and abiding affection for those Americans I have met , and who have accepted me into their confidence .
Some of the best times in my life were spent in local watering holes of some of the reddest states .
But since there 's an overwhelming profusion of jingoistic boosterism easily and readily available about how wonderful America is I figured I 'd concentrate on the negative for now — after all , I 'm discussing my reasons for leaving .
Besides , on the balance sheet between the pro and con my final tally shows a great deficit in the accounting .
It is said that a country deserves its leaders .
I think this applies even moreso when those leaders are chosen by its citizenry .
Since America has willfully chosen to be a non-reality based community , they will know firsthand the trauma that occurs when reality intrudes on their fantasy world .
It will not be pleasant .
The essence of America is deeply and fundamentally conservative , arrogant , and ignorant — and it is proud of these attributes , though they are called by other names such a rugged - individualism , a christian nation , the world 's policeman , etc .
When they claim that there is no room in America for folks such as myself — " America , love it or leave it ! " — they speak a truth they are little aware of .
When I crossed the border into Canada to begin a new life in a new country I felt a tremendous weight lift from me .
I felt free in a way I had never felt before .
And I never looked back .
I have not felt a single pang of regret , nor do I ever expect to .
When I visit America now , I feel like a visitor in some alien land , and it's a great feeling .
America , in its present form , has entered its final act : as in a classical tragedy the hero will soon fall victim to his tragic flaw , his hubris blinding him to the scenario he himself has set in motion and which now unfolds to his inevitable downfall .
And I , for one , do not want to be around when the curtain comes crashing down .
Obama to preside over White House 2.0 Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday November 8 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
Get ready for White House 2.0 .
That 's what many are expecting when President - Elect Barack Obama becomes President Obama in January and puts the power of his unprecedented Internet operation to work in the Oval Office .
Obama relied heavily on the Web for his victory over John McCain -- from organizing volunteers to fundraising to communicating -- and expectations are high he will turn to the Internet again to further his White House agenda .
" A lot of people are speculating , " said Julie Germany , director of George Washington University 's Institute for Politics Democracy & the Internet .
" Will an Obama administration use its vast back - end system , its database , all of the online communities it developed , to actually mobilize advocacy ? "
" It could , for example , email or text message or call people who live in certain districts to get them to lobby their senators and congressmen on issues that the Obama administration cares about , " she said .
Micah Sifry , co-founder of techpresident.com , a blog about politics and the Web , thinks it will -- or at least try .
" By giving people a sense that they really do have a stake and a say they will be much more motivated to do things in support of his legislative agenda because they 'll feel like it's their agenda too , " Sifry said .
" He is going to learn , either by succeeding or failing at this , that the more he partners with his supporters the more power he will have , " he said
" The more he simply tries to push a message at them and make them do something the less power he will have , " Sifry added .
Obama 's first moves after winning the election would indicate that he plans to not only mobilize his faithful but also listen to them .
In an email sent to millions of supporters on election night , Obama thanked those who gave their " time , talent , and passion to this campaign . "
But , he added , there was still " a lot of work to do " and he would " be in touch soon about what comes next . "
Change.gov , the official website launched by the Obama transition team on Thursday , invites users to " share your story and your ideas , and be part of bringing positive lasting change to this country . "
Under the headline of " Open Government , " change.gov urges users to " Share Your Vision " via email and asks them for their email address and zip code , essential elements in building an online data - base .
Craig Newmark , founder of online classifieds site craigslist.com , served as a technology adviser to Obama and is an advocate for a more open and responsive government .
" In New York and San Francisco there are so - called ' 311 ' programs , " he said .
" The idea is that it 's customer service for local government and if you need a pothole fixed you contact 311 .
" Well let 's start expanding 311 systems to all of government , " he said .
" There 's also the whole transparency thing , " Newmark added .
" The Internet is all about transparency .
The first phase is the election campaign then , afterwards , getting some real grass - roots democracy in there . "
David Almacy , who served as Internet and e-communications director for President George W. Bush , said the Internet is " a very powerful tool in communicating the president 's agenda . "
" The Internet is basically a 24 - hour seven - day - a - week spokesperson , " Almacy said .
" While we 're sleeping at night it 's still available for those who are searching on energy legislation or the war on terror or the war in Iraq . "
Almacy , who overhauled whitehouse.gov during his two years in the White House , making it a much more dynamic website , warned though that the Obama administration may find there are limits to how much it can do .
For example , " you 're not allowed to place cookies on people 's machines , " he said of the electronic spies which gather information about users .
" We had to work within the bounds that we were able to play with . "
" There might be some people who would be less likely to trust the government as much as they trust their political campaigns , " Almacy added .
Sifry said Obama " seems to have the right instinct but the proof is going to be in the pudding , as they say , in the details of how this plays out . "
Germany agreed .
" There 's a huge difference between being a candidate and actually being in the administration , and a lot changes from the day you win an election and the day you 're inaugurated , " she said .

As the new Congress convenes , both Democratic and Republican lawmakers are proposing limits on greenhouse gas emissions .
Most of these proposals are for carbon cap and trade systems similar to the European Union Emissions Trading System .
A carbon tax is another way to limit emissions .
This policy brief describes how a carbon tax could be implemented and presents an analysis of a Green Employment Tax Swap ( GETS ) .
Under this proposal , a national tax on carbon emissions is paired with a reduction in the payroll tax .
In particular , the brief assesses the impact of a tax of $ 15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , which is used to rebate the federal payroll tax on the first $ 3,660 of earnings per worker .
This reform is both revenue - neutral and distributionally neutral .

More than 1,200 people have been killed in gang violence this year alone Police in Jamaica say a lotto scam targeting US citizens is contributing to gang violence in the country .
Detectives say criminals are buying expensive high - powered weapons with the money sent by people who believe they have won a sweepstake on the island .
Despite attempts by detectives to break the scam for the past few years , it still remains active .
The operation is centred around Montego Bay , the country 's second city on the north coast .
It is similar to schemes that operate in other parts of the world .
The con-artists illicitly get hold of personal information on potential victims such as their names , addresses and telephone numbers .
We know guns are being bought , but there are also robberies and killings as a result of the amount of money that is in these communities
Assistant Commissioner Les Green
Jamaica Constabulary Force
They then persuade them that they have won a lottery and need to send a fee to process their winnings .
Police here say they particularly go after retirees from the US , and in the past they have had reports of people 's entire life savings being taken .
Officers say scammers are making thousands of dollars a week from wire transfers to the island , and that cash is now being used to buy expensive high - calibre weapons that are helping to fuel the violence that has seen more than 1,200 people killed since the start of the year .
Assistant Commissioner Les Green from the Jamaica Constabulary
Force says the scam is linked to other crimes .
" We know guns are being bought , but there are also robberies and killings as a result of the amount of money that is in these communities , " he said .
" The lotto scammers wo n't go themselves to collect the money .
They ask other people , and sometimes that does n't come back so they order a robbery or hit , and it increases the amount of crime as there are millions of US dollars involved in this flooding in every day . "
Police are targeting people involved in the lotto scam and are seizing their assets .
However , for many people it is a long process to recover what they have lost .
Detectives say they recently had to drop a case after an American grandmother killed herself after losing nearly a quarter of a million dollars .

What are these ?
During the GOP primary , we kept hearing about the emergence of a “ new evangelical ” movement that cared about issues beyond the standard anti-gay , anti-abortion right - wing agenda and were repeatedly told that Mike Huckabee was the most high profile example of this new type of leader .
As we pointed out then , and have continued to point out , that was a dramatic oversimplification and fundamentally misleading .
Because , when you get down to it , people like Mike Huckabee are in fact fully aligned with the traditional Religious Right agenda and , as Dan Gilgoff smartly notices , inevitably revert to form when it comes crunch time :
Remember back to the Republican primaries , when Mike Huckabee campaigned as a new kind of evangelical candidate , adding issues like the environment , education , and poverty to the hot - button agenda of God , guns , and gays ?
That big - tent Huck seems to be in much shorter supply now .
An email the Arkansas governor just sent out soliciting donations for his political action committee–whose beneficiaries include John McCain and Sarah Palin–asks fors $ 5 for each of these five red meat issues : 1 . Protection of Human Life 2 . Traditional Marriage 3 .
Tax policy that does n’t punish people for working , but rewards them 4 . 2nd amendment rights
5 . Supreme Court and Federal Court judge selection
So much for all those professed concerns about poverty , the environment , and human rights .
The full scale of the persecution of Christians in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul became apparent last night when the UN 's refugee agency said about 13,000 had been hounded from their homes this month - more than half of the city 's Christian community .
The UN high commissioner for refugees ( UNHCR ) said it was sending aid to thousands of Christian refugees fleeing Mosul after a three - week campaign of killing and intimidation .
About a dozen Christians have reportedly been killed in the recent violence , prompting many members of the community to seek sanctuary in churches and homes in outlying villages , or in Syria .
" Many left with little money and need help , " said Ron Redmond , UNHCR spokesman , in a briefing from Geneva .
Christian neighbourhoods had been bombarded with threatening phone calls , letters and messages pinned to doors for months , but the killing began a few weeks ago , he said .
Recounting the story of a woman named Mariam , Redmond said she left her home when she heard of a Christian who was murdered .
" We were the hard core that never wanted to leave Iraq , even with the tense environment , " the woman , who fled to Syria , was quoted by UNHCR as saying .
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks , but suspicion has fallen on Sunni extremists intent on turning the historic city into a stronghold .
Local Sunni officials deny the allegation , pointing the finger at Kurdish militias who , it is said , want to empty the city of Christians before upcoming local elections .
The Kurdish regional government also denies the claims .
Mosul , Iraq 's third biggest city after Baghdad and Basra , has remained mired in violence despite the US military surge .
Al - Qaida insurgents regrouped in the city after being flushed out of neighbouring Anbar province , taking advantage of its proximity to Syria .
After a period of relative calm roadside bombs and assassinations gradually returned to Mosul , giving it the reputation as the Iraq 's most dangerous city .
The province of Nineveh , which has Mosul at its heart , has been home to Assyrian and Chaldean Catholics for 2,000 years .
Before the fall of Saddam Hussein Iraq 's Christian population numbered about 1.2 million .
But the upsurge of violence has prompted a mass exodus , with 20 % of the 1.5 million Iraqi refugees in Syria thought to be Christians .
The return of sustained religious violence will also raise fears over Iraq 's fragile security and lend weight to calls for the Iraqi government to give US troops a legal mandate to maintain security for a further three years .
Meanwhile a Shia cleric , Jalaluddin al - Saghir , yesterday endorsed a draft US - Iraqi security pact .
" The country is passing through a most critical stage , " Saghir said .
" The politicians should think about Iraq 's interests .
They should not seek to break the unity of Iraqi society .
This is not a game . "
The proposed agreement has been opposed by a number of critics , including the Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , who say it infringes Iraq 's sovereignty .

After I had decided to put this up on my Web site , I did a quick Google to find any other recipients who thought it good enough to mention .

Unexpectedly Intriguing !
Teenage workers are disappearing from the U.S. workforce .
Something appears to have happened to drive them out of the workforce in large numbers .
Phil Miller and Doc Palmer say that the recent mandated hikes in the minimum wage very likely has something to do with the teenagers getting disappeared , but no one in the media is willing to finger them as a promising culprit behind the workplace disappearances .
Could they be right ?
To find out , we went straight to the source : the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
What we did was to take the BLS ' report on the Characteristics of Minimum Wage Earners , 2007 and compare it to their report on the Characteristics of Minimum Wage Earners , 2005 .
Why these two years ?
Mainly , 2005 was the last full year in which the BLS ' compiled the report under the old minimum wage rate of $ 5.15 per hour , while 2007 saw the mandated minimum wage rate increased by 13.6 % to $ 5.85 per hour on 24 July 2007 .
Here 's what we found when we compared Table 7 of both reports , which breaks down the number of hourly wage earners by age group .
Our first table shows the number of hourly wage earners in each wage group , broken down by those making more than the federal minimum wage for 2005 and 2007 and those earning the federal minimum wage or less for both years :
Overall , the total number of hourly wage earners increased by 265,000 between 2005 and 2007 .
We can see right off the magnitude of the changes for the total number of hourly wage earners for each age group , with declines in the totals for those in the groups for Age 16 - 19 , Age 20 - 24 , Age 30 - 34 , Age 35 - 39 , Age 40 - 44 and Age 45 - 49 and increases for all the other age groups .
We also see the relative proportion of minimum wage earners to the total number of hourly wage earners for each age group , which we 'll next look at more closely :
Between 2005 and 2007 , the total number of those making the federal minimum wage or less decreased by 153,000 , an 8.1 % drop below the 2005 figure of 1,882,000 minimum wage earners .
We can see that the Age 16 - 19 and Age 20 - 24 groups saw dramatic declines in the number of people earning the minimum wage or less , while all the other age groups either saw increases or fairly minor decreases .
If raising the minimum wage had no effect upon the level of employment , we should not see this result .
At all .
Instead , we should see the number of minimum wage earners for all age groups increase across the board .
The reason for this is because the people who earned wages above the old minimum wage level of $ 5.15 per hour , but at or below the new minimum wage level of $ 5.85 per hour would now be added to the total number of those counted as earning the minimum wage .
In fact , this is very likely what we do see for the presumably more experienced workers above the age of 25 .
In our next chart , we measured the differences between the total number of hourly workers counted between 2005 and 2007 and the number of minimum wage earners for each age group .
Here 's what we found :
This chart confirms that for teenagers , those between the ages of 16 and 19 years old , all of the jobs that disappeared in 2007 were minimum wage jobs .
In essence , a total of 94,000 hourly jobs disappeared for this age group overall .
This figure is the net change of this age group losing some 118,000 minimum wage earning jobs and gaining some 24,000 jobs paying above this level .
This represents what we believe to be the effect of the higher minimum wage level increasing the barriers to entry for young people into the U.S. workforce .
Since the minimum wage jobs that once were held by individuals in each age group have disappeared , total employment levels have declined as those who held them have been forced to pursue other activities .
Now consider this :
The minimum wage was just reset on 24 July 2008 to $ 6.55 per hour , a 27.2 % increase from where it was in early July 2007 .
Our best guess is that a lot of additional teenagers will be pursuing those other activities .
Meanwhile , the lack of employment opportunities for the least educated , least skilled and least experienced segment of the U.S. workforce will likely have costs far beyond the benefits gained by those who earn the higher minimum wage .
The government might be able to make the minimum wage earning teenage worker disappear , but they did n't do anything to make the teenagers themselves disappear .
Labels : jobs , minimum wage , unemployment
Likewise , it ’s important to differentiate between politicians who can live peacefully with ( if not embrace ) those things for which they are parodied .
For instance , few public figures have been spoofed as vigorously as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Everything from her suspected ambition to her laugh has been fair game .
Yet few would dismiss her as anything less than formidable .
She ’s hardly defined by her foibles .
In her presidential campaign , she did a fair job of getting in on the joke , laughing at herself in several settings and appearing with some of her top teasing tormenters ( like Jon Stewart on “ The Daily Show ” and Amy Poehler on “ Saturday Night Live ” ) .
New - on - the - scene politicians are more prone to being overtaken by their parodies .
“ Vice presidents can be particularly vulnerable , ” said Mr. Lichter , who mentions Vice President Dan Quayle as one who never fully recovered from the mockery that greeted his debut in 1988 .
It can also extend to running mates , like Adm. James Stockdale , Ross Perot ’s No. 2 , who today is better remembered for his doddering debate performance in 1992 than his heroic career .
Politicians at the center of sex scandals enter a particularly unforgiving punch - line purgatory .
( You think Mr. Stewart or Conan O’Brien are ever going to talk about John Edwards , Gary Hart or Eliot Spitzer for their policy ideas ? )
On the other hand , Vice President Dick Cheney has provided a lifetime supply of heart - attack and hunting - accident humor ( such fun genres ! ) , but will clearly go down as a serious , contentious and multidimensional figure in history .
“ There is a tipping point that politicians reach , ” said Bob Orben , who was head of White House speechwriting for Gerald R. Ford before writing comedy for the likes of Red Skelton and Dick Gregory .
Mr. Orben refers to America ’s “ comedy establishment , ” which he said was much more powerful today than it was in Mr. Ford ’s day .
“ You only had to overcome Johnny Carson back then , ” he said , and “ Saturday Night Live , ” too ( Chevy Chase ’s portrayal of Mr. Ford as physically clumsy marked the reputation of Mr. Ford , a former college football player , forever ) .

A trio of journalists who have a track record of documenting police abuse at political conventions were stopped and searched during the early morning hours in Minneapolis .
Police took their video equipment , cell phones , hard drive and notes about protests planned for next week ’s Republican National Convention .
No charges have been filed against the three , according to Mineapolis police spokesman Sgt. William Palmer .

It 's Friday night .
Our Pagan Cluster is sitting on the bluff of the Mississippi having our first real meeting , when Lisa gets a call .
The cops are raiding the Convergence Center , where we 're organizing meetings and trainings for the protests against the Republican National Convention .
It 's not a role play , the caller says .
It 's real .
Instantly , we jump up and hurry back the six or eight blocks to the old theater we are using for meetings , trainings and social gatherings .
I 've spent the last two days doing magical activism trainings , teaching people how to stay calm and grounded in emergency situations and when things get chaotic .
Now it 's time to put the training into practice .
Aaron , a tall , red - headed young man who could be one of my nephews strides along beside me .
" Are you grounded ? " I ask him .
He nods , and runs ahead .
Nobody can keep up with Lisa , who speeds ahead like an arrow , walking , not running , but still covering the ground quickly .
Andy and I trail behind .
We 're often street buddies , because we 're both big , slow , and supremely calm and stubborn , willing to wade into almost any situation and become the immovable object .
We 're stopped by a line of cops just before we reach the building .
T hey refuse to let us through , or to move their van which is blocking Scarecrow 's car .
There 's an investigation underway , they say , and wo n't say more .

Brush , our dear friend , is inside , having gone to a jail solidarity meeting , ironically enough .
So are two very young people who had just joined our cluster that night .
I try calling Brush 's cell phone , but get no reply .
We wait .
That 's what you do when the cops have guns trained on kids inside a building .
You wait , and witness , and make phone calls , and try to think of useful things to do .
We call lawyers .
We call politicians .
We try to call media .
We call friends who might know politicians and media .
Through the kitchen door , we can see young kids sitting on the floor , handcuffed .
We walk across the street , back , made more phone calls .
An ambulance is parked in front , and the paramedics head into the building , leaving a gurney ready .
Susu , from her car around the corner , reports that the cops have been grabbing pedestrians from the street , forcing them down to the ground , handcuffing them .
Song , one of the local organizers , calls her City Council member .
She wants to call the Mayor , Chris Coleman , who has promised that St. Paul will be as welcoming to protestors as to delegates , but no one has his home number .
What I have forgotten to tell people at the training is how much of an action is just this : tense , boring waiting , with a knot of anxiety in your stomach and your feet starting to hurt .
Song talks to a helpful neighbor , who 's come over to find out what 's happening .
He knows where the mayor lives , says it 's just a few blocks away , and draws us a map .
We decide to go and call on the Mayor , who could call off the cops .
About five of us troop down there , through the soft night and a neighborhood of comfortable homes and wide lawns on the bluffs above the Mississippi .
The Mayor 's house is a comfortable Dutch Colonial , and lights were on inside .
We decide that just a few of us will go to the door , so as not to look intimidating .
Song is a round , soft - bodied middle - aged woman with a sweet face .
Ellen is a tiny brunette with a gap - toothed smile , and Lisa , formidable organizer though she is , looks slight and unthreatening .
The rest of us hang back .
Someone opens the door .
Our friends have a conversation with the mayors ' wife , who is not pleased to be visited by constituents late at night , and who tells us we should call the office .
The Mayor , she says , is asleep , and she will not wake him up .
We think a mayor who was doing his job would get up and go see what 's going on .
Nonetheless , we head back to the convergence space .
A protestor has been released from the building .
A small crowd has gathered across the street , and Fox News has arrived .
They interview Song , who does her first ever Fox media spot .
She tells them the truth - that people were in there watching movies - a documentary about Meridel Le Seuer .
Meridel would be proud , and I 'm glad she is with us in some form .
One by one , protestors trickle out .
Now we get more pieces of the story .
The cops burst in , with no warning .
They drew their guns on everyone - including a five year old child who was there with his mother , and forced everyone down on the floor .
It was terrifying .
They had a warrant , apparently , from the county , not the city , to search for ' bomb making materials . '
They were searching everyone in the building , then one by one releasing them as they found nothing .
They continue to find nothing , as we wait through long hours .
Meanwhile , more and more media arrives .
These cops are not as creative as the DC cops during our first mobilization there against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
Those cops confiscated the lunchtime soup - which included onions and chili powder , claiming they were materials for home made pepper spray .
We wait until the last person gets out .
He 's a twenty year old who the cops have accused of stealing his own backpack - but apparently they relented .
And now it 's morning .
I wake up to the news that cops have been raiding houses where activists are staying , bursting in with the same bogus warrant and arresting people , including a four year old child .
They 've arrested people at the Food Not Bombs house - a group dedicated to feeding protestors and the homeless .
They 've arrested others , presumably just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
The Poor Peoples ' Campaign , which had set up camp at Harriet Island , a park in the middle of the Mississippi , has also been harassed , its participants ordered to disperse and its organizers arrested .
Let me be perfectly clear here - all of us here are planning nonviolent protests against an administration which is responsible for immense violence , bombs that have destroyed whole countries , and hundreds of thousands of deaths .
This is the America that eight years of the Bush administration have brought us , a place where dissent is no longer tolerated , where pre-emptive strikes have become the strategy of choice for those who hold power , where any group can be accused of ' bombmaking ' or ' terrorism ' on no evidence whatsoever in order to deter dissent .
Please stand with us .
Because it could be your home they are raiding , next .
Call the Mayors of St. Paul and Minneapolis .
Tell them you are outraged by these attacks on dissent .
Urge them to let Poor People encamp and to let dissent be heard .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant are about three times as likely as other women to have a baby with at least one birth defect , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday .

A variety of different birth defects are associated with mothers who have type 1 diabetes , also called juvenile diabetes , or type 2 diabetes , the most common form of the disease that is linked to obesity , the researchers said .
These included defects of the heart , brain , spine , limbs , kidneys and gastrointestinal tract , penile and ear abnormalities and cleft palate , the researchers wrote in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology .
“ This study documents the fact that diabetes is associated with a wider range of defects than we had been aware of in the past , ” Dr. Adolfo Correa of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , who led the study , said in a telephone interview .
Correa said it appears that the condition called gestational diabetes is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects .
This is a short - lived form of diabetes that can appear in a woman during pregnancy , but blood sugar levels usually return to normal shortly after the baby is born .
But Correa said some cases diagnosed as gestational diabetes may actually be type 2 diabetes that simply had gone unrecognized until the pregnancy .
The study involved 13,030 babies born with birth defects around the United States and 4,895 babies without birth defects , and the researchers determined which of the mothers had diabetes before becoming pregnant .
Women with diabetes had triple the risk of having a baby with birth defects than other women , the researchers said .
“ Preconception care is not reaching all women with diabetes the way it ought to .
And given the increasing prevalence of diabetes , including diabetes among women of reproductive age in this country and in many parts of the world , this is a call to action to the clinical and public health communities to come up with more effective prevention measures , ” Correa said .
Correa said doctors who know a woman who is pregnant or planning to become pregnant may consider steps including weight control , diet , exercise and medications .
When debating someone who believes in the fundamental components of the Christian narrative , i.e. the choice by man to eat the apple , the fall , original sin , and the subsequent return to God , I choose to focus not on the specifics but rather on the first and most important events .
These are the creation of man , and man ’s choice to eat of the tree of knowledge .
Why did God create man ?
Why does an omnipotent and omniscient being create us in the first place ?
Did he want companionship ?
Was he bored ?
Was he curious as to the limits of his own powers ?
None of these explanations fit with an all - knowing and all - powerful being .
Something there has to be missing in order to desire to create such a lowly and fragile life form in the first place .
Why create man with a desire for anything other than God ?
Quite simply , if the purpose of man is to love God , then why not create him just to do that , and with no desire to do something else ?
Even worse than creating man to desire something else ( step 2 ) , why create an perfect source of that which he desires ( the tree of knowledge ) and then create a third actor ( Lucifer ) to taunt him into making the wrong choice ?
Is this not the very definition of “ set up for failure ” ?
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it : for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die .
— Genesis 2:17
The Free Will Gambit
Seeing that this is horribly illogical , all Christians are trained to fall back on the specious argument of free will .
The idea is that despite the fact that God put everything in place for man to fail , he also gave man free will .
So he had the option to choose correctly , and he should therefore have made the right choice .
This is absurd .
Let ’s try another , scaled - down version of this experiment that will prove how silly this concept really is .
Sit a two - year - old in a high chair with candy on one side of their tray and spinach on the other side , and stand back with an open hand .
If the baby reaches for the candy , slap the hell out of it .
Ah , but that ’s not fair because ….. why ?
Because babies are programmed by evolution to prefer sweet tastes , so it ’s unfair to ask them to choose the right one because it ’s not as pleasurable ?
Ok , here ’s a better question : who determines what tastes good and what does n’t ?
Right , God does .
And who determined how attractive the tree of knowledge was to man in the garden ?
Right , God did .
And who decides how attractive “ loving God instead ” , i.e. “ spinach ” was to man at that very moment in the garden ?
Right again –God .
So if God controls all the variables , where ’s the free will ?
Desires > Free Will : The Well Scenario
Free will is subservient to the strength of natural desires .
If I just spent three days in a well , with no food or water , when I get rescued I have the choice to a ) drink water and eat food , or b ) go ride a bike .
Are those equal choices for your supposedly “ free ” will ?
Or how about you have the same well scenario , but this time you have two options when you get out : a ) consume food and water , or b ) go help the homeless at your local shelter .
Oh , you ’d choose food and water ?
Selfish .
You had the option –help others or indulge your own dark desires .
You chose wrong .
It ’s the same in the garden .
Here ’s what God essentially offered :
You can either a ) stay with your creator in love an harmony forever , or you can go with Satan and Eve to Earth , where you ’ll learn about a billion interesting and naughty things ( which I programmed you to find attractive ) .
Oh , but if you choose the one that I designed you to find irresistible ( and that I hired Satan to seduce you towards ) , I ’ll punish you …
It ’s the choice at the well all over again .
God determines the strength of every single one of your desires .
Is it your “ choice ” , as a man , to find platinum blonde women attractive ?
Is it your “ choice ” to like the taste of steak or beer ?
Or , even better , assuming you ’re a heterosexual male , could you decide to be gay right now ?
Could you exercise your free will and simply choose to like men instead of women ?
No , not really .
So how much of a choice is it , really , when you ’re asked whether you want to have sex with an attractive woman or an attractive man ?
Where is your free will when the directions and strengths of your desires are determined for you ?
So I ask again : if God controlled all of the following in the garden …
The attractiveness of staying with God
The attractiveness of the tree of knowledge
The seductiveness of Lucifer
The gullibility of Eve
How likely Adam would be to do what Eve had already done
… and we all agree that God did control these things …how did man really make a choice at all ?
Simple answer : he did n’t .
Lucky for us the story is n’t true at all .
It ’s nothing more than one of thousands of these highly similar narratives created by man throughout history .
99 % of the world accepts that 99 % of the other nearly identical stories are completely untrue , so it ’s only a matter of time before we clear up that last 1 % . :

On a chilly October night in 1964 , the shipping forecast warned of fog on the Thames .
Just after midnight , an East German freighter , the MV Magdeburg , slipped out of her Dagenham dock and headed slowly down river .
On deck were 42 Leyland buses bound for Cuba .
Coming the other way was the Yamashiro Maru , a Japanese ship , sailing empty .
The ships met at 1.52 am .
The Magdeburg was making the tight turn around Broadness Point when the Yamashiro Maru ploughed into her starboard side at more than 10 knots , holing her below the waterline and pushing her across the river .
' It was an accident , an act of God , ' insisted Keith Toms , a tug crewman on the Thames that night .
And that was the conclusion .
No one was killed , there was no inquiry , no one was accountable and only Leyland Motors , forced to replace the buses , suffered .
Now a historian has found documents that add weight to the suspicions of academics that the ship was rammed at the behest of the CIA - as part of an effort to sabotage anyone breaking the US embargo on Fidel Castro 's Cuba .
With the Americans threatening to blacklist any shipowner breaking the ' transportation blockade ' , Leyland Motors decided to use an East German ship .
It was in the maritime archives of the former German Democratic Republic that John McGarry found evidence given by Gordon Greenfield , the British pilot of the Magdeburg , stating that the Japanese ship broke international law by navigating the wrong way and giving misleading signals .
The captain and pilot of the Yamashiro Maru refused to speak .
McGarry believes a crime was committed .
' I felt that the question of CIA involvement might be resolved by an examination of the pilots ' logs which were supposed to be stored at Trinity House and in the Port of London Archives .
They can not be found .
The East German papers show Greenfield was deceived by someone on the Yamashiro Maru who sounded a single siren blast before the collision , an intention to pass port to port , ' he said .
Greenfield said in his statement : ' The Yamashiro Maru appeared to sail towards the south of the middle channel , but I interpreted her exchange of signals to mean that she was about to turn to starboard in order to pass me on her port side .
At this time there seemed to be no danger of a collision . '
Tracked down 44 years later , Greenfield said : ' Given the atmosphere of the day , I suppose it's not surprising people read something into what happened but there 's no truth in it , there was no blame attached . '
He did agree that , despite reports of thick fog , visibility was so good that the two ships could see each other clearly well before Broadness Point .
In 1975 , Washington Post reporters Jack Anderson and Les Whitten cited sources who claimed that a British intelligence wiretap on Cuban offices in London gave the CIA the Magdeburg 's movements , despite two Prime Ministers , Alec Douglas - Home and Harold Wilson , backing the export deal engineered by Leyland 's famed salesman Donald [ later Lord ] Stokes .
Anderson , a Pulitzer prize - winning journalist , is dead , but Whitten , 80 , told The Observer that they had two sources .
' Jack 's contacts were in the CIA and my contacts were in the National Security Agency .
I do n't remember a lot but I do know our sources were pretty good , the best really . '
Harold Elletson , director of the New Security Foundation in Berlin , said : ' It would be naive to think that the CIA would n't dare sink an East German ship in the vital estuary of a Nato ally .
They were under pressure to get results and they had a huge budget for sabotage .
In 1962 the British freighter Newlane was machine - gunned loading Cuban sugar .
The CIA poisoned 14,135 bags of Cuban sugar on the British ship Streatham Hill in 1962 in Puerto Rico . '
Douglas - Home backed Leyland and President Lyndon Johnson refused to speak to him .
In April 1964 , minister Rab Butler was called to see Johnson .
' His reward was a tongue - lashing , ' wrote Anthony Howard in the Spectator , ' during which the great , glowering figure behind the desk reached in his pocket to produce a wad of dollar bills which he flourished as he instructed Her Majesty 's Britannic Foreign Secretary to come to him in future if his country wanted a cash handout rather than go selling buses to Cuba . '
Anthony Glees , professor of intelligence studies at Buckingham University , said : ' That it was a deliberate sinking does n't sound entirely implausible .
I 've a very low estimation of the CIA and its work throughout the Cold War - it 's a history of failure .
What would have been inconsistent is that they had an operation in the Thames they got away with . '
But perhaps Magdeburg 's controversial cargo was a coincidence .
Keith Toms , then a 19 - year - old deck hand , said : ' It was frightening , a ship like that turning over .
I remember people crying out for help .
Trinity House , the pilots ' union body , was a very powerful body .
No one would be castigated .
People accepted that accidents happen .
It was such a busy river , and even without fog collisions happen in daylight .
I was surprised it sank , you would n't get enough force in a normal collision . '
Dr Kristian Gustafson , CIA historian at Brunel University , was sceptical : ' What the cousins did n't do was spray in each other 's countries .
But was America irrational about Cuba ?
Absolutely .
People did crazy things .'
Matt " Metafilter " Haughey 's laid out a 10 - point plan for winning the nerd vote that I heartily endorse — this is a platform I 'd stand up and salute if any politician had the guts to endorse it .
The points are : Broadband everywhere , universal healthcare , no federal tax on Internet purchases , renewed commitment to education , renewed commitment to science , real changes to transportation , early voting by mail , revamping copyright , a better job from the patent office , and open government .
1. Broadband Everywhere .
I want crazy South Korea / Japan style broadband I 've heard about for years : 100 Mbps ( upload and download ) fiber connections for less than $ 50 / month with unlimited bandwidth and the ability to run your own servers .
I know the US is a big spread out country and it makes this stuff somewhat difficult / costly , but it 's an ambitious goal with a ton of payoff .
We do n't have manufacturing jobs in the US anymore : we do n't make things , we do n't build things , we do n't sew things here , but we do have lots of ideas and inventions .
The economy of the future in the US is going to be intertwined with the internet and if every man , woman , and child in America has all the internet access they could ever need and could quickly program , build , and deploy their own stuff on their own mega - fast lines , we'd have a million and one programmers and designers and crafters and more contributing to a new vibrant future economy .
If fiber everywhere is too much , at least get 3G coverage in more places .
Vote Obama , speed second coming
Just off the press release wire :
HOUSTON , Oct. 22 /PRNewswire -USNewswire / -- Dr. K.A. Paul , the man the New Republic magazine called the world 's most popular Christian evangelist , today endorsed Senator Barack Obama for President of the U.S. ...
" Number one , speaking from an evangelical perspective , the current administration , I believe , has delayed the second coming of Jesus , " he said .
Hundreds of people took to the streets , Haaretz said ( Image : www.panet.co.il)
Riots have broken out in the mixed city of Acre , reportedly triggered when an Israeli Arab man drove his car during the Yom Kippur religious holiday .
Dozens of cars and shops were damaged as hundreds of people took to the streets , Haaretz newspaper reported .
For Jews , Yom Kippur is a sombre day of fasting , during which it is considered offensive to drive in much of Israel .
The Arab man was reportedly attacked by youths who said he was making noise intentionally , Haaretz said .
The Arab man is reported to have said he was simply driving to a property he owned in the eastern part of the city .
Police used force to disperse rioters ( Image : www.panet.co.il)
Most of Israel comes to a standstill on Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement - the holiest day in the Jewish calendar .
Streets are deserted except for a few pedestrians , cyclists and skateboarders , during the 25 - hour fast which this year began on Wednesday at 1640 ( 1440 GMT ) .
Extensive damage
The unrest erupted around midnight local time ( 2200 GMT ) , with hundreds of people pouring onto the streets as news spread of the alleged assault , Haaretz reported .
A crowd gathered on Ben Ami Street , a key commercial street in the city , and caused " extensive damage " to vehicles and property in " large - scale " Jewish - Arab rioting , the report said .
Police used force to disperse the rioters , it added .
Shops and cars were vandalised ( Image : www.panet.co.il)
" This is a very serious incident that the city of Acre has not seen the likes of in recent years and we will deal with all the rioters and those who take the law into their own hands with an iron fist , " the head of the Acre police station , Chief Superintendent Avi Edri , told Haaretz .
About one third of Acre 's population of almost 50,000 residents are Israeli Arabs , with the highest concentration in the Old City .
Israeli Arabs are people of Palestinian origin whose forbears remained in Israel after the foundation of the country in 1948 .
They number about one million - about one - fifth of the Israeli population - and although they have full rights as Israeli citizens , human rights groups say they face discrimination and exclusion .

TROY , N.Y .
— The hallowed halls of academia are not the place you would expect to find someone obsessed with evil ( although some students might disagree ) .
But it is indeed evil — or rather trying to get to the roots of evil — that fascinates Selmer Bringsjord , a logician , philosopher and chairman of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 's Department of Cognitive Science here .
He 's so intrigued , in fact , that he has developed a sort of checklist for determining whether someone is demonic , and is working with a team of graduate students to create a computerized representation of a purely sinister person .
" I 've been working on what is evil and how to formally define it , " says Bringsjord , who is also director of the Rensselaer AI & Reasoning Lab ( RAIR ) .
" It 's creepy , I know it is . "
To be truly evil , someone must have sought to do harm by planning to commit some morally wrong action with no prompting from others ( whether this person successfully executes his or her plan is beside the point ) .
The evil person must have tried to carry out this plan with the hope of " causing considerable harm to others , " Bringsjord says .
Finally , " and most importantly , " he adds , if this evil person were willing to analyze his or her reasons for wanting to commit this morally wrong action , these reasons would either prove to be incoherent , or they would reveal that the evil person knew he or she was doing something wrong and regarded the harm caused as a good thing .
Bringsjord 's research builds on earlier definitions put forth by San Diego State University philosophy professor J. Angelo Corlett as well as the late sociopolitical philosophers and psychologists , Joel Feinberg and Erich Fromm , but most significantly by psychiatrist and author M. Scott Peck in his 1983 book , People of the Lie , The Hope for Healing Human Evil .
After reading
Peck 's tome about clinically evil people , " I thought it would be interesting to come up with formal structures that define evil , " Bringsjord says , " and , ultimately , to create a purely evil character the way a creative writer would . "
He and his research team began developing their computer representation of evil by posing a series of questions beginning with the basics — name , age , sex , etcetera — and progressing to inquiries about this fictional person 's beliefs and motivations .
This exercise resulted in " E , " a computer character first created in 2005 to meet the criteria of Bringsjord 's working definition of evil .
Whereas the original E was simply a program designed to respond to questions in a manner consistent with Bringsjord 's definition , the researchers have since given E a physical identity :
It 's a relatively young , white man with short black hair and dark stubble on his face .
Bringsjord calls E's appearance " a meaner version " of the character Mr. Perry in the 1989 movie Dead Poets Society .
" He is a great example of evil , " Bringsjord says , adding , however , that he is not entirely satisfied with this personification and may make changes .
The researchers have placed E in his own virtual world and written a program depicting a scripted interview between one of the researcher 's avatars and E .
In this example , E is programmed to respond to questions based on a case study in Peck 's book that involves a boy whose parents gave him a gun that his older brother had used to commit suicide .
The researchers programmed E with a degree of artificial intelligence to make " him " believe that he ( and not the parents ) had given the pistol to the distraught boy , and then asked E a series of questions designed to glean his logic for doing so .
The result is a surreal simulation during which Bringsjord 's diabolical incarnation attempts to produce a logical argument for its actions :
The boy wanted a gun , E had a gun , so E gave the boy the gun .
Bringsjord and his team by the end of the year hope to have completed the fourth generation of E , which will be able to use artificial intelligence and a limited set of straightforward English ( no slang , for example ) to " speak " with computer users .
Following the path of a true logician , Bringsjord 's interest in the portrayal of virtuousness and evil in literature led to his interest in software that helps writers develop ideas and create stories ; this , in turn , spurred him to develop his own software for simulating human behavior , both good and odious , says Barry Smith , a distinguished professor of bioinformatics and ontology at the State University of New York at Buffalo who is familiar with Bringsjord 's work .
" He 's known as someone on the fringe of philosophy and computer science . "
Bringsjord and Smith both have an interest in finding ways to better understand human behavior , and their work has attracted the attention of the intelligence community , which is seeking ways to successfully analyze the information they gather on potential terrorists .
" To solve problems in intelligence analysis , you need more accurate representations of people , " Smith says .
" Selmer is trying to build really good representations of human beings in all of their subtlety . "
Bringsjord acknowledges that the endeavor to create pure evil , even in a software program , does raise ethical questions , such as , how researchers could control an artificially intelligent character like E if " he " was placed in a virtual world such as Second Life , a Web - based program that allows people to create digital representations of themselves and have those avatars interact in a number of different ways .
" I would n't release E or anything like it , even in purely virtual environments , without engineered safeguards , " Bringsjord says .
These safeguards would be a set of ethics written into the software , something akin to author Isaac Asimov 's " Three Laws of Robotics " that prevent a robot from harming humans , requires a robot to obey humans , and instructs a robot to protect itself — as long as that does not violate either or both of the first two laws .
" Because I have a lot of faith in this approach , " he says , " E will be controlled . "
Pity the poor frogs : they 're one of the most endangered group of vertebrates on the planet , and new research shows that two of the factors in their plight are common , everyday farm chemicals .
The study shows that atrazine , a weedkiller that 's widely used in agricultural areas , not only boosts the levels of parasitic flatworms in frog ponds , it also decreases tadpoles ' ability to fight off infections .
If that was n't bad enough , previous research has found that runoff from phosphate fertilizers also boosts parasite levels .
Taken together , researchers say , the weedkiller and the fertilizers are hitting frogs with a double whammy .
Amphibian populations around the world have been declining in recent decades , with many species on the brink of extinction .
Infection with any of several species of tiny flatworms , known as trematodes , can trigger debilitating limb deformities in frogs .
Severe infections can kill the amphibians .
The question was why high rates of those deformities — and , presumably , trematode infections — began showing up across the nation in the mid-1990s [ Science News ] .
The new findings suggest that the growing prevalence of the weedkiller atrazine in corn-growing regions since that time may be partly to blame for the woeful state of American amphibians .
In the study , published in Nature [ subscription required ] , researchers found that the weedkiller and the phosphate fertilizers both played a role in causing algae blooms in frog ponds , which feed the snails that serve as temporary hosts for the flatworms -- so when snail populations go up , so do flatworm populations .
Ecologist Pieter Johnson comments that
it 's surprising that atrazine would stimulate algal growth .
" It 's an example of complex ecological interactions that might not be anticipated , " he says .
Why would an herbicide lead to more algae ?
Apparently , the kind of algae favored by the snails recovers faster than competing algae [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
The new study also showed that frogs that are exposed to atrazine have suppressed immune systems , and therefore can't fight off the flatworms effectively .
Atrazine 's use is somewhat controversial :
The chemical was banned on fears of groundwater contamination by the European Union in 2004 .
But it is still commonly used in the US ; in 2006 , the country 's Environmental Protection Agency concluded there was not enough evidence to suggest the chemical was harmful to humans .
" I doubt that further documentation of atrazine 's harmful effects on frogs will prompt a ban in the US anytime soon , " says Pieter Johnson [ Chemistry World ] .

Henry Waxman ’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , a persistent thorn in the side of private military and security firms , has zeroed in on a new target : the use of foreign tax havens by government contractors operating in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The investigation follows recent reports that KBR has used an offshore subsidiary to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in payroll taxes , as well as MoJo ’s reporting on Blackwater ’s Barbados - based sister company , Greystone , whose local address and telephone number in Bridgetown trace back to a firm that specializes in shielding corporate revenues from U.S. tax authorities .
This week , Waxman ’s committee fired off letters to 15 companies , including KBR , Triple Canopy , DynCorp , CACI , Science Applications International Corporation , EOD Technology , and the Prince Group ( the holding company that owns Blackwater and Erik Prince ’s other business ventures ) , asking whether these contractors have any “ subsidiaries or other affiliated entities that were incorporated in any of the 39 foreign jurisdictions designated as tax havens by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ” — and demanding detailed information on their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates if the answer to that question is yes .
Among the information Waxman is seeking :
1 . A description of which persons or entities hold ownership interests in the entity ;
2 . A list of contracts under which the entity provided goods or services to any agency of the United States government between January 1 , 2002 , and the present , whether directly or indirectly ;
3. Copies of contracts , subcontracts , memoranda of understanding , or other agreements between the entity and your company or any of its affiliates ;
4 . A description of the gross profits the entity earned between January 1 , 2002 , and the present , through the performance of the contracts responsive to question 2 above , and the percentage of these profits that was allocated to the foreign jurisdiction in which it was incorporated ;
5 . A description o f the number o f U.S. and foreign nationals paid by the entity between January 1 , 2002 , and the present , to perform services pursuant to the contracts responsive to question 2 above ; the location where the workers performed the work ; the categories of jobs these workers performed ; the number of U.S. national personnel who worked within each job category ; and the average compensation ( in U.S. dollars ) paid to U.S. national personnel working within each job category ;
These customarily secretive companies will likely be reticent to divulge this type of information — and it remains to be seen how forthcoming the targets of Waxman ’s investigation will be with committee investigators .
Prince , for his part , responded icily when asked how much Blackwater earns in profits during an oversight hearing last October .
“ We ’re a private company , and there ’s a key word there — private , ” he said .
( Prince ’s refusal to disclose his company ’s profits so infuriated committee member Chris Murphy , a freshman Democrat from Connecticut , that he introduced a bill , which passed the House on Wednesday , requiring companies that derive more than 80 percent of their revenues from government contracts , totaling more than $ 25 million , to make their profits public . )
Given Prince ’s past reluctance to divulge financial information in particular , I asked an oversight source about the level of cooperation the committee expects from the companies it ’s investigating .
“ We expect them to comply , ” the source replied confidently .
The source also said that it was too soon to tell whether the investigation would lead to a hearing .
If the Prince Group and the other companies that received inquiries from Waxman do indeed provide the committee with the requested information , it will open a window not only on how much profit these firms clear on their government contracts ( and how much of those profits have been shielded from U.S. taxes ) , but on who these companies employ .
Increasingly , military contractors have turned to so - called third country nationals — workers who hail from the developing world and earn far less than their American or European counterparts — to staff their contracts .
In Blackwater ’s case , it has subcontracted with its Prince Group affiliate , Greystone , to provide third world recruits to work static security gigs , guarding a variety of military installations in Iraq .
( These foreign personnel , in turn , are typically contracted to Greystone through third party companies , among them Bogota - based ID Systems . )
Greystone , though , is not the only company Prince has established offshore .
He has based at least two other companies in a country that is a well - known tax haven .
According to records maintained by the North Carolina Secretary of State , Neptune Solutions LLC [ PDF ] and Neptune Holdings 1 LLC [ PDF ] , both of which list mailing addresses at Blackwater ’s Moyock , North Carolina headquarters and Blackwater president Gary Jackson as their manager , were incorporated in the Marshall Islands , located in the southwest Pacific , in July 2006 .
A little over a year later and weeks after Prince testified before the oversight committee , the Blackwater CEO filed applications to withdraw the companies ’ LLC status in North Carolina .
It remains unclear whether these companies are still operating , or what role they play , or were intended to , within Prince ’s private security empire .
Perhaps , thanks to Waxman , this is something we ’ll soon find out .

My friend Scott Johnson of Power Line has a column today in the Christian Science Monitor on the history of redistributionism and its links to the income tax .
Barack Obama ’s accidentally revealing answer to Joe the Plumber this week did not occur in a historical vacuum .
In fact , the history of the income tax shows it to be just the kind of instrument Obama describes , with much the same intent :
Until the Civil War , the idea of a tax on individual incomes would have seemed preposterous to most Americans .
Only as an emergency wartime measure did Congress adopt an income tax in the 1860s , and the measure was allowed to lapse with little fanfare in 1872 .
The modern income tax begins with the Progressive era in American politics .
In an influential 1889 article titled “ The Owners of the United States , ” crusading attorney Thomas Shearman argued that the lion ’s share of the country ’s wealth was in a limited number of hands .
If an income tax were not adopted , he warned , within 30 years “ the United States of America will be substantially owned ” by fewer than 50,000 people .
…
Progressives condemned the Constitution as an instrument crafted by the rich to protect their selfish interests ( J. Allen Smith ) , and a document rendered obsolete by intellectual progress in the century since its drafting ( Woodrow Wilson ) .
Frenzied attacks on “ the rich ” and “ the wealthy ” culminated in the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913 , authorizing federal taxation of income from all sources without limit .
The same year , historian Charles Beard published “ An Economic Interpretation of the United States Constitution . ”
This book – later debunked – suggested that the Constitution was the handiwork of a propertied elite serving its own interests .
Such sentiment has poisoned American political thought ever since .
Wilson is an interesting analogue to this campaign .
Like Barack Obama , Wilson had little experience in electoral politics , having spent most of his career as an academic .
Like Sarah Palin , he had two years of experience as a governor before running on a national ticket ( the top half in Wilson ’s case , obviously ) .
Like John McCain , Wilson tried to push reform and limited government in opposition to his own party , and like Palin , had to fight a substantial state “ machine ” to get it , although Wilson was somewhat less successful than Palin .
In any event , the income tax passed almost a century ago was supposed to limit the influence of the rich by forcibly redistributing their wealth .
One has to proclaim the redistribution , at least , as a success .
As Scott writes , 40 % of all income taxes get paid by the top 1 % of filers , and those paid in total the same amount as the bottom 95 % of all filers .
We ’ve grown so accustomed to the “ progressive ” tax system ( which has two distinct and accurate meanings ) that we no longer question whether this is actually good policy — at least not until a Joe the Plumber speaks up .
Obama is very fond of the number 95 , especially in terms of percentages .
We ’ve had the progressive income tax for 95 years , and progressives still want to soak the rich even more than they do now .
Has this succeeded in terms of efficient use of capital , or has it created a flabby , bureaucrat - ridden monster of a federal government to redistribute capital in about as costly a manner as can be imagined ?
The top 5 % of American earners now provides half of the funds for the federal government ; has that made them less influential , or more influential ?
In a way , we hear the same excuse for the system ’s failures as we heard from Communists after the fall of the Soviet Union .
They claimed that true Communism had never been tried , and the redistributionists now claim that we have never done redistribution on a scale large enough for it to succeed .
Both experiments show that both concepts are failures in and of themselves .
What ’s more , redistributionism opposes the American foundational concept of private property and assumes that all property essentially belongs to the government , which then allows citizens to keep a share — a share determined by bureaucrats in Washington .
It ’s time to end this experiment , and send the redistributionists packing .
BEIJING 
Wait until next year .
Scientists trying to save one of the world ’s most endangered species of freshwater turtles say waiting is their only recourse after a complicated attempt to mate two elderly turtles during this year ’s breeding season ended without producing any offspring .
The fate of the Yangtze giant soft - shell turtle seems especially uncertain because only one female is known to exist  an 80 - year - old turtle with a leathery shell that lived without notice for a half century inside a zoo in Changsha , the capital of Hunan Province , in southern China .
Only when scientists discovered her existence last year did it become clear that a chance remained to save her species .
In May , scientists drove her more than 600 miles to a zoo in the city of Suzhou .
There , a male turtle estimated to be 100 years old awaited her .
He had been the last known male of the species , though in recent months scientists discovered two more males in Vietnam .
Gerald Kuchling , a prominent herpetologist helping to oversee the mating program , said the male and female turtles were introduced to each other on May 7 .
AS THE global financial system fights desperately for survival , few people are more justified in saying “ I told you so ” than Jeremy Grantham , a Cassandra of the investment community since long before Nouriel Roubini became Doctor Doom .
Back in 2000 , The Economist reported Mr Grantham 's comments at an event to mark the 75th anniversary of the publication of “ The Great Gatsby ” .
The wealthy characters in the novel were “ completely shallow , ” he said — precisely the sort of “ ineffable lightweights ” who would have been unable to resist the temptation to join a crowd rushing into a stock market , and would accordingly have paid the price in the 1929 crash .
As the article concluded , “ He fears that a similar fate awaits today 's investors . ”
GMO
Jeremy Grantham of GMO
Mr Grantham 's scepticism cost him plenty of business during the bullish years , as foolish investors preferred to share Gatsby 's belief in “ the green light , the orgiastic future ” .
Yet , as The Economist reported this August , the mostly bearish ten - year forecasts issued in 1998 by Mr Grantham 's firm , GMO , “ proved almost entirely correct ” .
So Mr Grantham , a Brit based in New England , knows what he is talking about , which makes his latest GMO letter , “ Reaping the Whirlwind ” , a must - read .
He predicts further house - price falls in America and Britain , a sharp reduction in corporate profits everywhere , and that the Chinese government will “ stumble ” faced with the “ spectacularly complicated task of maintaining the highest economic growth rate in history ” .
Still , he admits to turning bullish on American shares , like another great investor , Warren Buffett , who last week wrote an op -ed in the New York Times advising people to buy them now .
“ If you wait for the robins , ” Mr Buffett counselled , “ spring will be over . ”
Mr Grantham admits he will probably fall foul of the Curse of the Value Investor , which is buying too soon .
Yet he is convinced that “ by October 10th global equities were cheap on an absolute basis and cheaper than at any time in 20 years . ”
The most entertaining part of the letter is entitled Where Was Our Leadership ?
Mr Grantham asks ,
“ Why did our leaders encourage the deregulation , encourage the leveraging and risk - taking , and completely miss or dismiss the growing signs of trouble and what we described as the ‘ near certainties ' of bubbles breaking ? ”
Why , indeed ?
He offers two theories .
The first he calls Career Risk and Bubbles Breaking .
The bosses of banks continued piling on leverage and taking ever greater risks because they felt they would be fired if they did not .
“ It 's what I call the Goldman Sachs Effect : Goldman increased its leverage and its profit margins shot into the stratosphere .
Eager to keep up , other banks , with less talent and energy than Goldman , copied them with ultimately disastrous consequences .
And woe betide the CEO who missed the game and looked like an old fuddy - duddy .
The Board would simply kick him out , in the name of protecting the stockholders ' future profits , and hire in more of a gunslinger from , say , Credit Suisse . ”
The second theory reinforces the first , by combining the pressure for ever greater success with the selection of bosses ill - equipped to handle it .
Mr Grantham believes that chief executives are “ picked for their left - brain skills — focus , hard work , decisiveness , persuasiveness , political skills , and , if you are lucky , analytical skills and charisma . ”
Great American executives are not picked for patience , he points out , plausibly enough .
“ Indeed , if they could even spell the word they would be fired .
They are not paid to put their feet up or waste time thinking about history and the long - term future ; they are paid to be decisive and to act now . ”
Only the rare person unconcerned with climbing the ladder , such as Mr Grantham , spoke out about the looming dangers .
( Turning bearish before the crowd certainly can involve serious career risk — recall the late Tony Dye , who in March 2000 was fired as a chief investment officer at Phillips & Drew because he had moved out of what he rightly believed were overvalued equities and thus prompted many of the firm 's clients to quit . )
According to Mr Grantham , such people “ have the patience of Job .
They are also all right - brained : more intuitive , more given to developing odd theories , wallowing in historical data , and taking their time .
They are almost universally interested — even obsessed — with outlier events , and unique , new , and different combinations of factors .
These ruminations take up a good chunk of their time .
Do such thoughts take more than a few seconds of time for the great CEOs who , to the man , missed everything that was new and different ?
Unfortunately for all of us , it was the new and different this time that just happened to be vital . ”
Ironically , those now in charge of the giants of the financial system are suffering from excessive risk aversion , scared of lending even to the bluest of chips .
Now , says Mr Grantham , left - brained bosses — not the sort of cautious bureaucrat likely to appeal to the governments now overseeing the financial system — are just what is needed .
“ The typical CEO is precisely equipped to deal with emergencies and digging out .
Thus , Paulson was just the man to miss the point , but equally just the man — or at least a typically good one — to deal with a complicated crisis under stress . ”
As Mr Grantham ( or , to be precise , his wife ) observes , the right - and left - brained should have come together on boards of banks , to keep fear and greed appropriately balanced .
Yet , Sarbanes - Oxley and countless other initiatives intended to improve corporate governance seemed to have been largely ignored in the boardrooms of Wall Street , the City of London and Zurich .
Let 's give the last word to Mr Grantham , who deserves his moment of schadenfreude : “ What a shame that we have typically subverted this balance into a CEO fan club of old friends and mutual backscratchers . ”
A monster roars all day – and much of the evening – next to my Beirut home .
My landlord Mustafa sits in his little soft drinks store downstairs with his fingers in his ears .
I work in The Independent 's office , windows tight shut , as a slurry of fine powder pours below the frame , coating archives and books , laptop and printer ( and Fisk ) , with a patina of brown , greasy dust .
Yes , I have a building site right next door , where diggers roar in an effort to build a spanking new twin - towers apartment complex .
All over Beirut , it 's the same , the skyline constantly transformed by housing projects and high - rise office blocks .
Yup , that 's right .
In Lebanon , in a country whose name is still synonymous with war – and in a world where capitalism is enduring a collapse of biblical proportions – business is booming .
Now readers , I am not – I am absolutely not – advising you to invest in this little statelet , with its sectarian government and mass graves and squalid Palestinian refugee camps .
I am not an economist .
At school , I failed O - level maths three times and as a result lost an offered place at Liverpool University .
But someone needs to explain to me how this little Middle Eastern cabbage patch is bouncing along so happily amid the cyclones ripping through the world 's economy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Beirut 's Blombank has just boasted a record 34 per cent rise in profits in the first three quarters of this year .
The chairman of Audi Saradar Bank , who happens to be minister for the displaced in the Lebanese government , says that Lebanon is expected to record its highest GDP growth in many years .
House prices continue to soar .
And this in a nation that suffers a $ 45.5 bn public debt .
So out came the little leather - covered Fisk notebook this week to garner words of Lebanese wisdom from the men ( few women ) who know the secrets of the country 's financial miracle .
Well , it turns out the Audi bank did lose about $ 20 m with Lehman Brothers but made a hair 's - breadth escape from the Wachovia collapse because the maturity date on its $ 200 m deposit investment fell on 3 October .
In all , Lebanon 's 58 banks made about $ 750 m profit this year .
And why does this money look so safe ?
Because three years ago , the Lebanese Central Bank forbade all commercial banks to go into derivatives .
Not one Lebanese bank made any investments in US sub - prime mortgages .
Commercial banks , in fact , are prohibited from making real estate investments anywhere outside Lebanon .
Lebanon , of course , has no oil – or has it ?
Back in 1976 , when Ghassan Tueni was minister of petroleum , most of the world 's oil conglomerates showed interest to explore parcels of sea-bed off the coast between Batroun and the northern city of Tripoli .
But the day Lebanon was to open offices for the bids in Tripoli , fighting broke out there between Syria and the Palestinians , embracing the very area where staff would be working .
Then in 1980 , Lebanese economist Marwan Iskander suggested to then President Elias Sarkis that the exploration bids should be opened again .
Iskander offered a large Cuban cigar when he told me the Sarkis story .
For some reason , all Lebanese smoke cigars when they are talking about financial folly .
" When I made my suggestion , Sarkis turned to me and said : ' Look Marwan , the Lebanese are crazy without oil .
If we get oil , they 'll go out of their minds !
Anyway , if we did find oil , the Syrians are not going to allow us to export it . ' "
Today , the Syrians have – politically – returned to Lebanon and the Siniora government is in no hurry to discover oil reserves under the Mediterranean .
But the Lebanese may have a commodity as wealthy as oil : it is the only country in the world that has 35 - 40 per cent of its population working abroad , and they are sending home about $ 7.5 bn a year .
Lebanon has also received $ 1.3 bn of its $ 7.6 bn Paris aid commitments – which will total $ 7.6 bn after Lebanese government reforms .
Not to be mentioned , by the way , is the estimated $ 1bn which the Hizbollah militia receives from Iran each year .
So much for America 's ability to " staunch the flow of money to terrorist organisations " .
As for the public debt , no problem .
At least $ 24bn of the $ 45.4bn is in foreign currency and $ 21bn in Lebanese currency .
But 80 per cent of the foreign debt is held by Lebanese banks or individual Lebanese businessmen who have no interest in taking their own country into bankruptcy ; they are quite happy to go on taking their massive interest payments .
As for the internal debt , Siniora can print more money if anything goes wrong .
Phew , that 's the first time I 've ploughed into the profit and loss of this strange country .
In the hell - disaster of the Middle East , it 's almost comical to find that Lebanon – politically , a Rolls - Royce without wheels – manages to make ends meet .
Should the world learn anything from this ?
Next time we meet , I told Iskander on Thursday , he can define a " derivative " for me .
" No , " he said , " you can explain it to me ! "
How do the Lebanese do it ?
By being optimistic .
Surprisingly , few of them know T S Eliot 's dark warning to their ancestors , the Phoenicians .
In " Death by Water " , he wrote : " Phlebas the Phoenician , a fortnight dead , / Forgot the cry of gulls , and the deep sea swell /
And the profit and loss ./
A current under sea / Picked his bones in whispers / ... O you who turn to the wheel and look to windward , / Consider Phlebas , who was once handsome and tall as you . "
But who in Beirut cares about Phlebas under the Mediterranean ?
The day may come when the Lebanese can find , richer , darker treasures beneath his bones .

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .

Explanation :
The dark , inner shadow of planet Earth is called the umbra .
Shaped like a cone extending into space , the umbra has a circular cross section that can be most easily seen during a lunar eclipse .
For example , last Saturday the Full Moon slid across the northern edge of the umbra .
Entertaining moon watchers throughout Earth 's eastern hemisphere , the lunar passage created a deep but partial lunar eclipse .
This composite image uses successive pictures recorded during the eclipse from Athens , Greece to trace out a large part of the umbra 's curved edge .
The result nicely illustrates the relative size of the umbra 's cross section at the distance of the Moon , as well as the Moon 's path through the Earth 's shadow .

The Baltic Dry shipping index , which has been flashing amber signals about the world economy for the past couple of months , is telling us there is something going badly wrong because it is now stuck firmly on red .
The index , a proxy for world trade flows , suffered its second biggest - ever fall yesterday , to 11 % , which took it down under the $ 2,000 mark and it fell another 8 % today to $ 1,809 .
The drop means it has fallen more than 80 % since July 's peak of around $ 12,000 and is now at a three - year low .
The index has long been seen as a good leading indictor of future economic production levels because it charts the cost of freight movements in 26 of the world 's biggest shipping lanes of " dry " materials , such as coal , iron ore and grain which feed into the production of finished goods some weeks or months ahead .
Think back to the first part of the year and there was a boom in oil and commodities prices , which pushed up demand for the ships to carry them .
Now we seem to be stuck in the bust phase .
We know that oil and commodity prices have fallen sharply because demand has faded in the face of high prices and because the world economy is being deflated by the global financial crisis .
There is some hope today that the worst of the financial crisis may be over , thanks to the mass injections of capital into banks by governments in Europe and the US .
But the damage to the world economy is already a fact of life and the Baltic Dry is pointing to a further slowdown in both output and inflation in many of the world 's economies .
The index may also be telling us something scarier .
It may be telling us that the world 's great industrial powerhouse , China , could be in trouble and that its imports of raw materials are collapsing at a far greater pace than the slow slide in demand from the West for China 's finished goods would imply .
There have been increasing concerns about China this year .
It has been booming for years and growing , if the official figures are to be believed , at more than 10 % a year .
That has , in turn , given rise to a stockmarket and housing market boom which now look to be going pop , as ours have done .
The great Asian miracle economy might now be coming apart at the seams , in spite of the official figures suggesting everything is stillfine .
But the Chinese authorities cannot control the Baltic Dry .
The stock market is tanking , credit is dwindling , banks are collapsing and more people find themselves without a job or even a home .
The times of owning a big , fancy , gas - thirsty Lexus SUV have disappeared along with the market for mortgage - backed derivative securities .
If you 've any hope to survive to drive through the impending financiapocalypse , you 'll need a vehicle that 's both thrifty and utilitarian .
We 've culled the ten best vehicles from the suggestions of our would - be hobo commenters to help keep you rolling from soup kitchen to unemployment office .

10 . ) A Bike

It may not be as glamorous as a Rolls or as fast as even a Kia Rio , but a bike will help you glide past those gas shortages already starting to appear in parts of the southern US .
The only fuel is you , so you 're only limited by the meager diet of 1,200 calories a day you get from the soup kitchen and rummaging in dumpsters .
Put a milk crate on the back and you 'll have space for your remaining unbartered possessions .

They can't take your home if you run off with it in the middle of the night .
In that spirit , a small RV is a great option .
Easy to park in tight spaces ( abandoned caves ) and comparatively easy on the fuel , a classic and tiny Winnebago is the most comfortable way to enjoy your life on the road .
The Winnebago Warrior , built off a Toyota truck frame , typically comes equipped with the Toyota 22R engine .
This is a workhorse engine found in countless Toyota vehicles , making replacement parts easy to find .

If you do n't quite have the muscles or stamina to pull - off a bike , a scooter is a reasonable alternative .
There 's a reason why scooter shops are fairing better than some car dealers lately .
There 's also a reason why individuals in developing nations have always looked to the scooter as an efficient , reliable and easy - to - maintain alternative to a car .
Get a classic Vespa and you can pretend that your new - found poverty is just a fad .

If it 's good enough for wartime Germany , it 's good enough for us .
The original Type - 1 Beetle had a nearly unparalleled product run of 58 years .
It sits five people , or one person and enough canned food , barrels of gasoline and jugs of water to last about three weeks .
The use of a rear - mounted engine not only creates fuel - saving airflow , it also means you can take a few bullets head - on from scavengers and keep driving .
It 's definitely the way Dave7 plans to survive the next great depression .

6. ) Boring , Mid-Sized Sedan
Advertisement
Your typical mass - produced mid-sized sedan is usually rather boring , but the characteristics that make these cars unappealing in a financial boom are the same ones that make them so desirable in a recession .
They 're cheap .
They have a low cost of operation .
They 're abundant .
They 're relatively roomy and safe .
They 're robust enough to jump a curb or run over a pothole , which is good for a future when local governments lack the money to maintain roads .
They do n't draw attention from the even - less - fortunate .
Commenter LuciferV8 recommends the 3rd - Gen Ford Taurus as the ultimate in recession transportation because of the sheer volume produced and simple design , but a an Accord or Camry should do the trick as well .
However , be prepared to defend the Accord or Camry as they were two of the top targets for stolen vehicles even in the BCC ( Before Credit Crunch ) era .
5. ) Quantya Strada

Steal yourself a diesel generator and a Quantya Strada electric bike and you 'll squeeze a few more miles out of each drop of fuel .
The Quantya is comfortable on or off the road , making it a great vehicle on its own .
The electric motor is much quieter than the typical motorcycle , allowing c0de to sneak up on the unsuspecting and grab vittles for the night .
4. ) Model T
Advertisement
As we pointed out yesterday , the Model T was designed to go one million miles , meaning that if you can find one with less than 500 K you 've got another 500 K to go .
The engine runs on gasoline , but it was also designed to run on ethanol , meaning that you can grow your own fuel on your new rooftop garden .
It 's like the AK - 47 of cars in that most of the pieces can be replaced by simple , hand - built parts , which saves you the trouble of fighting over spares .
They 're not exceptionally fast , but how quick do you need to be to outrun someone on foot ?

You may think that public transportation is just for the poor and mentally unstable , but we 'll all be poor and mentally unstable soon anyway , so you might as well learn your route .
When local governments collapse the driver 's unions will step up to deliver efficient transportation ... at a price .
Even if the trains eventually stop running , Adidac knows that he 'll have an edge when it comes to finding the subway station most suitable for his family to take up residence .

2. ) Classic German Diesel Automobile

Having owned a Mercedes - Benz 300D , we can attest to the indestructible nature of the W123 series cars .
The five - cylinder diesel variants , especially those without turbos , are basically glorified tractor engines and will run on almost any type of fuel you can throw in them .
Built from the mid 1970s until the mid 1980s , they 're tough as grit , easy to repair and , as Hwyengr points out , they 've got a bit more class than your typical cheap ride .
Bonus points if you can find a wagon .

We hope you like whatever is in the driveway right now , because with all the credit gone and the banks running away with your hard - earned , rapidly inflating currency , you 're not going to be able to finance a cheeseburger , let alone a new car .
Those of you currently without transportation or holding onto something expensive and finicky might consider investing in cheap , reliable transportation while you can .
As prndl points out : you do n't want to get shot stealing a car .

AMERICA and Pakistan both deny it ; but it appears that on September 15th they fought a short war .
America started it .
Local reports suggest that , under cover of darkness , two helicopter - loads of its soldiers crossed on foot from Afghanistan into the Pakistani tribal area — and terrorist haven — of South Waziristan .
This followed an American policy , allegedly authorised by President George Bush in July , of launching raids into Pakistan without its government 's approval .
But , on this occasion , Pakistani border troops responded as to the act of aggression that it constituted : shooting over the heads of the advancing Americans , forcing them back .
Pakistan has , since 2001 , been a vital American ally , which makes American policy towards it confused .
So , for related reasons , is Pakistan 's towards its own north - west tribal areas ; and the ramifications could hardly be greater .
A ruggedly inaccessible region , the tribal areas form a hinge between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
By manipulating the sentiments of the 3.5 m Pushtun tribesfolk who live there , past rulers , including British colonial administrators and Pakistani dictators , have sought to influence events in Afghanistan , where Pushtuns also predominate .
In this way , the Soviet army was driven from Afghanistan in 1989 — by American - armed mujahideen .
But now , in a sadly predictable repetition , it is America and its allies that attract the tribesmen 's wrath .
North - west Pakistan , and the seven , semi-autonomous tribal “ agencies ” in particular , has emerged as the main refuge and supply - route for Taliban insurgents on both sides of the border .
The leaders of al - Qaeda , displaced from Afghanistan , are also there .
And so are other stray Islamists , including Pakistani jihadist groups trained by the army to fight in Indian - held Kashmir , and lately discouraged from doing so .
Most of these fighters are probably drawn to the region to kill NATO troops and their local allies in Afghanistan .
Indeed this is a big reason why the reconstruction effort there may be failing .
Some 1,500 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan this year — roughly half of them by Western troops .
In a bleak assessment of the progress of the war , Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of America 's joint chiefs of staff , this month suggested that “ time is running out ” to turn things around .
Hence Mr Bush 's new policy .
Hitherto , America had launched just a few missile attacks on suspected al - Qaeda targets in north - west Pakistan , in consultation with the government ; three were reported in 2007 .
Meanwhile , since soon after America invaded Afghanistan in 2001 , it has paid the Pakistani army to wage a counter - insurgency campaign in the tribal areas .
To sustain 120,000 Pakistani troops in the field , at the latest count , including a 60,000 - strong locally - raised frontier corps , America has given some $ 12 billion .
It has not got value for money .
The border remains a militant thoroughfare .
And in Pakistan , Taliban - style militancy has spread deep into the North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) and beyond .
In the past year some 1,500 Pakistanis have been killed by terrorism and insurgency , mostly in or emanating from the north - west .
On September 6th , as an electoral college chose Asif Zardari as Pakistan 's president , a suicide - bomber drove into a police check - post in Peshawar , NWFP 's capital , killing 37 .
A few days earlier bearded gunmen ambushed an American diplomat in the city , spraying her car with bullets .
No wonder Mr Zardari , Pakistan 's first civilian leader in nine years , says the Taliban have the “ upper hand ” in Pakistan .
Mr Bush seems to agree .
By ordering unilateral American action , he presumably hoped to goad the Pakistani army to do better , and also to kill a few al - Qaeda types , including Osama bin Laden , the most famous of all supposed frontier tourists , before his presidency ends in January .
Mr Bush 's new aggression was first unveiled on September 3rd with an American airborne assault on the village of Jala Khel , in South Waziristan , which , American officials claimed , killed a score of al - Qaeda militants .
The army and journalists in Pakistan said the victims were civilians .
The army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani — hand - picked and American - approved successor in that job of America 's former ally , Pervez Musharraf — denounced the attack and vowed to defend Pakistan 's territory “ at all cost ” , and an army spokesman said American invaders would be shot .
Mr Zardari 's government also vowed to defend Pakistan 's borders .
It had little choice : one recent poll showed that four - fifths of Pakistanis oppose America 's striking al - Qaeda within their territory .
But neither Mr Zardari 's government nor Mr Bush 's can afford an out - and - out rift .
Visiting Islamabad this week , Admiral Mullen struck a more conciliatory note .
Both sides talked up the prospects for co-operation .
But Pakistan 's foreign minister said his government had not been forewarned of an attack by an American drone in South Waziristan on September 17th that killed some militants .
Alas , one reason why Pakistan has failed to bring order to its side of the frontier does seem to be its reluctance to abandon its jihadist proxies .
Otherwise , it is hard to explain why Pakistan has captured more fugitive leaders of al - Qaeda than of the Taliban , its former clients .
To outsiders , this policy looks contradictory at a time when the Pakistani army is fighting a war against the Taliban and its affiliates , in which over 1,500 soldiers have been killed .
But the army 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency , masters of strategic doublethink , might call it “ selective ” — a policy of squashing the militants at home , but still employing them abroad .
Afghanistan and India have always subscribed to this analysis of the ISI .
Adding weight to it , Pakistan 's army has increasingly come to blame its failures at the frontier on foreign support for the militants there , chiefly from India and Russia .
The suicide - bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in July was allegedly the army 's response to this .
The suspected culprits were led by Jalaluddin Haqqani , an Afghan jihadist , sometime resident in the Pakistani tribal agency of North Waziristan and an ISI “ asset ” .
American and Indian officials accused the ISI of involvement in the bombing , which killed over 40 people .
Even if they tried
Yet a devious Pakistani strategy of failing to crack down on cross - border violence is not the only reason it persists , nor the main one .
A better explanation , given the fraught , radicalised and ungoverned state of north - western Pakistan , and the many dead soldiers there , is that the army could not make a much better fist of controlling the border , even if it did its damnedest .
And moreover , it may be afraid to pursue its campaign more vigorously , for two reasons .
Pakistani officials suggest that , despite battling the Pakistani Taliban in the tribal areas , the army is reluctant to attack the Afghan Taliban , allegedly led from Peshawar and from Quetta , capital of Baluchistan province , for fear of worsening security problems in those places .
Secondly , the campaign is unpopular , in the army and elsewhere , precisely because Pakistanis think it is being waged for America .
An opinion poll last year found only 48 % of Pakistanis backed military action against the Taliban .
The army may be just as divided .
Several hundred demoralised soldiers surrendered last year to militants in South Waziristan and Swat , a mountainous region of NWFP north of the tribal areas ; some said they refused to fight their brother Muslims .
Many Pakistani leaders espouse similar views .
From within the cool colonnades of his office in Peshawar , Owais Ghani , NWFP 's governor , says America should reach an accommodation with Mr Haqqani and Afghanistan 's other main rebel leaders : the Taliban 's Mullah Omar ; and Gulbuddin Hikmatyar , another sometime Pakistan - backed , American - financed , jihadist .
This would mimic Pakistan 's own strategy .
In a time - honoured fashion , the army has tried to batter mutinous tribals ; then secure deals with them on its terms .
The results have been at best mixed .
In the western part of South Waziristan , by exploiting existing tribal animosities , the ISI has found a friend in Mujammad Nazir .
The army claims that his Wazir clansmen killed around 250 Uzbek militants in their midst last year .
In North Waziristan , after several abject failures , the army claims to have a deal with the dominant Daoud clan .
This , says the army , binds the tribesmen not to conduct raids into Afghanistan , or harbour foreign militants , on pain of having their houses demolished .
As a sweetener , the army promises to build them roads , schools and clinics .
America has cast grave doubt on the efficacy of this deal in particular .
Elsewhere , by the army 's own admission , its strategy has failed .
It has made a string of failed deals with South Waziristan 's most powerful warlord , Baitullah Mehsud , a former fitness instructor and enemy of Mr Nazir .
Mr Mehsud violated the last of these after the army invaded a jihadist mosque in Islamabad last year .
He has since emerged as the Pakistan Taliban 's strongest leader , and is accused of masterminding much jihadist violence , including the assassination of Mr Zardari 's wife , Benazir Bhutto , in December .
But despite an army attack on his fief in January , pitting 40,000 troops against a few thousand militants , Mr Mehsud remains in control of it .
In May he held a press conference there .
Pacts Pakistana
Pakistan 's army spokesman , General Athar Abbas , concedes that this was embarrassing .
He says the army 's error was to cut deals with the militants themselves ; it should have made them instead with tribal elders .
But it would have been hard - pressed to do so in South Waziristan , where the militants have murdered 120 pro-government elders .
That may be why Mr Abbas adds that the army hopes to forge yet another pact with Mr Mehsud .
For now , it cannot fight him , partly because it has its hands full elsewhere .
In the past month the army has taken its campaign to Bajaur agency , an alleged hideout of Mr bin Laden 's right hand , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
It claims to have killed over 700 militants , including foreign fighters fleeing newly - inhospitable North Waziristan .
“ It is time to give the militants a proper thrashing , ” says Ghulam Qadir , a senior official in Bajaur .
But many locals , who include some 300,000 displaced by the fighting , accuse the army of killing civilians and often behaving no better than the militants .
“ There is a perception that the government and the militants are the same , ” said Akhunzada Chattan , a local politician .
Meanwhile in Swat , formerly popular with honeymooning couples , the army is waging a bigger assault — against an affiliate of Mr Mehsud 's , a former ski-lift operator called Mullah Fazalullah .
He is another former beneficiary of a peace deal ; it did not deter his followers from burning 130 girls ' schools to ashes .
Mingora , Swat 's regional capital , is now under siege , its official buildings pocked by bullets and blackened by suicide blasts .
Some 15,000 soldiers are bunkered there , while Mr Fazalullah 's men hold the surrounding hills .
A local newspaper editor rubbishes the army 's claims to have killed many militants .
Wearily , he proffers a letter sent by the Taliban : “ Those without beards , those who drive on the left like the British , those who sell shaving kits , make - up or bras will be killed . ”
Perhaps only a minority , in Swat and elsewhere , support such edicts .
In the few places where tribal elders have resisted the militants , the Islamists have been shown to have little support .
In Lakki Marwat , home to Pakistan 's second - biggest Pushtun clan , a florid - faced hereditary ruler called Anwar Kamal has maintained a firm and secular grip .
By way of explanation , he said : “ I told the Taliban , in traditional language , that the next time I see a Talib on my land I am going to screw him as hard I can . ”
But alas , leaders like Mr Kamal are rare .
Linux - based operating systems are built on an open - development model , which can afford organizations an early view of - and an opportunity to influence - the technologies and implementations that will eventually work their way into these companies ' infrastructures .
What 's more , these early looks extend beyond points on a presentation slide to comprise run-able code that 's gathered into fast - moving , community - supported Linux distributions that administrators can begin testing in advance of the long - lived , enterprise - oriented releases to come .
I examined the principal security - related developments in three such vanguard Linux distributions , Canonical 's Ubuntu Linux 8.10 , Novell 's OpenSUSE 11.1 and Red Hat 's Fedora 10 , all of which are now available in beta form .
Ubuntu Linux 8.10 , which is slated for release at the end of October , ships with an encrypted private directory feature that enables users to store sensitive data securely without incurring the performance overhead of full - volume encryption .
Click here to read about Microsoft 's October patches and its new Exploitability Index .
In my own tests with full - volume encryption in previous Ubuntu versions , I 've noted processor overhead of about 20 to 30 percent during disk - intensive processes such as virtual machine image creation .
What 's more , full - disk encryption , unlocked by a single pass key , poses problems for multiuser machines , in which the disk unlocking is an all - or - nothing proposition , as opposed to a user - by - user measure .
As implemented in Ubuntu 8.10 , the encrypted private directory feature creates a folder - labeled " Private " - in users ' home directories .
The system automatically encrypts files placed in this directory and unlocks the directory upon user log-on .
In my tests , I could broaden the range of home directory folders that the system protected by copying the folders to the Private location and leaving a symlink behind to allow my applications to continue accessing the protected files at their previous addresses .
As this feature now stands , it 's too roughly implemented to supplant full - volume encryption entirely - there 's no user interface at this point , and there 's the possibility that sensitive data could be pulled from a system 's unencrypted swap partition .
I hope to see Ubuntu 's encryption feature set firmed up to include full - volume , Private folder and home directory encryption in time for the distribution 's next LTS ( Long Term Support ) release , which is currently scheduled for April 2010 .
Zelda : A Link to the Past Easter Egg - Chris Houlihan Room
Back in the early 1990s , Chris Houlihan was a reader of " Nintendo Power " ( the official Nintendo magazine ) .
Before the release of Zelda : A Link To The Past a .k.a.
Zelda 3 , Nintendo
Power held a contest , where the winner would have his name in a secret room inside the game ... and the room would be so well hidden that it would be nearly impossible to find .
And indeed , it nearly is , unless you know where it 's at .
In fact , it seems we had to wait for the internet / Snes emulators era for the room to be found by anyone at all .
Here 's what you have to do , there are different methods to enter the room :
FIRST ( EASIEST ) METHOD :
1. First of all , you need the Pegasus Boots !
If you do n't have them , go get them and come back here .
2. Start a saved game and start at the Sanctuary .
3 . Now , you 're going to have to go to the secret entrance to the Hyrule castle ( the one behind the bush you go to at the very beginning of the game ) AS FAST AS POSSIBLE .
The trick will only work if you 're fast , which is why you need the Pegasus Boots .
Try to storm your way through the screens .
4 . Here is the exact path [ note that any path is theorically good as long as you reach your goal quickly enough , but this one works fine for me ] : go down to leave the Sanctuary , down past the cemetary , then left .
In the new screen , go down as soon as possible , and you will enter a difficult area with big trees , rocks , bushes , and enemies .
Proceed with caution here , as it's easy to waste time if you 're not careful enough .
Go right of that screen .
You are now at the Hyrule castle .
Go down , then right , and go past the main entrance without entering .
Keep going right until you 're at the eastern side of the castle , then go up .
You will find the bush leading to the secret entrance .
Get rid of it and drop down the hole , and IF you were fast enough , you will enter the Chris Houlihan room .
It 's a room filled with blue rupees and a plaque saying : " My name is Chris Houlihan .
This is my top secret room .
Keep it between us , OK ? "
If you enter the normal underground castle passage , it means you were too slow .
SECOND METHOD :
It 's the same principle , but instead of starting from a saved game at the Sanctuary , from anywhere in the game just go to the Kakariko village , taking as long as you wish .
There , you have to place yourself at the top of the dirt path leading to the fortune teller screen .
The race against the clock starts now : run up to the fortune teller screen and go to the secret passage behind the bush just as in the first method ( go right and then it's all the same directions ) , always running as fast as possible .
This method is more difficult for me than the first one as it requires you to be even faster , but I have tried both and they * both * work .
OTHER METHODS :
Other methods have been referenced on the net , and I wo n't reference them all here as they have n't all been verified and the methods mentioned above work fine .
It seems you can also access the room by falling into a certain spot at the Pyramid in the Dark World ( but the people who have done this do n't know how to do it again ) , or by using a bomb to push you down a secret passage in the cemetary .
Some also say the " time attack " methods wo n't work if you get hit by an enemy on the way .
This might be true , but I would n't know because I usually started from scratch after getting hit , since it makes you lose precious time either way .
There is a rumour the egg only appears when the game somehow malfunctions ( instead of giving you an error message , it warps you to the Chris Houlihan room ) , which could explain why the ways to enter the room are so strange and different .
The " do it twice in a row without taking the rupees and next time you will get a chest with 500 rupees " thing , referred to in the comments for this egg , has n't worked for me ( I 've done it but the room was identical ) so until we see screenshots I 'll assume it 's a hoax .

The Democratic party and Barack Obama 's campaign today announced a plan to spend $ 20 m to organise and mobilise Hispanic voters .
Meanwhile , in Washington today buzz grew about Virginia governor Tim Kaine 's place near the top of the short list of Obama vice - presidential choices .
Kaine , an early Obama backer , could help Obama carry Virginia , and would bring outsider appeal to the ticket .
He appeared in Washington today , ostensibly to visit his daughter , and told reporters : " I think I 'm just not going to talk about my conversations with the campaign . "
The Democrats will focus the $ 20 m on four swing states in the west and south - west with large Hispanic populations .
The party aims to take advantage of what it considers a blunder by Republicans who have embraced hard - line immigration policies that have alienated Hispanic voters and provoked them to political action .
Democrats say that never before has a national party pledged this much money this early in such a broad programme .
Democrats say Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico and Florida are in play for Obama after voting for George Bush twice .
Victories there would reduce pressure on Obama to win Ohio and Pennsylvania , typically the site of brutal fall battles .
At a press conference at Democratic National Committee headquarters this morning , four Hispanic congressmen said Obama 's message of " change " on the economy , energy , healthcare , the war in Iraq , immigration and other issues appeals to Hispanic voters .
The news conference did not focus on immigration , though polls show it is a top concern for Hispanic voters .
" The reality is that [ McCain ] is proposing the same initiatives as President Bush , on the war , on social security , the economy , " Arizona representative Raul Grijalva said in Spanish , for the benefit of the Spanish - language media present , " and those were a failure for our community , a tremendous damage .
For me , the need for our community to choose Barack Obama is economic , political and social " .
The money , which comes both from party coffers and Obama campaign funds , will be spent to contact , register and mobilise Hispanic voters , on online organising , media advertising , travel for campaign speakers and staffing in swing states .
Democrats familiar with the initiative said the funds will be spent in all 50 states , but focused largely on the Hispanic - heavy swing states .
Obama is poised to carry a majority of Hispanic voters .
According to a survey release last week by the Pew Hispanic Centre , a non-partisan research organisation , Hispanic registered voters favour the Illinois senator 66 % to 23 % for McCain .
But by aiming aggressively at the segment , especially new voters , the Democrats hope to increase turnout that will add to his vote total in November , and force McCain to spend time and money campaigning in states that Bush won .
Bush , former governor of heavily Hispanic Texas , made strong inroads with Hispanic voters .
His strategists recognised that the group 's share of the electorate is growing , and Bush in 2000 and 2004 spent heavily on Spanish - language advertising and enlisted Bush 's part - Mexican nephew in the effort .
As a result , the Republican party doubled its share of the Hispanic vote in 2004 from 1996 , winning 40 % to the Democrats ' 59 % .
McCain , who also hails from a heavily Hispanic state , Arizona , was poised to share in Bush 's appeal .
In 2006 he was a staunch supporter of ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful immigration reform legislation backed by Bush and leading Democrats .
Beginning in 2007 and through the Republican primary , McCain yielded to anti-immigration forces in the party base , however .
" He 's got two key problems , " said Democratic party spokesman Luis Miranda .
" One , he 's promising the same failed policies of the Bush administration , and two , he walked on an issue of such importance to the community , like immigration reform , which showed the community that , can you really trust him ? "
Colorado senator Ken Salazar said immigration " is not one of the defining issues of our time " but noted that Obama " has not wavered in his commitment " to reforming the system .
Obama has long backed a guest - worker programme for low - paying jobs typically filled by illegal aliens , a path to legal status for illegal aliens , and other provisions
Indeed , the McCain campaign has acknowledged the Republican party 's poor standing among Hispanics , but the side plans to remind Hispanics of McCain 's longstanding ties to the community .
The campaign hopes Hispanics wo n't punish him for their distaste for Republican immigration policies .
In a statement released by the McCain campaign , Florida representative Lincoln Diaz - Balart said : " Unlike Barack Obama , John McCain does n't need an introduction to the Hispanic community .
John McCain has been working for more than two decades for the values , principles and issues Latinos care about . "
During the long primary campaign , Hispanics backed New York senator Hillary Clinton nearly two to one , in part because Hispanic voters had a favourable view of former president Bill Clinton , and because of historic cool relations between blacks and Hispanics .
Representative Jose Serrano of New York , a staunch Clinton backer during the primary season , today said Latino support for her transfers to Obama , her fierce rival .
" That love that the Latino community had for Hillary is also a love for change , " he said .
" It 's a love for the future of our country … it 's a love for ending those policies which are unfair and it's a love for true change in America . "

“ Some people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions .
They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers ; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers ; and rich and predatory money lenders . ”
– The Honorable Louis McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee in the 1930s
The Federal Reserve ( or Fed ) has assumed sweeping new powers in the last year .
In an unprecedented move in March 2008 , the New York Fed advanced the funds for JPMorgan Chase Bank to buy investment bank Bear Stearns for pennies on the dollar .
The deal was particularly controversial because Jamie Dimon , CEO of JPMorgan , sits on the board of the New York Fed and participated in the secret weekend negotiations .
1
In September 2008 , the Federal Reserve did something even more unprecedented , when it bought the world ’s largest insurance company .
The Fed announced on September 16 that it was giving an $ 85 billion loan to American International Group ( AIG ) for a nearly 80 % stake in the mega - insurer .
The Associated Press called it a “ government takeover , ” but this was no ordinary nationalization .
Unlike the U.S. Treasury , which took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the week before , the Fed is not a government - owned agency .
Also unprecedented was the way the deal was funded .
The Associated Press reported :
“ The Treasury Department , for the first time in its history , said it would begin selling bonds for the Federal Reserve in an effort to help the central bank deal with its unprecedented borrowing needs . ”
2
This is extraordinary .
Why is the Treasury issuing U.S. government bonds ( or debt ) to fund the Fed , which is itself supposedly “ the lender of last resort ” created to fund the banks and the federal government ?
Yahoo Finance reported on September 17 :
“ The Treasury is setting up a temporary financing program at the Fed ’s request .
The program will auction Treasury bills to raise cash for the Fed ’s use .
The initiative aims to help the Fed manage its balance sheet following its efforts to enhance its liquidity facilities over the previous few quarters . ”
Normally , the Fed swaps green pieces of paper called Federal Reserve Notes for pink pieces of paper called U.S. bonds ( the federal government ’s I.O.U.s ) , in order to provide Congress with the dollars it cannot raise through taxes .
Now , it seems , the government is issuing bonds , not for its own use , but for the use of the Fed !
Perhaps the plan is to swap them with the banks ’ dodgy derivatives collateral directly , without actually putting them up for sale to outside buyers .
According to Wikipedia ( which translates Fedspeak into somewhat clearer terms than the Fed ’s own website ) :
“ The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28 - day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s primary dealers in exchange for other program - eligible collateral .
It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally .
. . .
The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable . ”
“ To switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable ” means that the government gets the banks ’ toxic derivative debt , and the banks get the government ’s triple - A securities .
Unlike the risky derivative debt , federal securities are considered “ risk - free ” for purposes of determining capital requirements , allowing the banks to improve their capital position so they can make new loans .
( See E. Brown , “ Bailout Bedlam , ” webofdebt.com / articles , October 2 , 2008 . )
In its latest power play , on October 3 , 2008 , the Fed acquired the ability to pay interest to its member banks on the reserves the banks maintain at the Fed .
Reuters reported on October 3 :
“ The U.S. Federal Reserve gained a key tactical tool from the $ 700 billion financial rescue package signed into law on Friday that will help it channel funds into parched credit markets .
Tucked into the 451 - page bill is a provision that lets the Fed pay interest on the reserves banks are required to hold at the central bank . ”
3
If the Fed ’s money comes ultimately from the taxpayers , that means we the taxpayers are paying interest to the banks on the banks ’ own reserves – reserves maintained for their own private profit .
These increasingly controversial encroachments on the public purse warrant a closer look at the central banking scheme itself .
Who owns the Federal Reserve , who actually controls it , where does it get its money , and whose interests is it serving ?
Not Private and Not for Profit ?
The Fed ’s website insists that it is not a private corporation , is not operated for profit , and is not funded by Congress .
But is that true ?
The Federal Reserve was set up in 1913 as a “ lender of last resort ” to backstop bank runs , following a particularly bad bank panic in 1907 .
The Fed ’s mandate was then and continues to be to keep the private banking system intact ; and that means keeping intact the system ’s most valuable asset , a monopoly on creating the national money supply .
Except for coins , every dollar in circulation is now created privately as a debt to the Federal Reserve or the banking system it heads .
4
The Fed ’s website attempts to gloss over its role as chief defender and protector of this private banking club , but let ’s take a closer look .
The website states :
“ The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks , which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation ’s central banking system , are organized much like private corporations – possibly leading to some confusion about “ ownership . ”
For example , the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks .
However , owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company .
The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit , and ownership of a certain amount of stock is , by law , a condition of membership in the System .
The stock may not be sold , traded , or pledged as security for a loan ; dividends are , by law , 6 percent per year . ”
“ [ The Federal Reserve ] is considered an independent central bank because its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government , it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress , and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms . ”
“ The Federal Reserve ’s income is derived primarily from the interest on U.S. government securities that it has acquired through open market operations .
. . .
After paying its expenses , the Federal Reserve turns the rest of its earnings over to the U.S. Treasury . ”
5
So let ’s review :
1 . The Fed is privately owned .
Its shareholders are private banks .
In fact , 100 % of its shareholders are private banks .
None of its stock is owned by the government .
2 . The fact that the Fed does not get “ appropriations ” from Congress basically means that it gets its money from Congress without congressional approval , by engaging in “ open market operations . ”
Here is how it works :
When the government is short of funds , the Treasury issues bonds and delivers them to bond dealers , which auction them off .
When the Fed wants to “ expand the money supply ” ( create money ) , it steps in and buys bonds from these dealers with newly - issued dollars acquired by the Fed for the cost of writing them into an account on a computer screen .
These maneuvers are called “ open market operations ” because the Fed buys the bonds on the “ open market ” from the bond dealers .
The bonds then become the “ reserves ” that the banking establishment uses to back its loans .
In another bit of sleight of hand known as “ fractional reserve ” lending , the same reserves are lent many times over , further expanding the money supply , generating interest for the banks with each loan .
It was this money - creating process that prompted Wright Patman , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee in the 1960s , to call the Federal Reserve “ a total money - making machine . ”
He wrote :
“ When the Federal Reserve writes a check for a government bond it does exactly what any bank does , it creates money , it created money purely and simply by writing a check . ”
3 . The Fed generates profits for its shareholders .
The interest on bonds acquired with its newly - issued Federal Reserve Notes pays the Fed ’s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6 % return to its banker shareholders .
A mere 6 % a year may not be considered a profit in the world of Wall Street high finance , but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6 % return are considered “ for profit ” corporations .
In addition to this guaranteed 6 % , the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their “ reserves . ”
The basic reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve is 10 % .
The website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system , this 10 % held in “ reserve ” can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans ; that is , $ 10,000 in reserves becomes $ 100,000 in loans .
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.8 puts the total “ loans and leases in bank credit ” as of September 24 , 2008 at $ 7,049 billion .
Ten percent of that is $ 700 billion .
That means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least $ 700 billion annually – this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans .
The banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks ’ interests protected by an all - powerful independent private central bank , even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers ’ — for example , when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the U.S. economy .
Among other special benefits , banks and other financial institutions ( but not other corporations ) can borrow at the low Fed funds rate of about 2 % .
They can then turn around and put this money into 30 - year Treasury bonds at 4.5 % , earning an immediate 2.5 % from the taxpayers , just by virtue of their position as favored banks .
A long list of banks ( but not other corporations ) is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks .
Time to Change the Statute ?
According to the Fed ’s website , the control Congress has over the Federal Reserve is limited to this :
“ [ T ]he Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by Congress , which periodically reviews its activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute . ”
As we know from watching the business news , “ oversight ” basically means that Congress gets to see the results when it ’s over .
The Fed periodically reports to Congress , but the Fed does n’t ask ; it tells .
The only real leverage Congress has over the Fed is that it “ can alter its responsibilities by statute . ”
It is time for Congress to exercise that leverage and make the Federal Reserve a truly federal agency , acting by and for the people through their elected representatives .
If the Fed can demand AIG ’s stock in return for an $ 85 billion loan to the mega - insurer , we can demand the Fed ’s stock in return for the trillion - or - so dollars we ’ll be advancing to bail out the private banking system from its follies .
If the Fed were actually a federal agency , the government could issue U.S. legal tender directly , avoiding an unnecessary interest - bearing debt to private middlemen who create the money out of thin air themselves .
Among other benefits to the taxpayers .
a truly “ federal ” Federal Reserve could lend the full faith and credit of the United States to state and local governments interest - free , cutting the cost of infrastructure in half , restoring the thriving local economies of earlier decades .

New mother Billie faces a week in hospital recovering from emergency Caesarean
Billie Piper will remain in hospital for a week after enduring a traumatic 26 - hour labour followed by an emergency Caesarean to give birth to her first child , a boy .
Miss Piper , 26 , delivered Winston James Fox around 1 am on Tuesday at the private Portland Hospital in London .
Her husband Laurence Fox , 29 , confirmed that mother and the 6lb 11 oz baby were well and happy .
Fox said : ' He is beautiful .
He is sweet .
It was an emergency Caesarean .
I 'm tired but not as tired as her , no doubt .
It was long and hard .
She was in labour for more than 24 hours . '
Billie Piper , seen near her West Sussex home on the weekend , has given birth to her first child , a baby boy , in a London hospital
The Portland Hospital in London is well known for its celebrity clientele
He said Billie would remain in hospital with the child while she recovered from the operation .
' She had a Caesarean .
It was quite a major thing was n't it , ' he said , adding that doctors told the couple she might not be ready to go home for " five days to a week " .
And he said Billie was thrilled with her new status : ' She 's really happy she 's a mum . '
The proud father - who briefly left his wife 's side to buy a bottle of Moet & Chandon champagne - wore a rosette saying ' Fabby Daddy ' on the left side of his chest .
He also wet the baby 's head with a pint of lager in the Green Man pub across from the Portland yesterday with a group of friends .
Fox said he had not changed his jeans and jumper for three days , but despite his exhaustion he ahppily showed off mobile phone pictures of his son .
Mr Fox told friends : ' You have no idea what 's going on but it 's amazing . '

He said he had initially panicked because he could n't get the car to start after his wife went into labour .
Speaking outside the hospital he said : ' I feel fantastic . '
When asked about the newborn 's name , Fox remained close - lipped , stating : ' That 's a private moment . '
However , Evans was n't quite so discreet , revealing on his blog that Piper and Fox had named their baby Winston James Fox .
He commented : ' We 've got lots of nice presents , lots of nice flowers , and my mum and dad are coming down later .
Billie 's parents came down last night .'
Miss Piper , a former star of Doctor Who , is expected to stay in hospital overnight and her husband pledged to ' be with her for the length of it ' .

One of the first visitors was Miss Piper 's ex-husband , the Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans , who remains a close friend .
Evans popped in for five minutes and delivered a gift .
He described Miss Piper as ' fantastic ' and said : ' She 's very happy and she looks wonderful .
She 's really pleased .
It 's tears of joy up there . '
He added : ' I 've not been informed if I am a godparent but here 's hoping .
Fabby Daddy :
Fox was wearing a purple badge declaring his new role in life
' I got him a tractor .
A remote - control tractor .
Every little boy needs a tractor .'
After leaving the hospital Evans wrote about the ' absolute pure joy ' of his first meeting with Miss Piper 's ' brand new shiny baby ' on his internet diary , which he titled ' Winston James Fox , welcome to Planet Earth ' .
He wrote : ' At the time of writing this , the little fella is not even 15 hours old .
He is cute as you like and did n't cry once for the few minutes I was there which was just a few moments ago .
' How cool is life ? '
Evans , 42 , and his wife Natasha Shishmanian announced their own pregnancy in July .
Fox and Miss Piper married in East Sussex on New Year 's Eve 2007 .
The actress has admitted being nervous about the birth .
She said : ' Some women are all about this glowing , blooming thing , are n't they ?
' I have n't really tapped into that .
I 've basically replaced all my vices for a new one - control .
I 've had about ten scans and I bought one of those baby heart monitor things . '
The name Winston derives from an expression meaning ' joyful stone ' .
Fox went to the same school ( Harrow ) as one of the most famous owners of the name , Winston Churchill .

Chris , who is reported to be the intended godfather of her child , has joked about the baby race between Miss Piper and his new wife .
He announced golf professional Miss Shishmanian 's own pregnancy on his blog in July this year .
Mr Evans said : ' You know they had a baby race , to see who could get in the family way first .

' I 've never talked about this before but it 's true .
' And Billie thrashed us .
It was n't so much that Billie thrashed us or Tash , it was the fact that Laurence her husband thrashed me . '
Mr Fox and Miss Piper married in East Sussex on New Years Eve 2007 .
The former teen pop star had a previous six - year marriage with Radio DJ Chris Evans whom she married in a casual Las Vegas ceremony in 2001 .
They divorced in May 2007 - three years after they split .

After the worst violence there in a decade , officials in China 's northwesternmost region tighten curbs on the observance of Ramadan .
Scarves are sold at a silk factory in Hotan , in China 's far west Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in a file photo .
HONG KONG — China is stepping up restrictions on its Muslim Uyghur population during the fasting month of Ramadan , following a string of violent attacks in its northwestern region of Xinjiang .
Women are being forced to uncover their faces in public by police , while restrictions on teaching Islam to Uyghur children are being intensified , police said .
“ We are ... checking the identities of those who have beards or mustaches , and women who cover their faces , ” an officer who answered the phone at the Charbagh village police station , in Lop county , Hotan prefecture .
“ We uncover the faces of veiled women by force if necessary , ” he said .
“ We also arrest anyone teaching religion to children illegally , ” he said , adding that police were also helping to enforce a ban on Muslim restaurant closures in Ramadan .
Restaurants run by Muslims are forbidden to close in daytime during the fasting month , as is the custom in other Islamic regions of the world , according to official statements on government Web sites in Xinjiang .
" This is government policy .
It covers only Uyghur restaurants . "
Lop county offical
Official decree
In Atush city , in the far west of the remote Tarim Basin , “ It was decided after general discussion to produce a document titled ‘ Promise to remain open for Atush city ’s Muslim restaurants during the Ramadan period ’ , ” according to a statement issued by the municipal commerce and industry bureau .
Officials have been dispatched to count all the restaurants run by Muslims and to “ educate ” their owners so that they sign the agreement of their own accord , it said .
Officials in other parts of the region cited similar measures .
“ The new instructions target only Uyghur restaurants , ” an official from the Lop county taxation bureau in Hotan prefecture in the far south of Xinjiang said .
“ We do n’t issue such orders for [ Han ] Chinese restaurants . ”
“ This is government policy .
It covers only Uyghur restaurants .
It is only for one month — I mean September .
The order came from the prefectural level of government in Hotan , ” he said .
“ In September , all the restaurants must be kept open . ”
' We will be punished '
During Ramadan , Muslims who are able should take no food , water , or cigarettes during daylight hours .
Restaurants in Muslim countries close during the day , re-opening to break the fast after sunset .
A Uyghur restaurant owner in Hotan ’s Keriye county confirmed the policy : “ We must keep our restaurant open during Ramadan , ” he said .
“ If we do n’t follow government ’s orders , we will be punished . ”
“ The order says that if we close our restaurant during Ramadan , the government will close the restaurant for between six and 12 months as a punishment , and that also we will have to pay a fine , ” he added .
Exiled Uyghur groups said Uyghur government cadres throughout Xinjiang had been forced to sign “ letters of responsibility ” promising to avoid fasting , evening prayers , or other religious activities .
“ Leading cadres of townships will be severely punished or investigated in accordance with law if the ban on fasting is violated , ” the Germany - based World Uyghur Congress said in a statement signed by spokesman Dilxat Raxit .
Special groups have been set up in schools to educate Uyghur teachers and students not to fast , and to monitor their activities on pain of expulsion from school , Raxit said .
Similar restrictions are in force in Toqsu [ in Chinese , Xinhe ) and Shaya counties , near Kucha , where up to 10 alleged Muslim attackers were reportedly killed after assaulting a local police station Aug. 10 .
Xinjiang is a vast region bordering Central Asia rich in natural resources with several key strategic borders with China ’s neighbors .
China is home to up to 11 million Uyghurs , a Turkic - speaking minority group that formed two short - lived East Turkestan republics in the 1930s and 40s during the Chinese civil war and the Japanese invasion .

One of the things that has annoyed me during this campaign is how easy it has been for candidates to simply make things up about one another 's records , even when they are talking about topics that are relatively easy to check .
Last spring , people kept saying that Obama had no real accomplishments in the Senate , even though that was not true .
More recently , McCain has said that Obama has not reached across the aisle to work with Republicans .
That 's not true either : he has worked with Dick Lugar on securing Russian loose nukes and small arms , and on avian flu , with Tom Coburn on ethics reform and openness in government , and so on .
The latest charge is this :
" Sen . Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue . "
Oh , really ?
" art of the Senate 's ethics reform bill deals with earmarks -- lawmakers ' often abused practice of inserting items in legislation to direct funds to special interests ( a la Duke Cunningham ) .
According to current rules , lawmakers can attach earmarks anonymously , a state of affairs inviting abuse .
Reform efforts have sought to change that .
Republicans and good government types have criticized Reid 's version of earmark reform legislation , which is weaker than the version passed by House Democrats , saying that it does n't go near far enough in terms of disclosure .
Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) offered an amendment today that mirrored the tougher legislation passed by House Democrats .
According to Craig Holman of Public Citizen , Reid 's version , if it had been applied to earmarks as part of legislation passed last year , would have disclosed the sponsor of only approximately 500 earmarks .
DeMint 's amendment would have forced sponsors to be known of roughly 12,000 . (...)
But Democrats sought to block DeMint 's amendment , with an effort led by Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) .
They failed , due mostly to nine Democrats , including Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and freshmen Sens. Jon Tester ( D - MT ) and Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , who crossed the aisle to vote with the Republicans , along with Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) . "
And guess what ?
It worked .
CQ ( quoted by TPMMuckraker ) :
" After losing a critical floor vote Thursday and scrambling in vain to reverse the decision , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , found the spirit of bipartisan compromise more to his liking Friday morning .
Reid offered an olive branch to Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , agreeing to embrace his amendment to a pending ethics and lobbying overhaul ( S 1 ) with some modifications .
DeMint ’s amendment , which Democratic leaders tried but failed to kill on Thursday , would expand the definition of member earmarks that would be subject to new disclosure rules . "
More generally : Obama was the Senate 's point person for ethics reform .
Ethics reform is never a particularly good way to endear yourself to your colleagues , since working for it consists in large part of trying to convince them to give up various goodies .
For some of the ethics reform debate , Obama had the Senate leadership behind him .
But he was working for stronger legislation than they wanted .
Sometimes he won , as in the case just described .
Sometimes he lost : he was pushing for an independent commission to oversee Congressional ethics cases , and lost .
But the idea that he never took on his party 's leadership is just wrong .
Last week , VentureBeat 's Dean Takahashi ( author of The Xbox 360 Uncloaked : The Real Story Behind Microsoft ’s Next - Generation Video Game Console ) posted an in - depth look at the hardware problems that have plagued the Xbox 360 since the time of its launch .
Today , the one named source inside Microsoft for the article , a contract game tester named Robert Delaware , was fired for his participation .
In addition to losing his job , it also appears that Mr. Delaware may be facing civil charges from both Microsoft and Excell Data ( the temp employment company who arranged his contract ) .
In the original article ( a very long but excellent read ) , Delaware suggests that Microsoft 's failure to divulge information to the testers working to identify bugs likely resulted in the prolonged existence of many of the hardware errors present in the console .
He specifically names a bug present in NBA 2k6 which caused consistent hardware failure and even the Red Ring of Death , as well as issues resulting from the practice of including dashboard updates on retail discs .
Delaware has no regrets about the situation , calling his contribution to the article , " the moral thing to do . ”
It should be pointed out that Microsoft is completely in their rights to terminate the employment of someone who discusses sensitive corporate information with the press in such a manner , as well as seek legal action against them .
That said , I find it comforting that Mr. Delaware had the courage to speak out on this issue .
Companies need to be held accountable for their actions when consumers are suffering from poorly designed products and being willing to put your career on the line to ensure that is worth a lot of respect in my book .
My best wishes go out to Mr. Delaware .
Thank you for standing up .

A recent blog post by Gartner Analyst Mark Driver picks up on the increasing interest in Smalltalk .
There are many factors contributing , but one of them appears to be the rise in popularity of dynamic languages like Ruby , Python and others .
Smalltalk has pioneered many of the concepts behind these languages a long time before they were conceived and has been around since the 1970 / 1980s .
Many of the Smalltalk VMs have been around just as long and have reached a high level of maturity .
Seaside
Another reason for the interest in Smalltalk today is , like with Ruby and Ruby on Rails , a web framework .
Seaside has been around for a while and has gathered a lot of interest .
Avi Bryant is behind DabbleDB , an online database which is built on Seaside ( InfoQ has an interview with Avi Bryant talking about how DabbleDB makes use of Smalltalk 's image concept for persistance and how Squeak can be made to scale ) .
While Seaside was developed on Squeak , recently many other Smalltalk vendors have started supporting it as well .
Cincom Smalltalk supports Seaside and offers WebVelocity , a GUI tool for Seaside development in the browser ( a short video introduction to Web Velocity is available , a longer demonstration is available at Google Video ) .
GemStone , who 's behind GemStone / S , a Smalltalk that offers persistence and clustering , also supports Seaside , eg. with their GLASS product ( which is also available in a free edition ) .
Ruby and Smalltalk
Smalltalk was one big influence on Ruby , and it continues to do so .
Rubinius , for instance , has used Squeak Smalltalk as a model for implementing their VM , and GemStone 's Maglev is built right on top of a Smalltalk VM .
While Ruby 's grammar is more complex than Smalltalk 's simple grammar , it 's still being influenced .
Named parameters ( ' keyword messages ' in Smalltalk ) , for instance , are n't available in Ruby , although they can be emulated using hash iterals , a feature that 's long been available in Smalltalk .
Ruby :
def foo( arghash ) # ... do something with arguments 42 end foo ( : name => " foo " , : size => 42 )
Note : Ruby 1.9 offers a more compact literal hash syntax , which allows to omit a few characters .
The same using Smalltalk keyword messages ( note that the method 's name is made up of all keyword arguments ) :
: name name : size size " this is a comment ... do something with arguments " ^ 42 .
receiver name : ' foo ' size : 42 .
Languages like Objective - C also have Smalltalk - style keyword messages .
Smalltalk has also managed to avoid the many variants of Lambdas , Procs and Blocks in Ruby , recently joined by the new ' stabby lambda ' syntax ( -> {} ) .
Smalltalk has one way to create block : [ : argument| ^ 42 ] creates a block , it takes one argument and returns the value 42 .
Another difference between Smalltalk and Ruby is the availability of tools and IDEs .
Ruby IDEs have only recently started to become available , whereas Smalltalk has always been closely integrated with IDEs ( although there are Smalltalks without dedicated IDEs , eg. GemStone / S or GNU Smalltalk ) .
Ruby IDEs , however , are very different from Smalltalk IDEs , for instance : all of the Ruby IDEs are written in a non-Ruby language .
The Ruby support in Aptana ( RDT ) , 3rd Rail ( DLTK ) , Netbeans , IntelliJ is written in Java , SapphireSteel 's Ruby In Steel is based on Visual Studio .
There 's the Ruby based FreeRIDE , although it 's development seems to have stopped .
Ruby IDEs provide static analysis , type inference , and other logic for analyzing and modifying Ruby code - but all of that code is written in either Java or C# and depend on either JRuby 's AST or RubyInSteel 's AST .
The availability of an AST of Ruby source has recently been improved with Ryan Davis ' ruby_parser , which can take Ruby source and return the AST ( in UnifiedRuby format ) , complete with comments and line numbers .
Smalltalk 's IDEs , on the other hand , are written in Smalltalk .
Static analysis tools are available too , as well as refactoring tools ( the first refactoring tool was actually Smalltalk 's Refactoring Browser ) .
Interview with Randal L. Schwartz
To get a view of someone who moved from a language often associated with scripting ( Perl ) to Smalltalk , we talked to Randal L. Schwartz .
Randal is the author of many popular books and columns on Perl .
Recently he 's spent a lot of time using and advocating Smalltalk , declaring the " The Year of Smalltalk " .
He 's also on the leadership team of Squeak .
InfoQ : Seaside 's known for using continuations for maintaining state .
Avi Bryant recently mentioned that the product he 's working on , DabbleDB , has been moving away from using continuations because AJAX allowed for a different application model .
What 's your experience with this ?
What makes Seaside an appealing web framework to use ?
Continuations allow me to create abstractions control flows , much in the same way that I would create abstractions of layout views .
I can have an abstraction called " show this form until it validates " in a library , and the library can return the incomplete page containing the web form until it validates , all apparently " within " a call to the library .
Without continuations , I 'd have to hook up some top - level recognizer to say " ok , this is a response to a form input that this library now needs to see " , and I 'd lose all my local state .
InfoQ : What method(s ) of persistence are you using in your Smalltalk and Seaside applications ?
Are you using an RDBMS with Smalltalk ?
What 's the ORM library situation for Smalltalk ?
For legacy interface , Glorp is Object - Relational mapper of choice .
Glorp is in active development to add an " Active - Record " - style layer as well .
For new applications , I 'd highly recommend the product from GemStone , which puts the VM inside a completely persistent environment .
Objects just naturally persist , and thus do n't need to be dissassembled into SQL for insertion into and retrieval from a classic database .
InfoQ : What Smalltalk versions do you use - which ones do you have experience with ?
Are they all equivalent - or are some more suited to particular problem domains ?
I 'm on the leadership team for Squeak , and I 've been tracking Squeak since its initial release .
I only recently started playing with Cincom VisualWorks , so I 'm learning more about it as I progress .
I think GNU Smalltalk is interesting , but as a Squeak contributor , I can't look at it because of the licensing issues ( GPL code cannot be derived into MIT - licensed releases ) .
InfoQ : Ruby 1.9 added Fibers - a construct which can also be used as symmetric coroutine .
Some Smalltalk versions also use these instead of exposing heavyweight kernel threads - what 's your experience ?
In Smalltalk versions that only have userspace threads - are there situations where you 'd like to use kernel threads ?
I 'm not a big fan of threads .
In Unix , thread is spelled " f o r k " for a reason .
I think sharing should be opt - in , rather than opt- out , and threads presume the wrong default .
InfoQ : You 've been actively promoting Smalltalk for some time now .
What are the two most common questions or objections to Smalltalk you get ?
" Smalltalk , is n't it dead ? " Hardly .
" Can I edit with my favorite editor ? "
Basically no , and you would n't want to use your favorite editor when you realize you 're only editing 5 to 10 lines of code at once anyway , and you really want an editor that is sensitive to the current environment .
The built - in code editors do that just fine .
One approach to make Smalltalk usable from IDEs like Eclipse is the STDT .
It 's based on Eclipse and translates Smalltalk 's code into files and resources .
The " Industry Misinterpretations " podcast has a long interview with one of the STDT developers .
As an aside , Eclipse and Smalltalk should go together well , particulalry , as Rick DeNatale explains , because Eclipse grew out of IBM's Smalltalk efforts .
InfoQ :
What 's your elevator intro to the Smalltalk - how would you explain it to your , say , Perl friends ?
Smalltalk - I can teach the * entire * syntax to you in 20 minutes .
It 's pure objects , and the debugger allows for live debugging , even in a web environment .
Smalltalk has distributed source code management built in , and can talk to any library on the system either natively or via FFI .
Smalltalk can talk to files , devices , and sockets as well as any Perl program can , and has been around for * far* longer .
Every bit of your interaction with the system is open and editable and customizable , including your dev tools .
InfoQ : Who 's behind Squeak nowadays - and how is development moving forward ?
The Squeak Leadership team ( including me ) represents the community to oversee the overall project .
We also have Web teams , Release teams , News teams , and so on , to handle the specifics .
( http://www.squeak.org/Community/Teams/)
InfoQ : What features - language concepts or other - from Perl do you miss in Smalltalk , if any ?
I still use Perl for command - line scripting .
Smalltalk does n't lend itself to small programs very well . :)
InfoQ : What 's your opinion on Ruby 's Open Classes ( Monkey Patching ) ?
Have you used Squeak 's Traits ?
It 's nice that a package like Seaside can teach every object to " render itself " on a web page , with the class dispatch mechanism used for appropriate selection .
Without that kind of patching , you have to build the equivalent of class dispatching at the user code level , and it 's never as clean .
InfoQ : Ruby has seen many new implementations come along recently - Smalltalk has had many different runtimes from different vendors .
Do you see the different implementations of Smalltalk as a problem or an asset ?
The two big smalltalks I play with ( Squeak and VisualWorks ) actually shared a common ancestor ( the original Xerox Parc image ) , so that 's not much of an issue .
However , projects like Seaside are actually helping to ensure that vendors stay fairly close in features , so this is a good thing .
For more information on Smalltalk by Randal , he 's been interviewed on the Industry Misinterpretations podcast , and he co-hosts the FLOSS Weekly podcast .
One episode is particularly interesting for everyone curious about Smalltalk : FLOSS 29 : Interview with Dan Ingalls , who wrote the first Smalltalk runtime from a language spec by Alan Kay back in the early 1970s , and many of the following Smalltalk versions at PARC , as well as Squeak .
Randal also blogs about Smalltalk .
For more information on Smalltalk and how Smalltalk developers approach software development , one source is Cincom 's James Robertson , who blogs about Smalltalk and also publishes a daily screencast and a weekly podcast .
GemStone has a blog focussing on GLASS , their GemStone / Linux / Apache / Smalltalk / Seaside software stack .
Finally , a list of free books on Smalltalk is available online .
At dConstruct in Brighton last month Steven Johnson talked at length about his startup , outside .in , that collects together place - blogs to display aggregates commentary and information on a block , neighbourhood and city level .
The site is US - only at the moment , which made it a curious presentation for a largely non-US audience .
Their toolset for extracting geographical information from blog entries is impressive , but a number of us were talking afterwards about what the real value of such aggregation is for those who might already live in an information - rich or tightly knit neighbourhood .
I find outside .
in handy for keeping up with news from Grand Rapids now that I no longer live there , but even if it were available in the UK I suspect its main use would be for identifying other local people rather than learning what ’s going on .
And even then , there are existing community discussion groups and other fora that work well .
What would seem really compelling is a way to connect with the places that only get our partial attention .
A couple of times a week I take a bus past a local leisure centre .
It ’s not somewhere that I ’m likely to use at the moment , but with big life changes coming up it may be somewhere I ’m more interested in before long .
It was n’t until after the fact that I saw that it was the centre of some controversial planning decisions , far too late to engage in the debate .
We all travel along a variety of paths all the time .
Often only a few of the places on our routes get much of our attention , but most of them are of some importance to us .
I ’d really like to have a site that was aware of my most common ( or preferred ) routes and helped me engage with them more deeply .
Presumably it would n’t be much more work than that outside .
in does to assemble place - blogs .
That geo - data just needs to be mapped to a trajectory rather than a simple locale .

Marino's Sagra dell ' Uva is one of the oldest grape festivals in Italy Wine started flowing through taps in dozens of homes during an Italian grape festival in Marino , south of Rome .
At the heart of the town 's famous Sagra dell ' Uva , or Grape Festival , is the moment when sparkling white wine flows from the fountains in the main square .
But this year locals and tourists had to make do with water , as bad plumbing meant the wine supply was switched by mistake to local homes .
People come from as far away as France and Germany to watch the display .
" Every year , during the Grape Festival , we interrupt the water supply to the main fountains in the town centre and we channel wine into them instead to re-evoke a famous victory , " Mayor Adriano Palozzi said .
Accidental supply " But this year , " Mr Palozzi said , " Due to a technical error , instead of connecting wine to the fountains , we accidentally channelled it into some local homes .
" Apparently the people living around the square who got the wine coming out of their taps were very surprised , they thought that it might be some kind of present from the local council !
It only lasted three minutes , we corrected it straight away . "
About 10 to 12 houses were affected , and the main bar on the town 's square also had wine instead of water .
Commemorating the Battle of Lepanto , October 1571
Each year , they hand out 150 tonnes of grapes and provide 3,000 litres of the local white wine during the four - day festival .
The grape festival , which is one of the oldest in Italy , commemorates the return of Admiral Marcantonio Colonna to his home in Marino after his victory over the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto in October 1571 .
The town sent more than 250 sailors to the battle .
The sagra is celebrated on the first Sunday of October to give thanks for their safe return .

An alternative treatment used to " cleanse the colon , " a coffee enema involves introducing a mixture of coffee and water into the colon by way of the rectum .
Proponents suggest that coffee enemas can aid in detox and clear potentially harmful substances from the body .
Adam Gault / OJO Images / Getty Images
Unlike colonics , which involve multiple infusions of water , an enema involves a one - time infusion of water .
The water sits in the lower part of the colon for a short period of time , then is released .
While coffee enemas are sometimes administered by practitioners of alternative medicine , many individuals perform coffee enemas on their own at home .
Uses for Coffee Enemas
Coffee enemas are typically touted as a natural treatment for the following health issues :
Chronic pain
Constipation ﻿ ﻿
﻿ Depression
Fatigue
Intestinal parasites
Yeast overgrowth
In addition , coffee enemas are often used to boost mood , reduce stress , increase energy levels , improve digestion , and promote sounder sleep .
Coffee enemas are also purported to aid in the treatment and / or prevention of cancer .
To that end , it 's commonly used as a component of Gerson Therapy .﻿﻿
The Research
Despite their popularity , coffee enemas and their health effects have been explored in very few scientific studies .
The available research indicates that coffee enemas may fail to offer significant health benefits .
For instance , a small study published in Human & Experimental Toxicology in 2012 provides evidence contrary to the claim that coffee enemas can increase the body 's production of glutathione .﻿﻿
A compound with antioxidant properties , glutathione is known to stimulate the excretion of bile ( a substance critical for digestion ) .
Proponents of coffee enemas often name increased glutathione production as a key factor in the treatment 's supposedly detoxifying effects .
For the 2012 study , 11 healthy participants either received coffee enemas three times a week for two weeks or drank coffee twice daily for 11 days .
After a washout period , each participant then switched to the alternate coffee - based treatment .
Results revealed that neither approach led to an increase in glutathione levels or in total antioxidant capacity .
However , a pilot study published in Clinical Nutrition Research in 2014 suggests that coffee enemas may be useful in preparing the bowel for endoscopy ( a type of procedure that includes cancer - screening tests such as a colonoscopy ) .﻿﻿
Side Effects and Safety Concerns
Coffee enemas may also lead to a number of serious complications , such as dehydration , pleural or pericardial effusions , infections , sepsis , salmonella , colitis , rectal or internal burns , perforation of the wall of the intestines , electrolyte imbalance , brain abscess , heart failure , and even death .﻿﻿
There have been three deaths related to coffee enemas associated with electrolyte imbalance caused by frequent enemas .
There 's a concern that coffee enemas may be harmful to people with certain conditions such as an abdominal hernia , blood vessel disease , congestive heart failure , Crohn 's disease , diverticulitis , gastrointestinal cancer , heart disease , intestinal tumors , severe anemia , hemorrhoids , and ulcerative colitis .
The risk of side effects appears to increase if coffee enemas are combined with fasting .﻿﻿
In addition , coffee enemas should not be done by pregnant or nursing women , children , and people who have undergone colon surgery .
Like coffee consumed orally , coffee enemas can be stimulating and result in caffeine dependence .
Conclusion
Due to the lack of research on the health effects of coffee enemas and considerable risks , coffee enemas cannot be recommended for any reason .
If you 're still considering trying it , it 's important to talk with your primary care provider first .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares plunged to their lowest levels in almost 20 years on Wednesday , while the mortgage companies ’ bonds rallied on the belief that an increasingly likely government bailout would wipe out shareholders but secure their massive debt .
U.S. Treasury and Freddie Mac officials met to discuss how the company can best weather the current economic woes in light of mounting credit losses , sources familiar with the meeting said , but neither Treasury nor Freddie Mac officials would comment on details .
“ As you would expect , we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and we ’ve been communicating with their regulator and the Federal Reserve , ” Treasury spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said .
Wednesday ’s meeting was one of several since mid-July when the U.S. Congress approved a plan to provide any necessary extra funding for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Anxiety about the companies has risen this week following a report in Barron ’s newspaper that government officials may have no choice but to go ahead and effectively nationalize Fannie and Freddie as rising defaults on home mortgages undermine the value of their assets .
Freddie Mac ’s stock slumped 22 percent to $ 3.25 , after falling to the lowest level since 1990 , and Fannie Mae shares slid nearly 27 percent to $ 4.40 , after hitting the lowest level since 1988 .
“ We continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize Fannie and Freddie , and what that would leave over for existing shareholders , ” said Marshall Front , chairman of investment firm Front Barnett Associates in Chicago .
But the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rallied , as bond investors believe the government will do whatever it takes to maintain confidence in the two companies , since their ability to issue debt , and use the proceeds to help fund U.S. home buyers , is critical to pulling U.S. housing out of its worst slump since the Great Depression .
CreditSights analysts said in a report that it was a “ highly remote ” possibility that senior debt would be impaired in a government investment in the U.S. mortgage giants .
While the Treasury is going to try to avoid nationalization , other rescue scenarios include the Treasury buying the agencies ’ mortgage - backed securities , or other debt , or preferred shares , according to Ira Jersey , U.S. interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse in New York .
“ ( It could be ) something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders , but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing OK , ” Jersey said .
Fears that the two companies will need to be bailed out forced Freddie Mac to pay record - high yield premiums on a $ 3 billion debt sale on Tuesday .
But Freddie Mac ’s debt prices rallied on Wednesday and the yield gap over Treasuries was sliced to about 0.98 percentage point from 1.13 points a day ago , even though U.S. Treasury bonds also rallied .

“ It ’s fundamentally a flight to quality , ” said Lee Olver , fixed - income strategist at SMH Capital in Houston .
“ The market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government , ” Olver said .
The cost to insure Freddie Mac senior debt against a default with credit default swaps fell 18 percent to 40 basis points , or $ 40,000 a year to insure $ 10 million of debt for five years , according to Markit Intraday .
Fannie ’s spreads also tightened about 16 percent to 40 basis points .
Earlier this year , Freddie Mac committed to raising $ 5.5 billion in fresh capital to bolster its balance sheet , but investors are unlikely to buy new shares if they fear a government rescue might wipe out their equity .

Meanwhile , Fannie Mae Chief Executive Daniel Mudd , speaking Wednesday on National Public Radio , reiterated that the company has more capital than it has ever had , and that it has not asked , nor been offered , help from the U.S. Treasury .
Hedge - fund manager Doug Kass , who has placed big bets that Fannie Mae shares will fall , said on Wednesday that the depressed stock of the two companies will drop to zero , dismissing Mudd ’s comments about its capital adequacy .
“ What Mudd did n’t say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset -- housing -- and losses are off the charts and ( there are ) no signs of stability , ” Kass , founder and president of Seabreeze Partners Management , said in an interview .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee almost half of all outstanding U.S. mortgages and the government is relying heavily on them to step up mortgage purchases to hold down home lending rates and help stabilize the flailing housing market .
It is important for Fannie and Freddie to keep operating , and recent government steps on their behalf were “ appropriate , ” Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Gary Stern told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday .
But the looming U.S. election and the recent Congressional mandate to the Treasury to provide funding for Fannie and Freddie argue for delaying a bailout as long as possible , Bill Gross , chief investment officer of Pimco , said in an e-mail .
“ That delay will only be possible if the GSEs continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads , ” he said of the government - sponsored enterprises ’ funding costs .
If costs jump further and foreign investment fades , the Treasury will be forced to act sooner .
Foreign investment is being closely monitored , as ebbing demand means higher funding costs for Fannie and Freddie and thus rising home loan interest rates , analysts have said .
Overseas central banks dumped nearly $ 11 billion of agency - related securities during the past month .
Russia , for one , is not planning to rapidly raise or cut exposure to debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Russia ’s deputy finance minister said on Wednesday .
Everyone dreams ( even if we do n’t always remember them after the fact ) and researchers have found that the majority of us have dreams with similar themes .
For years people have tried to uncover the meaning of dreams — the fleeting images that we see when we go to sleep .
Some interpretations are outright bizarre , while others are pretty understandable .
This is a list of the interpretations that the Association for the Study of Dreams has given to the most recurring and common types of dream .
Be sure to tell us whether you think it is accurate from your own experiences .
10 Car Troubles
In these types of dreams you are usually in or near a car or some other type of vehicle which is out of control or has other problems that seem insurmountable .
For example , the brakes may have failed , you may have lost control of the steering , or be heading over a cliff or crashing .
You can either be the driver or the passenger .
This is a very common type of nightmare and it occurs in all people – not just those who can drive .
This dream usually means that you are feeling powerless over something in your life – or that you are heading for a crash ( metaphorically speaking ) .
9 Faulty Machinery
In the faulty machinery dream you are trying to operate mechanical equipment which either fails to work , or fails to work in the way that you expect it to .
The vast majority of these dreams involve a telephone – either trouble dialing , losing a connection , or dialing a wrong number .
It can involve a lost Internet connection , or something manual like a jammed or broken machine .
This dream often means that you feel you are losing touch with reality , or that a part of your body or mind is not functioning as it should .
It can also occur when you are feeling anxious about making a connection with another person in real life .
8 Lost or Trapped
Dreaming about being lost is very common and will usually occur when you are having conflict in deciding how to react in a situation in real life .
In the dream you are trying to find your way out of an area – such as a forest , city streets , a large building , or other maze - like structure .
Another way this dream plays out involves you being trapped , buried alive , caught in a web , or unable to move for some other reason .
This is often accompanied by a feeling of terror .
This dream usually means that you are trapped in real life – unable to make the right choice .
7 Missed a Boat or Plane
In this type of dream you are rushing to catch a bus , train , plane , or other type of public transport – but you miss it – usually by a fraction of a second .
Rather than feeling fear in this dream , you usually feel frustration .
This dream can also occur in a different form , in which you arrive late for an important performance or sporting event that you are supposed to participate in , only to find that the event has already begun .
This dream usually means that you feel that you have missed out on an important opportunity in your real life .
It will often occur when you are struggling over an important decision .
6 Failing a Test
This dream usually manifests itself in people who have been out of school for a long time .
In the dream you are prevented from passing a test in a variety of different possible scenarios .
In one scenario you find that you are unable to make it to the test on time , often through being unable to find the test room .
In other versions you are unprepared ( either through lack of study ) or you are missing equipment .
This dream usually means that you are feeling tested in some way in your real life .
You may feel that you are unprepared for something or playing the wrong part in life .
5 Ill or Dying
In this dream , you ( or a loved one ) are ill , injured , or dying .
It is a moderately common dream and , not surprisingly , occurs often at the onset of an illness .
Aside from becoming ill , this dream can mean that you are emotionally hurt or are afraid of becoming hurt .
The dream may also be warning you of an upcoming physical risk to yourself or a loved one .
When it is someone else in the dream that dies , it can mean that you feel that part of yourself ( that you see represented by that person ) is dead .
It may also mean that you wish the person would go away , or that you fear losing them .
4 Being Chased
Dreaming of being chased can be a truly horrifying experience .
Most often the chaser is a monster or some person that is frightening , and occasionally it may be an animal .
You may be surprised to know that this is the most commonly experienced nightmare theme .
The meaning of these dreams is that someone , something ( possibly something as obscure as an emotion ) is making you feel threatened .
One way to determine the root of the threat is to ask yourself who or what in your real life most closely resembles the “ creature ” or circumstance in your dream .
It is also worth noting that sometimes this dream is a replay of an actual event in your life .
3 Bad or Missing Teeth
Teeth dreams are fairly common and they usually involve the discovery of extremely decayed or missing teeth in your own mouth .
Sometimes you will dream that you open your mouth and your teeth begin to fall out .
The fact that the majority of people today have reasonable teeth ( perhaps with the exception of the British ) , it is not surprising that we feel so emotionally disturbed by these dreams .
So , what does it mean when we dream about missing teeth ?
At the most basic level it means that we are afraid of being found unattractive .
At a deeper level , it can signify a fear of embarrassment or a loss of power in real life .
Oh – I was just kidding about the “ British ” thing !
2 Dream Nudity
In this type of dream you are in a state of undress , partial undress , or inappropriate dress ( for example wearing pajamas to work ) .
Occasionally you are the witness of another person who is naked while you are clothed .
This is often accompanied by feelings of embarrassment and shame , but occasionally with the feeling of pride or freedom .
The meaning of this dream is that you are feeling exposed , awkward , or vulnerable , or you are afraid that you have revealed too much of yourself ( such as a secret or a very personal feeling ) in a real life situation .
An interesting fact about this type of dream is that it occurs much more frequently in people who are involved in a wedding ceremony in their real life .
1 Falling or Sinking
We have all had falling dreams – it is such a common dream , in fact , that myths have arisen over them ; the most common myth is , of course , that you will die if you hit the ground in the dream .
I can assure you , having hit the ground in more than one falling dream , that this is not true at all .
In the falling dream we are usually falling through the air and frightened .
Occasionally we may be sinking in water ( and in danger of drowning ) .
Typically a person having this dream is feeling insecure or lacking in support in their waking life .
These dreams often occur when you are overwhelmed in life and feel ready to give up .
If you have this dream you should evaluate your current situation and try to locate the problem that is overwhelming you .
Deal with it and this dream should go away .
From 2005 until about 2010 , I designed a series of typographically meticulous magazine parodies full of New York media - world in - jokes .
They got a lot of attention from influential blogs like Gawker and Design Observer .
I initially started making these for Panopticist , my personal blog at the time .
They caught the eye of some folks at Vanity Fair , and I created a bunch for VF , too .
Here ’s a selection .
“ This institution was a big question mark about the health of the deposit fund , ” Sheila C. Bair , the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C. , said on a conference call Thursday .
“ It was unique in its size and exposure to higher risk mortgages and the distressed housing market .
This is the big one that everybody was worried about . ”
She said that the bank ’s rapidly deteriorating condition prompted regulators to seize it Thursday , and not on a Friday as is typical for bank closures .
For weeks , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department were nervous about the fate of WaMu , among the worst - hit by the housing crisis , and pressed hard for the bank to sell itself .
Washington Mutual publicly insisted that it could remain independent , but the giant thrift had quietly hired Goldman Sachs about two weeks ago to identify potential bidders .
But nobody could make the numbers work and several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid .
But as panic gripped financial markets last week after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , WaMu customers started withdrawing their deposits .
The government then stepped up its efforts , at points going behind WaMu ’s back to work privately with four potential bidders on a deal .
On Wednesday afternoon , the government solicited formal written bids .
On Thursday morning , regulators notified James Dimon , chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , that he was the likely winner .
“ We are building a company , ” Mr. Dimon said in a brief interview .
“ We are kind of lucky to have this opportunity to do this .
We always had our eye on it . ”
But the seizure and the deal with JPMorgan came as a shock to Washington Mutual ’s board , which was kept completely in the dark : the company ’s new chief executive , Alan H. Fishman , was in midair , flying from New York to Seattle at the time the deal was finally brokered , according to people briefed on the situation .
Mr. Fishman , who has been on the job for less than three weeks , is eligible for $ 11.6 million in cash severance and will get to keep his $ 7.5 million signing bonus , according to an analysis by James F. Reda and Associates .
WaMu was not immediately available for comment .
The government has dealt with troubled financial institutions differently .
Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual , which were less entangled with the rest of the financial system , were allowed to collapse .
But the government took emergency measures to stabilize Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and the American International Group , the insurance giant .
Federal regulators had been trying to broker a deal for Washington Mutual because a takeover by the F.D.I.C. would have dealt a crushing blow to the federal government ’s deposit insurance fund .
The fund , which stood at $ 45.2 billion at the end of June , has been severely depleted after suffering a loss from the sudden collapse of IndyMac Bank .
Analysts say that a failure of Washington Mutual would have cost the fund as much as $ 30 billion or more .
The deal will end WaMu ’s 119 - year run as an independent company and give JPMorgan Chase branches in California and other markets where it does not have a big presence .
John Daly Arrested at Hooters , Held in 24 Hour Detox ( Mugshot )
PGA golferpassed out after a binge of heavy drinking at a Winston - Salem , NC Hooters on Sunday .
The extremely intoxicated and uncooperative athlete was taken into police custody for a 24 hour detox lockup at Forsyth County Enforcement Detention Center .
Restaurant personnel called paramedics when they determined that Daly might need help .
They tried to rouse him but he refused to be transported to a medical facility so police were summoned to take over .
They hauled the unruly Daly to jail where he was photographed , fingerprinted and held for a 24 hour sober up .
Daly , a popular pro tour favorite , has undergone alcohol rehabilitation treatment three times .
He has also shared details of an addiction to gambling in the last chapter of his autobiography .
Daly has won two major championships : the 1991 PGA Championship and the 1995 British Open .
His last tour victory was the 2004 Buick Invitational .
In March 2008 , his golf swing coach , Butch Harmon , quit working with the golfer after the long hitter spent a 2 - 1/ 2 hour rain delay in the Hooters corporate tent at the PODS Championship .
Clearly disgusted , Harmon told a reporter : " My whole goal for him was he 's got to show me golf is the most important thing in his life .
The most important thing in Daly 's life is getting drunk . "
UPDATE : December 31 , 2008 - John
Daly has been suspended for six months by the PGA for poor conduct .
Daly told The Associated Press that the suspension is " not fair in reality , but it 's probably fair in perception . "
He has n't been seen on the tour since he missed the cut in Las Vegas on October 17 .
We 've included a photo of the power hitter in his prime .

There are two things that are certain in life , and I 'm not talking about death and taxes .
These happen to be of the food - related variety .
Even though I am sure you are well aware of these food truisms , they are always fun to repeat :
Peanut butter goes well with anything .
Bacon makes everything taste better .
You may be familiar with these food rules , but did you know they are not independently separate from each other ?
Bacon and peanut butter work together too .
If you 've never had a peanut butter and bacon burger , you just do n't know what you 're missing .
Yet , of course , rules are made to be broken .
Or at least pushed to the breaking point .
Cases in point : peanut butter slices and canned bacon .
MREdepot
P.B. Slices threaten promise to do to peanut butter what Kraft did to cheese .
Individually wrapped and perfectly shaped , the squares of peanut butter are being marketed as " convenient and stackable . "
I do n't know how convenient they really are , but they certainly do appear to be stackable .
Next up is Yoder 's Canned Bacon .
In case you were wondering , it did n't fare too well in a taste test ( From The Onion 's A.V. Club ) .
Although one intrepid food explorer commented , " If nothing else , there 's a lot of value in canned bacon , " since so much was left untouched on the plate .
Food technology is a wonderful thing , but sometimes it might not be wise to fool with the laws of nature .
Best just stick to basics and combine these two familiar foods into delicious creations like peanut butter and bacon burgers .

A week does not pass where I have the opportunity to chastise yet another injured Q - tip user on the Ear Disorders Board or in my own clinic .
I had two today , including one admitted bobby - pin user .
I have a well - deserved reputation of being a venomous and unsympathetic opponent of using Q - tips in the ear , so I thought this topic deserved another blog post .
Now , I use the term Q - tip , a brand name and registered trademark of the Chesebrough - Pond / Unilever Company , and makers of Vaseline and other slick products , in the generic sense .
Since Q-tips are a lot easier to say than “ cotton - tipped applicators ” , I will use this term .
There are certainly other manufacturers of cotton - tipped applicators out there , but none with eighty years of manufacturing experience .
I always thought that the Q of Q - tip meant “ quick ” since others have chosen to bastardize this fine brand name in this fashion .
I was surprised to discover that the Q actually means “ quality ” .
Strangely enough , I also discovered that Q - tips used to be called Baby Gays ; a name given to this product by its Polish inventor ( I ’m not going there ) that would not be considered politically - correct marketing today .
Let me say up front to ward off the lawyers of this fine company , that it is not the Q - tips that are the problem .
It is the USERS of the Q - tips that I wish to address .
Q - tips do not harm people ; people harm people .
I wish that I had a box of Q - tips to check my facts , but I have been told that the company has a warning on the box not to use them INSIDE the ear .
That is a very good and responsible statement .
Unfortunately , few people read the box or heed this warning .
I found the following statement on their Web site :
A growing number of school districts are hiring teachers from foreign countries to fill shortages in math , science and special education .
The trend is most evident in poor urban and rural districts , according to educators .
Segun Eubanks , director of teacher quality at the National Education Association , the USA 's largest teachers union , says many of those districts have trouble keeping teachers for reasons including low pay , disruptive students , and a lack of books and materials .
" American workers are not willing to do the work for the conditions and pay we offer , " he says .
" So we 're recruiting them for the same reasons we recruit farmworkers and day laborers . "
The National Council on Teacher Quality ( NCTQ ) , a think tank , says a new teacher is generally paid $ 30,000 to $ 45,000 .
The Department of Education does not track foreign teachers .
The American Federation of Teachers union estimates at least 18,000 of the nation 's 3.7 million teachers were hired elsewhere .
Kate Walsh , NCTQ president and a member of the Maryland State Board of Education , says it has become more common to hire overseas .
" All poor districts have a harder time recruiting , " she says .
" Anytime you 're teaching poor kids in the inner city , it 's very hard to get teachers to stay . "
Walsh says foreign teachers can enrich students ' education by exposing them to other cultures .
Eubanks agrees but says the USA must address the underlying shortage by training more teachers and improving schools .
Foreign teachers must pass state tests and meet federal requirements .
Around the country :
• Prince George 's County public schools in Maryland , with a teaching staff of 10,000 , have 556 Filipino teachers and uncounted others from other countries .
• Los Angeles has 326 foreign teachers out of 33,529 .
• Wichita public schools have 43 foreign teachers , all Filipino , out of 4,000 .
• Baltimore public schools have 593 foreign teachers from Jamaica , India , the Philippines and elsewhere out of 7,000 , says George Duque , staffing director .
" Retention has been excellent .
We 've only had 20 , max , who have not been renewed or who have chosen to leave . "
Duque says Filipino teachers are a good fit because English is one of the country 's official languages and its academic system is similar to the USA's .
He acknowledges that there can be clashes over teachers ' accents and cultural differences .
Filipino teachers , for example , come from a culture where teachers are revered , he says .
" When they come here , they have to learn about our culture and the urban culture and the culture of poverty and the challenges our children have , " he says .
Danilo Danga , 33 , is in his fourth year teaching special education at Baltimore 's Calverton Elementary / Middle School .
He taught English and social studies in the Philippines for eight years .
At first , he says , students disrupted class and cursed at him , yelling , " Shut up , Jackie Chan ! " and other taunts .
Colleagues advised him to assert himself and offer rewards for good behavior .
He did .
Among the rewards was Filipino chicken adobo he cooked himself .
" Each year is becoming better and better , " he says .
" I 'm excited to come to school every day despite all the challenges . "
Over at DjangoSites there is a steady flow of new websites , with a handful showing up every single day .
Something really cool is that a growing number of these are either commercial websites that are using Django to make money , or they are very serious in terms of code - base , development effort and online exposure .
Django is growing up , and is making an impression on the web at large : I 've decided to interview the brains behind these websites to find out why they chose Django , how it assisted their development processes , and how it got in their way .
Soon I 'll be launching Django Site of the Week , and I want your input .
So far I 've conducted quick interviews with a number of fantastic websites that are powered by Django .
Some of these are commercial and charge their users for access , others are large - scale community projects , and others are a hybrid .
I'm in the process of editing them into something useful for the community , with plans to launch Django SOTW within the next few weeks .
Each week , I aim to publish an interview with the creators of a Django - powered website that stands out from the other sites listed at DjangoSites .
I 'm looking for the real cream of the crop : websites that are more than a blog and a collection of generic views .
Some of the websites you can expect to see interviews from in the first few weeks include EveryBlock , SuggestionBox and Disqus .
These sites are all unique and have approached a problem in their own way , all of them using Django .
The reasons for using Django and the issues they faced are interesting , and some background information should help aspiring entrepreneurs as they work towards releasing their own Django - based websites .
While I continue to prepare the websites , I would like any suggestions for websites to feature .
If you would like to nominate a website to be the Django Site of the Week , or if you have a unique story to tell from your involvement in the development of a complex Django powered website , please email me at ross at this domain .
I 'd love to hear from you .
Denial is bad for two reasons .
First , if you can't accept that you lost , you do n't have a prayer of getting better .
If you think Kerry and Gore lost because they were too " high - minded , " then you miss the basic fundamentals at work , and spend your days congratulating yourself for being up on the latest Paul Krugman .
This is a war , and you do n't lose wars because of abstract principles , but because of hard immovable facts .
Is your army bigger than theirs ?
Are you attracting more recruits ?
Are you deploying in the right places ?
Who has more resources ?
Who has the technology edge ?
These are the reasons I voted Obama in the primary .
I did n't think he was " more principled " than Clinton , nor did I really care .
I thought she was tough , but I knew he was tougher .
I thought her campaign was smart , but I thought his was smarter .
I thought one person was talking about being a fighter , and another was out there actually being a fighter .
The general is bearing all of this out , because right now , Barack Hussein Obama is beating John McCain like he stole something -- from Toot , no less .
[ MORE ]
Second , if you can't accept that you lost , if you do n't truly understand what happend to liberals over the past few decades , then can't fully appreciate what the Obama campaign is doing right now .
If you can't admit that we 've sucked in the South for the lionshare of three decades , then you can't really feel what it means to see a black man competing in Florida , Georgia , Virginia and North Carolina .
If you believe that Reagan Democrats were simply deluded , than you can't get what it means to see a black man polling at 52 percent among white blue collar folks in Ohio .
If you think that black voters have forgotten the sacrifices of the Civil Rights movement , than you 're likely to miss the beauty of the storm brewing right outside your door .
Noting this is n't an invite to sit on your ass and not vote , it is n't evidence of complacency .
To the contrary , it 's evidence that the voters are not complacent .
Liberals are the wimp at the end of the bar .
There is a gorgeous red-head , just down the way , working on her third vodka gimlet .
Some herb - ass dude is blustering in her ear , but she 's winking at you .
She walks over and buys you a drink .
She 's waiting on you to ask for the math .
But you want to talk her head off about how things like this never happen to you .
About how you always spill your drink , or trip and fall trying to get off your bar - stool .
It makes her want to go back and talk to the blustery herb just on GP .
And she would -- if the herb had any GP to speak of .
Folks , we are watching a revoloution .
I 'm talking about the technology , the GOTV effort , the historic numbers for black voters , a sick , sick edge among young voters .
Are we going to spend the next days trying to concoct exotic scenarios in which the dastardly Republicans steal this one ?
Are black folks going to sit around wondering if white people will revert back to their Yacubic nature ?
Or are we going to start thinking about the change taking place right before our eyes , and what it means for our agenda ?
What will we do ?
I 'm not asking for self - congratulation -- just some self - confidence .
As soon as children are old enough to interact socially , some become entrenched in chronic and increasing patterns of victimization by their peers , according to a report in the October issue of Archives of General Psychiatry , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
Children who are aggressive in infancy and are from families with harsh parenting styles and insufficient income appear more likely to be consistently victimized .
As many as one in 10 youth are the direct target of physical attacks , hostile words and social aggression from peers during school years , according to background information in the article .
" Studies also show that peer victimization becomes increasingly stable over time , with the same children enduring such negative experiences throughout childhood and adolescence , " the authors write .
" The consequences associated with high and chronic victimization are manifold and include depression , loneliness , low self - esteem , physical health problems , social withdrawal , alcohol and / or drug use , school absence and avoidance , decrease in school performance , self - harm and suicidal ideation [ thoughts and behaviors ] . "
Edward D. Barker , Ph.D. , of the University of Alabama , Tuscaloosa , and colleagues studied 1,970 children ( 51 percent boys ) born in Québec , Montreal , Canada , between October 1997 and July 1998 .
Participating children were assessed at ages 4.5 months , 16.6 months , and 2.4 , 3.4 , 4.1 , 5.1 , 6.2 and 7.2 years .
At each point , mothers provided information on factors such as victimization , family adversity , parenting styles , physical aggression , hyperactivity and internalizing symptoms .
At age 7.2 years , teachers and children reported on victimization by classmates .
" Three trajectory groups were identified with respect to victimization by peers between 3.4 and 6.2 years of age , " the authors write .
" As expected , most of the children ( 71 percent ) fell on a low / increasing trajectory , whereas 25 percent and 4 percent of the children followed moderate / increasing and high / chronic trajectories , respectively .
The overall age - related increase in preschool peer victimization is consistent with the view that , as preschool children progressively spend more time interacting with peers , they are more likely to experience negative peer experiences . "
Children who were on the high / chronic and moderate / increasing trajectory according to their mothers ' reports at young ages also had the highest levels of victimization at age 7.2 , as reported by themselves and their teachers .
Children who were aggressive at a young age ( 17 months ) were more likely to become victims in preschool than children who were less aggressive , but neither early internalizing symptoms ( for example , sadness , fear and anxiety ) or hyperactivity were associated with later victimization .
Children exposed to harsh parenting were more likely to be chronic victims , and insufficient family income also predicted high / chronic and moderate / increasing victimization trajectories .
In addition to identifying factors associated with victimization , " the present results also suggest that multiple forms of victimization may be the norm for victimized children , i.e. , children with a high / chronic trajectory had harsh , reactive parents and were victimized by peers in preschool and after school entry .
Other forms of victimization are likely to occur for these children , both within the school ( e.g. , verbal bullying by teachers ) and within the community , particularly within low socioeconomic contexts , " the authors write .
" These results suggest that early preventive interventions should target both child - and parent - level risks and focus on alternatives to harsh and aggressive interactions . "

How to give more people this route out of crime
John McCain threw up his Florida fire wall yesterday : a million Cuban Americans who see Barack Obama as a combination of Fidel Castro , Hugo Chávez , and any other Latin leader who ever nationalised a business .
In the streets of Miami's Little Havana , which McCain visited yesterday , there was one word for the kind of change promised by Obama .
" Comunismo , " said Michael Garcia , 30 , the son of Cuban emigres who works at his family - owned accounting business .
" I should n't have to pay more taxes because I work harder than other people , " he said .
" The things that Obama say scare me because that 's everything that Fidel said .
These things are associated in my mind with going down the path to communism . "
McCain , who is fighting to hang on to the pivotal state , has tried for two weeks to tap into fears that Obama would raise taxes for business owners , using the story of Joe the Plumber , the Ohio man who confronted the Democrat about his plan to " spread the wealth around " .
But nowhere perhaps has McCain found a more willing audience for his story about Joe the Plumber than south Florida , the heartland of Cuban emigres - where he is known locally as " Pepe el plomero " .
Cuban support is crucial to McCain if he is to hold Florida in Tuesday 's elections , and block Obama from winning the White House .
Here , in the traditional Republican enclave of Little Havana , even the faintest whiff of socialism revives memories of exile from Castro , a psychology McCain played on yesterday .
" Senator Obama is running to be Redistributionist in Chief .
I 'm running to be Commander in Chief , " he told a crowd of a few hundred at a local lumber yard .
" Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth .
I 'm running to create more wealth .
Senator Obama is running to punish the successful .
I 'm running to make everyone successful . "
In the small , tidy homes of Little Havana , lawn campaign signs warn that an Obama presidency would be the first step to communism .
Many of the McCain supporters in the lumberyard yesterday see Obama as practically a clone of Castro .
" Obama is saying 100 % the same things that Castro was saying before 1959 , " said Nerty Piscola who left Cuba as a teenager in 1969 .
" It sounds good .
Many people want to be equal , but the result is that everyone is equal and everyone is poor . "
The fears run even deeper among those who were adults at the time of the revolution .
" If Obama takes power you are going to see all the people going to the fields to cut sugar cane , " said Lazaro de Jesus , a sign painter .
In recent years , Florida 's Cuban Americans have been reinforced in their anti-socialist , anti-Democratic views by a new wave of Spanish - speaking exiles from Venezuela .
At least 80,000 have settled in Florida since Hugo Chávez came to power in 1998 .
The Cuban vote is crucial if McCain is to counter the surge of support for Obama in south Florida .
The three counties surrounding Miami are the Democratic heartland of Florida .
The Obama camp 's strategy for Florida depends on beating McCain by a 600,000 vote margin to take the entire state .
They hope to get a third of their supporters to take part in early voting - a goal made easier yesterday after Florida 's Republican governor ordered polling stations to extend their hours following long queues .
The Obama camp also says it has won over a substantial share of younger Cubans , those who were born in this country and identify more strongly with domestic American issues .
" A lot of the people coming over from the island that have only been here about 10 years tend to vote more Democratic than Republic , " said Carmen Elliott , who was a toddler when her family left Cuba in 1962 .
' Top prize '
Florida is a hotly contested swing state .
With 27 electoral votes , it is a top prize , and its demographic profile makes it close .
The polls show Barack Obama three points ahead of John McCain .
Florida 's influential Cuban - American community , its military population , and " panhandle " conservative whites tend to back Republicans .
But the large population of " snowbirds " , retirees from the north , the state 's non-Cuban Hispanics and black population are likely to back Obama .
In the 2000 election , the infamous " hanging chads " - bits of paper representing ambiguous votes on paper ballots - threw the Florida poll into chaos .
· This article was amended on Saturday November 1 2008 .
Hugo Chávez did not come to power in 2000 .
He was elected in 1998 and re-elected in 2000 and 2006 .
This has been corrected .

We live in a world of euphemism .
Undertakers have become " morticians , " press agents are now " public relations counselors " and janitors have all been transformed into " superintendents . "
In every walk of life , plain facts have been wrapped in cloudy camouflage .
No less has this been true of economics .
In the old days , we used to suffer nearly periodic economic crises , the sudden onset of which was called a " panic , " and the lingering trough period after the panic was called " depression . "
The most famous depression in modern times , of course , was the one that began in a typical financial panic in 1929 and lasted until the advent of World War II .
After the disaster of 1929 , economists and politicians resolved that this must never happen again .
The easiest way of succeeding at this resolve was , simply to define " depressions " out of existence .
From that point on , America was to suffer no further depressions .
For when the next sharp depression came along , in 1937 – 38 , the economists simply refused to use the dread name , and came up with a new , much softer - sounding word : " recession . "
From that point on , we have been through quite a few recessions , but not a single depression .
But pretty soon the word " recession " also became too harsh for the delicate sensibilities of the American public .
It now seems that we had our last recession in 1957 – 58 .
For since then , we have only had " downturns , " or , even better , " slowdowns , " or " sidewise movements . "
So be of good cheer ; from now on , depressions and even recessions have been outlawed by the semantic fiat of economists ; from now on , the worst that can possibly happen to us are " slowdowns . "
Such are the wonders of the " New Economics . "
For 30 years , our nation 's economists have adopted the view of the business cycle held by the late British economist , John Maynard Keynes , who created the Keynesian , or the " New , " Economics in his book , The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , published in 1936 .
Beneath their diagrams , mathematics , and inchoate jargon , the attitude of Keynesians toward booms and bust is simplicity , even naïveté , itself .
If there is inflation , then the cause is supposed to be " excessive spending " on the part of the public ; the alleged cure is for the government , the self - appointed stabilizer and regulator of the nation 's economy , to step in and force people to spend less , " sopping up their excess purchasing power " through increased taxation .
If there is a recession , on the other hand , this has been caused by insufficient private spending , and the cure now is for the government to increase its own spending , preferably through deficits , thereby adding to the nation 's aggregate spending stream .
The idea that increased government spending or easy money is " good for business " and that budget cuts or harder money is " bad " permeates even the most conservative newspapers and magazines .
These journals will also take for granted that it is the sacred task of the federal government to steer the economic system on the narrow road between the abysses of depression on the one hand and inflation on the other , for the free - market economy is supposed to be ever liable to succumb to one of these evils .
All current schools of economists have the same attitude .
Note , for example , the viewpoint of Dr. Paul W. McCracken , the incoming chairman of President Nixon 's Council of Economic Advisers .
In an interview with the New York Times shortly after taking office [ January 24 , 1969 ] , Dr. McCracken asserted that one of the major economic problems facing the new administration is " how you cool down this inflationary economy without at the same time tripping off unacceptably high levels of unemployment .
In other words , if the only thing we want to do is cool off the inflation , it could be done .
But our social tolerances on unemployment are narrow . "
And again : " I think we have to feel our way along here .
We do n't really have much experience in trying to cool an economy in orderly fashion .
We slammed on the brakes in 1957 , but , of course , we got substantial slack in the economy . "
Note the fundamental attitude of Dr. McCracken toward the economy — remarkable only in that it is shared by almost all economists of the present day .
The economy is treated as a potentially workable , but always troublesome and recalcitrant patient , with a continual tendency to hive off into greater inflation or unemployment .
The function of the government is to be the wise old manager and physician , ever watchful , ever tinkering to keep the economic patient in good working order .
In any case , here the economic patient is clearly supposed to be the subject , and the government as " physician " the master .
It was not so long ago that this kind of attitude and policy was called " socialism " ; but we live in a world of euphemism , and now we call it by far less harsh labels , such as " moderation " or " enlightened free enterprise . "
We live and learn .
What , then , are the causes of periodic depressions ?
Must we always remain agnostic about the causes of booms and busts ?
Is it really true that business cycles are rooted deep within the free - market economy , and that therefore some form of government planning is needed if we wish to keep the economy within some kind of stable bounds ?
Do booms and then busts just simply happen , or does one phase of the cycle flow logically from the other ?
The currently fashionable attitude toward the business cycle stems , actually , from Karl Marx .
Marx saw that , before the Industrial Revolution in approximately the late 18th century , there were no regularly recurring booms and depressions .
There would be a sudden economic crisis whenever some king made war or confiscated the property of his subject ; but there was no sign of the peculiarly modern phenomena of general and fairly regular swings in business fortunes , of expansions and contractions .
Since these cycles also appeared on the scene at about the same time as modern industry , Marx concluded that business cycles were an inherent feature of the capitalist market economy .
All the various current schools of economic thought , regardless of their other differences and the different causes that they attribute to the cycle , agree on this vital point : that these business cycles originate somewhere deep within the free - market economy .
The market economy is to blame .
Karl Marx believed that the periodic depressions would get worse and worse , until the masses would be moved to revolt and destroy the system , while the modern economists believe that the government can successfully stabilize depressions and the cycle .
But all parties agree that the fault lies deep within the market economy and that if anything can save the day , it must be some form of massive government intervention .
There are , however , some critical problems in the assumption that the market economy is the culprit .
For " general economic theory " teaches us that supply and demand always tend to be in equilibrium in the market and that therefore prices of products as well as of the factors that contribute to production are always tending toward some equilibrium point .
Even though changes of data , which are always taking place , prevent equilibrium from ever being reached , there is nothing in the general theory of the market system that would account for regular and recurring boom - and - bust phases of the business cycle .
Modern economists " solve " this problem by simply keeping their general price and market theory and their business - cycle theory in separate , tightly - sealed compartments , with never the twain meeting , much less integrated with each other .
Economists , unfortunately , have forgotten that there is only one economy and therefore only one integrated economic theory .
Neither economic life nor the structure of theory can or should be in watertight compartments ; our knowledge of the economy is either one integrated whole or it is nothing .
Yet most economists are content to apply totally separate and , indeed , mutually exclusive , theories for general price analysis and for business cycles .
They can not be genuine economic scientists so long as they are content to keep operating in this primitive way .
But there are still graver problems with the currently fashionable approach .
Economists also do not see one particularly critical problem because they do not bother to square their business cycle and general price theories : the peculiar breakdown of the entrepreneurial function at times of economic crisis and depression .
In the market economy , one of the most vital functions of the businessman is to be an " entrepreneur , " a man who invests in productive methods , who buys equipment and hires labor to produce something which he is not sure will reap him any return .
In short , the entrepreneurial function is the function of forecasting the uncertain future .
Before embarking on any investment or line of production , the entrepreneur , or " enterpriser , " must estimate present and future costs and future revenues and therefore estimate whether and how much profits he will earn from the investment .
If he forecasts well and significantly better than his business competitors , he will reap profits from his investment .
The better his forecasting , the higher the profits he will earn .
If , on the other hand , he is a poor forecaster and overestimates the demand for his product , he will suffer losses and pretty soon be forced out of the business .
The market economy , then , is a profit - and - loss economy , in which the acumen and ability of business entrepreneurs is gauged by the profits and losses they reap .
The market economy , moreover , contains a built - in mechanism , a kind of natural selection , that ensures the survival and the flourishing of the superior forecaster and the weeding - out of the inferior ones .
For the more profits reaped by the better forecasters , the greater become their business responsibilities , and the more they will have available to invest in the productive system .
On the other hand , a few years of making losses will drive the poorer forecasters and entrepreneurs out of business altogether and push them into the ranks of salaried employees .
If , then , the market economy has a built - in natural selection mechanism for good entrepreneurs , this means that , generally , we would expect not many business firms to be making losses .
And , in fact , if we look around at the economy on an average day or year , we will find that losses are not very widespread .
But , in that case , the odd fact that needs explaining is this :
How is it that , periodically , in times of the onset of recessions and especially in steep depressions , the business world suddenly experiences a massive cluster of severe losses ?
A moment arrives when business firms , previously highly astute entrepreneurs in their ability to make profits and avoid losses , suddenly and dismayingly find themselves , almost all of them , suffering severe and unaccountable losses ?
How come ?
Here is a momentous fact that any theory of depressions must explain .
An explanation such as " underconsumption " — a drop in total consumer spending — is not sufficient , for one thing , because what needs to be explained is why businessmen , able to forecast all manner of previous economic changes and developments , proved themselves totally and catastrophically unable to forecast this alleged drop in consumer demand .
Why this sudden failure in forecasting ability ?
An adequate theory of depressions , then , must account for the tendency of the economy to move through successive booms and busts , showing no sign of settling into any sort of smoothly moving , or quietly progressive , approximation of an equilibrium situation .
In particular , a theory of depression must account for the mammoth cluster of errors which appears swiftly and suddenly at a moment of economic crisis , and lingers through the depression period until recovery .
And there is a third universal fact that a theory of the cycle must account for .
Invariably , the booms and busts are much more intense and severe in the " capital goods industries " — the industries making machines and equipment , the ones producing industrial raw materials or constructing industrial plants — than in the industries making consumers ' goods .
Here is another fact of business cycle life that must be explained — and obviously can't be explained by such theories of depression as the popular underconsumption doctrine : that consumers are n't spending enough on consumer goods .
For if insufficient spending is the culprit , then how is it that retail sales are the last and the least to fall in any depression , and that depression really hits such industries as machine tools , capital equipment , construction , and raw materials ?
Conversely , it is these industries that really take off in the inflationary boom phases of the business cycle , and not those businesses serving the consumer .
An adequate theory of the business cycle , then , must also explain the far greater intensity of booms and busts in the non-consumer goods , or " producers ' goods , " industries .
Fortunately , a correct theory of depression and of the business cycle does exist , even though it is universally neglected in present - day economics .
It , too , has a long tradition in economic thought .
This theory began with the 18th - century Scottish philosopher and economist David Hume , and with the eminent early 19th - century English classical economist David Ricardo .
Essentially , these theorists saw that another crucial institution had developed in the mid-18th century , alongside the industrial system .
This was the institution of banking , with its capacity to expand credit and the money supply ( first , in the form of paper money , or bank notes , and later in the form of demand deposits , or checking accounts , that are instantly redeemable in cash at the banks ) .
It was the operations of these commercial banks which , these economists saw , held the key to the mysterious recurrent cycles of expansion and contraction , of boom and bust , that had puzzled observers since the mid-18th century .
The Ricardian analysis of the business cycle went something as follows :
The natural moneys emerging as such on the world free market are useful commodities , generally gold and silver .
If money were confined simply to these commodities , then the economy would work in the aggregate as it does in particular markets : a smooth adjustment of supply and demand , and therefore no cycles of boom and bust .
But the injection of bank credit adds another crucial and disruptive element .
For the banks expand credit and therefore bank money in the form of notes or deposits which are theoretically redeemable on demand in gold , but in practice clearly are not .
For example , if a bank has 1,000 ounces of gold in its vaults , and it issues instantly redeemable warehouse receipts for 2,500 ounces of gold , then it clearly has issued 1,500 ounces more than it can possibly redeem .
But so long as there is no concerted " run " on the bank to cash in these receipts , its warehouse - receipts function on the market as equivalent to gold , and therefore the bank has been able to expand the money supply of the country by 1,500 gold ounces .
The banks , then , happily begin to expand credit , for the more they expand credit the greater will be their profits .
This results in the expansion of the money supply within a country , say England .
As the supply of paper and bank money in England increases , the money incomes and expenditures of Englishmen rise , and the increased money bids up prices of English goods .
The result is inflation and a boom within the country .
But this inflationary boom , while it proceeds on its merry way , sows the seeds of its own demise .
For as English money supply and incomes increase , Englishmen proceed to purchase more goods from abroad .
Furthermore , as English prices go up , English goods begin to lose their competitiveness with the products of other countries which have not inflated , or have been inflating to a lesser degree .
Englishmen begin to buy less at home and more abroad , while foreigners buy less in England and more at home ; the result is a deficit in the English balance of payments , with English exports falling sharply behind imports .
But if imports exceed exports , this means that money must flow out of England to foreign countries .
And what money will this be ?
Surely not English bank notes or deposits , for Frenchmen or Germans or Italians have little or no interest in keeping their funds locked up in English banks .
These foreigners will therefore take their bank notes and deposits and present them to the English banks for redemption in gold — and gold will be the type of money that will tend to flow persistently out of the country as the English inflation proceeds on its way .
But this means that English bank credit money will be , more and more , pyramiding on top of a dwindling gold base in the English bank vaults .
As the boom proceeds , our hypothetical bank will expand its warehouse receipts issued from , say 2,500 ounces to 4,000 ounces , while its gold base dwindles to , say , 800 .
As this process intensifies , the banks will eventually become frightened .
For the banks , after all , are obligated to redeem their liabilities in cash , and their cash is flowing out rapidly as their liabilities pile up .
Hence , the banks will eventually lose their nerve , stop their credit expansion , and in order to save themselves , contract their bank loans outstanding .
Often , this retreat is precipitated by bankrupting runs on the banks touched off by the public , who had also been getting increasingly nervous about the ever more shaky condition of the nation 's banks .
The bank contraction reverses the economic picture ; contraction and bust follow boom .
The banks pull in their horns , and businesses suffer as the pressure mounts for debt repayment and contraction .
The fall in the supply of bank money , in turn , leads to a general fall in English prices .
As money supply and incomes fall , and English prices collapse , English goods become relatively more attractive in terms of foreign products , and the balance of payments reverses itself , with exports exceeding imports .
As gold flows into the country , and as bank money contracts on top of an expanding gold base , the condition of the banks becomes much sounder .
This , then , is the meaning of the depression phase of the business cycle .
Note that it is a phase that comes out of , and inevitably comes out of , the preceding expansionary boom .
It is the preceding inflation that makes the depression phase necessary .
We can see , for example , that the depression is the process by which the market economy adjusts , throws off the excesses and distortions of the previous inflationary boom , and reestablishes a sound economic condition .
The depression is the unpleasant but necessary reaction to the distortions and excesses of the previous boom .
Why , then , does the next cycle begin ?
Why do business cycles tend to be recurrent and continuous ?
Because when the banks have pretty well recovered , and are in a sounder condition , they are then in a confident position to proceed to their natural path of bank credit expansion , and the next boom proceeds on its way , sowing the seeds for the next inevitable bust .
But if banking is the cause of the business cycle , are n't the banks also a part of the private market economy , and can't we therefore say that the free market is still the culprit , if only in the banking segment of that free market ?
The answer is no , for the banks , for one thing , would never be able to expand credit in concert were it not for the intervention and encouragement of government .
For if banks were truly competitive , any expansion of credit by one bank would quickly pile up the debts of that bank in its competitors , and its competitors would quickly call upon the expanding bank for redemption in cash .
In short , a bank 's rivals will call upon it for redemption in gold or cash in the same way as do foreigners , except that the process is much faster and would nip any incipient inflation in the bud before it got started .
Banks can only expand comfortably in unison when a central bank exists , essentially a governmental bank , enjoying a monopoly of government business , and a privileged position imposed by government over the entire banking system .
It is only when central banking got established that the banks were able to expand for any length of time and the familiar business cycle got underway in the modern world .
The central bank acquires its control over the banking system by such governmental measures as : Making its own liabilities legal tender for all debts and receivable in taxes ; granting the central bank monopoly of the issue of bank notes , as contrasted to deposits ( in England the Bank of England , the governmentally established central bank , had a legal monopoly of bank notes in the London area ) ; or through the outright forcing of banks to use the central bank as their client for keeping their reserves of cash ( as in the United States and its Federal Reserve System ) .
Not that the banks complain about this intervention ; for it is the establishment of central banking that makes long - term bank credit expansion possible , since the expansion of central - bank notes provides added cash reserves for the entire banking system and permits all the commercial banks to expand their credit together .
Central banking works like a cozy compulsory bank cartel to expand the banks ' liabilities ; and the banks are now able to expand on a larger base of cash in the form of central bank notes as well as gold .
So now we see , at last , that the business cycle is brought about , not by any mysterious failings of the free - market economy , but quite the opposite : by systematic intervention by government in the market process .
Government intervention brings about bank expansion and inflation , and , when the inflation comes to an end , the subsequent depression - adjustment comes into play .
The Ricardian theory of the business cycle grasped the essentials of a correct cycle theory : the recurrent nature of the phases of the cycle , depression as adjustment intervention in the market rather than from the free - market economy .
But two problems were as yet unexplained :
Why the sudden cluster of business error , the sudden failure of the entrepreneurial function , and why the vastly greater fluctuations in the producers ' goods than in the consumers ' goods industries ?
The Ricardian theory only explained movements in the price level , in general business ; there was no hint of explanation of the vastly different reactions in the capital and consumers ' goods industries .
The correct and fully developed theory of the business cycle was finally discovered and set forth by the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises , when he was a professor at the University of Vienna .
Mises developed hints of his solution to the vital problem of the business cycle in his monumental Theory of Money and Credit , published in 1912 , and still , nearly 60 years later , the best book on the theory of money and banking .
Mises developed his cycle theory during the 1920s , and it was brought to the English - speaking world by Mises 's leading follower , Friedrich A. von Hayek , who came from Vienna to teach at the London School of Economics in the early 1930s , and who published , in German and in English , two books which applied and elaborated the Mises cycle theory : Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle , and Prices and Production .
Since Mises and Hayek were Austrians , and also since they were in the tradition of the great 19th - century Austrian economists , this theory has become known in the literature as the " Austrian " ( or the " monetary over - investment " ) theory of the business cycle .
Building on the Ricardians , on general " Austrian " theory , and on his own creative genius , Mises developed the following theory of the business cycle :
Without bank credit expansion , supply and demand tend to be equilibrated through the free price system , and no cumulative booms or busts can then develop .
But then government through its central bank stimulates bank credit expansion by expanding central bank liabilities and therefore the cash reserves of all the nation 's commercial banks .
The banks then proceed to expand credit and hence the nation 's money supply in the form of check deposits .
As the Ricardians saw , this expansion of bank money drives up the prices of goods and hence causes inflation .
But , Mises showed , it does something else , and something even more sinister .
Bank credit expansion , by pouring new loan funds into the business world , artificially lowers the rate of interest in the economy below its free - market level .
On the free and unhampered market , the interest rate is determined purely by the " time preferences " of all the individuals that make up the market economy .
For the essence of a loan is that a " present good " ( money which can be used at present ) is being exchanged for a " future good " ( an IOU which can only be used at some point in the future ) .
Since people always prefer money right now to the present prospect of getting the same amount of money sometime in the future , the present good always commands a premium in the market over the future .
This premium is the interest rate , and its height will vary according to the degree to which people prefer the present to the future , i.e. , the degree of their time preferences .
People 's time preferences also determine the extent to which people will save and invest , as compared to how much they will consume .
If people 's time preferences should fall , i.e. , if their degree of preference for present over future falls , then people will tend to consume less now and save and invest more ; at the same time , and for the same reason , the rate of interest , the rate of time discount , will also fall .
Economic growth comes about largely as the result of falling rates of time preference , which lead to an increase in the proportion of saving and investment to consumption , and also to a falling rate of interest .
But what happens when the rate of interest falls , not because of lower time preferences and higher savings , but from government interference that promotes the expansion of bank credit ?
In other words , if the rate of interest falls artificially , due to intervention , rather than naturally , as a result of changes in the valuations and preferences of the consuming public ?
What happens is trouble .
For businessmen , seeing the rate of interest fall , react as they always would and must to such a change of market signals : they invest more in capital and producers ' goods .
Investments , particularly in lengthy and time - consuming projects , which previously looked unprofitable now seem profitable , because of the fall of the interest charge .
In short , businessmen react as they would react if savings had genuinely increased : they expand their investment in durable equipment , in capital goods , in industrial raw material , in construction as compared to their direct production of consumer goods .
Businesses , in short , happily borrow the newly expanded bank money that is coming to them at cheaper rates ; they use the money to invest in capital goods , and eventually this money gets paid out in higher rents to land , and higher wages to workers in the capital goods industries .
The increased business demand bids up labor costs , but businesses think they can pay these higher costs because they have been fooled by the government - and - bank intervention in the loan market and its decisively important tampering with the interest - rate signal of the marketplace .
The problem comes as soon as the workers and landlords — largely the former , since most gross business income is paid out in wages — begin to spend the new bank money that they have received in the form of higher wages .
For the time preferences of the public have not really gotten lower ; the public does n't want to save more than it has .
So the workers set about to consume most of their new income , in short to reestablish the old consumer / saving proportions .
This means that they redirect the spending back to the consumer goods industries , and they do n't save and invest enough to buy the newly - produced machines , capital equipment , industrial raw materials , etc .
This all reveals itself as a sudden sharp and continuing depression in the producers ' goods industries .
Once the consumers reestablished their desired consumption / investment proportions , it is thus revealed that business had invested too much in capital goods and had underinvested in consumer goods .
Business had been seduced by the governmental tampering and artificial lowering of the rate of interest , and acted as if more savings were available to invest than were really there .
As soon as the new bank money filtered through the system and the consumers reestablished their old proportions , it became clear that there were not enough savings to buy all the producers ' goods , and that business had misinvested the limited savings available .
Business had overinvested in capital goods and underinvested in consumer products .
The inflationary boom thus leads to distortions of the pricing and production system .
Prices of labor and raw materials in the capital goods industries had been bid up during the boom too high to be profitable once the consumers reassert their old consumption / investment preferences .
The " depression " is then seen as the necessary and healthy phase by which the market economy sloughs off and liquidates the unsound , uneconomic investments of the boom , and reestablishes those proportions between consumption and investment that are truly desired by the consumers .
The depression is the painful but necessary process by which the free market sloughs off the excesses and errors of the boom and reestablishes the market economy in its function of efficient service to the mass of consumers .
Since prices of factors of production have been bid too high in the boom , this means that prices of labor and goods in these capital goods industries must be allowed to fall until proper market relations are resumed .
Since the workers receive the increased money in the form of higher wages fairly rapidly , how is it that booms can go on for years without having their unsound investments revealed , their errors due to tampering with market signals become evident , and the depression - adjustment process begins its work ?
The answer is that booms would be very short lived if the bank credit expansion and subsequent pushing of the rate of interest below the free - market level were a one - shot affair .
But the point is that the credit expansion is not one - shot ; it proceeds on and on , never giving consumers the chance to reestablish their preferred proportions of consumption and saving , never allowing the rise in costs in the capital goods industries to catch up to the inflationary rise in prices .
Like the repeated doping of a horse , the boom is kept on its way and ahead of its inevitable comeuppance , by repeated doses of the stimulant of bank credit .
It is only when bank credit expansion must finally stop , either because the banks are getting into a shaky condition or because the public begins to balk at the continuing inflation , that retribution finally catches up with the boom .
As soon as credit expansion stops , then the piper must be paid , and the inevitable readjustments liquidate the unsound over - investments of the boom , with the reassertion of a greater proportionate emphasis on consumers ' goods production .
Thus , the Misesian theory of the business cycle accounts for all of our puzzles : the repeated and recurrent nature of the cycle , the massive cluster of entrepreneurial error , the far greater intensity of the boom and bust in the producers ' goods industries .
Mises , then , pinpoints the blame for the cycle on inflationary bank credit expansion propelled by the intervention of government and its central bank .
What does Mises say should be done , say by government , once the depression arrives ?
What is the governmental role in the cure of depression ?
In the first place , government must cease inflating as soon as possible .
It is true that this will , inevitably , bring the inflationary boom abruptly to an end , and commence the inevitable recession or depression .
But the longer the government waits for this , the worse the necessary readjustments will have to be .
The sooner the depression - readjustment is gotten over with , the better .
This means , also , that the government must never try to prop up unsound business situations ; it must never bail out or lend money to business firms in trouble .
Doing this will simply prolong the agony and convert a sharp and quick depression phase into a lingering and chronic disease .
The government must never try to prop up wage rates or prices of producers ' goods ; doing so will prolong and delay indefinitely the completion of the depression - adjustment process ; it will cause indefinite and prolonged depression and mass unemployment in the vital capital goods industries .
The government must not try to inflate again , in order to get out of the depression .
For even if this reinflation succeeds , it will only sow greater trouble later on .
The government must do nothing to encourage consumption , and it must not increase its own expenditures , for this will further increase the social consumption / investment ratio .
In fact , cutting the government budget will improve the ratio .
What the economy needs is not more consumption spending but more saving , in order to validate some of the excessive investments of the boom .
Thus , what the government should do , according to the Misesian analysis of the depression , is absolutely nothing .
It should , from the point of view of economic health and ending the depression as quickly as possible , maintain a strict hands - off , laissez - faire policy .
Anything it does will delay and obstruct the adjustment process of the market ; the less it does , the more rapidly will the market adjustment process do its work , and sound economic recovery ensue .
The Misesian prescription is thus the exact opposite of the Keynesian :
It is for the government to keep absolute hands off the economy and to confine itself to stopping its own inflation and to cutting its own budget .
It has today been completely forgotten , even among economists , that the Misesian explanation and analysis of the depression gained great headway precisely during the Great Depression of the 1930s — the very depression that is always held up to advocates of the free - market economy as the greatest single and catastrophic failure of laissez - faire capitalism .
It was no such thing .
Nineteen twenty - nine was made inevitable by the vast bank credit expansion throughout the Western world during the 1920s : a policy deliberately adopted by the Western governments , and most importantly by the Federal Reserve System in the United States .
It was made possible by the failure of the Western world to return to a genuine gold standard after World War I , and thus allowing more room for inflationary policies by government .
Everyone now thinks of President Coolidge as a believer in laissez - faire and an unhampered market economy ; he was not , and tragically , nowhere less so than in the field of money and credit .
Unfortunately , the sins and errors of the Coolidge intervention were laid to the door of a nonexistent free - market economy .
If Coolidge made 1929 inevitable , it was President Hoover who prolonged and deepened the depression , transforming it from a typically sharp but swiftly disappearing depression into a lingering and near - fatal malady , a malady " cured " only by the holocaust of World War II .
Hoover , not Franklin Roosevelt , was the founder of the policy of the " New Deal " : essentially the massive use of the State to do exactly what Misesian theory would most warn against — to prop up wage rates above their free - market levels , prop up prices , inflate credit , and lend money to shaky business positions .
Roosevelt only advanced , to a greater degree , what Hoover had pioneered .
The result for the first time in American history , was a nearly perpetual depression and nearly permanent mass unemployment .
The Coolidge crisis had become the unprecedentedly prolonged Hoover - Roosevelt depression .
Ludwig von Mises had predicted the depression during the heyday of the great boom of the 1920s — a time , just like today , when economists and politicians , armed with a " new economics " of perpetual inflation , and with new " tools " provided by the Federal Reserve System , proclaimed a perpetual " New Era " of permanent prosperity guaranteed by our wise economic doctors in Washington .
Ludwig von Mises , alone armed with a correct theory of the business cycle , was one of the very few economists to predict the Great Depression , and hence the economic world was forced to listen to him with respect .
F.A. Hayek spread the word in England , and the younger English economists were all , in the early 1930s , beginning to adopt the Misesian cycle theory for their analysis of the depression — and also to adopt , of course , the strictly free - market policy prescription that flowed with this theory .
Unfortunately , economists have now adopted the historical notion of Lord Keynes : that no " classical economists " had a theory of the business cycle until Keynes came along in 1936 .
There was a theory of the depression ; it was the classical economic tradition ; its prescription was strict hard money and laissez - faire ; and it was rapidly being adopted , in England and even in the United States , as the accepted theory of the business cycle .
( A particular irony is that the major " Austrian " proponent in the United States in the early and mid-1930s was none other than Professor Alvin Hansen , very soon to make his mark as the outstanding Keynesian disciple in this country . )
What swamped the growing acceptance of Misesian cycle theory was simply the " Keynesian Revolution " — the amazing sweep that Keynesian theory made of the economic world shortly after the publication of the General Theory in 1936 .
It is not that Misesian theory was refuted successfully ; it was just forgotten in the rush to climb on the suddenly fashionable Keynesian bandwagon .
Some of the leading adherents of the Mises theory — who clearly knew better — succumbed to the newly established winds of doctrine , and won leading American university posts as a consequence .
But now the once arch - Keynesian London Economist has recently proclaimed that " Keynes is Dead . "
After over a decade of facing trenchant theoretical critiques and refutation by stubborn economic facts , the Keynesians are now in general and massive retreat .
Once again , the money supply and bank credit are being grudgingly acknowledged to play a leading role in the cycle .
The time is ripe — for a rediscovery , a renaissance , of the Mises theory of the business cycle .
It can come none too soon ; if it ever does , the whole concept of a Council of Economic Advisors would be swept away , and we would see a massive retreat of government from the economic sphere .
But for all this to happen , the world of economics , and the public at large , must be made aware of the existence of an explanation of the business cycle that has lain neglected on the shelf for all too many tragic years .

On Friday , August 1 , The Agitator blog posted the following : “ Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project sends the photo below .
It ’s from a series of L.A. Times photos from a federal raid on a medical marijuana clinic in California .
I would n’t draw too many conclusions from it .
But it is a little disconcerting . ”
So disconcerting , apparently , the L.A. Times pulled this particular photo from its slideshow and fed it into the memory hole .
Man dressed as a Blackwater mercenary partakes in a DEA raid on a Culver City medical marijuana dispensary .
Maybe this particular DEA agent gets his jollies dressing up like a Blackwater mercenary — and maybe he is a Blackwater mercenary .
I leave it up to you to decide , although the latter as opposed to the former makes more sense , that is unless the DEA has relaxed its dress code to the point of absurdity .
“ As a U.S. Marine , I would have faced charges for simply wearing my camouflage utility uniform into a store , ” writes Tim King for Salem - News .
“ There are these things called standards that the Corps and other military and police groups are obligated to follow .
It is to avoid giving someone the wrong idea about who you are and your application in society .
I guess Blackwater and the federal marijuana plant warriors do n’t care what people think . ”
Is it a stretch to conclude Blackwater operates domestically ?
Last week , Raw Story ’s David Edwards and Muriel Kane wrote a story about Jeremy Scahill , who detailed Blackwater ’s foray into intelligence .
Blackwater is not only providing intelligence to “ foreign governments , but to Fortune 500 corporations . ”
Moreover , Blackwater ’s Total Intelligence Solutions appears to be a catch - all for former CIA spooks , including J. Cofer Black , who ran the CIA ’s extraordinary rendition program .
As Tim Weiner wrote for the New York Times on January 20 , 2002 , the CIA now operates domestically , never mind this is prohibited by its charter .
Recall FEMA and the DHS contracting Blackwater after Hurricane Katrina .
Blackwater mercenaries were even “ deputized ” by the Louisiana governor .
“ What is most disturbing is the claim of several Blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal government and the state of Louisiana , ” wrote Daniela Crespo and Jeremy Scahill for Alternet on September 12 , 2005 .
“ That raises a key question : under what authority are Blackwater ’s men operating ?
A spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department , Russ Knocke , told the Washington Post he knows of no federal plans to hire Blackwater or other private security . ”
As Wayne Madsen noted last October , Blackwater is now in the business of “ training ” domestic law enforcement in the United States — in Iowa , North Carolina , Georgia , New York , Indiana , Virginia , New Jersey , Florida , Oregon , Alaska , and elsewhere .
Madsen ’s exhaustive list also indicates the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration receives training from Blackwater , although a Google search does not return mention of such training ( this video , however , claims to show Blackwater and the DEA jointly training counternarcotics police in Afghanistan ) .
As it turns out , the DoD has tapped Blackwater to work its “ counter - narcoterrorism activities , ” along with Raytheon , Lockheed , and Northrop Grumman .
As I wrote last November , “ the military - mercenary complex is expanding operations ” and the Pentagon ’s “ Counter - Narcoterrorism Technology Program ” is just the ticket — and in the case of Blackwater and the others , a handsome meal ticket .
Considering all of this , is it possible Blackwater is working with the DEA here in America ?
I ’d say the possibility is more than fifty percent they are .
Now that John McCain has called for the military to be used in American cities to “ fight crime ” — crime that is largely related to illegal drugs — no doubt Blackwater will be tapped , as they were in New Orleans , even though the DHS claimed ignorance of the fact .
Of course , McCain ’s idea was not his own , and it will not be limited to crime infested inner cities , but will be expanded in order that the commoners get accustomed to the idea of martial law and mercenary thugs in black uniforms toting automatic weapons .

SHAOXING , China 
In the good old days — oh , three months ago — Tao Shoulong would prowl the streets of this ancient city in his Mercedes - Benz .
His wife and partner , Yan Qi , would cruise around in her Toyota Land Cruiser .
Together , they would drink into the night with clients , suppliers and creditors , hatching plans to expand their Zhejiang River Dragon Textile Printing & Dyeing Co. Tao built River Dragon from a start - up with four employees into one of China 's biggest textile printing firms in just five years .
He had even grander dreams :
He wanted to see his company 's stock trade on Nasdaq alongside the likes of Microsoft and Intel .
The dreams are dead .
River Dragon shut down on Oct. 7 . Tao and Yan have vanished , leaving behind more than $ 290 million in debt and a lot of anger in this city 140 miles south of Shanghai in the Yangtze River Delta .
The company 's demise put 4,000 workers on the street and jilted hundreds of suppliers and creditors .
The speedy rise — and speedier fall — of River Dragon is a depressingly familiar story in China these days .
Thousands of Chinese factories have shuttered in the past year , done in by : • An export - killing global slowdown that began with the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the ensuing financial crisis .
Local textile merchant Fang Xingquan , a River Dragon creditor , is among many who believe a sharp drop - off in exports was a key factor in the company 's demise .
• Rising materials costs that have squeezed profit margins .
• A deliberate Chinese government campaign to regulate sweatshop factories out of business .
China 's National Bureau of Statistics this week said the nation 's economy grew at an annual rate of 9 % in the quarter ended Sept. 30 , the lowest since 2003 .
The state - run Xinhua news agency said the government is considering a series of actions to boost exports and stimulate home sales .
Many economists , including Yu Yongding of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , believe that China needs to keep annual economic growth of 8 % or 9 % to absorb the 24 million people entering the labor force every year or risk social instability .
Earlier this month , the International Monetary Fund predicted that Chinese economic growth would cool from 2007's sizzling 11.9 % to 9.7 % this year and 9.3 % in 2009 .
Private forecasters are even more pessimistic .
UBS Investment Research , for instance , forecasts 8 % growth in 2009 .
" China is being hit over the head by both the global crisis and the domestic slowdown , " says Stephen Green , economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai .
Exports account for nearly 38 % of China 's economic output .
JPMorgan Chase calculates that Chinese exports fall 5.7 percentage points every time global economic growth shrinks by a percentage point .
And the IMF is predicting that global growth will drop 2 percentage points — from 5 % last year to 3 % in 2009 .
Chinese appliance maker Haier has already seen export growth drop to 10 % the first three quarters of this year from 30 % a year earlier , the official English - language China Daily newspaper reported .
What happens to China has big implications globally : China contributed 17 % of world economic growth last year , the same as the United States , according to the United Nations .
Home prices collapsing
The Chinese economy is absorbing another blow beyond crumbling exports : collapsing home prices .
Nicholas Lardy , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , D.C. , reckons a slowdown in construction could shave another 1 to 2 percentage points off China 's economic growth .
" The property bubble is already starting to burst , " says Yan Yu , a business management scholar at Peking University , researching the export center of Dongguan in southern Guangdong province .
" House prices here in Dongguan have fallen by up to 50 % this year , " leaving many homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth .
" People have worked all their lives and believed the hype and bought overvalued properties , then saw their savings vanish , " says independent economist Andy Xie in Shanghai .
" That carries more political risk " than rising joblessness .
The good news :
The forecast growth rates are still pretty impressive by any other economy 's standards ; Chinese exports have proved surprisingly resilient , growing nearly 22 % in September from a year earlier ; and the government in Beijing is sitting on enough cash — $ 1.8 trillion in foreign exchange reserves — to go on a spending spree if needed to rescue the Chinese economy from catastrophe .
" Chinese authorities appear to be well aware of the global economic situation , " JPMorgan Chase reported this month .
The bank expects government to turn the spigot on spending , quadrupling the budget deficit to the equivalent of 2 % of economic output from 0.5 % this year .
The authorities are n't going to save everyone .
The Chinese government has put pressure on small firms that foul the environment , pay miserly wages and turn out cheap products .
" Beijing no longer wants to be the world 's sweatshop for junk , " CLSA Asia -Pacific Markets says in a recent report .
First , China cut tax breaks for exporters and imposed new export taxes on polluters , even targeting producers of disposable chopsticks .
Then it introduced a labor law in January , requiring companies to give workers written contracts and making it harder for them to lay off employees or to hire informal part - time help .
The combination of tougher regulations , weakening exports , rising costs and a stronger Chinese currency has hammered thousands of small factories .
The pain has been especially agonizing in Guangdong , a low - cost manufacturing center across the border from Hong Kong in southern China .
Guangdong 's exports rose just 14 % the first seven months of 2008 after growing 27 % a year earlier .
Industrial profits were up just 4 % this year through May , compared with 49 % a year earlier and puny compared with 21 % growth nationwide .
" Guangdong 's weak performance is a signal of the government 's determination to restructure the low - value - added export process sector and to force out of business firms that abuse labor and the environment , " CLSA concluded .
Trouble in toyland Firms that were already struggling with narrow profit margins have been squeezed .
More than half of all China 's toy exporters — 3,631 firms — shut their doors the first half of the year , the official Xinhua news agency reported .
" Many toy factories have gone bankrupt this year , " says Luo Yunzhang , founder of toy exporter Guangzhou Sixiren Toy , which makes playground equipment for Ohio - based Little Tikes , among other products .
" We saw exports start to dip in May , when the government began restricting businessmen 's visits ahead of the ( August ) Olympic Games . …
Now the global crisis is causing problems .
When people are in difficulties , they spend less on things like toys , " Luo says .
Luo predicts that Sixiren 's export revenue will drop by half this year , to $ 500,000 .
China 's textile industry is also enduring a deep slump .
Textile exports have been tumbling since March .
More than 10,000 small textile manufacturers went out of business the first half of this year alone , the government says .
" The global crisis is seriously affecting the local textile industry , " says Yu Xin of the China Chemical Fibers and Textile Consultancy in Hangzhou .
China 's 30 - year economic boom has produced towns that specialize in one product .
There are shoe towns , zipper towns , air conditioner towns and sock towns .
Shaoxing — a city of 4.3 million long known in China for opera , rice wine and scenic river vistas — has sold itself as China 's Textile City .
The textile sector has been " an easy market , as it is not complicated , has low entry barriers and is a big employer , " says Standard Chartered 's Green .
The local government gives tax breaks , and the industry has benefited from having a large number of suppliers and trained workers close by .
For a while , River Dragon looked like one of the winners .
After working as a clerk at another firm , Tao started the company in 2003 with his wife , Yan , and four colleagues .
River Dragon went public in Singapore two years ago , and Tao bought another textile firm last year , hoping the acquisition would give River Dragon the heft to list on Nasdaq .
In July , Yan , the company CEO , announced that River Dragon had landed a $ 10 million contract to supply apparel to 76 U.S. universities .
But the deal proved a mirage .
The end came quickly .
A day after the factory stopped production , River Dragon stock was dropped from the Singapore exchange .
Corporate documents are missing , and Tao and Yan are long gone .
" I think they are still on the run in China , " says Fang , the supplier .
He says he was stiffed for more than $ 860,000 when River Dragon went under .
Keeping society ' stable '
About 300 suppliers and creditors descended on the River Dragon complex , looting warehouses in the hopes of salvaging something .
Hundreds of workers demonstrated in the streets , demanding back pay for August and September .
Worried about the unrest , the local government coughed up cash .
" The government paid the workers to keep society stable , " textile analyst Yu says .
As their export orders dry up , Chinese manufacturers are likely to look for customers at home in China or in other emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa .
" Soon we will see vicious price competition between companies who have lost exports , " Green says .
In Guangdong , toymaker Luo hopes to push domestic sales up to $ 1.5 million this year from $ 1 million in 2007 .
" The situation in the U.S. and other countries will not turn around quickly , " he says .
" We must rely more on the domestic market , as Chinese consumers increasingly have money to spend on toys .
Profits are very thin in the toy business , both in export and domestic sales .
I prefer exports . …
Domestic sales involve more work .
There are more customers .
But their orders are small . "
Independent economist Xie says China became overly dependent on demand from the U.S. and Europe that was stoked by too much borrowed money and inflated asset values .
" It 's all coming to an end , " he says .
" You need to look elsewhere for livelihood .
Americans cannot spend money anymore . "

Infallible Indian journalists have been spooked by a delightful Da Vinci Code style hoax played on them .
On Sunday , almost every newspaper reported the arrest of Johann Bach , an 88 - year - old Nazi war criminal , in the jungles of Khanapur , close to Goa , on Saturday .
A classified advertisement inserted by the “ Waffen SS ” fugitive to sell an 18th century piano was supposed to have led Perus Narkp detectives to the “ senior adjutant ” who reportedly had a role in the “ extermination ” of 12,000 Jews at the Marsha Tikash Whanaab concentration camp in East Berlin .
Bangalore based newspapers went to town with the news :
# “ Hitler ’s stormtrooper held in Karnataka , ” headlined Deccan Herald .
# “ World War II criminal arrested ? ” asked The Hindu # “ Cops stunned over Nazi man ’s arrest , ” said The Times of India # “ Antique piano ad leads police to Nazi colonel near Belgaum , ” said the New Indian Express .
On Monday , the up - country papers went a step further .
# “ Traced to Goa , Nazi war criminal tried to enter Karnataka , arrested on way and flown to Berlin , ” said The Indian Express , Delhi # “ Goa piano ‘ thief ’ found to be Nazi war fugitive , ” said The Telegraph , Calcutta , with a helpful graphic ( above ) of the flight of the Nazi criminal .
Wanted by Interpol , octagenarian Bach , it was reported , had escaped the Nuremberg trials and evaded justice for over half a century .
On the German government ’s “ Most wanted list ” since the end of WW II , he had spent time in Argentina , Bulgaria , Yemen and Canada .
Apparently , the Israeli media had reported his sighting in Calungute , Goa , though V.S. Acharya , Karnataka ’s home minister , denied any knowledge .
Hemant Nimbalkar , Belgaum superintendent of police , said he was unaware of the incident .
But the papers said Bach had been picked up by detectives of Perus Narkp who are part of the German chancellor ’s “ Core ” team in collaboration with Indian intelligence .
Anil Budur Lulla of The Telegraph “ exclusively ” reported that “ Berlin also had information from Tel Aviv that an old German had bragged about overseeing the genocide of Jews to an Israeli tourist couple in Goa during a rave party a few months ago . ”
Deccan Herald quoted a press release issued by “ Perus Narkp ” .
Times of India said the press note was circulated by email .
DH had this telling line : “ A brilliant musician like his illustrious 18th Century namesake , this eccentric Bach later rose high in the Nazi SS hierarchy . ”
The Telegraph , quoting “ sources ” , said that “ after further investigations in Goa , proceedings would begin to take Bach to Germany , with whom India signed an extradition treaty in 2004 . ”
Deccan Herald said he would “ be facing trial at the International Court of Justice at The Hague . ”
And on and on it went .
Well , it turns out , it was all a super prank , obviously played by someone with some taste in western classical music .
churumuri bravely deduces that it was played / devised by someone called Bhawana Shakti Sharma or by someone who knows someone called Bhawana Shakti Sharma , because it is an anagram of “ Marsha Tikashi Whanaab ” .
“ Bach ” is obviously a bastardisation of Johann Sebastian Bach , with the piano thrown in for good measure .
“ Perus Narkp ” is an anagram of “ Super Prank “ .
Considering that the story has Goa as its epicentre , churumuri also sticks its neck out to declare that the “ super prank ” was played by a Goan / Goans who have had their axe for their local media for some time now .
Indeed , one Goan blog says “ The Truth Behind Perus Narkp ” will be revealed tomorrow with the teasing tagline : “ One of the most telling stories on the Goan as well as Indian media . ”
Why the prank was played , is a long story .
Maybe to show how gullible journalists have become in this age of instant news and even more instant analysis .
Maybe to show how little research and background checking goes into modern - day reporting populated by greenhorns barely out of their teens .
Maybe to show what a bunch of cultural ignoramuses we are , with scarcely any knowledge of music , Indian or western .
Or maybe to show how smart the prankster is .
Whatever the reason , it ’s a lovely prank for which all of us fell .
We have been had .
Lie back and enjoy — and spare a thought for those stung by us .

Already a spokesmodel for L’OrÃ©al , she is also the face of Calvin Klein fragrance , Eternity Moment .
Throw in her stint as a model in Louis Vuitton ’s Fall 2004 advertising campaign , at the grand old age of 21 , she ’s done quite a lot .
