“ Clouded leopard conservation is a unique and ambitious project at Nashville Zoo , ” said Rick Schwartz , Nashville Zoo president .
“ The birth of the female cub not only adds to a worldwide clouded leopard population that is rapidly decreasing , but it also increases the genetic viability of the captive population . ”
Nashville Zoo ’s clouded leopard Jing Jai gave birth to a rare female cub on May 24 .
This is the second clouded leopard birth at the Zoo in two years as the Zoo continues its work to save this species in decline .
At one month old , the cub , named Matsi , weighs 1.5 pounds and is being hand - reared by Zoo staff .
Clouded leopards are seriously endangered because of deforestation , poaching and the pet trade .
Since 2002 , Nashville Zoo has been a member of the Thailand Clouded Leopard Consortium , an ongoing collaboration with the National Zoo , Point Defiance Zoo and organizations to develop a multi- faceted conservation program that includes a viable self - sustaining breeding program .
Introducing clouded leopards to potential mates is difficult due to the cat ’s reclusive disposition .
Male clouded leopards are often aggressive and have been known to attack and kill potential female partners .
To reduce fatal attacks , cubs are hand - raised and introduced to mates at a young age .
At one month old , the cub , named Matsi , weighs 1.5 pounds and is being hand - reared by Zoo staff .
The Consortium plans to pair her with a male clouded leopard born in February at the National Zoo in Washington D.C.
This is the second birth for Jing Jai and her mate Arun .
Last year , she gave birth to three cubs that were on exhibit at Nashville Zoo during fall 2009 .
Clouded leopards are native to the dense forests of Southeast Asia and parts of China .
They are considered the smallest of the large cats , growing to about five feet long ( half of that is tail ) and weighing 30 to 50 pounds .
With short legs , large paws and a long tail , clouded leopards are well adapted to spend much of their time high in trees .
Mayor of London Boris Johnson is seeking legal action to remove peace protesters camping in Parliament Square , it was confirmed today .
Greater London Authority ( GLA ) officers have been given authority by Mr Johnson to apply to the High Court to begin legal proceedings for trespass , a spokeswoman confirmed .
" Parliament Square is a world heritage site and top tourist attraction that is visited by thousands of people and broadcast around the world each day , " a statement on behalf of the Mayor said .
" The Mayor respects the right to demonstrate - however , the scale and impact of the protest is now doing considerable damage to the Square and preventing its peaceful use by other Londoners including those who may wish to have an authorised protest .
" As a result he has given GLA officers the authority to apply to the High Court to begin legal proceedings for trespass . "
The move was welcomed by Westminster City Council whose leader accused the protesters of " hijacking " Parliament Square .
Councillor Colin Barrow , leader of the council , said : " We welcome the Mayor 's decision to take action as we felt that the hijacking of Parliament Square , one of London 's historic public spaces , needed to be brought to an end .
" We all support peaceful protest , but it is completely unacceptable for parts of our city to be occupied and turned into no - go areas by vociferous minorities , however laudable each cause might be . "
The action is unconnected to the arrest of anti-war protester Brian Haw as police carried out security checks today ahead of the Queen 's Speech .
An eyewitness reported seeing Mr Haw being forcibly detained and handcuffed by officers at the camp opposite the Houses of Parliament where he and other peace campaigners maintain a round - the - clock demonstration .
Police with sniffer dogs moved in this morning to search the collection of tents on Parliament Square before the Queen arrived to announce the new Government 's plans .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said two people were arrested in Parliament Square at 8 am for allegedly obstructing police .
He could not confirm that Mr Haw was one of those detained .
An officer at the scene confirmed that Mr Haw and fellow protester Barbara Tucker had been arrested .
Mr Haw began his high - profile Parliament Square demonstration against the UK's policy in Iraq and elsewhere on June 2 2001 .
[ I was originally going to avoid this , but decided to do it for the critical analysis , because I suspect it will be widely but badly covered , and because I also suspect that very little of this coverage will point out the publication record of these authors .
Which is worth pointing out .
Have fun in the comments !]
Why do different countries have different IQs ?
You 'd first answer probably has something to do with education , but a trio of US scientists have put forward a radically different hypothesis – international variation in intelligence is related to the prevalence of parasites in a country .
As is , according to them , pretty much ever y major aspect of human culture ( but more on this later ) ...
Christopher Eppig , Corey Fincher and Randy Thornhill ( yes , that one ) from the University of New Mexico have suggested that fighting off parasitic infections during childhood takes up valuable energy that might otherwise go towards the development of the brain .
More parasites mean less well developed brains and weaker mental abilities .
To test their controversial idea , the trio collected average IQ values for countries all over the world using three separate sets of data .
They also used the World Health Organisation ’s data on global “ disability - adjusted life years ” ( DALYs ) , a measure of a country ’s disease burden that looks at the number of years of ‘ healthy ’ life lost by an average citizen because of poor health .
They found a strong correlation between these two figures , both across all nations and within each continent ( except South America ) .
They claimed that the prevalence of infectious diseases is the “ most powerful predictor of average national IQ ” , even after they adjusted the results for other factors , like each country ’s temperature , GDP , literacy rate , enrolment in secondary school and more .
They also suggest that this could help to explain the mysterious Flynn effect , where IQ increases sharply as a nation develops .
The very obvious caveat to all of this is that old adage that correlation is not causation .
In this case , a link between infections and IQ tells us nothing about whether infected people grow up to be less intelligent , or whether intelligent people are less likely to become infected .
Intelligence , after all , could affect one ’s understanding of what a disease is , how to avoid it , and how to seek help for an infection .
And perhaps a third factor is at work here – higher education could lead to both greater intelligence and the knowledge to avoid common infections .
Readers may enjoy trying to come up with alternative explanations of their own .
These problems become particularly astute when you ’re looking for correlations between statistics that represent entire nations .
This broad - brush ‘ ecological ’ approach tells us nothing at the individual level .
In a given country , do children who acquire early infections grow up to have lower IQs ?
We simply do n’t know .
In fairness to Eppig , Fincher and Thornhill , they say , “ We are not arguing that global variation in intelligence is only caused by parasite stress . ”
They also frame their paper as a way of introducing a hypothesis and suggest ways of testing it .
Fair enough , but they have supported their hypothesis with data that are , at best , inconclusive .
As such , I wonder what this study is doing in a Royal Society journal rather than , say , Medical Hypotheses .
Indeed , as I alluded to earlier , this new paper is the latest in a long line of hypothesis - generating publications from Fincher and Thornhill linking parasites and infections to pretty much any sweeping aspect of human life you can think of .
Through similar studies based on correlations at the national level , Thornhill and Fincher have suggested that infections are linked to individualism and collectivism , religious diversity , linguistic diversity , armed conflicts and civil war , and democracy and liberal values .
Like any attempt to explain very complex patterns of human behaviour through a single cause , this ought to raise an eyebrow .
I 'm raising two .

Gov. Chris Christie on NJ Supreme Court and school funding
TRENTON —
The reason fanatics like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck adore Gov. Chris Christie has never been so clearly on display as it was last week during his Rant in Robbinsville .
It was one of his town hall meetings , stuffed with friends as usual .
But this time he went far beyond the familiar call for a reasonable cap on property taxes .
This time he attacked justices of the state Supreme Court as “ people in black robes who are elected by no one ” and suggested that they should never defy the majority will .
So much for Alexander Hamilton ’s quaint notions of judicial independence .
Previous coverage :
• Entire N.J. judicial panel resigns to protest Gov. Christie 's non-tenure of Justice Wallace
• Justice Wallace grateful for colleague support as term ends
• N.J. lawyers group honors ousted state Supreme Court Justice John Wallace Jr .
• Retired N.J. Supreme Court justices ask Gov. Chris Christie to reconsider reappointing Justice Wallace
• Republican groups launch radio ads supporting Gov. Christie's N.J. property tax cap proposal
• Gov. Christie predicts N.J. will go broke without proposed property tax cap
• N.J. seniors fear Gov. Chris Christie 's proposed cuts to property tax rebates
The governor also revealed for the first time the real reason he removed Justice John Wallace from the bench :
It was the first phase in a larger scheme to take money out of poor urban school districts and spread it around to wealthier suburbs .
“ If people wonder why I want to change the Supreme Court , it ’s because I do n’t have the flexibility to change the school funding formula , ” he said .
“ The Supreme Court theory that if you put more money in , ( schools are ) going to just by magic get better has proven to be wrong . ”
The hope must be that if you repeat this nonsense enough , people will start to believe it .
But for the record , New Jersey is closing the racial achievement gap faster than any other state .
That ’s partly because we ’ve built the nation ’s best preschool program , no small thing .
Some districts , like Union City , have worked near miracles .
Others , like Camden , are still failing horribly .
But let ’s place the blame where it belongs — with state and local officials who failed to make the most of the money directed to poor urban areas under the Abbott vs. Burke rulings .
The court can only open the door .
Union City showed that it ’s possible to walk through it .
The governor also claimed that the court mandated “ the overwhelming majority ” of state money to go a “ small number ” or urban districts .
It was half the money , and it went to districts attended by nearly 1 in 4 New Jersey students .
Worse , the governor blamed the court for pinching school aid to suburbs like Robinsville , when the real cause is the sweeping cuts to all districts the governor is pushing .
“ He ’s just wrong , ” says David Sciarra of the Education Law Center , who represents students in poor districts .
“ If he funded the formula , Robbinsville would get $ 1.7 million more in aid . ”
The governor is playing an ugly political game .
He wants suburban taxpayers to blame their problems on the cities , with the Supreme Court as the enabler .
If he has to smudge a few facts along the way , so be it .
Look up the word “ demagogue ” in Webster ’s dictionary and you find a pretty tight fit with the governor in Robbinsville : “ A person who tries to stir up the people by appeals to emotion , prejudice , etc. , in order to win them over quickly and so gain power . ”
Standing in his way , of course , is the Supreme Court .
It found that the state ’s reliance on property taxes created enormous disparities that deprived kids in poor cities of a chance for a decent education , violating the state Constitution ’s promise .
Here ’s how the governor described it : “ They ’ve taken the power out of the hands of the Legislature to make this judgment and out of the hands of the governor , and the courts are making it .
Well , that ’s wrong .
If judges want to legislate , they should run for the Legislature . ”
He added , “ They ’re put there , and they believe they should stay there without any responsiveness to the people of the state . ”
Remember , though , that governors and legislatures in New Jersey created a system that was profoundly unequal .
Kids in poor cities were crowded into decrepit buildings with poorly paid teachers in systems funded at slightly more than half the state average .
That ’s what majority rule delivered .
And that ’s why the court jumped in .
Is the governor really suggesting that justices should heel to the majority instead ?
New Jersey is ready for a fiscal conservative after a decade in which the public sector continued to swell even as private sector jobs disappeared .
Polls show solid majorities want to see Trenton go on a diet and support his plan to cap property taxes .
If the Rant in Robbinsville is any guide , though , Christie has grander plans to push a conservative agenda .
That will no doubt tickle Limbaugh and friends .
But it will be a tough sell to the moderate voters of New Jersey .
Emacs 23.1.93 for Nokia N900
This page describes how to build Emacs 23.1.93 debian package for the Nokia N900 .
Everything is done under scratchbox : I make the hypothesis you already have a usable build environment .
Let 's first grab Emacs 23.1.93 sources :
$ wget -q http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/emacs-23.1.93.tar.gz $ wget -q
http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/emacs-23.1.93.tar.gz.sig $ gpg --verify emacs-23.1.93.tar.gz.sig gpg : Signature made Sat 27 Feb 2010 04:16:56 AM
CET using DSA key ID BC40251C gpg : Good signature from " Chong Yidong < cyd@stupidchicken.com > " $ tar xzf emacs - 23.1.93.tar.gz
Let 's now get the ' debian ' folder using git
$ cd emacs - 23.1.93 $ git clone http://git.natisbad.org/n900-emacs-23.1.93-debian-folder.git debian Cloning into n900 - emacs-23.1.93 - debian - folder ... remote : Counting objects : 44 , done .
remote : Compressing objects : 100 % ( 32/32 ) , done .
remote : Total 44 ( delta 6 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) Receiving objects : 100 % ( 44/44 ) , 44.75 KiB , done .
Resolving deltas : 100 % ( 6/6 ) , done .
If you are interested by some details about the content of the ' debian ' folder , you can take a look at my previous emacs - 22.2 for N900 page which provides additional details on that topic .
Let 's now compile the package .
If you have some laundry to do , you can probably do it now : compilation take a lot of time !
$ dpkg - buildpackage - rfakeroot - us - uc -sd - b - i - ICVS - I.git ...
At the end of the process , you should have the following :
$ ls -lh ../*.deb -rw-r--r-- 1 arno 1000 25 M Feb 28 17:06 ../emacs_23.1.93-1_armel.deb
You now just have to upload the .deb to you device and do a dpkg - i to install it .
If you want to use emacs in fullscreen on your device , you may be interested by this entry .
As an additional note , I did not manage to build the stable version ( 22.1 ) of Emacs under Scratchbox ( segfault of qemu ) but 23.1.93 works like a charm .

I just uploaded two new tracks .
For the direct posts , here is Meditation and Stalemate .
As you can probably tell from the title and the photo , I like contrast
and variation .
Although it is obvious that musical works should have various contrasting sections within them ( otherwise they would get boring fast ) , often people do n’t think about the importance of what I like to call meta - contrast ( okay , I just made that up now , but it clarifies my point ) .
Pieces of music should vary within an artist ’s repertoire .
Some composers only write orchestral pieces .
Some only compose on the piano .
Others only use electronic sounds .
My philosophy is to make use of the widest spectrum of musical sounds , instruments , themes , styles , and genres as possible .
Thus , it is appropriate that I uploaded these two tracks – Meditation and Stalemate – at the same time .
The first one is called Meditation , not because it ’s an awesome title ( because it ’s not really ) , but because it really made me think of ancient Asian influences .
But like I said , I love contrast , so it has a bunch of electronic instruments and sounds as well .
Meditation :
The second one is called Stalemate simply because it is going to be in the upcoming Neo Chess by Metallic Cloud Games .
The other song I wrote for this game ( Checkmate ) is going to be the theme of the game .
Stalemate is meant to be in the background during gameplay .
It contrasts vastly from Meditation , as it is jazzy , uses modern instrumentation , and has no electronic parts ( well , to clarify , of course it is somewhat electronic , because I composed a lot of it using the sample instruments in Logic Pro , but I used completely acoustic samples ) .
Stalemate :
After listening to both tracks , you now understand what I mean by contrast and variation .
Or maybe not .
But either way , I hope you liked them .

These are indeed good days for private tracker buffs .
Yet another excellent BitTorrent site , TorrentGui ( TTG ) has opened public registrations and is currently accepting new members .
Understandably , some of you out there might not be familiar with the name ‘ TTG ’ .
Even though the name is new , this is by no means a new , start up tracker .
TorrentGui was previously known as GameGui and used to specialize in video games .
Now , it has rebranded itself as TTG and has expanded site operations to track software , movies and TV shows in addition to PC and console games .
It has an impressive collection of high definition video content and is home to several P2P encoder groups including ‘ WiKi ’ , who used to release exclusively on HDChina .
TTG will be open for public registration for three days starting today .
With over 35000 registered members ( at least in their forums ) , TTG is one of those huge private trackers .
Bulk of this user base migrated from GameGui which itself was one of the largest Chinese torrent sites during its time .
Their torrent index is also decently sized with around ~ 7500 active torrents indexed at time of posting .
Although TTG began as a games only tracker , the site has now expanded to index video content including movies and TV shows .
You can even find software and other releases which makes this essentially a General / 0 Day tracker .
If you are wondering , TTG still seems to focus a lot on games and their PC / Console games collection is as impressive as it ever was .
In addition , this tracker has quite a few exclusive releases with the help of internal encoder groups such as WiKi ( Ex - HDChina ) , NGB , BPMWell , BD Club , QW ( games ) and WiiDao ( Wii games ) .
The screenshot below captures ofr of TTG ’s torrent index :
Although the majority of releases indexed on this tracker are in English , it ’s navigation interface does not have an English language translation option – it ’s all in Chinese .
However , there is no need to worry – you can get over the translation woes with the help of Google Chrome .
How to translate TorrenTGui to English with Google Chrome
Download the latest version of Google Chrome browser from here .
Visit TTG forum homepage through this link : http://torrentgui.com/bbs/index.php.
Once the page is done loading , Google Chrome will automatically display several translation options ( the message will be displayed just beneath the address bar – you ca n’t miss it ) .
Choose the auto detected settings ( should be Chinese Simplified Hans to English ) and hit translate .

In his first interview since being released from Israeli detention , a Canadian activist from the Free Gaza Flotilla activist describes seeing solidarity in the face of death , and what happened when the Israeli military took control of the humanitarian aid ship and arrested those on board .
Kevin Neish tells his story to the media for the first time in this episode of rabble radio .
Part of the interview is excerpted here :
Meagan Perry : Hello Kevin Neish , we 're so glad you 're okay .
Kevin Neish : Hello there ... I 'm , well I did n't realize I was dead but ... I 'm glad I 'm not dead .
I mean I was kind of surprised ... needless to say , everybody thought I was dead .
MP : There are varying reports about what had happened ...
KN : It seems ask anybody who was n't in jail or you could get ahold of saw me was at the front of the ship along the handrailing talking to a colleague in the moonlight ... beautiful evening .
And that was the spot that I guess several people were murdered earlier on in the fighting and they thought I was one of them and that I 'd been pitched over the side by the Israelis or something .
So yeah the Israelis knew I was alive but were n't telling anybody and I asked for my rights to the embassy I bet you 20 times .
So the embassy actually found me because the prisoners were all in Be'er Sheva and they literally just went from cell to cell calling out my name asking anybody if anybody had seen me and nobody had seen me .
I think they came to almost the last place I think ... and they called me out and I stepped out and their jaws dropped .
The rest is history .
MP : So nobody knew what had happened to you ... what did happen to you ?
KN : What happened from that spot on the front deck .
I think that was about midnight .
I think the attack happened around 4:00 a.m. in the morning , I did n't check my watch .
What happened was I took a little wander around after chatting with the friend there ... I saw the Israeli ships in the distance .
I 've got colour blindness partially and I 've got really good night vision because of that so I actually pointed out to the Turkish aid workers : " See those identical lights way off in the horizon " and they squint and say : " Probably the Israelis " and everbody got their life jackets on except me and they were quite concerned that I did n't have my life jacket on yet because I did n't take it seriously .
You know , the Israelis they would n't attack us , a ship full of civilians .
It just was n't going to happen ... I told them so and they thought I was nuts and they were right , I was nuts .
They had wooden stakes and wooden handles of things , and they had pipes and they had links of chain -- small chain , you could lock up a bike with .
Across along the front railing , the teak railing on the front of the ship , was lined with old rusty pipe fittings and nuts and bolts , the size of a walnut ... things like that .
This is madness , I said what are you going to do with nuts and bolts you 're throwing at the most sophisticated army in the world .
After that , I thought nothing was going to happen , I thought well I 'm going to go down and put my feet up and have a few hours sleep and start off fresh when daylight comes .
But I woke up because of all the noise , and what not , not the attack but people doing things .
I heard grinders going which was bothering me and it turned out they were grinding the chains that they hang up around the lifeboat stations .
They were grinding these chains off the middle posts as weapons within sight of the Israelis coming ... and that 's all they had .
MP : As a peace activist , what were your feelings about everyone preparing to fight back ?
KN : They had every right to do it .
Well peace activist , I 'm not a pacifist , I 'll defend myself if someone attacks me .
What woke me up was flash grenades about 15 feet from the back of the ship .
There were a huge explosions and flashes and then it was just a big cloud of tear gas and I could see people running through the tear gas with gas masks on because they had brought a large collection of gas masks , brand new ones .
And again , I thought it was silly , at one point , I saw them putting these things on .
So that happened and I mistakenly thought I was safer on the big ship a ) because I thought the big ship would get through to Gaza because it was such a big ship .
I thought what could they do to such a big ship like that and I thought for sure the small ships would get picked off and they were picked off .
They were shut down immediately , no resistance .
Even the freighters were shut down , they had very small crews .
At the end they made a combined effort on the main ship and that 's when all hell broke loose .
MP : What did you see then ?
KN : I saw dead bodies .
I saw captured Israeli soldiers , I saw men fighting machine guns with three foot length of chain .
It was phenomenal .
When the flash grenades went off at the back I took note of what was happening there but I did n't approach it I backed off and just took note of what they were doing .
They were hauling fire hoses out and what not .
After the fact I found out that the firehoses actually worked .
The Israelis backed off .
They had zodiacs and speed boats with grapples trying to climb up the side of the ship .
The firehoses and I guess the nuts and bolts actually drove the Israelis off .
At the same time they had commandos coming down from helicopters over top .
So I moved and took photographs went up and down the stairs following people and being of whatever assistance , witnessing and helping with things if I could .
I was actually when they hauled the captured Israeli soldiers in .
I can't imagine how these young fellas with all the weapons you could possibly want , how these commandos got captured by humanitarian aid workers .
As far as what I saw , when it started I took photographs of this landing and they had a tarp for one person , an IV pole and a nurse and a doctor and basic instruments for medical emergency care .
And in the end that whole area was full of bodies .
There was people pounding on people 's chests trying to bring people back .
I saw for sure two people dead -- there were two bullet holes , very neat ; and I think one other guy died in front of me , he was sucking wind and his eyes were going , going , going .
And there was blood , blood all down the stairs , blood everywhere .
I got blood on my pants and boots .
It was something else .
I have n't seen any reports , I 've seen nothing but I 've heard the Israelis are saying that they attacked because they were shot at from the ship and that 's a bald faced lie .
Unless I missed something pretty dramatic somewhere , I heard no weapons fired , nobody else heard weapons fired .
What I heard was the flash grenades and the tear gas of the start of the Israelis attacking .
And then the helicopters started shooting onto the deck and that 's when I started to hear gun fire from up above .
MP : What was it like in detention when you got there ?
KN : Eventually , an announcement came over the air from the captain because the Israelis got to the bridge because they'd shot the people that were defending the bridge , and the captain surrendered the ship and he got onto the PA system immediately I guess because there was still fighting at the doorways and then the announcement came over the air in Arabic but I knew what it was because there was no other announcement , I knew what it meant ... it was a very calm voice .
Then a female voice came on announcing in English that everybody stop fighting , stop resisting , the bridge is seized , the Israelis have command of the ship , there 's no sense risking your lives anymore , go to the lounges and drop your weapons -- you know , weapons drop your pipes and chains and wooden staffs .
I just retreated with all the other arab and turkish folks .
I sat where I was before , near the back of the ship and there were Israelis peeking in the windows but they would n't come in and the woman 's voice kept on coming over saying " Israeli soldiers please please stop shooting , we 're not resisting anymore , we 've released your captured soldiers .
They 're unharmed and they 're released .
Please stop attacking us . "
Eventually the Israelis , the soldiers , [ Haneen Zoubi ] she 's an Arab Israeli Knesset member , she 's in big shit , she 's in jail right now , it 's simple they took away her immunity so they can do whatever they want to her now .
She acted as a liason , brave woman , she walked right out with her hands up because anyone who was standing , was a target , basically .
She had her hands up and she came forward and explained that there were numerous injured .
When that all happened they took us and hogtied us with plastic tie wraps behind our backs and marshalled us all up onto the open deck .
There were 280 of us all tied up .
MP : Where did they take you ?
What did they do with you ?
KN : They left us there for quite a while and you could n't move .
Talk about stress positions ... you hogtie someone behind their back and force them to sit on their knees or on their ass , however they 're first put down and not move , you did n't move .
Eventually you 'd start to hurt and try to wriggle around and then you 'd get yelled and screamed at .
There were two young , big strapping guys and I guess they had had enough of being humiliated , and being abused .
They rose up and immediately you could see , the sun was coming up , the soldiers charging through the people on the grounds with their guns up .
And these guys were toast so I got up ... it made the Israelis stop because they knew who I was .
They had my passport and they gave it back to me and they took 4,000 bucks of my friggin ' money but yeah , we wo n't get into that .... so yeah I stood up with these two guys hoping that the Israelis would pause and consider , not shoot and they did n't ... the guns went down but yelling carried on ... then next they used batons to beat them down .
Then these two guys , I guess they 'd made their point , and they kind of gracefully eased down and when they eased down I dropped pretty quickly ...

Interview
Hayward , who had been carefully coached by legal and media teams , frustrated the committee with his ' lack of candour '
BP chief executive Tony Hayward felt the full - on wrath of a powerful committee of the US Congress today , determined to bring him to account for what it called an astonishing culture of " corporate complacency " that has led to America 's worst environmental catastrophe .
In the 59 days since the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , Hayward has been transformed into one of the most hated men in the US , and the ferocity of the encounter between him and the House of Representatives committee on energy and commerce was much - anticipated .
As one committee member noted : " The anger at BP is at fever pitch .
It 's almost palpable . "
The committee has been conducting an aggressive inquiry into the gusher , and called Hayward in to answer specific charges of suspected safety lapses and shortcuts in the design plan of the well in the days before the explosion on the ill - fated Deepwater Horizon rig .
But Hayward , who had been carefully coached by legal and media teams and was testifying under oath , failed to satisfy .
" The committee is extremely frustrated with your lack of candour , " Bart Stupak , who is leading the investigation , told him .
" You are the CEO .
You have a PhD .
We hope you have more candour in your responses . "
The reprimand was just a taste of the rancour towards Hayward .
He was told by angry committee members that BP had a history of cavalier disregard for environmental rules and workers ' safety .
Hayward 's claims to have ushered in a new regime of safety after taking over as chief executive of the company in 2007 were plainly ridiculed .
" When I heard of the explosion in the Gulf , the name that immediately popped into my mind was BP , " said Stupak .

But the committee 's search for answers was repeatedly frustrated by Hayward , who denied any involvement in or prior knowledge of the ill - fated decisions about the well that led to the blow - out .
" I was not part of the decision making process on this well , " he said .
" I had no prior knowledge . "
Hayward had multiple variations on the same theme : that he had no direct involvement or knowledge of problems on the Deepwater Horizon , even though engineers lower down in BP 's hierarchy had spoken about a " nightmare well " .
He clung to his argument that it would be premature to comment until investigations had run their course .
However , he did allow that BP was pursuing seven lines of inquiry into the disaster , focusing on the cement casing of the well and well control procedures , as well as the failed blow - out preventer safety device .
His answers , all delivered in flat , impassive tones , infuriated committee members .
" You are kicking the can down the road , " said Henry Waxman , the chairman of the committee .
" I find that irresponsible . "
Ed Markey , who chairs the subcommittee on global warming , snapped : " Your equivocation is not reassuring . "
Even the Republican members were frustrated .
" You are copping out , " said Phil Gingrey .
" It seems like your testimony has been way too evasive . "
Today 's session in Congress looked set to erase whatever modest rehabilitation in BP 's image was affected by the company 's decision to pay $ 20 bn into an independently managed fund to pay victims of the disaster .
But in one glimmer of hope , the US official overseeing the administration 's response to the spill said that the drilling of a relief well meant to staunch the gusher was proceeding ahead of schedule .
Hayward admitted to the committee that a relief well would be the only sure way of stopping the gusher .
I take you on this quick tour not to make fun of futurism past ( I have only slightly less - purple skeletons in my closet ) , but to point out how an idea that we have largely taken for granted is in fact the product of a very specific ideology .
Despite its Department of Defense origins , the matrixed , hyperlinked Internet was both cause and effect of the libertarian ethos of Silicon Valley .
The open - source mentality , in theory if not always in practice , proved useful for the tech and Internet worlds .
Facebook and Twitter achieved massive scale quickly by creating an open system accessible to outside developers , though that openness is at times more about branding than anything else — as Twitter ’s fellow travelers are now finding out .
Mainframe behemoths like IBM wave the bloody shirt of Linux , the nonprofit open - source competitor of Microsoft Windows , any time they need to prove their bona fides to the tech community .
Ironically , only the “ old ” entertainment and media industries , it seems , took open and free literally , striving to prove that they were fit for the digital era ’s freewheeling information / entertainment bazaar by making their most expensively produced products available for free on the Internet .
As a result , they undermined in little more than a decade a value proposition they had spent more than a century building up .
But now , it seems , things are changing all over again .
The shift of the digital frontier from the Web , where the browser ruled supreme , to the smart phone , where the app and the pricing plan now hold sway , signals a radical shift from openness to a degree of closed - ness that would have been remarkable even before 1995 .
In the U.S. , there are only three major cell - phone networks , a handful of smart - phone makers , and just one Apple , a company that has spent the entire Internet era fighting the idea of open ( as anyone who has tried to move legally purchased digital downloads among devices can attest ) .
As far back as the ’ 80s , when Apple launched the desktop - publishing revolution , the company has always made the case that the bourgeois comforts of an artfully constructed end - to - end solution , despite its limits , were superior to the freedom and danger of the digital badlands .
Apple , for once , is swimming with the tide .
After 15 years of fruitless experimentation , media companies are realizing that an advertising - supported model is not the way to succeed on the Web and they are , at last , seeking to get consumers to pay for their content .
They are operating on the largely correct assumption that people will be more likely to pay for consumer - friendly apps via the iPad , and a multitude of competing devices due out this year , than they are to subscribe to the same old kludgy Web site they have been using freely for years .
As a result , media companies will soon be pushing their best and most timely content through their apps instead of their Web sites .
Meanwhile , video - content services are finding that they do n’t even need to bother with the Web and the browser .
Netflix , for one , is well on its way to sending movies and TV shows directly to TV sets , making their customers ’ experience virtually indistinguishable from ordering up on - demand shows by remote control .
It ’s far from a given that this shift will generate the kinds of revenue media companies are used to : for under - 30s whelped on free content , the prospect of paying hundreds or thousands of dollars yearly for print , audio , and video ( on expensive new devices that require paying AT&T $ 30 a month ) is not going to be an easy sell .
Originally announced with a planned second half of 2010 launch , today Google has narrowed the launch of its Chrome OS to fall .
This , according to Sundar Pichai , Google VP of product management speaking at Computex .
By our calculation that is sometime between 22 September and 21 December in the northern hemisphere if you want to take the man literally ... and you do , do n't you .
Wonder if we 'll see a Chrome OS tablet launch at the same time ?
I do n’t think a tough question is disrespectful .
–Helen Thomas
American democracy took a big hit with the forced retirement of Helen Thomas , the First Lady of the Washington Press Corps ..
When one considers how many scoundrels remain in powerful positions in both public and private life , the swiftness with which she was dumped after 50 years of reporting on U.S. presidents was breathtaking .
More so when you listen to TV talking - heads blandly repeating corporate and Pentagon PR as “ news ” and Faux News blowhards like Beck and Limbaugh shamelessly make vicious slanders , perpetrate outright lies and create disinformation .
The last thing one hears in most places is the kind of tough question that was Helen Thomas ’ trademark .
Every president thinks that all information that comes to the White House is his private preserve after they all promise an open administration on the campaign trail , but some are more secretive than others .
Some want to lock down everything .
–Helen Thomas
Thomas recognized that it is essential for real democracy that the press must have an adversarial relationship to the president , in order to get to the facts about what the government is actually doing and why .
She was n’t afraid to challenge the prevailing “ defense of democracy ” narratives about U.S. wars and occupations — whether the President pushing them was a Republican or a Democrat .
Whether it was George W. Bush , who Thomas called “ the worst president in American history ” or President Barack Obama , who MSNBC cheerleaders like Keith Olbermann or Rachel Maddow hesitate to criticize , Thomas bluntly pierced the propaganda .
Government secrecy is an enemy of real democracy , and Thomas was a bright light trying to reveal what politicians aim to hide from the American people : no -bid contracts for “ private contractors ” bilking the public and committing war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan , torture minimized as “ enhanced interrogation , ” the contradictions between presidents ’ speeches and actions .
You do n’t spread democracy through the barrel of a gun .
— Helen Thomas
For Thomas , “ collateral damage ” is a cover - up word for civilian men , women and children in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan — and , yes , Gaza — killed in the service of corporate empire - building .
She made their deaths visible while most media erases them .
Thomas focused on policies , not political party .
She had no interest in the political “ horse race ” coverage that dominates so much reporting .
What got Thomas fired was a May 27 off - the - cuff remark about Israel — the “ third rail ” of U.S. foreign policy .
Thomas is the only contradictory journalistic voice that could be heard in the so - called “ mainstream ” ( corporate - owned ) media .
From the New York Times to CNN , reporters have mouthed the mantras provided by Israel about their attack on the “ freedom flotilla ” ships that tried to take humanitarian aid to Gaza .
The Washington Post was at least honest enough to headline Glenn Kessler ’s piece for what it was “ Israel give its account of raid ” .
The rest of the U.S. media mostly went along with Israel ’s claim that heavily armed IDF commandos acted in “ self - defense ” against ships of civilians from 40 countries .
Soldiers fired live ammunition , used tasers and flash bombs on human rights activists , a Nobel Prize winner , Ed Peck ( a former U.S. ambassador to the Middle East ) Swedish novelist Henning Mankell , peace activist and retired U.S. Army Col .
Ann Wright .
Yet , unless one goes to the Internet and the international press ( including dissenting voices in Israel itself ) , the attacks on the Freedom Flotilla have been told only from Israel ’s perspective .
Telling the other side was certainly possible within three days of the IDF assault as the Freedom Flotilla activists were released and speaking with or writng for international media outside the U.S.
For example , Swedish author of the ‘ Wallander ’ mystery series , Henning Mankell ’s ‘ Flotilla Diary ” was published in the UK Guardian newspaper .
Would Helen Thomas , at a White House press briefing , have quoted the emerging eyewitness accounts of the commando raids on the ships ?
Would she have raised the facts that the rest of the world already knows about Israel ’s three - year blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza ?
Would she have asked President Obama how Israel ’s “ security ” was threatened by the ships ’ medicine , toys , wheelchairs , olive trees and cement for Palestinians still living in rubble and on what the World Health Organization has called “ a starvation diet ” ?
Would any other reporter have done so ?
She did .
On June 1 , Thomas grilled White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs : “ The initial reaction to the flotilla massacre , deliberate massacre , an international crime , was pitiful .
What do you mean you regret something that should be so strongly condemned , and if any other nation in the world had done it , we would have been up in arms ?
What is this ironclad relationship where a country that deliberately kills people and boycotts every aid and abet … the boycott [ blockade of Gaza ] ? ”
It was an Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) priority to conceal as much as possible of the attack from the world through censorship .
Journalists and activists on the Freedom Flotilla are saying their satellite transmissions were quickly jammed .
The international press is interviewing these journalists who say that IDF soldiers confiscated or immediately destroyed all cameras , cell phones and lap top computers .
There was no return of those devices — which presumably had raw footage of the attack that would contradict Israel ’s propaganda campaign .
However , raw , unedited footage of the Israeli assault is now becoming available , and it shows the falsehood of the IDF - edited footage distributed widely shortly after the attack .
Israel has now admited that audio was added to the IDF footage that U.S. media widely broadcast .
The June 10 edition of “ Democracy NOW ! ” interviewed one of the journalists on the Flotilla and has some of the raw video Israel did not manage to suppress .
Robert Mackey has also complied the raw video :
But , without Helen Thomas in the White House press room , will anyone confront Barack Obama about the U.S. policy of unconditional support for Israel ’s ongoing violations of international law , or the additional $ 30 billion in U.S. military aid to Israel recently authorized for expenditure over the next decade ?
We in the press have a special role since there is no other institution in our society that can hold the President accountable .
I do believe that our democracy can endure and prevail only if the American people are informed .
— Helen Thomas
Increasingly , one hears about a “ crisis in journalism ” that is too often debated in terms of profits : “ How can newspapers compete with the Internet ?
What ’s the 21st century economic model ? ”
What corporate - owned newspapers fail to debate is the real crisis in journalism , the crisis of content and perspective , independence and purpose of journalism in a democracy .
The career ( and firing ) of Helen Thomas speaks directly to the juncture that American journalism finds itself at : “ Infotainment ” or information ?
Probing for facts or press release distribution ?
Asking questions or echoing statements from public relations flunkies ?
Thomas did n’t just jot down what press secretaries or presidents said .
Unlike most of the Beltway hacks working in the corporate media , Thomas knows the difference between public relations and journalism .
Unfortunately , for the last 25 years , the job descriptions of the two fields increasingly have merged as schools of journalism and departments of advertising / marketing / public relations have been folded together into “ communications ” departments .
Many of today ’s reporters do n’t appear to even know the difference between the craft of journalism and the craftiness of PR .
They are simply , “ stenographers to power , ” as writer Micheal Parenti calls them in a critique of the press of that name .
There ’s a reason that journalism is the only profession protected under our Constitution .
Thomas Jefferson remarked , “ Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter . ”
Democracy is threatened when the people do not know what their government is doing .
Democracy can not survive when citizens are not informed about the issues of the day and the policies proposed to address them .
Consider the gobbledy - gook that passes for reporting whenever another U.S. war is proposed or the confusion and sound - bites surrounding the health care “ reform ” bill approved by President Obama .
When America ’s youth are to be sent around the world to kill and be killed or when major legislation that affects everyone , such as that on health care , is to be voted on by Congress , what is needed is deeply informed reporting that is skeptical of those with political power and wealth .
Without that kind of journalism , citizens cannot possibly participate in democracy in any meaningful way — and true democracy is more than voting for packaged candidates every two to four years .
Few in the White House press corps have dug deeply enough to be actually informed .
Acting more like celebrity writers , they worship the powerful people true journalism is supposed to hold accountable .
I doubt anyone left in the White House press room has the guts regularly shown by the petite 89 - year - old woman who was just forced to retire .
American democracy will be further diminished towards a state of facade without Helen Thomas ’ questions .

The problem with America is stupidity .
I 'm not saying there should be a capital punishment for stupidity , but why do n't we just take the safety labels off of everything and let the problem solve itself ?
Centralized electric power entered the world in 1882 .
The first plant , a temporary test case , opened in London that January .
By the fourth of September , New York City was home to a permanent version .
Twenty - six days later , the third centralized electric plant — and the first hydroelectric plant in the world — began operations .
It was in Appleton , Wisconsin .
Yes , Appleton , Wisconsin .
London .
New York .
Appleton .
Yes , seriously .
And the story actually gets a bit weirder .
See , London and New York ?
Those plants were the direct work of Thomas A. Edison — babies he guided into the world by the sweat of his brow and the dinosaur - like stomping of his competitors .
Appleton was just a licensee , the brainchild of a group of random businessmen who bought a couple of Edison generators and built a power plant around them .
It was the Waiting for Guffman of early electricity , and it came very close to beating Edison , himself , to the punch .
Appleton sits on the Fox River , a little south and east of Green Bay , part of a chain of small cities that ring Lake Winnebago .
Back in 1882 , Appleton 's location was n't just about great views or good fishing .
Water was the highway .
It was the power source that ran factories .
The Fox River made Appleton rich .
Or , anyway , some people in Appleton .
Ok , some guys .
Ok , some white guys with hilarious facial hair .
Henry Rogers , for instance .
Sporting a fabulous mustache and a penchant for going by " H.J. " , Rogers was basically one dollar - sign emblazoned pot belly away from being That Guy in late 19th - century political cartoons .
To the Appleton Post and the Appleton Chronicle , he was one of " our Capitalists , " the men of action who got things done .
Who he had over for supper was considered legitimate news .
When H.J. Rogers took a trip to Chicago , it made both papers .
In 1882 , he really set the Appleton media on fire .
That July , Rogers went fishing with H.E. Jacobs , a salesman who worked for the Western Edison Light Company , lining up licensees for Edison 's electric lighting system .
Let 's put this story in perspective : Rogers already owned Appleton 's gas lighting utility .
He had never seen an electric light .
And while Edison had been selling one - off , on - site generators for a while , the idea of a centralized electric utility had n't yet been demonstrated in the United States and there were precious few engineers
West of Mississippi who knew how to make one run .
And yet , Henry Rogers walked away from that fishing trip the proud owner of all rights to Edison technology in the entire Fox River Valley .
I do n't know much about this H.E. Jacobs , but he was a hell of a salesman .
Why Electricity Generation is Like a Dirty Joke
There 's a simple experiment that helps explain the basics of electricity generation .
Take a bar magnet and slide it quickly in and out of a coil of copper wire .
Every time you do this , you 'll produce a small electric current .
( And a large potential for immature jokes . )
The physical tango of a conductive metal moving through a magnetic field produces electricity .
That conversion from physical to electrical is what generators are all about .
When H.J. Rogers convinced his buddies to buy in on electric light , he was essentially betting his fortune on a larger , better - engineered version of that science museum " please touch " exhibit .
Like the bar magnet and copper coil , the Edison K - model dynamos Rogers bought produced electricity by moving a conductor through a magnetic field .
In this case , the Fox River turned a water wheel , which moved a system of gears , which spun a cylinder of conductive metal between six tall magnets .
( The magnets ' resemblance to legs earned the system the nickname " Long - legged Mary Ann " , which is what passed for an immature joke in the 1880s . )
The interaction of magnets and metal does n't actually " generate " anything from scratch .
Instead , the magnetic field simply forces electrons to move in one direction .
You know how an atom is set up — central nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons .
In conductive metals , the electrons are n't tied down to any one atom .
Instead , they mingle , forming something akin a river of electrons in which atoms float like buoys .
The magnetic field makes the electron " river " flow along , from one buoy to another .
What we call " electric service " is just the movement of electrons around a closed loop of wire .
On one end is the generator .
At the other is your house .
Making the Technology Work ( Sort Of )
This all sounds relatively simple , but at the time it was high technology that not even the ostensible experts totally grasped .
In New York City , Thomas Edison built up a working central system by inventing parts of said system as he went along — from the voltage regulators that made sure electrons were pushed along by a steady , predictable amount of force , to the meters that allowed you to , you know , actually charge customers .
Rogers ' Appleton team wanted to beat Edison to the first central system in the United States .
But , without an Edison of their own , they could n't hope to compete on a technological basis .
There 's an old saying , " A project can be good , it can be cheap , or it can be fast .
You get to pick two . "
The Appleton Capitalists , by all accounts , went with cheap and fast .
" Two and a half months after Jacobs had first talked to Rogers about it , the first hydroelectric central station in the world was in business , " wrote Forrest McDonald in " Let There Be Light " , his 1957 book on the history of electric utilities in Wisconsin .
" But this speed was accomplished partly by the omission of several of the safety and reliability features of the complete Edison system and partly by the use of makeshift equipment . "
Hilarity , as they say , ensued .
Start with the water wheel itself .
To save time and money , Rogers initially opted to use a dynamo powered by the same water wheel that ran the pulp beaters on his paper mill .
The problem : Power to the dynamo fluctuated based on how hard the mill was running .
The resulting surges burnt out lightbulbs , which cost — in 2009 equivalency — $ 35 a pop .
Given that H.J. Rogers , himself , was the utility 's first three customers — by way of his two paper mills and his house — that problem was fixed pretty quickly .
By November 1882 , the electric utility had its own building and water wheel at Vulcan Street .

But there were still no voltmeters .
Edison had invented them , but Appleton would n't buy any for another six years .
Instead , they had a guy .
A guy who sat in the utility building — shack , really — with the dynamos and stared at a lightbulb .
Based on the brightness of the bulb , he decided whether the voltage was too high , too low or just right .
Apparently , the Goldilocks method did n't cause any serious problems , as long as the guy had good eyesight .
Staff were also the solution to Appleton 's wiring problem .
Wires connecting customers to the generator , and lights to each other , were usually just wrapped in paper or cloth — if they were insulated at all .
They shorted out if you looked at them wrong , and , apparently , there were a lot of dirty looks going around .
In 1922 , A.C. Langstadt , a retired engineer from the Appleton utility 's early days , remembered having to repeatedly stop work and shut down the power plant for anywhere between an hour and a day , while all the utility employees went from house to house playing " Hunt the Shorted Wire " .
Ironically , these shortcuts still did n't get Appleton up and running before Edison 's New York plant .
It was still the start of something , though .
When the lights at H.J. Rogers ' mansion glowed for the first time on the night of September 30 , 1882 , the occasion marked both the genesis of what would someday be called renewable electricity , and a watershed moment wherein electric power became real to the skeptics — something possible all across the country , not just in Thomas Edison 's laboratories .
History Lost ... And Found
Back in April , I went on a bit of a pilgrimage to see this landmark for myself .
The original Vulcan Street Power Plant is long since gone , but in 1932 , the city built a replica , on the same spot , complete with a model generator .
It was rededicated as a National Historic Engineering Landmark in 1977 .
Or so I 'd read .
I started looking for it at H.J. Rogers ' mansion , now a museum open to the public .
" I think it 's somewhere down in the river bottom , " the director told me .
" I 'm not really sure .
You should ask at the Paper Mill Museum down there . "
So I did .
And the staff at the Paper Mill Museum looked at me as though a pack of chinchillas had just climbed out of my ear and rappelled down my shoulder .
They 'd never heard of any such thing .
They directed me to a nearby Italian restaurant , housed in a former power plant .
It was large and brick and definitely not the right building .
I tried the county historical society museum .
Again , my chinchilla problem seemed to be acting up .
By now , I was wondering whether I 'd imagined the whole thing .
A Google map provided by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers was set to a hospital far from the river .
An old souvenir bulletin from 1977 sent me to a mid-century power station that had since been turned into office space .
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers finally gave me an address that made sense — 530 S. Vulcan Street .
On an island in the middle of the Fox River , down a pockmarked street that ran into the parking lot of a paper factory , I found the Vulcan Street Power Plant — a little , square box of a building , up on stilts at the water 's edge , its once - white paint peeling away from the rotting wood .
It had snowed the night before , and I climbed the shaky front steps worried that the accumulation might be hiding a hole in the decking .
The front door was locked , but I could peer through the broken windows and see a Long - Legged Mary Ann enthroned on a dias .
The all - important , voltage - regulating lightbulb was intact , hanging from the moss - caked wood roof .
It would be a lie to say that this ending did n't make a bit of sense .
When the city of Appleton built the replica , they thought — thanks to erroneous dates in a memoir published by one of Edison 's engineers — that Vulcan Street had been the first centralized power plant in the whole world .
The let down must have been a bitch .
And , while electricity as a whole has obviously been successful , the investment did n't end well for H.J. Rogers .
He poured buckets of money the utility ( and the electrically lit mansion he used as advertisement ) , and never made a cent back .
By 1884 , he was writing of his accounts being always overdrawn .
He de-invested and left Appleton entirely within a few years .
The utility business , itself , did n't fare much better .
After the first three years , investors had plopped down the equivalent of more than $ 500,000 , and found they owned a company worth less .
They never got any dividends .
By 1896 , the utility was bankrupt .
The same thing happened to most of the early adopters of centralized electricity , who did n't anticipate the challenges of running a business with such huge upfront infrastructure costs .
The Vulcan Street replica memorializes long - term success , but it's also something of a monument to immediate , belly - up failure .
I teetered back to the ground and stood for a minute in the cold .
A couple passed by , walking their dog along the river .
They did n't so much as glance at the crumbling relic .
I walked back to my car and drove away .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Angered by Arizona ’s crackdown on illegal immigrants , Hispanic protesters took to the streets on Saturday to denounce the new law and call on President Barack Obama to act urgently on immigration reform at May Day rallies across the United States .
Protesters gather to speak out against stricter immigration laws , such as one passed recently in Arizona , at a May Day rally in Lafayette Square Park near the White House in Washington , May 1 , 2010 .

In a sea of American flags and banners painted with “ We Are All Arizona ” and “ Overturn Arizona Apartheid , ” tens of thousands of marchers , dressed in white , swarmed downtown Los Angeles .
In Washington , a U.S. congressman was among 34 people arrested in a protest outside the White House .
Dozens of protests were planned by immigration rights activists in U.S. cities , including in the Arizona capital , Phoenix , where the governor signed the toughest immigration law in the nation eight days ago .
Activists want a repeal of the law that seeks to drive illegal immigrants out of the U.S. - Mexico border state and they want Obama to fulfill his election promise to overhaul immigration laws .
An estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants live in the United States .
“ What is happening in Arizona is making the community come out to the street , ” said activist Omar Gomez in Los Angeles .
The Arizona law requires state and local police to determine people ’s immigration status if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” they are in the United States illegally .
Supporters say it is needed to curb crime in the desert state , which is home to some 460,000 illegal immigrants and is a major corridor for drug and migrant smugglers from Mexico .
Critics say the law is unconstitutional and opens the door to racial profiling .
Polls show it has the backing of almost two - thirds of Arizona voters and majority support nationwide .
The law has prompted legal challenges and hurled immigration back on the front burner of U.S. politics in this volatile election year .
‘ NO PLACE FOR BIGOTRY ’
“ Laws that make suspects out of people for no other reason than the color of their skin have no place in our country , ” Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , a Mexican - American , told marchers packing into the city center .
“ We must show that bigotry has no place in the United States of America , ” added Villaraigosa , a Democrat who is one of the most powerful Hispanics in U.S. politics .
Kellie Morrell , a waitress at a New York City restaurant that she said employs several illegal immigrants , was among a few thousand activists who took to the streets of New York .
“ They work really hard and they deserve to not have to live in fear of arrest or being thrown into prison , or even worse , ” she said .
In Washington , Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez from Obama ’s home state of Illinois , was arrested with 34 others after they locked arms and sat in front of the White House fence , chanting Obama ’s campaign slogan , “ Yes we can ” in Spanish .
The congressman was later released , a spokesman said .
Hispanics are the largest minority in the United States and a powerful voting bloc .

Organizers had expected turnout at rallies to be at the highest levels since 2006 and 2007 , when hundreds of thousands of immigration rights supporters marched in U.S. cities
Police estimated 50,000 people attended the Los Angeles rally , but organizers pegged the number at 250,000 .
Crowds in most cities appeared to be smaller .
In Chicago , where activists turned out to protest the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team at a game this week , tens of thousands of marchers turned out .
In the Boston area , some 2,000 people marched in favor of legalizing undocumented migrants .
Anger at the law spilled over the border to Mexico on Saturday , where activists toting placards reading “ Justice for Migrants , ” gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City .
OBAMA’S PROMISE
Arizona ’s law instantly revived efforts by Democrats to enact immigration reform six months before congressional elections .
A framework set out by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was quickly endorsed by Obama on Thursday , but analysts see only a slim chance of it passing .
Frustration at Obama for not delivering on an election promise to overhaul immigration laws was evident in placards like “ Where is your promise Obama ? ” , and some doubted they would vote for Democrats in November congressional elections .
“ They feel worse than neglected , they feel attacked , ” said Joseph Antoine , 21 , who was among 2,000 marchers in Boston .
“ They ’re not going to be rushing to support Democrats in November . ”
Going underground !
Clever animals cross road in hidden tunnel to avoid being flattened by traffic
Living by a busy road , these animals are n’t willing to take any chances when it comes to getting across safely .
Instead , a rabbit and a stoat are cleverly using an underground network of drains to make it to the other side .
The cute animals scuttle from one side of the road to the other and pop out of drains in order to avoid being hit by traffic .
Peek - a - boo : A rabbit pops his head up from the drain before scuttling underground
Stoat , look , listen :
The creature uses a network of drains to cross the road
And a fluffy little owl also uses the same underground network as a home while waiting for its mother to bring food .
Amateur wildlife photographer Paul Bunyard captured the shots while driving on his way to work in Rugby , Warwickshire .
The 38 - year - old was able to grab a quick photo of the stoat before it popped back into the drain .
What a hoot !
A baby owl waits for its mother in a road - side drain
Clever :
The rabbit pokes its head out of the drain , looking out for traffic
However , while the Ministry of Justice communications officer was waiting for it to emerge , the curious creature appeared at the other side of the road .
Mr Bunyard said : ‘ I thought he had become spooked by me stopping the car , but when he popped up nearer to where I was about 20 seconds later I could n't believe it .
‘ He must have just been curious and wanted to get a closer look at me and my camera . ’
Curious :
The rabbit comes out of its hiding place to have a look around
A few days earlier , Mr Bunyard also spotted a rabbit poking its head out of a drain on the same road .
‘ It looked pretty young , about a month old , and it's the season for newborn animals , ’ he said .
He added that he saw the owl , along with a sibling , being fed by their mother .
Mr Bunyard put cones along the road to make sure vehicles did not get too close to the drains .
As this latest table posted by Edward Harrison shows , California is no longer the US state most likely default .
That would be the home state of Obama and Rahm Emanuel , Illinois .

The team over at Terrafugia , the company developing the Transition Roadable Aircraft ( aka the Flying Car ) has been given permission to gain some extra pounds .
The company has been working hard to overcome the persistent issue of how to build a safe enough car , that can still be light enough to compete with the other aircraft in its class .
But the ambitious design still came in too heavy to qualify as a Light Sport Aircraft .
The Federal Aviation Administration provided a little help to the company by issuing a maximum takeoff weight exemption specifically for the new design .
Now Terrafugia can add some automotive safety features such as airbags , crumple zones and a safety cage , and still qualify as a Light Sport Aircraft .
The LSA designation is important because it opens the market up to a wider swath of potential customers thanks the simplified requirements needed to receive an LSA pilot 's license .
Terrafugia says the exemption will allow them to be in compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards , something most of its LSA competitors do n't have to worry about .
The FAA has granted the company an extra 110 pounds to the LSA limit of 1,320 pounds maximum takeoff weight .
Terrafugia says this will allow the extra safety equipment and a still allow the airplane to compete with other LSA aircraft in terms of range and the amount of payload it can carry .
The company successfully completed flight and drive testing of the proof of concept version of its roadable aircraft last year .
The innovative design has foldable wings that allow the owner to drive to the airport , and in less than a minute , convert the car into an airplane .
Flying cars are nothing new , but the Transition is easily the most practical version of the idea so far .
The company claims the airplane will cruise at a speed of 115 miles per hour and a range of more than 450 miles .
On the road , the two place , front wheel drive vehicle achieves a respectable 30 miles per gallon .
Terrafugia says it will unveil the design of the production version of the Transition in Oshkosh in late July .
It still hopes to deliver the first customer versions in late 2011 .
Autopia will be at EAA Airventure again this year and will provide updates from Terrafugia and any of the other flying car developers hoping to fulfill the Jetson like dream of an airplane in every garage .

The so - called love hormone , oxytocin , may spur both self - sacrifice and defensive aggression among warriors .
Here , U.S. Marines fight together in the TV miniseries " The Pacific . "
A brain hormone that fosters fuzzy feelings between mothers and children may also goad soldiers to launch preemptive strikes in defense of their comrades , according to new research .
Oxytocin has received much attention for boosting social bonding and cooperation , but it also appears to trigger defensive aggression against outsiders who might threaten an individual 's social group , psychologists say .
That indicates the hormone has a much more complex role in social dynamics than just encouraging humans to make love and not war .
" Our study shows that oxytocin not only plays a role in modulating cooperation and benevolence , but also in driving aggression , " said Carsten De Dreu , a social psychologist at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands .
De Dreu took special interest in parochial altruism , in which people self - sacrifice for the sake of their group or defensively hurt competing groups .
He and his colleagues have now fingered oxytocin as a likely neurobiological mechanism that drives how humans regulate intergroup conflict .
Some animal studies had shown that oxytocin encourages protectionist behavior , but this marks the first study to illustrate a similar effect in humans .
De Dreu and his colleagues had reasoned that this " dark side " of cooperation makes sense from an adaptive , evolutionary perspective of competing groups .
" We were interested in seeing where oxytocin's ' niceness ' breaks down , " De Dreu told LiveScience .
Fearing the worst
To study the dark side of oxytocin , the Dutch researchers ran three experiments based on financial games that represented variations on the classic prisoner 's dilemma scenario .
The games pitted self - interest against the overall interest of each three - person group , and also added the possibility of hurting a competing three - person group .
Individuals could either keep a certain sum of money or put it into a group pool in which the individual got less but the whole group benefited more .
Male volunteers who took a whiff of oxytocin through a nasal spray tended to act more in the interests of the group ( sharing their money ) rather than selfishly , unsurprisingly .
They also tended to make choices that benefited their group but did not hurt outsiders during the first experiment .
The second experiment showed that oxytocin affected people regardless of their natural tendencies to cooperate .
But the real twist came during the third experiment involving 79 males , who took either oxytocin or a placebo .
Rather than having a certain amount of money to spend , the group decision - makers simply chose whether to cooperate or not cooperate with an outsider group .
That choice led to four possible outcomes , depending on what the outsider group also chose .
The two groups received a moderate reward if they both cooperated and a lesser reward if they both chose to not cooperate .
But if an outsider group chose to not cooperate , the in - group was better off also not cooperating .
Cooperating with outsiders who had chosen not to cooperate led to the worst - case scenario .
Decision - makers under the influence of oxytocin acted protectively by not cooperating with an opposing group , as researchers had predicted .
Such noncooperation in the third experiment was considered a preemptive strike or defensive aggression , because the group acted to protect itself against possible harm from the outsiders .
The third experiment also showed that oxytocin encouraged defensive aggression against outsider groups when there was greater fear of such groups , De Dreu explained .
Researchers manipulated the fear factor by increasing the financial hurt that outsiders could inflict upon a group .
Similarly , the third experiment also tested the greed factor by giving the in - group more rewards if it acted competitively against outsiders .
But the results showed that oxytocin did not encourage such offensive aggression , in which a group would " hurt " another group without having been provoked , aimed only at winning more rewards .
Not all love and peace
Researchers cautioned that the findings only apply to males so far , given that no females participated in the experiments .
But the results may have relevance to understanding male - dominated conflicts , ranging from prehistoric hunter - gatherer skirmishes to .
" The most important practical implication is that we should stop treating oxytocin as a panacea for distrust and conflict , " De Dreu pointed out .
In other words , giving oxytocin to everyone in the world wo n't necessarily usher in a new era of peace and prosperity .
It might even spur more paranoia and conflict between different groups or nations .
" Giving soldiers oxytocin might make them more cooperative towards their comrades , even willing to self - sacrifice , " De Dreu said .
" But it should [ also ] make them more likely to launch a preemptive strike against the competing army , with conflict - escalation being the most likely consequence . "
Next up , De Dreu and his colleagues have begun studying whether oxytocin enhances motivations to protect the group , protect the individual within the group , or more broadly to protect the weak and vulnerable .
The study will be published in the June 10 issue of the journal Science .

Next time your brain plays tricks on you , you have an excuse : according to new research by UCL scientists published today in the journal Nature , the brain is intrinsically unreliable .
This may not seem surprising to most of us , but it has puzzled neuroscientists for decades .
Given that the brain is the most powerful computing device known , how can it perform so well even though the behaviour of its circuits is variable ?
A long - standing hypothesis is that the brain 's circuitry actually is reliable - and the apparently high variability is because your brain is engaged in many tasks simultaneously , which affect each other .
It is this hypothesis that the researchers at UCL tested directly .
The team - a collaboration between experimentalists at the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and a theorist , Peter Latham , at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit - took inspiration from the celebrated butterfly effect - from the fact that the flap of a butterfly 's wings in Brazil could set off a tornado in Texas .
Their idea was to introduce a small perturbation into the brain , the neural equivalent of butterfly wings , and ask what would happen to the activity in the circuit .
Would the perturbation grow and have a knock - on effect , thus affecting the rest of the brain , or immediately die out ?
It turned out to have a huge knock - on effect .
The perturbation was a single extra ' spike ' , or nerve impulse , introduced to a single neuron in the brain of a rat .
That single extra spike caused about thirty new extra spikes in nearby neurons in the brain , most of which caused another thirty extra spikes , and so on .
This may not seem like much , given that the brain produces millions of spikes every second .
However , the researchers estimated that eventually , that one extra spike affected millions of neurons in the brain .
" This result indicates that the variability we see in the brain may actually be due to noise , and represents a fundamental feature of normal brain function , " said lead author Dr. Mickey London , of the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research , UCL .
This rapid amplification of spikes means that the brain is extremely ' noisy ' - much , much noisier than computers .
Nevertheless , the brain can perform very complicated tasks with enormous speed and accuracy , far faster and more accurately than the most powerful computer ever built ( and likely to be built in the foreseeable future ) .
The UCL researchers suggest that for the brain to perform so well in the face of high levels of noise , it must be using a strategy called a rate code .
In a rate code , neurons consider the activity of an ensemble of many neurons , and ignore the individual variability , or noise , produced by each of them .
So now we know that the brain is truly noisy , but we still do n't know why .
The UCL researchers suggest that one possibility is that it's the price the brain pays for high connectivity among neurons ( each neuron connects to about 10,000 others , resulting in over 8 million kilometres of wiring in the human brain ) .
Presumably , that high connectivity is at least in part responsible for the brain 's computational power .
However , as the research shows , the higher the connectivity , the noisier the brain .
Therefore , while noise may not be a useful feature , it is at least a by - product of a useful feature .

On the Gulf of Mexico ( CNN ) --
Ten miles off the coast of Louisiana , where the air tastes like gasoline and the ocean looks like brownie batter , Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton leans out of a fishing boat and dunks a small jar beneath the surface of the oil - covered water .
" God , what a mess , " he says under his breath , scooping up a canister of the oil that 's been spilled into the Gulf of Mexico .
Even though Overton has been studying oil spills for 30 years , he 's not sure what he 'll find in that sample .
That 's because , just below the surface , the scope and impact of one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of the U.S. remains a mystery .
And that terrifies some scientists .
It 's been five weeks since an oil rig exploded and sank , rupturing a pipeline 5,000 feet beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico .
Some clues about what so much oil -- perhaps 22 million gallons of it -- will do to the environment have become obvious :
Dolphins have washed up dead .
Endangered sea turtles have been found with oil stuck on their corneas .
Lifeless brown pelicans , classified as endangered until recently , have been carried away in plastic bags .
Beaches in Grand Isle , Louisiana , are spattered with gobs of sticky crude .
And when the moon rises over the coast there , the oil - soaked ocean sparkles like cellophane under a spotlight .
But what 's really going on in the depths of the ocean and in the all - important root systems of coastal marshes may prove to have more impact in the long term , and scientists know much less about what 's happening in these invisible reaches of the Gulf ecosystem .
As one oceanographer put it , a Chernobyl - sized catastrophe could be brewing under the sea .
Or the environment here may be dodging a huge bullet .
" It 's kind of like falling out a window , " Overton said of the confusion .
" We do n't know how hard that ground is gonna be until we hit bottom .
We do n't know if we 're going to land in soft shrubs and live -- or if we 're going to hit a rock . "
If scientists ' worst fears are realized , the oil plume in the Gulf could choke off and kill coastal marshes in the productive Mississippi Delta and barrier islands , turning these verdant tufts of life -- which look like hairy putting greens floating out on the water -- into open ocean .
That would snap the region 's marine food chain , exposing and starving all kinds of organisms .
Overton said the impacts of such an occurrence would last for a century .
Opinion :
What if carbon dioxide were as black as oil ?
Equally frightening , the oil also could spawn a massive oxygen - free " dead zone " deep in the Gulf 's waters , which would suffocate all marine life on the ocean floor .
Samantha Joye , an oceanographer at the University of Georgia , said that if that happens , the dead zone could change marine chemistry in the Gulf of Mexico forever .
" I think it 's sort of out of sight , out of mind , " she said of the deep - water impacts .
Whether either of those scenarios comes to pass depends on what 's taking place beneath the surface of the water .
Scientists now are scrambling to understand what 's going on .
Joye recently embarked on a two - week mission to take water samples at the bottom of the ocean .
Researchers know almost nothing about what the oil and chemical dispersants used to try to break up the oil will have on life below the Gulf 's greasy surface , Joye said on her boat in Gulfport , Mississippi , just before heading out toward the epicenter of the spill .
" I do n't think we know what 's going on yet , and it 's a month into this thing , " she said .
Bacteria eat oil and in the process also chew oxygen out of the ocean .
There 's so much oil in the water , the bacteria may deplete oxygen reserves until deep - water fish like grouper and snapper and " benthic " communities of sea tubes and oysters suffocate , she said .
Joye will be dropping a huge testing kit -- it's as tall as a person and looks like a stick of dynamite -- several hundred feet into the oil plume to see what 's happening .
Initial tests show that the bacteria are depleting oxygen levels , she said .
And if the ecosystem at the bottom of the ocean goes , commercially important fish and crustaceans on the surface probably will feel the effects , too , she said .
" It 's hard for me to imagine anything worse , honestly , " she said of the Gulf oil spill .
" It 's going to dramatically alter the system . "
The roots of the Gulf coast 's marshes , also hidden from view , are another focus for scientists .
Much public attention has been paid to the migratory birds that nest on the marshes and to the shrimp and fish that use their tangled roots as a nursery , hiding their vulnerable young from bigger fish that swim in open waters .
But the marsh grasses themselves and the less - sexy microorganisms that are the basis for the marsh food chain are easily suffocated and killed if exposed to oil , said Roger Helm , a marine ecologist and chief of the environmental quality department at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
Meanwhile , these unseen " little guys " -- the plankton , diatoms and the like -- " are the basis for everything that 's going on out there , " he said .
" How this is going to affect the food web long - term , it 's a great toxicological experiment , " he said .
There are several reasons for the widespread scientific confusion .
Perhaps the best is that nothing like the Gulf oil spill has ever happened before .
Many have compared it to the 1989 disaster in which the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled oil off the coast of Alaska .
About 260,000 barrels -- a smaller amount than what 's gone into the Gulf -- were released into the environment in that case , and it happened rather quickly .
The Gulf spill has dragged on over weeks and has n't stopped .
A better comparison , some scientists say , is the IXTOC I oil well disaster in Mexico in 1979 .
But , in that case , little research was done to understand the spill 's impact on the Gulf of Mexico , Overton said .
So there is no real - world scientific precedent that could be used to understand what 's happening now .
BP , the company that was leasing the offshore oil rig that exploded and sank April 20 , is handling the environmental cleanup .
It 's doing so in a way that adds further question marks to the environmental situation .
BP has released more than 28,000 gallons of chemicals on the ocean , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , in hopes these " dispersants " will break up the oil and minimize its impact on the environment .
Such a huge amount of dispersant has never been released deep into the ocean before , according to the EPA , and some independent researchers and the EPA have questioned whether those chemicals may be making matters worse .
The EPA 's chief , Lisa Jackson , recently told National Public Radio's " All Things Considered " that the agency is doing " science on the fly " to try to understand what 's happening .
Other efforts to mitigate the environmental disaster are equally complicated .
Workers have put plastic booms , which look like elongated strings of childhood floaties , around select barrier islands in hopes of keeping the oil off brown pelican nesting grounds and sensitive marshes .
On a recent National Wildlife Federation tour of Barataria Bay , off the Louisiana coast , at least one boom was broken , and another was caked in oil .
The scope of the contamination is daunting .
More than 100 miles of Louisiana coast have been hit by the oil , according to CNN reports .
Cleaning up that huge mess along the coast -- which continues to grow -- may prove to be a near - impossible task , said Maura Wood , a senior manager for the National Wildlife Federation 's coastal restoration program .
Each clean - up option comes with drawbacks , she said , but she remains hopeful that scientists will be able to figure out a way to tackle the problem .
Other scientists are upset that more research was n't done in advance to understand the environmental impacts of a deep - water spill like this one before it happened .
" It just irritates the piss out of me that we were not prepared for a situation like this and did n't have studies on these issues , " said Overton , the LSU professor , adding that he and other scientists " should have raised more hell " about the lack of information about oil - spill response methods and about the marshes themselves .
He said the government should " siphon " a small amount of oil company revenues and put the money into more research about what happens to the environment after a major oil spill .
As Overton rode a fishing boat back to the Louisiana coast on a recent rainy morning , chocolate water spewing from its wake , he said there may be a faint silver lining in an otherwise dire situation .
Perhaps scientists will learn from this oil spill , he said .
And maybe they 'll learn enough that they can do better next time .
The university hopes to build a series of buildings for science , business and the arts over the course of several decades on the site near the Hudson River , where the streets are lined with warehouses , factories and auto repair shops .
Columbia has already acquired the bulk of the land it needs , but the owners of four warehouses and two gas stations refused to sell and sued to stop the taking of their property .
There are also seven tenements in the area , which are not subject to condemnation , but Columbia hopes to move the tenants to comparable apartments elsewhere .
Norman Siegel , who represented the losing property owners , said he was still reviewing the decision .
“ We ’re extremely disappointed , ” he said .
Mr. Siegel had hoped that the lower court decision would serve as a roadmap for others hoping to oppose the state ’s use of eminent - domain powers .
Nicholas Sprayregen , the owner of the four warehouses who had refused to sell to Columbia , could not be reached for comment .

The ruling cited a decision in a similar eminent - domain case last year involving the Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn , where the state was condemning property on behalf of a developer who planned to build a basketball arena for the Nets and up to 6,000 apartments .
“ We ruled for Atlantic Yards , and if we could rule in favor of a basketball arena , surely we could rule for a nonprofit university , ” the court said Thursday in its decision , which was written by Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick .

" I can tell you where to go because I am employed to keep this beach safe , " a private guard said , even though the beach is public .
And last month , according to the New Orleans ' Times - Picayune , a man identifying himself as a BP contractor told a private charter pilot that he could n't fly a reporter over the restricted spill area .
" No media or press on any planes , " the charter 's owner said he was told .
BP maintains these are anomalies .
But every such attempt deepens the impression that BP , having caused the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history , is trying to manipulate what the public sees about it .
On one level , it 's tempting to believe BP 's denials simply because trying to hide embarrassing acts is so obviously futile when a company is caught in a spotlight this bright .
What the news media do n't find , government investigators and plaintiffs ' lawyers will .
Meanwhile , every attempt at secrecy raises suspicions .
But secrecy plainly has been part of the game plan since the disaster 's earliest days in April .
Although BP made feeds from itsunderwater cameras available to the government , it initially failed to open them to the public .
The world did n't get its first glimpse of the gushing oil until late May , after Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass. , demanded that BP make the feed public .
Scientists quickly recognized that BP was low - balling the spill rate .
In another controlling move , when BP signed up U.S. fishermen to help with the cleanup , the company 's contracts barred them from talking to the news media .
After much criticism , Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles proclaimed last week that BP would n't stop anyone from talking .
But if the incidents since then are any guide , many workers have n't gotten the word .
Just as outrageous have been the government 's controlling actions .
Some Coast Guard personnel claim to be enforcing a rule requiring a 500 - yard buffer — nearly a third of a mile — around any vessel involved in the cleanup , the Associated Press has complained .
At that distance , a camera can't document what 's going on and reporters can't conduct interviews .
Also , no private planes may fly below 3,000 feet for miles around the spill area — far too high to get meaningful photos .
Do a few news media flights really pose a safety risk ?
The bulk of coverage so far — and there has been a lot — has been by media " embedded " on government flights , which means the government controls what the reporters see .
That 's how wars are generally covered .
But this is not war , nor even a fast - moving disaster like Hurricane Katrina , where lives are at stake .
It 's tough to see why so many restrictions are necessary .
The public will be living with the effects of this catastrophe for many years .
Neither BP nor the government should be getting in the way of what the public sees as events unfold .
Having finally paid off the first installment of this bit , I ’ve finally managed to scrape together enough material for a second installment of :
I ’m so broke that …
I asked the Tea Party to refund my membership dues .
I could n’t pay full homage to the late Ronnie James Dio .
I ’m STILL saving up to file for bankruptcy .
I pawned one of my kidneys .
I ’ve considered emigrating to Mexico .
A Census worker counted me as .4 — which is less than half the man I used to be .
My accountant * fired me ( * Turbo Tax ) .
My wallet , after feeling empty and unfulfilled , ran off with my neighbor ’s coin purse .
I voted for change , thinking I was voting for literal change ( talk about shortchanging voters , eh ? ) .
I STILL owe myself an apology for actually posting this cents - less dribble .
Now ’s your chance , Dear Reader , to say something funny by adding your two cents ( no I Owe Yous , please ; I ’m broke enough as it is ) in the COMMENTS section below .

Calls had been rising within his Democratic Party for him to step aside before elections on July 11 that are seen as a referendum on the party ’s first year in power .

“ Unfortunately , the politics of the ruling party did not find reflection in the hearts of the people , ” Mr. Hatoyama told an emergency meeting of Democratic lawmakers , broadcast live on television .
“ It is regrettable that the people were gradually unwilling to listen to us . ”
Mr. Hatoyama is the fourth Japanese prime minister to resign in four years , which is likely to renew soul - searching about Japan ’s inability to produce an effective leader and to feed concerns that political paralysis is preventing Japan from reversing a nearly two - decade - long economic decline .
Mr. Hatoyama , who was teary - eyed as he announced his departure , was also following the common Japanese practice of leaders ’ resigning to take responsibility for failure .
His resignation will not force a change in government , because the Democrats still hold a commanding majority in Parliament ’s Lower House , which chooses the prime minister .
But it will be a damaging blow to a party that had taken power in a landslide election victory that ended more than a half - century of nearly unbroken one - party control .
Mr. Hatoyama took power with vows to challenge the bureaucracy ’s grip on postwar governing and revive Japan ’s economy .
Instead , his inexperienced government appeared to become consumed by the issue of the Okinawa base and a series of investigations into the political financing of Mr. Hatoyama and his backer in the party , Ichiro Ozawa .
Syracuse Crunch Selected to Help Kick off AHL's Historic 75th Anniversary Season
June 7 , 2010 - American Hockey League ( AHL ) - Syracuse Crunch News Release
Syracuse , NY ( June 7 , 2010 ) - The Syracuse Crunch announced today that they have been selected to help kick off the AHL 's historic 75th anniversary season .
The AHL's 75th anniversary season will commence on October 8 , 2010 with a special set of home - and - home series ' featuring the AHL 's six senior - most cities .
The Crunch will travel to Cleveland to take on the Lake Erie Monsters on October 8 , before opening their home schedule on Saturday , October 9 vs. Lake Erie at the War Memorial at Oncenter .
Each of the six teams will wear throwback uniforms , with the Crunch donning the sweaters of the Syracuse Stars , the league 's first - ever Calder Cup Champions .
The Crunch will unveil the throwback Stars uniform design in the upcoming weeks .
The other two home - and - home series ' will feature Providence vs. Springfield on October 8 and 9 and Hershey vs. Rochester on October 10 and 16 .
Syracuse , Providence , Springfield and Cleveland were among the league 's charter cities in 1936 , with Hershey coming aboard in 1938 and Rochester hitting the ice in 1956 .
The American Hockey League will be using special logos to observe its 75th anniversary throughout the coming year .
Designed by Derek Abraham of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment , the logos can be seen at theahl.com .
All team uniforms throughout the 2010 - 11 season will include the anniversary logo as a jersey patch and a helmet decal , and several teams during the year will wear special vintage theme jerseys celebrating the AHL 's 75th anniversary .
The 2011 AHL All - Star Classic will take place at the Giant Center in Hershey , Pennsylvania , on January 30 - 31 , and will mark a return to an East vs .
West format , pitting players from each of the AHL's two conferences against each other .
This will be the first East - West All - Star Game in the AHL since 1942 , and the 2011 event will feature the league 's All - Stars wearing authentic throwback sweaters .
A special line of 75th - anniversary merchandise will also be available at ahlstore.com beginning later this summer .
The American Hockey League was officially born in 1936 when the Canadian - American Hockey League and the International Hockey League merged to form the International - American Hockey League ( the " International " would be dropped from the league 's name in 1940 ) .
Since 2001 , the AHL has been the top development league for all 30 National Hockey League teams , with more than 85 percent of today 's NHL players having graduated from the American Hockey League .

Fears of new flashpoint as defiant Israel prepares for showdown with two more Gaza aid ships
Israeli ambassador to US compares Gaza attack to fight against Nazi Germany
This is n't America or Europe , it is the Middle East , where there is no mercy for the weak , says Israeli defence minister
Israel bows to world pressure and deports activists seized in botched raid
Israel is facing another potentially explosive confrontation at sea as pro-Palestinian activists sent two more boats to challenge its blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Reports in Israel claimed the navy was prepared to use even more force to stop ships from breaking the blockade .
A top commander told the Jerusalem Post yesterday : ‘ We boarded the ship and were attacked as if it was a war .
‘ That will mean that we will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war . ’
World condemnation :
An Israeli flag burns outside the embassy in Manila in the Philipines today as global anger over the attack on the Gaza aid convoy increased
Fury : Protesters shout slogans during an anti-Israeli protest in front of the Israeli embassy in Vienna , Austria today
Turkey - one of Israel 's closest Muslim allies until Monday 's clash left several of citizens dead - was last night reported to be considering sending a naval escort for the boats .
This would arrive in the region at the end of the week , creating a potential flashpoint for a major clash between the nations .
Today Israel bowed to world pressure and began deporting the activists it had seized in Monday 's botched raid .
The 42 Britons jailed in the attack are expected to arrive back in the UK today or tomorrow .
More than 100 Arab activists were have already been bussed over the border with Jordan today .
However Israel remained defiant about the raid , with the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. comparing it to America 's fight against Nazi Germany .
Speaking on Fox News yesterday , Michael Oren said the raid was ' perfectly legal , perfectly humane – and very responsible ' .

Homecoming : Palestinian aid flotilla attack survivor Hasan Nowarah is greeted by his children at Glasgow Airport after being deported from Israel today
Turkey 's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has called for Israel to be punished for its attack
' Israel acted in accord with international law , ' he continued .
' Any state has the right to protect itself , certainly from a terrorist threat such as Hamas , including on the open seas .
' The U.S. acted under similar international law when it fought the Germans and the Japanese in World War Two . '
Yesterday Turkish premier Tayyip Erdogan called for Israel to be punished for its attack on the flotilla on Monday and said ' nothing would ever be the same ' in relations between the two allies .
' Israel 's behaviour should definitely , definitely be punished .
No one should try to test Turkey 's patience , ' he said .
Greta Berlin , of the Free Gaza Movement , which organised the flotilla at the centre of Monday 's confrontation , said it would not be deterred by the Israeli action and that one of the two latest cargo ships was already off the coast of Italy en route for Gaza .
‘ We are an initiative to break Israel 's blockade of 1.5 million people in Gaza .
Our mission has not changed and this is not going to be the last flotilla , ' she added .
The MV Rachel Corrie , a converted merchant ship bought by pro-Palestinian activists and named after an American woman killed in the Gaza Strip in 2003 , set off yesterday from Malta , organisers said .
It was carrying medical equipment , wheelchairs , school supplies and cement , as well as 15 activists , including Northern Irish Nobel peace laureate Mairead Corrigan - Maguire and Denis Halliday , an Irish former senior UN diplomat .
Irish prime minister Brian Cowen described the vessel as Irish - owned and said it should be allowed to finish its mission .
The ship was carrying 15 activists including a northern Irish Nobel Peace laureate .
WHO WAS RACHEL CORRIE ?
Rachel Corrie was an American member of the International Solidarity Movement who was killed while protesting against Israel Defence Forces demolishing homes in the Gaza Strip .
The 23 - year - old volunteer travelled to Gaza during a gap year in 2003 during the Second Intifada where she and other demonstrators formed a human shield to prevent the destruction .
She was hit by a bulldozer while attempting to stop the IDF destroying the home of Palestinian Samir Nasrallah .
The IDF claimed the death was due to the restricted angle view of the D9 bulldozer driver .
Miss Corrie , from Olympia , Washington , was a student at The Evergreen State College and also worked as a volunteer with patients suffering mental disorders .
On March 14 , 2003 , during an interview with the Middle East Broadcasting network , Miss Corrie said : ‘ I feel like I 'm witnessing the systematic destruction of a people 's ability to survive .
' Sometimes I sit down to dinner with people and I realise there is a massive military machine surrounding us , trying to kill the people I 'm having dinner with . ’
‘ The government has formally requested the Israeli government to allow the Irish - owned ship ... to be allowed to complete its journey unimpeded and discharge its humanitarian cargo in Gaza , ’ he told parliament in Dublin .
An Israeli marine lieutenant , who was not identified , told Israel 's Army Radio his unit was prepared to block the ship .
‘ We as a unit are studying , and we will carry out professional investigations to reach conclusions , ’ the lieutenant said , referring to Monday 's confrontation in which his unit shot nine activists aboard a Turkish ferry .
‘ And we will also be ready for the Rachel Corrie , ’ he added .
Israel 's Army Radio reported that the ship would reach Gazan waters by Wednesday , but activist Berlin said it might not attempt to reach Gaza until early next week .
‘ We will probably not send her till ( next ) Monday or Tuesday , ’ she said of the 1,200 - tonne cargo ship .
A second boat carrying about three dozen passengers is expected to join it , Miss Berlin said , adding : ' This initiative is not going to stop .
' We think eventually Israel will get some kind of common sense .
They 're going to have to stop the blockade of Gaza , and one of the ways to do this is for us to continue to send the boats . '
Israeli officials said it was studying the lessons from the Monday 's clashes and would be prepared to turn back any further challengers to its blockade .
The flotilla was the ninth seaborne attempt to breach the blockade that Israel and Egypt imposed after the militant Hamas group violently seized the territory in 2007 .
Israel allowed five seaborne aid shipments to get through but slammed the blockade shut after its 2009 war in Gaza .
Israel says it is is needed to prevent the Iranian - backed Hamas , which has fired thousands of rockets into the Jewish state , from building up its arsenal .
It also wants to put pressure Hamas to free an Israeli soldier it has held for four years .
Critics say the blockade has failed to weaken Hamas but further strapped an already impoverished economy .
Egypt broke ranks with Israel yesterday and said it was opening its border with the strip for several days to allow in aid .
The governor of Egyptian 's northern Sinai district said it was a gesture meant to ' alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers after the Israeli attack ' .
Route : MV Rachel Corrie set off from Malta heading for Gaza
Defence minist er Ehud Barak , who visited the Shayetet 13 base in Atlit on Wednesday , praised the commandos who participated in the deadly raid on the Gaza - bound aid flotilla .
' You carried out the mission and prevented the flotilla from reaching Gaza , ' Barak said according to Haaretz.com .
' We need to always remember that we are n't North America or Western Europe , we live in the Middle East , in a place where there is no mercy for the weak and there are n't second chances for those who do n't defend themselves .
This is a true - color image from the part of the Hubble Ultra - Deep Field .
It has allowed researchers to identify a new population of the most - distant known galaxies ( white circles ) present when the universe was less than 800 million years old .
These galaxies may be responsible for ionizing intergalactic gas early in the universe 's history .
Researchersare building a better picture ofone of the most important changes in the early universe a process thatlifted the cosmic fog from the dark , early universe .
Anew study of observations by the HubbleSpace Telescope has revealed that the earliest known galaxies , presentsome 800 million years after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago , may haveemittedenough ultraviolet light to strip electrons from ( or ionize ) thehydrogen gasbetween galaxies .
Beforethis so - called re-ionizationof the universe , hydrogen gas absorbed light just like fog ona dark road , limiting the distance over which the earliest galaxies could have beenobserved .
[ Hubble photo of the ancient galaxies ]
Earlyuniverse unveiled
Foryears , researchers have believed that asthese galaxies coalesced into larger and larger structures .
Theirsubsequentultraviolet glows ionized hydrogen in bubbles around them , which grewandeventually overlapped until essentially all the intergalactic mediumwasionized and transparent .
Butresearchers were less sure about thetiming .
" Thathas been the outstandingquestion , " Brant Robertson of the California Institute of Technology inPasadena , Calif. , told SPACE.com .
" At what point in time do galaxiesproduce enough of these ionizing photons to keep the electrons andprotons inthe universe unbound ? "
Darkages of the universe
Althoughthe universe actually began in anionized state following the BigBang , this first period of ionization lasted for only about300,000 years , until electrons and protons cooled enough to form hydrogen atoms .
( Thishydrogen formation generated photons that we know today as the cosmicmicrowavebackground . )
Whatfollowed was a period known as thecosmic Dark Ages , during which the universe 's vast clouds of cloudhydrogenslowly condensed to form the first galaxies .
From studies of neutralhydrogendetected in the light from distant quasars , astronomers knew thatre - ionizationmust have been complete by about a billion years after the Big Bang .
" Thething that 's changed recently isthe installation of the new camera on Hubble , " Robertson said .
Hubble 'sWide Field Camera 3 , in operation since May 2009 , has allowedastronomersto pinpoint the infrared signatures of more than 50 galaxies that dateto 800 million years after the Big Bang .
Theresearch is detailed in the Nov. 4 issueof the journal Nature .
Explaining the cosmic fog 's lifting
Bydetermining whether these ancientgalaxies released sufficient ultraviolet light to re-ionizethe universe ' sintergalactic hydrogen , researchers could rule out other possibleexplanationsfor re-ionization , such as radiation from matter falling into massivegalacticblack holes , or the annihilation of hypothetical dark matter particles .
Intheir new analysis , Robertson and hiscolleagues first used the recent Hubble data to estimate the totalnumber ofancient galaxies .
Then they took information about the color of lightfromthose galaxies to estimate the sizes and intensities of the starscontained inthem , which yielded the number of ultraviolet photons generated by eachgalaxy .
Finally , based on data for closer galaxies , the researchers estimated that some 10 to 20 percent of thoseultravioletphotons would have made it out of their galaxies to re-ionizeintergalactichydrogen .
Theresults suggest there were likely enoughultraviolet photons to re-ionize the universe in the first 800 millionyears ofcosmic time , although uncertainties remain .
Robertsonsaid one of the major uncertaintiesin their calculation was the number of early galaxies , which currentlydependson Hubble 's surveys of a small section of sky .
Butas Hubble collects data over a widerportion of the sky , that uncertainty will decrease .
" It 'sa very exciting time , " Robertson said .
" In the next couple of years we 'll be able to know ifthere are enough galaxies to re-ionize the universe . "
Let 'em cry ( or drop to the floor ) at the grocery store
Tanya Hefets
To all of you mothers out there who manage their children 's behaviors effectively , despite the crying or tantrum that might ensue , I applaud you .
It ’s a rather infrequent occasion that I come across a mother who despite knowing her inevitable fate , will effectively manage her child ’s behavior , in hope that each and every little step will make a big difference in the life of her child .
So when the rare occurrence of a mother pulling out a token board , PECS book , or schedule at the grocery store takes me by surprise , I make sure to tell her that despite the way the situation appears to everyone else , she is my hero .
It still shocks me that even with the incidence of autism rapidly increasing and all of the press surrounding the disease , the general public still remains so unaware of the difficulties a child with autism faces .
My first tip is simple ; do n’t allow yourself to perceive negative energy from others .
Otherwise known as : do n’t bother yourself with what other people think .
Taking the time to correct a behavior , practice communication skills , and / or encourage your child ’s growth is not solely limited to the confines of your own home .
Make a point to take your child on one errand each day .
Equip yourself with any token boards , communication systems , and / or schedules you may need to enable your child to benefit from community outings .
Set a goal with your child ; if your child attains all tokens on his or her board by behaving appropriately while on an outing , reward your child immediately following the outing .
Encourage your child to use language functionally and interact while out in the community .
For example , if your outing consists of picking up a prescription at the local drug store , have your child tell the pharmacist your last name and pay for the prescription .
The first few times running an errand may require a lot of facilitation and coaxing , but equipping your child with functional lifelong skills could never be matched .
And what happens if the trip does not go as planned and your child requires facilitation to cooperate ?
When debating whether to correct a behavior or encourage the use of communication while in public , despite the glances and whispers that might plague you , think of this : would you rather instill critical lifelong skills or succumb to the ignorance of people foreign to the disease ?
My second tip is to simplify your ( and your child ’s ) life through the use of a ( visual ) schedule .
Schedules not only provide children with visual cues on upcoming tasks / events , but allow them to functionally prepare themselves for what lies ahead .
Think of it as your child ’s calendar or Blackberry .
I know that I am not the only one who would be lost without my calendar .
Encourage your child to create a schedule with you ; by doing this , you are enabling your child to become an active decision maker ( while you control the options ) .
Start out by giving your child a choice between two options and expand from there .
Use language your child can understand ; for example , some children benefit from using simple terms ( e.g. , first bath , then bed ) , while others benefit from language containing more linguistic information ( e.g. first we are going to take a bath and get all clean , then we will go lay down in bed ) .
Have the schedule displayed in a place that is easily accessible to your child .
My third tip comes from my passion for speech and language and the development of communication skills .
Require your child to use language at all times throughout the day .
I maintain a firm belief that language learning should not be a frustrating and overwhelming process .
For many children with autism , communication proves to be the most difficult and frustrating process to acquire and maintain .
This upsets me greatly and has been the foundation for most of the work I do today .
Approaching language comprehension and use lightly and functionally goes a long way .
Try not to demand language from your child as much as encourage it .
A great way to encourage language use is through requesting or “ manding ” .
For instance , if your child ’s favorite activity is drawing , withhold desired objects until your child requests the objects appropriately ( whether through the use of PECS , verbal communication , or sign ) .
Facilitating such language use is encouraged ( e.g. , I know you want to draw .
Tell me what you need . )
This may also be further expanded upon to provide your child with necessary support ( You want a marker to draw ; I have a marker . ) .
If your child responds with “ I want marker ” , “ marker ” , or “ I need marker ” the communicative need was met successfully .
If your child proceeds to request an undesired object ( “ I want trampoline ” ) the communicative need was not successfully met and the desired object should not be given .
Proceed to prompt your child to request the desired object and then reward them naturally by following through with the request .
I often use phrases such as , “ I love how you asked for the marker ! ” “ I am so proud of you ! ” “ Here ’s the black marker . ”
Other situations that lend themselves nicely to successful communication include routine events ( getting dressed , packing bags ) , activities of daily living ( taking a bath , brushing teeth ) , and activities with multiple steps ( cooking , cleaning ) .
If your child is learning about body parts in school , make use of bath time and talk about all of the body parts that are getting wet / washed .
You may also choose to play a few extra games of Simon Says or sing a few extra verses of Head Shoulders Knees and Toes .
Opportunities for communication are endless ; explore , facilitate , and conquer your child ’s communicative intent .
My fourth tip comes from all of the professionals and paraprofessionals who discourage children from speaking about desires at inappropriate lengths .
Do n’t get me wrong , I still get great use of the phrase , “ We ’re not talking about that right now ” during therapy sessions when a client brings up superman in the middle of a cooking exercise .
I have learned , however , to incorporate superman during appropriate opportunities more frequently and have continually encountered success while using children ’s desires to my advantage while facilitating language .
My advice to you is to expand on your child ’s desires during appropriate times .
For example , while getting dressed , you may say to your child “ Superman wears a suit and a cape .
It ’s red and blue . ”
What are you wearing today ?
Do you have on the same colors as superman ?
Children naturally speak more readily and easily about things pertaining to them and of interest to them .
Why not encourage your child to speak about the superman in his or her life while creating opportunities for successful communication / learning .
My fifth and final tip is derived from the many wonderful parents I have had the pleasure of guiding and working with .
Take advantage of the knowledge , experience , and guidance the professionals in your child ’s life can provide you with .
Do n’t be afraid to ask many questions and request assistance when needed .
The professionals that work with your children have a wealth of knowledge and would be happy to help your child in any way possible .
And I leave you with this :
On my next visit to the grocery store , I hope to see you and your child shopping together , earning tokens , and disregarding any onlookers .

Disturbing new questions have been raised about the role of doctors and other medical professionals in helping the Central Intelligence Agency subject terrorism suspects to harsh treatment , abuse and torture .
The Red Cross previously documented , from interviews with “ high - value ” prisoners , that medical personnel helped facilitate abuses in the C.I.A. ’s “ enhanced interrogation program ” during the Bush administration .
Now Physicians for Human Rights has suggested that the medical professionals may also have violated national and international laws setting limits on what research can be performed on humans .
The physicians ’ group , which is based in Cambridge , Mass. , analyzed a wide range of previously released government documents and reports , many of them heavily censored .
It found that the Bush administration used medical personnel — including doctors , psychologists and physician assistants — to help justify acts that had long been classified by law and treaty as illegal or unethical and to redefine them as safe , legal and effective when used on terrorism suspects .
The group ’s report focused particularly on a few issues where medical personnel played an important role — determining how far a harsh interrogation could go , providing legal cover against prosecution and designing future interrogation procedures .
The actual monitoring data are not publicly available , but the group was able to deduce from the guidelines governing the program what role the health professionals played , assuming they followed the rules .
Home > Unused > Vesak Thailand : Thai Buddhists celebrate Vesak and seek solutions to political and social crisis Asia News , May 25 , 2010 Thailand is still shaken from weeks of tension and violence that have sown death and destruction .
The theme of 2010 , organized in collaboration with the Japanese , focusing on Buddhist " prospects " in world economy .
Prayers , meditations and torchlight processions for peace in the country .
Bangkok , Thailand --
The festival of Vesak - which celebrates the birth , enlightenment and death of Bhudda - is a moment of reflection , prayer and blessing for Thailand , shaken by a political and social crisis in recent weeks that has sown death and destruction .
It is proposed as a starting point for addressing the challenges of Thai society , in search of peace and solidarity , and nations around the world , who must overcome an economic crisis unprecedented in recent history .
Japan has collaborated with Thailand in the organization of the 7th Conference for the feast of Vesak , an event sponsored by the United Nations which has declared the land of the elephants ' world centre of Buddhism .
" The festival takes place May 23 to 25 and the central theme is focused on the economy , starting with the slogan " Global Recovery : The Buddhist Perspective ” . "
Prince Vajiralongkorn and his wife , Princess Srirasami presided over the inaugural ceremony of the conference which was attended by Somdet Phra Buddhachaya - Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand – together with 400 Buddhist patriarchs from around the world and 1,300 Buddhist leaders representing 1300 nations .
Phra Dharmakosajarn , rector of Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University ( MCU ) , stresses that the Buddhist Patriarchate and monks agree on the need for chants and meditations to " invoke the blessing of the King " and " to wish a speedy recovery of the country " suffering from a severe social and political crisis .
For this very reason today in Buhhaamontol in the province of Nakhon Pathom , a prayer common was held at 5 pm followed by a torch - lit procession .
Enshin Saito , one of the most distinguished speakers and a university professor in Japan , analyzes the contribution of Buddhist education from an economic and financial point of view .
He also recalled the visit of John Paul II to Japan in 1981 , during which the Pope quoted the words of Saicho , founder of Japanese Tendai Buddhism , that " to forget oneself and work for the good of others is the culmination of compassion " .
Saito says that we must " be able to accept adverse events or unforeseen difficulties " , without others having to assume the consequences .
General Anupong Paojinda ,
Thai army commander , stressed that " the Dharma of Buddha is the is the priceless philosophy to keep our heart and mind to doing good , forgiveness and morality " and it is beneficial both for the individual and “ society as a whole ” .
The leader of the Chinese Buddhists - Phra Mahaganacharayacheen Dharmasamadhivatra - points the finger at the " contradictions between peoples ” and “ problems relating to natural resources that occur throughout the world , caused by a " division between men's minds and the Dharma ” .
About 90 % of 62.2 million
Thais practice Theravada Buddhism , brought to the nation from India around the third century before Christ .
This stream is based on the Pali Canon of Buddha 's teaching , known as the Tripitaka ( a type of bible of Buddhism ) .
This year , for Thailand , the festival of Vesak is celebrated today , May 25 .
My almost three - year - old decided our fish needed to be fed …
So , with that in mind , he dumped two * entire * containers of food into their tank this morning !
Oy !
Hopefully , the little guppies will survive .
Where was I when this was all happening ?
Well , I was still trying to clean up the mango smoothie that had been thrown all over our upstairs carpet .
These kiddos are keeping me on my toes !

Well the last time these two teams faced off the match was decided by the official , this time there will be a national audience and the teams that have won 3 of the last 4 MLS Cups face off on ESPN2 .
One team will be seeking revenge , the other is looking for a level of consistency , and one thing is almost certain about the matchup of RSL and Houston , controversy will be one of the themes of the day .
For RSL , they question the two PK calls given in minutes to Houston and then no calls going their way , so far this year 4 PK's have been issued against RSL , they have yet to have an official point to the spot in their favor .
Houston has been consistent over their last 6 matches , loss , win , loss , win , loss , win , it does n't matter if they are at home or on the road they have n't been able to string together results over the last month and RSL is hoping that trend will continue .
Both teams have suffered from and are now close to recovering from some impactful injuries , for Houston they are close to getting Ching back into their starting lineup ( just in time for a national team callup ) but they have a huge question mark next to Luis Angel Landin , who is suffering with concussion like symptoms .
Out for the Creamsicles are Cameron , Weaver , and Robinson , and they are still looking for replacements for the departed Holden and Clark .

Lake 's list is looking better than in recent weeks as we last week saw the return of Javier Morales to action , and this week do n't be surprised if Ned Grabavoy is on the bench and ready for action .
Fabi , Robbie , and Nelson are all listed as questionable but I expect that Robbie will likely get the start if he is able to go .
A win for RSL would move them into second place in the West behind the red hot Galaxy and only San Jose would be able to catch them over the weekend .
After the jump , my key matchups and wildcards for this match :
Key Matchups
Jamison Olave vs. Houston & MLS Officials :
In the two meetings between RSL and Houston last year , Olave was shown a red card in both matches .
This year he was twice called for fouls in the box and both were very , very soft as replays showed , but when you are 6 ' 3 " 210lbs and look like you could play linebacker in the NFL it is hard for MLS officials to understand that he is not only one of the fastest guys on the pitch , he is one of the most talented .
There is far too often an assumption of guilt when it comes to Olave , and far too often it is the wrong call .
Jamison will make mistakes , he is only super - human after all , but since the Chivas friendly late last year , he has played with a much better control of his emotions and it has helped his game .
So the question is will Houston look to push his buttons and try to get a reaction , will they dive and wiggle around like dead fish on any contact ?
I hope they play the game and I hope that head official Alex Prus will allow them to play .
He has been the head official in 162 matches , he issues an average of 3.3 yellow cards per match and has pointed to the penalty spot 47 times ( once every 3.45 matches ) , and he has issued 35 red cards ( once every 4.63 matches ) .
Here is hoping he calls it down the middle .
So in 8 matches Houston has been called for 84 fouls and issued 11 yellow cards and 2 red cards , for Real Salt Lake they have been called for 88 fouls , issued 14 yellow cards and have yet to be shown a red card .
If men are allowed to play a man 's game , well then we should see a very entertaining match , and hopefully the play on the pitch will decide the outcome .
Javier Morales vs. Lovel Palmer :
So this will be Javi 's second match back in the starting lineup and while you could see some " rust " on his performance , this week he will get to see a lot of Houston 's replacement for Ricardo Clark , Lovel Palmer .
After a couple trials Houston lured him away from Harbour View in Jamaica , the 25 year old is a talented player but I do n't think he will be able to deal with Javi .
When Morales is in his zone there are few defensive midfielders who can deal with him and if you watch the play of Palmer you see that he can be beat .
I believe that the new faces in new roles has been one of the main issues for Houston as they look to replace guys who were MLS All Stars and USMNT players .
Palmer will get some support , likely in the form of Richard Mulrooney , but the 33 year old simply is n't as quick as he used to be and the reality is that both will likely have their hands full with Javier .
Robbie Findley vs. expectations :
Well we saw it last year with Yura Movsisyan , he was the hot player at the end of the 2008 season and for the first couple months of 2009 he was distracted and pushing to get goals .
In time it came out that a part of his struggles could probably be blamed on the contract negotiations with RSL and MLS as his agent shopped him around Europe in search of a bigger paycheck .
Now we have the 2010 version of the story , same agent , and a similar story , Robbie was incredible down the stretch for RSL and in the playoffs last year .
So far this year he has n't found the back of the net , and now in the last couple days the stories about his agent , contract negotiations , and I am left to wonder if all of it could be again distracting Robbie .
Hopefully the last 24 hours have helped him clear his head a bit , a USMNT camp call up , the possibility of heading to South Africa to represent the US in the World Cup , and his statement that he has n't made up his mind about his future .
One thing is clear for Robbie , scoring a couple goals against Houston is exactly what the doctor ordered and could put a lot of things to rest .
Expectations are always hard to meet , and I for one thought that Robbie would have a much better season this year than he did in 2009 .
I am still holding firm to that belief , Robbie has everything it takes to be a big part of the future of Real Salt Lake , Major League Soccer , and the US National Team , but only time will tell the tale .
Wildcards
The Birdman of Houston :
Dominic Oduro has never scored a goal against RSL in a Houston uniform , but in 395 minutes of action before joining the men in orange he scored 3 goals against RSL .
His unique combination of speed , size and skill has caused issues for RSL in the past , and so far this year he has found the back of the net just once , but also helped with 3 assists , while being called for offsides 10 times .
RSL will need to ensure they mark him well and that communication is clear on any offside traps they may deploy .
The injury to Ching really forced Houston into a 4 - 5 - 1 formation , and while Ching is back healthy you have to wonder if they will risk him in a physical matchup with USMNT duty just days away .
With Landin being questionable and Weaver out , the man up top for Houston will be Oduro , but with the way both Borchers and Olave have been playing of late , they should be able to deal with him .
Fatigue Factor :
Houston will be playing their 4th match in 13 days when they take the pitch on Thursday night , while their travel schedule has n't been as bad , just 2 of their first 7 were on the road .
They have now played their 3rd road match of the year and they are 1 - 1 - 1 away from Robertson Stadium , with 3 goals scored and 3 allowed .
You have to wonder if the three changes they made to their lineup against Chivas were adjustments to the busy schedule .
You never know what you will get with Dominic Kinnear , but against Chivas they got two early goals and then played a more defensive style .
We have seen that happen before in the 3 - 2 RSL loss at Houston last year , where two early goals and a red card allowed Houston to play a much slower style and protect their lead .
If they try that at Rio Tinto on Thursday , they might just find themselves in the same boat that Toronto did .
Then add in the elevation that will add even more fatigue to their already tired legs , there will be no mystery water breaks on Thursday evening as RSL will like push and push hard at Houston looking to wear them down and get some revenge for the April fool 's day match .
Pablo Power :
Last week RSL was forced to make a first half sub as Robbie Findley picked up an injury , in came Pablo Campos and he quickly reminded fans why he earned their respect last season .
A couple great runs , perhaps one of the best combination plays of the year with Alvaro Saborio , which resulted in the 3rd RSL goal .
A wonder chip shot chance that went just wide of goal after beating Chris Seitz .
Pablo joined RSL midway through the season last year and was able in just 400 minutes of action to get 2 goals and 3 assists , both of his goals were game winners for RSL .
Now with just 61 minutes of first team action in 2010 he already has an assist and several dangerous shots , you have to believe that Pablo will likely see some action against Houston where their backline size has always caused RSL issues , but at 6 ' 3 " Campos is a force to be dealt with on set pieces and in the run of play .
He has a great touch for a big guy and as we saw last Saturday , he can deliver a great ball into the area , creating scoring chances for his teammates .
Prediction :
These teams match up really well and while the results have n't often gone RSL's way the matches are alway intense ( 5 of the last 7 have had a red card issued ) , they are always close ( 21 goals for Houston , 17 for RSL in 13 matches ) .
Last year the teams matched up 3 times , a 1 - 1 draw in Houston on June 20th where RSL was down to 10 men for over 30 minutes , a 0 - 0 draw at Rio Tinto on August 15th where Houston was down to 10 men in the 36th minute and RSL dropped to 10 men in stoppage time of the first half . , and a 3 - 2 loss at Houston on Sept 19th in which RSL was down to 10 men in the 32nd minute , and Houston was down to 10 men for the final 8 minutes of the match .
The 2 - 1 Houston win this year was questionable to say the best , and at Rio Tinto there is a swagger and a confidence that RSL gains .
Houston is tired and their inconsistent efforts all year lead me to believe that RSL will walk out with a 3 - 2 win .

LEIGH SALES , PRESENTER : The Federal Government 's defending its commitment to mental health funding after the head of its advisory council resigned , accusing it of not taking the issue seriously .
In his resignation letter , Professor John Mendoza says the Rudd Government 's claiming credit for the increased investment in mental health , which was actually the work of the Howard Government .
Hamish Fitzsimmons reports .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS , REPORTER : On Thursday in Canberra , representatives from the mental health sector will present the Federal Government with a letter demanding funding for mental health be taken more seriously .
PATRICK MCGORRY , MELBOURNE UNI :
It starts off with a commitment to equity in funding and then goes through a series of more specific proposals for immediate investment and growth , and that 's what the Prime Minister has received and we 'll be more formally presenting that to the Government on Thursday .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS :
The sector 's feeling it 's come off second best in funding and it's been highlighted by the resignation of the chair of the Government 's peak advisory body on mental health .
John Mendoza believes mental health is not a serious issue for the Rudd Government and has resigned in disgust .
JOHN MENDOZA , FMR CHAIR , MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY COUNCIL :
We were set up as an advisory council by the Rudd Government .
It was a pre-election commitment .
It was very much as a consequence of the recognition that the policy directions in mental health were not working and that this government was gonna take a different course and it was gonna take a more assertive response , greater leadership role at the national level .
Well that simply has n't happened .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS :
Other members of the advisory council say the body is now going to have to rethink its role without a leader like John Mendoza and the limited remaining mandate for the council .
DAVID CROSBIE , CEO , MENTAL HEALTH COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA :
At the moment it 's difficult to see how in the lead - up to an election we can appoint somebody given that the current appointment of the council ends in the next six months or so .
So I think the council 's in a bit of a hiatus at the moment .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS :
Over the next four years the Federal Government has allocated mental health $ 168 million out of $ 7.4 billion in health funding .
That 's not enough to solve the problems and frustrations for those in the sector , say its representatives .
DAVID CROSBIE :
The frustration comes from hearing these stories over and over again of people becoming desperate , taking their partners or their children , trying to get in through a hospital emergency department and being turned away and their experiences being so negative , and I think that drives a level of frustration , even a level of anger in the mental health sector .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS : In Federal Parliament , the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to answer questions about Professor Mendoza 's resignation .
KEVIN RUDD , PRIME MINISTER :
In the most recent Budget the Government made a $ 175 investment on the important reforms needed in mental health .
These will in part deliver more youth - friendly mental health services , more mental health nurses and more support for people with mental illness .
TONY ABBOTT , OPPOSITION LEADER :
He 's now been talking for nearly three minutes ; why has he air - brushed Professor Mendoza out of this question ?
KEVIN RUDD :
So on the question of mental health , we believe this is a huge priority for the future of the country .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS : The Australian of the Year Professor Patrick McGorry says the Government 's decision to defer boosting mental health funding until next year fails the 750,000 young people who need it now .
PATRICK MCGORRY : They seem to think it 's OK to defer it .
We do n't think it 's OK .
People 's lives are at risk .
There 's a whole generation of young people who are still being locked out of mental health care because of the under - investment in that area of reform .
HAMISH FITZSIMMONS : Whether Thursday 's trip to Canberra by sector representatives will make a difference in an election year is yet to be seen .

Best of Linux With Ubuntu 10.04 , Canonical delivered a good - looking Linux distro that just works .
Mark Shuttleworth 's outfit has put together an impressive user interface to solve its famous bug number one - luring people away from Windows .
But good looks and great hardware support are just the beginning .
If Ubuntu really wants to help people escape Windows , it 's going to need to offer the whole package - great Linux applications to replace and improve on the apps Windows users are accustomed to using .
Unfortunately , the best apps are n't always the defaults that ship with Ubuntu - or any other distro , for that matter .
This article is the first in a series that looks at Linux applications – those on Ubuntu in particular – and how they compare to what 's available on Windows and OS X , which have been out there longer , are more polished , and have a larger number of users .
The focus will be on multimedia apps in particular – audio , video and photo – along with back - up services .
I 'll be focusing on Ubuntu because Canonical is specifically hoping to lure Windows and OS X users away .
To kick things off , I look at one area where Linux has an embarrassment of riches – music players .
Whether you 're looking for a player with features that puts Apple 's iTunes to shame or just a bare - bones play / pause button , there 's something that will work for everyone .
First , some parameters .
I 'll be ignoring things like audio codecs because , sorry to say , codecs are a subject that simply does n't matter to the ordinary consumer .
Also , if a music player does n't support MP3s , then it 's just not a music player for the ordinary PC users .
Similarly the focus will be on GNOME apps .
There 's nothing wrong with other desktops and apps written for them , but Ubuntu ships with GNOME and KDE apps have a huge overhead before they 'll run in GNOME .
Hudson � Your Escape from " Integration Hell "
Dr. Simon Wiest , Dr. Wiest Software Engineering , http://www.simonwiest.de
Hudson is a popular web - based continuous integration server , written in Java .
Hudson is used in 17.000 + server installations worldwide in small , medium and large companies alike , including eBay , Hewlett - Packard , MySQL , JBoss , Xerox , Yahoo , Linked In , or Goldman - Sachs .
It allows you to automate your software build chain , e.g. monitoring changes in version control systems , triggering new builds , testing artifacts , sending notifications , deploying to production servers , and much more .
Hudson is liked for its ease of use and broad extensibility via 250+ plugins .
Web Site : http://hudson-ci.org ( see http://hudson.glassfish.org for a live installation )
Version Tested : Hudson V1.358 ( Mai 2010 )
License & Pricing : Open Source ( MIT License )
Support : User and developer mailing lists
Overview
" Continuous Integration ( CI ) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently , usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day .
Each integration is verified by an automated build ( including test ) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible .
Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly . "
( Martin Fowler , http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
Figure 1 : A typical continuous integration cycle
Hudson is a CI server that allows you to implement that approach ( Figure 1 ) : Developers will check in new code into your version control system ( 1 ) .
Hudson polls this system regularly for changes , e.g. every minute ( 2 ) .
If changes are indicated , the new code is checked out to build severs ( 3 ) and a new build of your project is executed .
The results are reported back to Hudson ( 4 ) that will set the new status of the project ( 5 ) : stable , instable , or failed .
Finally notifications are sent to developers and other stakeholders ( 6 ) , which will either fix any problems found or proceed implementing new features .
This complete cycle typically does not exceed 15 minutes .
Installation
Download the latest release from http://hudson-ci.org/latest/hudson.war.
Start Hudson in the command line using the following command : java �jar hudson .war .
Finally , open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser .
You should now see the Hudson Dashboard ( like Figure 2 , but for obvious reasons without any projects yet ) .
You are now ready to run .
If port 8080 is already used , you can choose another port by starting Hudson with a command like : java - jar hudson .
war --httpPort=8888 .
Hudson can also be deployed in application servers like Tomcat , WebSphere or JBoss .
The Hudson project publishes new releases roughly every week .
Hudson will inform you of updates available on its Administration page ( Hudson / Manage Hudson ) .
Plugins are installed via the built - in Plugin Manager ( Hudson / Manage Hudson / Manage Plugins ) .
Figure 2 : A typical Hudson Dashboard
Documentation
Very useful documentation is placed right into the application as context - sensitive help .
There�s also a wiki on the project website and two active mailing lists for users and developers ( some 18,000 postings in 2009 ) .
Two books on Hudson are currently in progress , " CI with Hudson " by J.F. Smart and " CI mit Hudson " ( in German ) by S. Wiest .
Distributed Architecture
Building and testing software is a rather resource intensive process .
Continuously building software obviously requires even more computing power .
Hudson can distribute your builds to a grid of build servers , the " slave nodes " .
This speeds builds up , but also enables you for example to test software on multiple slave nodes running different operating systems , databases , application servers , web browsers , service packs , etc .
Slave nodes can be run on " real hardware " under your desktop , in your data center or on virtualized systems , e.g. on a VMWare host or in the Amazon EC2 cloud .
Hudson will take care of monitoring the nodes , distributing the work and collecting the results , once the builds have been completed on the slave nodes .
Plugins
As software build chains always differ from team to team , a good CI server must demonstrate " infrastructure chameleon " capabilities .
Hudson is extensible by 250 + plugins , offering support for alternative build tools ( e.g. msbuild , gradle , rake ) , version control systems ( e.g. CVS , Git , Perforce , Mercurial ) , notification channels ( e.g. rich email , jabber , twitter , eXtreme feedback devices ) , virtualization and cloud computing ( VMWare , Amazon EC2 ) , user directories ( e.g. LDAP , ActiveDirectory ) , issue trackers ( e.g. JIRA , Bugzilla , Mantis ) , and much more .
At current pace , the Hudson community releases 1 � 2 new plugins and 3�5 updates of existing ones per week .
The source code of these plugins is available to serve as a starting point for own customizations .
In fact , many Hudson " heavy users " came for a shrink - wrapped , ready - to - use product , but stayed for a highly customizable build automation platform .
Building a " Test Drive " Project
You understand Hudson best by seeing it in live action .
Thus , for a simple five - step test drive of Hudson , you could build any Open Source project that hosts its source code publicly accessible .
We will use Apache Commons IO in the following example :
First go to Hudson � Manage Hudson � Configure System : In Section " JDK " add a new Java Development Kit .
In section " Maven " add a new Maven installation .
Click on " Save " at the bottom of the page .
Then go to Hudson � New Job enter " apache - commons - io " as job name and choose " Build a mave n2 project " .
Click on " OK " to proceed with the job configuration page .
On the job configuration page , in section " Source Code Management " , choose " Subversion " and enter " http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/io/trunk " in field " Repository URL " .
Click on " Save " at the bottom of the page .
Click on the " Build Now " icon in the left sidebar .
A new build will start , checking out the source code , then compiling and testing it .
You can follow the progress by peeking at the live output of the build : Click on the progress bar on the left hand side to open the console view .
Once the build has been finished , return to the Hudson dashboard page by clicking on " Hudson " in the top left corner .
If the build succeeded , you will see a blue ball icon .
If any problem occurred , the ball will be yellow or even red .
Note how you can browse the test results interactively by clicking on the project name and then on " Latest Test Results " .
You have now configured your Hudson server , added your first job and built it .
In a production instance , builds would be triggered automatically ( by changes in the version control system or by a timer ) � but the basic scheme would be the same .
Conclusion
Continuous Integration is a software development practice that most teams cannot think of living without , once it has been established .
With Hudson , the necessary tooling is fast to install , easy to maintain and scalable for future extensions .
A final note : While Hudson is implemented in Java and supports mainstream Java build chains out of the box ( CVS / Subversion , Ant / Maven , JUnit / TestNG ) , it is not restricted to the Java world : Many companies use Hudson to automate their software development efforts in C/C++ , C# , PHP , Groovy , Scala , and many other languages .

On one hand , Paul Kanjorski ’s defenders can argue that the Democrat from Pennsylvania was attempting a bit of demagogic hyperbole in describing Republican attitudes towards welfare programs in his tirade yesterday , caught by C - SPAN3 , Human Events , and Kerry Picket at the Washington Times .
On the other hand , Kanjorski ’s contention that “ minorities ” and “ defective ” constituents are somehow different than “ average , good American people ” certainly sounds less like hyperbolic irony and more like a projection of Kanjorski ’s own bigotry .
It only takes Kanjorski less than a minute to run off the rails :
We ’re giving relief to people that I deal with in my office every day now unfortunately .
But because of the longevity of this recession , these are people — and they ’re not minorities and they ’re not defective and they ’re not all the things you ’d like to insinuate that these programs are about — these are average , good American people .
Stephen Gutowski wonders whether the media will treat this with as much attention as if a Republican had said it :
I ’m sure that the media will jump all over this indisputable video evidence of a rep with a D next to his name saying something racist .
Just like they did when there was indisputable video evidence of a rep with a D next to his name assaulting someone on a public sidewalk .
The media is always thorough and diligent when exposing corruption and disgrace within the Democratic party after all .
And I ’m sure that Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be demanding Kanjorski apologize for his racist remarks and resign .
You know , like they did with Joe Biden and Harry Reid .
Surely Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton , being men of integrity and all , wont stand for a major political party in the United States to allow people who make dubious racial remarks stay in power .
This statement is a lot more concrete than George Allen ’s “ macaca moment , ” and that got wall - to - wall coverage in the 2006 election cycle .
Kanjorski is running for re-election in his district , which makes this very similar to the “ macaca ” coverage .
Will the media provide the same level of exposure to a much more obvious ( and deliberate ) example of bigotry ?
For that matter , the national media has clung to the Joe Barton apology to BP for days , even after almost every other Republican in Congress distanced themselves from it .
Does n’t this seem a little more newsworthy ?

La commissaire européenne en charge du numérique , Neelie Kroes , a mis en garde ce jeudi les gouvernements européens contre le risque de se voir " enfermés accidentellement dans une technologie propriétaire " , visant sans le nommer Microsoft , et annoncé la mise en place d'un programme de conseils aux Etats pour qu'ils développent leur utilisation de logiciels libres .
Contrairement aux logiciels propriétaires , le code - source ( la " recette " d'un programme ) des logiciels libres est consultable et modifiable par tout utilisateur .
La plupart des logiciels libres , comme le navigateur Web Firefox , la suite bureautique OpenOffice ou le système d'exploitation GNU / Linux Ubuntu , sont distribués gratuitement .
Dans son discours à l'Openforum Europe , une association de promotion du logiciel libre , la commissaire européenne a souligné que les technologies propriétaires pouvaient à terme devenir tellement prévalentes " que les alternatives sont systématiquement ignorées " , alors même qu'il peut exister des solutions équivalentes libres et gratuites .
" C'est un gaspillage d'argent public que la plupart des administrations ne peuvent plus se permettre " , juge Neelie Kroes .
Précédemment commissaire européenne à la concurrence , Neelie Kroes avait lancé plusieurs enquêtes contre Microsoft , qui ont abouti à la condamnation du géant du logiciel à des amendes record , pour son refus de partager certaines informations avec ses rivaux et pour l'installation par défaut d'Internet Explorer comme navigateur Web dans Windows .
Une problématique similaire s'est posée récemment outre-Atlantique : la semaine dernière , la justice québecoise a conclu que les autorités de la province canadienne avaient agi illégalement en achetant des logiciels Microsoft sans lancer une procédure d'appel d'offre , parce qu'il existait des concurrents libres et gratuits .

University of Cincinnati students can now change their gender markers with the university ’s registrar office .
Students must submit a letter of support from a licensed medical professional , but this letter does not have to indicate a diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder .
But , the text of this letter :
Must be printed on the physician or psychologist / therapist ’s letterhead stationery ;
Must include the student ’s full legal name ;
Must affirm that the student is sufficiently ready for or has completed a gender role and transition , and that it is intended that the role change is to be permanent ; and
Must be dated , and must bear the signature of the physician or psychologist / therapist .
This letter must also accompany the Gender Marker Update Request form .
This new UC policy better matches the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles policy for changing gender markers on state I.D.s .
A big thanks to GenderBloc and the University of Cincinnati Office of the Registrar for partnering to make this policy change .
Google vs. China : Search giant blinks
Google 's Chinese search site , google.cn , now displays a big link to the uncensored Hong Kong site , google.com.hk .
LONDON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Google slightly altered its business strategy in China late Monday in an attempt to balance the company 's desire to keep its Chinese website with its goal of avoiding self - censorship .
Google for the past three months has been automatically redirecting visitors to its Chinese site , google.cn , to its Hong Kong search engine , google.com.hk .
Though Google does not sensor results on the Hong Kong site for users in mainland China , the Chinese government does .
Still , Chinese government officials told the search giant that it finds the auto - redirect " unacceptable " and would likely revoke Google 's license to operate in country if it continues that practice , according to a company blog post .
As a result , Google said that over the next several days , it will stop automatically directing its mainland Chinese users to its Hong Kong search engine .
Instead , it has begun to display a " landing page " on google .cn for some users , which requires users to click on an image that links to the Hong Kong site .
The search company also once again began hosting some search content on its Chinese servers , including maps , music , and translation services , which can be provided locally without the need for censorship .
That content is hosted on google.cn and can be accessed on google .
com.hk for users from within mainland China .
Google 's license is up for renewal on Wednesday , and the company said it has resubmitted its renewal application based on its new approach .
The company said its new strategy is consistent with local law and its commitment to not self - censor .
" We are going with this new approach because we would like to try to provide our service to Chinese users , " Google China spokeswoman Marsha Wong told CNN .
Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) had been using the automatic redirect after deciding it would no longer censor results in China .
Google stopped censoring search results in China in March .
Its stance against censorship of its China site toughened after Google announced in January that it had discovered a targeted cyber attack on its network infrastructure .
To circumvent China 's strict censorship laws , Google no longer hosts its search operations within mainland China -- it physically moved all of its Chinese servers to Hong Kong .
As a result , Google no longer needs to adhere to China 's censorship laws , and it is up to the Chinese government to block access to the results it finds objectionable .
The arrangement is similar to how Chinese users have long been able to access Google 's main search page , the uncensored google.com :
The Chinese government allows access to some result pages and blocks pages it does not want its users to see .
The announcement had some impact on Google 's stock .

Peter Beinart makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up :
The Netanyahu government is filled with Americans .
The prime minister himself attended high school in the Philadelphia suburbs .
Ron Dermer , one of his closest advisors , was born in Miami Beach .
His ambassador to the United States , Michael Oren , hails from New Jersey .
In addition , prominent Americans like Abrams regularly appear in the U.S. media to echo the Netanyahu line .
But paradoxically , this familiarity breeds overconfidence and ignorance .
When Netanyahu travels to Washington , he speaks before Jewish audiences that mostly dislike Barack Obama ’s Israel policy , even though according to a recent American Jewish Committee survey , American Jews overall support it by a margin of close to two to one .
When he ’s not speaking to right - wing Jews , he ’s speaking to right - wing Christians .
And when he ’s not speaking to right - wing Christians , he ’s speaking to former Bush administration officials who expect to soon be back in their old jobs .
As an Obama official once told me about the Netanyahu team , with amazement , “ these guys are actually waiting for President Palin . ”
Of course they are .
Then they get their war on against Iran and permanently occupy the West Bank .
Remember Palin had one flag in her office beside the US one : Israel's .
Remember also her position on the West Bank :
PALIN : I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon , because that population of Israel is , is going to grow .
More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead .
And I do n’t think that the Obama administration has any right to tell Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand .
WALTERS : Even if it ’s [ in ]
Palestinian areas ?
PALIN : I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expand .
Cheney , Palin and Netanyahu want their war back - with torture , pre-emptive attacks and every terrorist attack used to justify more aggression .
And if you put the Christianist right back in the White House , this time purged even of the tincture of responsibility Bush inherited from his family , we have a world war on our hands .

Tucker is one of the most popular Leafs in recent memory , but it looks like the 35 - year - old is nearing the end of his career .
This is n’t entirely surprising considering the reckless way he played for so many years in Toronto .
After being bought out by Toronto , Tucker signed with the Avalanche and has produced two underwhelming years of less than 25 points .
He did n’t score any points in a six hard - fought games against the Sharks in the opening round of this year ’s playoffs .
Some people are still bitter that Tucker leveraged his four 20 + ( fake ) goal seasons in Toronto to get a four - year , $ 12 million contract and for being a member of the Muskoka - 5 .
However , I choose to fondly remember the crazed player with the Jack Nicholson in the Shining face jumping madly into the Ottawa Senators bench .
Ah , the good times .
The Leafs ’ “ gem ” of this year 's trade deadline .
Ponikarovsky was supposed to fit nicely on a line with Evgeni Malkin and basically provide the Penguins with the same spark that Bill Guerin and Chris Kunitz provided last season when the Pens won the Cup .
It did n’t work out very well for the Penguins considering they made Poni a healthy scratch for a few games this post - season .
He scored one goal in the playoffs and never seemed to click with either Evgeni Malkin or Sidney Crosby .
I was rooting for Poni because I hold no ill will towards him , but it looks like the Leafs got the better end of this deal .
Ah , the Alexei Ponikarovsky before there was an Alexei Ponikarovsky .
Best remembered by Leaf fans for having one Hell of a slap - shot and being traded for Cory “ I once scored a huge playoff OT goal ” Cross .
After being traded to the Lightning for Cross , Modin played decently for the Bolts , registering two seasons of 30 + goals and one of 29 over six seasons .
They then traded him to the Blue Jackets for Marc Denis and he was hit hard with injuries .
Over the last three seasons he has n’t played over 50 games and has only once cracked 25 points in Columbus .
Accordingly , I was shocked that Modin was not only alive , but still worthy of being traded when the LA Kings acquired him this trade deadline .
He scored 3 goals and added one assist in six games during a first round defeat at the hands of the Canucks this post - season .
The old Alexei Ponikarovsky outplayed the current Alexei Ponikarovsky .
One of the first bitter moments in my Leafs fandom was the day Pat Quinn waived Steve Sullivan .
This was n’t like when I was furious at Gord Ash for dismantling the key pieces to the Blue Jays ’
World Series team , because I was n’t old enough to understand everything that goes into building , sustaining , and re-building a team .
I was naïve and did n’t realize that there are things like money that play a role .
I also did n’t understand great players eventually age and subsequently suck .
But I saw promise in Steve Sullivan and knew if he was given a shot with the Leafs he would be a very good player .
I was upset with Quinn because I did n’t feel he ever gave young players a fair chance ( not exactly true since Kaberle and Markov were both young and played key roles ) and he was biased against smaller players .
After leaving the Leafs , Sullivan settled into a 60 - 75 point player when he was n't plagued by injuries .
The Predators gave the Blackhawks everything they had in the first round and Sullivan notched 3 assists in six games .
I once compared Stempniak to Snooki from the Jersey Shore because neither could score , despite having the most chances of everyone .
Although , once Stempniak was shipped to the desert he turned into a scoring machine , which means he would be J - Woww in an updated comparison .
Stempniak scored 14 goals in 62 games with the Leafs then scored 14 in 18 games with the Coyotes .
He turned his season around and quite potentially his career , since before his desert vacation it was questionable what , if any , type of offer he would receive as a free agent .
Stempniak returned to Toronto form this post - season and only registered two assists and a - 4 rating in seven games against the Detroit Red Wings .
Leaf fans got way ahead of themselves and proclaimed Wellwood the first true linemate for Mats Sundin after he registered four assists in his first game with the big Swede .
It did n’t really work out that way and Wellwood ate his way out of Toronto .
For a while I worried Wellwood would take his departure as a wakeup call and start training hard .
Instead , it seems like he ’s still intent on hitting up every buffet in Vancouver and has n’t scored over 30 points in his two seasons in Vancouver .
However , Wellwood did score 7 points in 12 games for the Canucks in the playoffs .
Not too shabby for a guy whose off - season workouts involve drinking beers on the dock of his cottage .
Uh , let ’s just move on .
Never played a game for the Leafs , he does n't count .
Who does Leafs Nation hate more : Andrew Raycroft or Vesa Toskala ?
It ’s a hard question that I can’t answer .
They were both surly and thought they were much better than they actually were .
Both are intrinsically tied to the downward spiral of the post - lockout Maple Leafs .
I ’ll say I hate Toskala more , just because I actually thought he was good .
Raycroft has settled nicely into a back - up role with the Canucks and had a solid year behind Roberto Luongo ( although that is likely to end since the Canucks seem intent on letting Cory Schneider back - up next season ) .
Raycroft only played 25 minutes this playoffs when he came in to relieve Luongo after being shelled by the Kings in the first round .
He let in one goal on eight shots .
The last act of JFJ was picking up Moore from waivers and it turned out to be one of his brighter moves .
The Leafs turned Moore into a third line superstar and eventually parlayed him into a second round pick .
The Habs acquired Moore for a second round pick this season and he did the job you would expect of him .
He even scored a few huge goals in the playoffs for Montreal , one of which was integral in eliminating the Washington Capitals .
That alone might be worth the second round pick .
I trashed the Leafs ’ Hall Gill signing relentlessly before he played a game for Toronto .
I thought he was old and slow and the absolute opposite of the player a team should sign in the post - lockout NHL .
However , he turned out to be a really solid defenceman .
He turned into a shut - down defenceman this post - season and was an integral part of Montreal ’s two stunning upsets .
For the most part , if Halak did n’t stop a shot , it was likely that Gill blocked it before it got there .
His stats do n’t really tell the story , because he had one assist and was a - 3 , but he was a revelation .
The Narrative turns 38 .
But as to the facts , just shut up !
Today is the 38th anniversary of the famed Watergate break - in .
The topic is of longstanding interest to me , and I continue to marvel over the fact that after all these years , the reasons for the burglary are still unsettled .
Historians and Nixon scholars continue to wonder , while pondering various theories .
The one thing that stands out is that principle accuser John Dean -- the man whose testimony brought down Nixon and sent people to prison -- was the architect of the burglary and the coverup .
His story changed many times , and it appears to a number of people who have studied Watergate in detail that he ordered the burglary for personal reasons , and then later implicated others who had no idea what was going on .
In exchange , he was allowed to walk , while those he implicated went to prison .
There have been a number of books which have attempted to flesh out the details in an attempt to clarify history .
John Dean has sued some of them , and threatened to sue others -- most recently James Rosen of Fox News , whose biography of John Mitchell concluded ( after years of research ) that the conventional version of the burglary ( especially Dean 's version that Mitchell ordered it ) was wrong , and that Dean himself had ordered the burglary for personal reasons .
As I observed last year ,
Little wonder he 's threatening to sue .
For those who are interested , here 's an interview with Rosen :
NRO 's Kathryn Lopez has an interview with Rosen here .
In what I think is a very significant new development , Geoff Shepard ( author , " The Secret Plot to Make Ted Kennedy President " ) recently delivered a comprehensive 90 minute presentation which is a review of the prominent Watergate conspiracy books and more .
Shepard came to similar conclusions about John Dean and if you are at all interested in Watergate , this video is an absolute MUST WATCH !
It 's called " The Mysteries of Watergate " :
May 24 , 2010 : Former Nixon Domestic Council official , Watergate defense lawyer , and author Geoff Shepard presented the fourth Richard Nixon Legacy Forum .
Shepard spoke about the conventional wisdom of Watergate , five alternative perspectives on how the controversy unfolded , and the role of former White Counsel John Dean as the orchestrator of the cover-up .
May 24 , 2010 : Even forty years later , Watergate remains America 's greatest political scandal .
What is so interesting , at least to those who are interested in learning more about it , is that there is almost no agreement on the motivation for the original Break - in itself -- or on whether the true culprits were those who actually executed the Break - in and the Cover - up or those they later alleged authorized and approved their illegal acts .
Dozens of books have been written by principal Watergate players ; hundreds of books and articles have been written by various commentators .
Geoff Shepard 's 90 minute presentation reviews the prominent Watergate conspiracy books and then explores a series of continuing uncertainties and concerns with what most Americans have been taught as ' conventional wisdom ' about Watergate .
It the course of it , he reveals some startling information about John Dean , one of the most prominent Watergate actors -- and shows why we can expect Watergate controversies to continue well into the future .
From the caption :
And here it is .
If you can spare the time ( and I know it 's long ) , it 's worth it .
For more , see my previous posts , and be sure to watch the Key To Watergate video :
It 's interesting even if you 're not a political junkie .
Recommended reading includes Jim Hougan 's groundbreaking Secret Agenda , Len Colodny 's Silent Coup , James Rosen 's Strong Man , and Geoff Shepard 's The Secret Plot to Make Ted Kennedy President .
As to why the history of such an important event still remains unsolved after all these years , why , it 's the Narrative Principle at work .
The Narrative is that Nixon was bad and evil , and had to be brought down by in a grand political pageant orchestrated by the sainted MSM , by that heroic whistle - blower named John Dean !
As to the details , they do n't matter .
Shut up and think as you 're told .
The Marine Corps ' most ( in ) famous technologist has a solution for the Gulf oil spill : Blow the crap out of it , with the Mother of All Bombs .
Over the past decade , no one in the Corps has been more creative , more persistent and more migraine - inducing in his pursuit of warfighting gadgetry than Franz Gayl .
Some of his ideas were rock - solid , like small spy drones and bomb - resistant trucks .
Eventually , the Pentagon bought tens of thousands of the trucks , due in large part to his agitating and whistleblowing efforts .
Other concepts of his were more fringe : oribiting troop transports , super - strength exoskeletons , laser guns that could roast insurgents alive .
Now Gayl , a civilian scientist ( semi - ) employed by Quantico , may have come up with his most dramatic idea yet :
Use a 21,000 - pound megamunition to generate a king - sized shock wave that would force those leaking pipes on the seabed shut .
Deploying the GBU - 43 MOAB – known as the " Massive Ordnance Air Burst " or " Mother of All Bombs " – would be " proven , safe and ' green , ' " Gayl tells our pal David Axe , of War Is Boring .
The bomb consumes all its own fuel , after all .
And it 's not a nuclear weapon , like the one the Russians allegedly used to shut down out - of - control wells .
If there are no MOABs to be had , Gayl adds , a Vietnam - era Daisy Cutter will do just fine .
Either one ... can be enclosed in a simple pressure shell , that is augmented with several tons of liquid oxygen canisters , and lowered to just a few meters above the leaking well head .
An oxygen - enhanced MOAB or Daisy Cutter detonated at a water depth of 5,000 feet will indeed have an interesting effect on all the well - related plumbing and equipment that is above , at , and slightly below the sea floor ....
The exploding MOAB or Daisy Cutter would have an incredible implosive - sealing effect on oil plumbing within the immediate vicinity of the detonation .
Gayl 's active , active mind has n't stopped looking for ways to bring technology to bear to solve the most intractable problems .
Nor does he limit himself by exploring the implications of those solutions .
For instance : what would happen if the Mother of All Bombs went off - target at the bottom of the Gulf ?
UPDATE : Gayl sends along this handy set of slides , depicting how the MOAB vs. spill operation might work .

The Press Complaints Commission has rejected a privacy complaint from a woman about an article and pictures of her in Loaded magazine under the headline " Wanted !
The epic boobs girl ! "
She was said in the article to have the " best breasts on the block " .
The accompanying pictures of her were taken from the internet and readers were offered a reward of £ 500 for assistance in encouraging her to pose for the magazine .
The complainant said that the article intruded into her privacy .
The somewhat provocative photographs had been uploaded to her page on Bebo in December 2006 , but they had since been published on numerous other sites without her permission .
She said the magazine 's article , published in February this year , had caused her upset and embarrassment , and that publication was in breach of the privacy clause in the editors ' code of practice .
But the PCC decided that the pictures had been given such a wide circulation that it was no longer credible to describe them as private .
Had Loaded taken them from the Bebo site without them having appeared widely on other sites , the commission might well have reached a different decision .
The magazine , in contesting the complaint , explained that it was commenting on pictures that had been given extremely wide circulation on the net and pointed out that the complainant 's photograph had featured in the top three of a Google image search on the word " boobs " .
The commission did sympathise with the woman , and accepted that the tastefulness of the article was questionable .
However , the issue for the PCC was whether the publication of the information was intrusive , and it decided that it was not .
The commission did n't think it possible to censure the magazine for commenting on material that had already had such wide circulation , and which had already been contextualised in the same way ( ie , as an exemplar of beautiful breasts ) by many others .
The ruling does raise issues about what constitutes the public domain in online terms , and how far editors are entitled to make use of it .
In a sense , it 's about whether people compromise their own privacy by placing material on the net .
Stephen Abell , the PCC 's director , said : " The PCC has done a lot of work on the use of material taken from social networking sites .
This case is slightly different : it rests on material that has been given much broader dissemination online .
The commission had to pay regard to the extent to which the information had already been made available , and also the context in which it had appeared .
It judged that would not have been proportionate to criticise an editor for republishing this material , bearing in mind how - and how far - it had already spread .
The commission has instituted an ongoing working group to consider issues thrown up by online publication , and will continue to think and act flexibly in relation to this challenging area .
I understand that online working group will also look at matters such as the prominence of online apologies , the archiving of complaints about articles and consider the possibility of developing a PCC online brand so that websites can advertise their adherence to the code .

The South Bronx has more health problems than any other part of New York , according to studies by the city health department .
Many , like diabetes and obesity , are connected to diet .
Mr. Derryck thought a community supported agriculture program rooted in the actual community could help .
In a traditional C.S.A. plan , people pay farmers at the beginning of a season for weekly deliveries of whatever grows on the farm .
Last year , 18,000 New Yorkers participated in 80 such plans , according to the advocacy group Just Food .
It ’s a model that does n’t translate well to poor neighborhoods , where handing over , say , $ 500 at one time with the promise that someone will send you a box of flowers , herbs and vegetables you probably do n’t want is n’t a popular notion .
So he decided to turn the model on its head , giving plan members a say in what is grown , and , with the help of nonprofit groups , making it less expensive as well .
“ Most people I talked with say , ‘ Can I get enough food to feed my family , ’ ” Mr. Derryck said .
“ They do n’t want parsnips and thyme .
They want 10 pounds of potatoes . ”

He cajoled almost every person he has ever served with on a nonprofit board , raising $ 562,000 .
He also got a $ 300,000 bank loan .
He bought the farm in February 2009 , then went shopping for a farm manager , a tractor and a refrigerated truck for delivery in the Bronx .
Once he pays off investors and the loan , which might take five years or more , he intends to pass shares in the farm to the members of the plan .
Mr. Derryck ’s farm wo n’t be producing until August .
And even then , it ca n’t grow enough to fill the boxes .
So a small group of Schoharie County farmers have signed on , agreeing to offer vegetables and fruit at a discount to help Mr. Derryck make budget .
Mr. Derryck thinks the plan can eventually generate $ 1.2 million a year for Schoharie County farmers , and expand its roster of supporters to include foster - care families and day care centers .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A thin rain of charged particles continually bombards our atmosphere from outer space .
The mysterious particles were first detected 100 years ago but until 10 years ago when a new type of telescope began to come online physicists were n't sure where the " cosmic rays " came from or how they were generated .
They suspected the particles were accelerated by supernova shockwaves , but suspicions are n't proof .
Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes now keeping a watchful eye on the night skies are finally providing the evidence needed to solve this longstanding puzzle .
Over the past several years , observations of individual supernovae remnants in our galaxy have gradually strengthened the case for supernova acceleration .
But this fall the evidence suddenly got much stronger .
The VERITAS consortium reported their observations of a starburst galaxy .
This time the physicists were observing many supernovae at once instead of one by one .
As they reported in Nature the correlation between the high cosmic - ray density in the core of this galaxy and its high supernova rate provides powerful evidence in support of the theory of supernova acceleration .
Six of the papers co-authors are physicists at Washington University in St. Louis , one of the founding groups in the VERITAS consortium , a collaboration of 22 institutions that runs a four - telescope array in the Santa Rita foothills south of Tuscon .
The last of the three major imaging atmospheric Cherenkov arrays to come online ( the other two are MAGIC in the Canary Islands , H.E.S.S. in Namibia ) , VERITAS saw " first light " in September 2007 , just two years ago .
Cosmic rays discovered
It all began nearly 100 years ago with a tenacious response to what most people would have considered a passing irritation .
The Viennese physicist Victor Hess wanted to know why an instrument used to measure radiation , called a gold - leaf electroscope , would slowly discharge even when there was no obvious source of radiation nearby .
What was ionizing the air within the instrument case and letting the charge leak away ?
To figure out where the radiation was coming from , Hess made balloon ascents in 1911 and 1912 , carrying electroscopes with him .
He expected the instruments would discharge more slowly at higher altitudes .
Instead , he found that they discharged more rapidly .
Hess decided the radiation was coming from outer space and named it cosmic radiation .
He won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1936 for his discovery .

Why it took so long
The famous American physicist Robert Millikan called Hess 's penetrating radiation " cosmic rays , " but " rays " is a misnomer .
The " rays " are not light but instead are atomic nuclei , mostly hydrogen nuclei , or protons , with a sprinkling of helium and heavier nuclei .
Unlike light , these particles carry electric charge .
And that 's a problem because space is laced by magnetic fields , and charged particles spiral around magnetic field lines .
These deflections and detours so tangle the particles ' paths that by the time they arrive at Earth they appear to be arriving in equal numbers from all directions .
Because the rays themselves do n't point back to their sources , astronomers have to track them down by other means .
When cosmic rays collide with other atomic nuclei in gas or dust , they produce gamma rays , which are a kind of high - energy light .
The gamma-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum covers a lot of territory , but some of the most energetic gamma rays have trillions of times the energy of the light we can see .
Because gamma rays travel in straight lines physicists can trace them backward - with luck to objects that can be observed with conventional telescopes at other wavelengths .
But there is another obstacle to overcome .
Gamma rays make it nearly to Earth but not quite .
They can't penetrate the atmosphere , and so , like cosmic rays , they must also be detected indirectly .
When a very energetic gamma-ray interacts with an atom in the upper atmosphere , the collision can result in debris in the form of a pair of particles : an electron and its antiparticle , the positron .
The debris from this collision can interact with another atom yielding more electrons , positrons and photons
in an avalanche that results in a cascade of billions of particles called an extensive air shower . "
Because the particles are traveling faster than the speed of light in the atmosphere , they create a shock wave similar to the sonic boom from a supersonic jet .
The shock wave takes the form of a cone of bluish light known as Chernekov radiation .
( The blue glow of the cooling water in a nuclear reactor is created by the same process . )
The flashes of light from an extensive air shower are so faint and brief they can't be seen with the unaided eye .
To record them , Chernekov telescopes like VERITAS use extremely sensitive and fast " cameras " made of hundreds of photomultiplier tubes .
The Washington University group founded by James H. Buckley , Ph.D. , professor of physics in Arts & Sciences and a member of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences at the University , designed and built the high - speed electronics capable of making " movies " of the flashes at a blistering half a billion frames per second .
The frame rate of a standard movie camera , by contrast , is 24 frames per second .
The four telescopes in the VERITAS array each provide a different view of an air shower , providing a better fix on the direction of the incoming gamma ray .
Accelerators in space
Scientists knew from the start that cosmic radiation had to come from unusual astrophysical sources .
Cosmic rays are what is called non-thermal radiation .
That is , you can't get this kind of radiation just by heating something up , even to the nuclear furnace temperatures of stellar interiors .
Instead , to make cosmic rays , you need something more like a particle accelerator .
But the world 's highest - energy accelerator is designed to boost protons to an energy of only a few tera - electron - Volts , and by the standards of cosmic rays , that 's nothing .
Some of them have energies 100 million times higher .
An accelerator works by using electromagnetic fields to continually kick particles confined to a ring to higher and higher energies .
To get up to cosmic ray energies , however , the particles would have to be subject to very strong electromagnetic fields over enormous distances .
So , at a minimum , cosmic accelerators must be huge and exceedingly violent objects .
And that 's more or less what VERITAS and the other telescopes are finding them to be .
M82 , or the Cigar Galaxy , is a starburst galaxy about 12 million light - years away from Earth .
In the galaxy 's center , stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside the entire Milky Way galaxy .
The high stellar birth and death rate made M82 a good test case for the theory that cosmic rays are generated in supernovae explosions .
In this false - color image , X - ray data recorded by the Chandra X - ray observatory is blue ; infrared light recorded by the Spitzer infrared telescope is red ; Hubble space telescope observations of hydrogen line emission is orange , and the bluest visible light is yellow - green .

A supernova remnant
Even before all four telescopes were up and running , the VERITAS array was used to observe IC 443 , also known as the Jellyfish nebula , a galactic supernova remnant in the constellation Gemini .
IC 443 is thought to be the remains of a star that blew itself apart thousands of years ago .
The massive explosion left behind the collapsed remnant of the star 's core , in the form of a spinning neutron star , and a rapidly expanding shell of gas .
When material speeding out from the supernova hit the interstellar medium , it created a shock wave .
In the southeast corner of the nebula the shock wave is slamming into a dense molecular cloud , perhaps the cloud from which the star originally condensed .
VERITAS found that high energy gamma-ray emission was confined to a region in the remnant where the molecular cloud was thickest .
It seemed the shock wave was acting as a gigantic accelerator , and gamma rays were being unleashed when protons energized by the shock front struck the nearby molecular cloud .
This interpretation of the results made sense , but was it true ?
The physicists were n't entirely sure .
For one thing , energetic electrons as well as atomic nuclei can produce gamma rays .
Electrons accelerated to high energies by the supernova might be colliding with low - energy photons , boosting them to gamma-ray energies .
This is called the inverse Compton effect .
Arthur Compton described the opposite process — in which high energy photons collide with stationary particles — while at Washington University , work for which he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 .
The theory of the inverse effect was first set out by two of Compton 's colleagues at the University , Eugene Feenberg and Henry Primakoff , in 1948 .
But Buckley and his colleagues were also aware that one observation was not much to go on .
It was possible that supernova remnant IC 443 was n't typical but rather somehow anomalous or unusual .
Since 2007 , VERITAS has taken gamma-ray snapshots of other supernova remnants , including Boomerang and gamma Cygni , observed just this summer .
They show much the same gamma-ray emission as IC 443 .
Many supernovae at once
The latest find , announced Nov. 1 in the online journal Nature , is qualitatively different .
This time the telescopes were looking at the diffuse gamma-ray emission from an entire galaxy , one that has many supernova remnants .
They were looking at an entire forest instead of a single tree .
The galaxy is M82 , a starburst galaxy five times brighter than the entire Milky Way .
There are many starburst galaxies , says Henric Krawczynski , Ph.D. , associate professor of physics and a member of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences , who together with Buckley , has led many of the VERITAS scientific programs , " but we chose to observe M82 because it is close to our Milky Way galaxy and combines a high rate of star formation with a high density of interstellar matter . "
M82 is also called the cigar galaxy because it was deformed into a long , fat slug by a collision with a nearby galaxy .
The encounter funneled gas into the galaxy 's core , creating a compact region where stars are being formed about 10 times faster than in the Milky Way and supernova pop off with alarming frequency .
The ferment of stellar explosions , the astronomers reasoned , should be churning out cosmic rays and gamma rays .
Not that the gamma rays would be easy to see , because the supernovae in the starburst galaxy are much farther away than IC 443 or other supernovae in our galaxy .
Although VERITAS is presently the most sensitive gamma-ray observatory in the world , it took almost two years of repeated observations to detect the predicted signal .
But the data , once gathered , indicated that the starburst region of M82 has a cosmic ray density 500 times the average cosmic ray density of our galaxy .
Its estimated supernova rate is about 30 times higher than the Milky Way's .
The correlation between the cosmic - ray density and the supernova rate strongly supports the long - held theory that supernovae are cosmic ray factories .
What they know and when they knew it
So do physicists feel they now know where and how cosmic rays are generated ?
Buckley 's response is carefully worded .
" After all of these years , we 're starting to see evidence both from discrete sources -- the supernova remnants -- and at the galactic scale -- the starburst galaxy -- that supernova explosions are really the source of cosmic rays . "
" If we finally see neutrinos coming from the sources , " he says , " then we 'll know absolutely that protons , not electrons , are producing the gamma rays , because only the protons will give you neutrinos . "
" But even if we knew where they 're coming from , we would n't know the exact mechanism by which they 're accelerated , " he continues .
" That shock acceleration idea is very nice , but there are problems with it and ultimately the devil is in the details . "

Synopsis and Key Points :
Information on Disability Diversity in society including the definition of both diversity and disabilities .
Main Digest
People with disabilities are the nation 's largest minority , and the only one that any person can join at any time ...
The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect .
It means understanding that each individual is unique , and recognizing our individual differences .
These can be along the dimensions of race , ethnicity , gender , sexual orientation , socio- economic status , age , physical abilities , religious beliefs , political beliefs , or other ideologies .
It is the exploration of these differences in a safe , positive , and nurturing environment .
It is about understanding each other and moving beyond simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity contained within each individual .
If you do not currently have a disability , you have about a 20 % chance of becoming disabled at some point during your work life .
People with disabilities cross all racial , gender , educational , socioeconomic , and organizational lines .
Discussion regarding diversity has often focused on gender and race .
In contrast , there has been limited attention given to people with disabilities as the world 's largest minority group .
Definition of Diversity
The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect .
It means understanding that each individual is unique , and recognizing our individual differences .
These can be along the dimensions of race , ethnicity , gender , sexual diversity and orientation , socio- economic status , age , physical abilities , religious beliefs , political beliefs , or other ideologies .
It is the exploration of these differences in a safe , positive , and nurturing environment .
It is about understanding each other and moving beyond simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity contained within each individual .
Definition of Disability
The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) of 1990 protects qualified individuals with disabilities from unlawful discrimination in the workplace , including access to training and career development .
A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities .
Specifically , a qualified individual with a disability is someone who can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation .
Disability Diversity in Education
Including Disability as Diversity in teaching can involve any number of factors , such as making classes accessible to students with disabilities , accommodating your own disability in a class , and incorporating disability studies perspectives into your course content .
Disability and Cultural Diversity
Employment circumstances facing minorities with disabilities are bleak .
Attention to this issue must become a priority .
In response to unacceptably high unemployment statistics for persons with disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds , the U.S. Office of Disability Employment Policy has been working with Howard University , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the National Urban League , ASPIRA and other minority organizations in an effort to respond to this challenge .
It will take the efforts of many organizations and employers to reverse the negative employment picture for minorities with disabilities .
Here are some factors that help to perpetuate the high unemployment rates of persons with disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds :
People with disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds experience twice the discrimination experienced by non-disabled people in the minority community .
Both disability and race complicate the situation .
There is disparity in rehabilitation services provided to minority persons with disabilities .
Educational opportunities are less available and affordable to individuals with disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds .
Inadequate transportation and housing in disadvantaged communities intensify the employment barriers for minority people with disabilities .
There is a lack of mentors and role models for minority individuals with disabilities in the workplace .
Mainstream job coaching , on the job training and internships are often not readily available to minority individuals with disabilities .
Both mainstream and minority communities and religious organizations tend to overlook their capability to support the employment of minority individuals with disabilities .
Cultural differences are not clearly understood by individuals or organizations designing programs to support the employment of minority persons with disabilities .
Companies that include people with disabilities in their diversity programs increase their competitive advantage .
People with disabilities add to the variety of viewpoints needed to be successful and bring effective solutions to today 's business challenges .
The American economy is made stronger when all segments of the population are included in the workforce and in the customer base .

Neither the Liberals nor the Christian Democrats have ruled out forming a government with Mr Wilders , who was last year banned from entering Britain for public safety reasons .
The Home Office refused the politician entry on that grounds that he " would threaten community security and therefore public security " .
Mr Wilders had been invited to the House of Lords to show his 17 - minute film , Fitna , which criticises the Koran as a " fascist book " and compares Islam to Nazism .
The contests shifted early on from regional and municipal races into a midterm referendum on the prime minister ’s conservative government , which is two years into a five - year term .
Mr. Berlusconi campaigned assiduously , casting the elections as an endorsement of his mandate and his can - do style of leadership .
He strove to both solidify his position within his coalition and garner enough clout to push through several much - disputed reforms on his agenda , including a widespread overhaul of the justice system and a change to the Constitution that would allow for the direct election of the president with expanded powers for the office .
( There has been speculation that Mr. Berlusconi himself would run for the office if it had more authority . )
Rather than addressing local concerns , these elections , which did not include seven of Italy ’s 20 regions , probably will be better remembered for the emergence of various corruption scandals — one involving a close aide to the prime minister — bungled electoral procedures in some regions , and accusations of vote tampering in others .
The campaign will also be recalled for what was not said , at least on national television .
Mr. Berlusconi was accused of plotting to take at least one talk show critical of him off the air .
Political talk shows did not air during the campaign .
Turnout was relatively low in a country where electoral participation is usually high .
Fewer than 65 percent of voters made it to the polls , down from 72 percent in the last regional elections in 2005 .
Many experts saw the decline as an indication of rising frustration on the part of Italians .
The NDP is refusing to endorse a deal reached between the Conservative government and other opposition parties to grant MPs access to uncensored documents relating to Afghan detainee transfers .
A man Afghan authorities suspect of insurgency - related activities is interrogated during a joint Canadian - Afghan army patrol in the Panjwaii district of Kandahar province in July 2009 .
( ( Colin Perkel / Canadian Press ) )
Government House leader Jay Hill rose in the Commons on Monday morning to announce he expected Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff and Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe to sign the agreement " in very short order . "
It came shortly after New Democrat representative Jack Harris emerged from a Tuesday morning all - party meeting and said the deal reached between the other three parties is too narrow and his party can't support it .
Harris also reiterated his party 's calls for a full public inquiry .
" We 're not part of it , " Harris told reporters on Parliament Hill .
" This will not get at the truth .
This will not allow parliamentarians to see all unredacted documents . "
Liberal House leader Ralph Goodale told the Commons the success of the agreement will depend on the " honest behaviour " of all parties involved and vowed the Liberals " will continue to be alert and vigilant in the process . "
Last month , House Speaker Peter Milliken ruled the Conservatives breached parliamentary privilege by denying MPs access to uncensored material pertaining to detainee transfers by Canadian soldiers .
A special parliamentary committee on the Afghanistan mission is examining allegations detainees were tortured after they were handed over to Afghan officials .
The Conservatives and the Canadian military have steadfastly denied that Canadian officials were aware of allegations the Afghan security forces tortured detainees , but the government has refused to make public thousands of pages of documents related to the transfers without major redactions .
In his ruling , Milliken called on all parties to reach a compromise regarding the documents that would respect Parliament 's right to review the material , while also ensuring national security concerns are addressed .
Bloc House leader Pierre Paquette said the deal respects the Speaker 's ruling and will allow a group of chosen MPs to have the option to report back to the House if they think it 's necessary .
After all parties reached a tentative deal four weeks ago , opposition leaders accused the Conservative government of dragging its heels in subsequent negotiations to finalize the agreement .
MPs can't see cabinet records : NDP
The compromise called for a committee of MPs to take an oath of confidentiality and examine unredacted documents to determine whether the material was relevant to allegations that Afghan authorities tortured prisoners that were handed over by Canadian troops .
Jack Harris , NDP MP for St. John 's East , speaks in the House of Commons .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
Under the compromise , documents deemed relevant would then be passed on to a panel of experts who would determine how to release the information to all MPs and the public " without compromising national security . "
But the NDP's Harris said the current deal prevents
MPs from reviewing all material because a panel of jurists will vet documents the government claims to be matters of cabinet confidentiality or solicitor - client privilege before deciding whether to hand them over to politicians .
" We believe it fails the test of people having trust in this process , and we think it 's a no go , " Harris said .
But the Liberals ' Goodale disagreed with the NDP 's argument , saying the government has surrendered unilateral control over the documents and " all relevant and necessary information will be available . "
The Liberals also announced former leader Stéphane Dion and MP Byron Wilfert would represent their party on the panel .

New York ( CNN ) -- Kayla Berg was thrilled to return last August to Antigo , Wisconsin , where she looked forward to competing on the high school gymnastics team .
Her mother , Hope Sprenger , said she agreed to move Kayla , 15 , and her older brother , Jimmy , back to the small town where they were raised .
They had moved three months earlier to Texas , but Kayla and her brother were homesick .
" We were going to try and start a new life , " Sprenger said , " but Kayla missed her friends .
She was very upset that they did n't have gymnastics team at the high school in Texas . "
The return home also meant Kayla and her brother would spend time with their father and grandparents , who lived five miles away .
" We left it pretty open , " Sprenger said about the living arrangement that allowed Kayla and Jimmy to stay with either parent .
" They could ride bikes , or we'd take them back and forth . "
Sometimes Kayla walked , or ran , between her parent 's homes to get in shape for gymnastics .
A few weeks were left of summer break , and Kayla was making it a point to catch up with friends .
With her 16th birthday still a couple of weeks away and no driver 's license , she accepted a ride to the Antigo McDonald 's , where her best friend worked .
" She had called me that afternoon , on August 11 , around 1 or 2 and said she was going to hang around at her dad's , " Sprenger said .
" She said , ' I love you , ' and I said , ' Love you back . ' " Mother and daughter agreed to talk later .
They never did .
" All I know is something 's wrong , " Sprenger said , adding that she 's 100 percent certain Kayla would never run away .
Sprenger and police have spent the past 10 months retracing Kayla 's movements on the night of August 11 .
One of her brother 's friends picked Kayla up at her father 's house at about 8:30 p.m .
The two arrived at McDonald 's half an hour later .
Kayla ran inside , talked briefly with her friend , and then left .
She had told her friend she planned to ride around in the car for a while .
" The last we pretty much know about the story we have , is around 10 p.m. , " said Antigo Police Chief Eric Roller .
" The male says he dropped her off ... at her boyfriend 's house in Wausau . "
Wausau is 34 miles from Antigo .
Sprenger did n't approve of the boyfriend .
" I did n't feel comfortable that he was 19 she was 15 , " she said .
The brother 's friend said he last saw Kayla when she got out of his vehicle and walked toward a house she said was that of her boyfriend .
" He figured it was about 10 p.m. when he dropped her off .
...
He said it was dark . "
Roller said .
The friend accurately described the house , which is in downtown Wausau and surrounded by other homes and businesses .
Investigators and Kayla 's mother question why Kayla would have requested a ride to that house .
It had been condemned by the health department weeks earlier and was undergoing renovations .
Kayla 's mother said Kayla knew no one had been living there .
Roller said he has heard conflicting stories about whether Kayla knew the property had been condemned .
No one else saw Kayla get out of the car , Roller said , but investigators were able to confirm that the 24 - year old driver returned at midnight to his parents ' house in Deerbrook , about 45 minutes away .
Six days later , on August 17 , Kayla 's mother reported her missing .
" It was such a messed - up situation as to why this was n't reported immediately , " she said .
" There was miscommunication between me and her dad .
I thought she was at her dad's .
...
Her brother said she was over at her friend 's house . "
Kayla did n't have a cell phone or computer , so her whereabouts could not be tracked .
Although she did have a Facebook account , she had n't accessed it in months .
" It 's not been a lot to go on , " Roller said .
" There 's been quite a bit of searching around that area .
There 's some water in the area .
There have been dives . "
Cadaver dogs turned up no trail and no scent of Kayla at or near the boyfriend 's home .
The car she was riding in was seized and processed for evidence .
Police still have the car , but investigators will not comment on the evidence collected .
Roller said the biggest problem with the case is that police received information a week after Kayla went missing .
He said her friends were uncooperative with police , making it appear as if they might be helping Kayla hide .
" A lot was probably gut reaction on us , thinking that if something drastic had happened , the friends would be a little more concerned , " he said .
" But 10 months is a long time for someone to be gone . "
The case is further complicated by differing descriptions of what Kayla was wearing on the last night she was seen .
Some say she was wearing jeans , a tank top and flip flops .
But the driver says she wore a long - sleeved shirt , Roller said .
Kayla 's mother reached out to the driver who gave her daughter a ride .
She says she received two text messages from him .
" I had said , ' Hey , where 's Kayla , and where did you drop her off ? ' " Sprenger said .
" He said , ' I do n't know . ' "
Since then , Sprenger said , most of her contact has been with the driver 's attorney or his parents .
" Once he got a lawyer involved , no one could talk to him , " Roller said .
The driver 's attorney did not return CNN 's calls seeking comment .
A reward is being offered by Kayla 's family for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for her disappearance .
An additional reward is being offered by Langlade County Crimestoppers .
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Langlade County Police at ( 715 ) 627-6411 or Crimestoppers at ( 715 ) 627-6245 .

It is the first visit from a senior Arab offical since 2007
The Head of the Arab League is visiting the Gaza Strip , the first senior Arab official to do so since the Islamist militant group Hamas took over in 2007 .
Amr Moussa 's visit is partly intended to add to pressure on Israel to end its Gaza blockade , correspondents say .
Nine people were killed when Israeli troops boarded an aid flotilla trying to break the blockade on 31 May .
Israel and Egypt have blockaded Gaza since Hamas seized control of the Palestinian territory .
Mr Moussa 's trip is also aimed at trying to heal a rift between Hamas and Fatah , who control the West Bank .
We stop weapons and arms coming into Gaza ; on the other hand , we allow in items for normal daily life Tony Blair , Middle East peace envoy Blair hopeful over Gaza blockade
" This blockade which we are all here to confront must be broken and the position of the Arab League is clear , " Mr Moussa said as he was met by Palestinian leaders at the Rafah crossing with Egypt .
Following the flotilla raid , Egypt opened its border with Gaza allowing people with valid passes to cross .
Mr Moussa met senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniya at his Gaza home .
Mr Haniya said Mr Moussa 's visit was " a step toward the end of the blockade " .
Analysis Amr Moussa 's visit carries significance on two levels .
It is intended to add to the growing international pressure for Israel to lift its blockade of Gaza - a blockade which Israel argues is necessary to preserve security , but whose rationale and effects on the people of Gaza is , elsewhere , widely opposed .
Mr Moussa 's appearance in Gaza also extends a hand to Hamas - an Islamist movement the Arab League has up to now preferred to keep at arm 's length .
There will be further talk now of trying to broker a reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah - the two main , bitterly divided Palestinian factions .
But there is also some back - covering here : Arab diplomats are well aware that in recent times some of the most vocal support for Gaza has come from two countries not in the Arab League - Turkey and Iran .
He met representatives of non-governmental organisations at a UN - run school damaged in an Israeli offensive 18 months ago .
He was scheduled to meet the leaders of other Palestinian factions before returning to Egypt .
The international envoy to the Middle East , Tony Blair , hinted that a partial lifting of the blockade could be agreed within days .
" There is a clear and intelligent distinction to be made , " said Mr Blair , who represents the Quartet of the United Nations , United States , the European Union and Russia .
He told the BBC : " We stop weapons and arms coming into Gaza ; on the other hand , we allow in items for normal daily life . "
" I hope very much we can build on that distinction over the next few days and get a change in policy in the way we need , " Mr Blair said .
Mr Moussa 's trip is also aimed at finding a way of bringing two Palestinian factions , Hamas and Fatah together , says the BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem .
Hamas gunmen drove Fatah out of Gaza in 2007 , and relations between the two groups remain strained .
The trip was announced soon after the flotilla of ships , led by the Turkish Mavi Marmara , were prevented from entering the waters off Gaza .
They were carrying 10,000 tonnes of aid , including building materials which are currently restricted under the terms of the blockade .
The Israeli government says the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas and other militant groups launching rocket attacks on Israel .
The restrictions mean life for the 1.5 million population of Gaza has become crippling , correspondents say .
Many are still living in makeshift camps after their homes were destroyed in the Israeli incursion .
Last week US President Barack Obama said the blockade was " unsustainable " and pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in aid .
At the beginning of June Mr Moussa said the Arab League , a 22 - member forum representing Arab nations , would go to the UN Security Council to demand the blockade be lifted .
You may reject the idea of a microchip implant , but your grandchildren could embrace them , according to an Australian professor .
Katrina Michael , associate professor of the University of Wollongong 's school of information systems and technology , and author of scientific paper Towards a State of Uberveillance , said subdermal chip implants in humans could be commonplace within two to three generations .
But at present , she regards the device as a threat to life and liberty because technologists and politicians largely do not know if silicon chips could harm the human body and have not determined the terms in which the devices can be used .
" You will have a new breed of tech - savvy individuals that are more adaptable to technologies .
But you could forget about getting Australians to have chip implants now , " Michael said .
" For instance [ microchips ] are problematic for motoring patients with psychological conditions .
You may need to balance the patient 's well being , public safety and their ability to consent to the implant . "
Michael said human microchips could rid chronic illness sufferers from the need to visit hospital by sending simple data on their health to a doctor .
However , she said chip implants presently cause damage to the human body because they fuse with tissue and cause damage when removed .
" At this moment , there will be no contingency plan ; it will be a life sentence to upgrades , virus protection mechanisms , and inescapable intrusion , " authors , Katina and M.G Michael wrote in their paper .
She noted that some 900 US hospitals have registered for a microchip - based patient identification system to more quickly identify patients admitted to emergency .
" There has n't been 50 cases of people using microchips in Australia , which is a fundamental problem for politicians because they do not want to touch the issue if it is n't detailed in black and white , " Michael said .
She described seeing " a lot of blank faces " when she spoke to politicians of the privacy implications of wearable and implantable Radio Frequency Identification Devices ( RFID ) chips , but noted " new breed politicians " such as Labor Senator Kate Lundy understood the technology and its dilemmas .
" It is a fallacy to speak of a balance between [ freedom , security and justice ] in the microchip scenario , so long as someone else has the potential to control the implant device , " the authors wrote in their paper .
The microchip devices could see a new social segregation in the form of " electronic apartheid , " computer virus infections that interfere with pacemakers , and a wealth of unknown health problems , the authors contend .
The advent of subdermal microchips is part of what the authors call ' uberveillance , ' which connotes the ability to automatically locate and identify individuals , and can be used to as a predictive mechanism for behaviour and traits .
Google Latitude typifies the term at present , Michael said , along with subdermal microchips and social networking tools .
She is currently testing the appeal of location - tracking through a pilot in which university students signed - up to the mobile location tool , Google Latitude , and recorded the amount of times they checked on the whereabouts of other participants .
Michael said students and respondents to earlier trials were surprised by how often they used the tool .
Yet for all the data collected by ' uberveillance ' technologies , Michael warns the actions or whereabouts of individuals cannot be guaranteed .
" There will be problems .
We will have too much data and not enough knowledge , " she said .
Michael is speaking at the 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society .
This story , " The Next Generation May be ' Chipped ' " was originally published by Computerworld Australia .

Republicans just killed unemployment benefit extensions for Americans out of pettiness and with an eye toward political gain .
They know that if the Democrats ca n’t help the economy by this fall , the Democrats will suffer at the polls .
The AP reports :
“ Republicans in the Senate have defeated an election - year bill to continue weekly jobless benefits for millions of long - term unemployed workers .
The 57 - 41 loss was a major blow for President Barack Obama and Democrats .
They needed three more votes — for a total of 60 — to stop a GOP filibuster .

The rejected bill would also have provided billions of dollars in new aid , protecting the jobs of tens of thousands of state and local government workers as the country begins to emerge from the worst recession in seven decades .
Democrats have been trying to advance the measure for months as an insurance policy against a double - dip recession .
Despite another round of cuts to the measure aimed at pacifying GOP deficit concerns , not a single Republican broke with party leaders determined to kill the measure for adding more than $ 30 billion to the deficit . ”
Not only do they not care about out of work Americans , but they do n’t care if America slides into a depression .
In fact , they are doing everything they can to ensure that happens so that they can use it to regain power .
“ The latest version of the measure contains a variety of provisions sought by lawmakers in both parties , blending jobless aid averaging about $ 300 a week with the renewal of dozens of tax cuts sought by business groups and a host of other legislation .
It is considerably smaller than a version that passed with GOP help just three months ago . ”
When the GOP wo n’t even vote yes on their own ideas , it ’s clear that they have a political agenda and that agenda has nothing to do with helping America right now .
Republicans who are oozing with sympathy for poor BP can’t muster one iota of concern or sympathy for Americans who are suffering right now .
This is truly disgraceful .
There is a time and place for partisan politics , and this is n’t it .
This is n’t about the deficit , it ’s about November .
Once again , the Republican Party shows where its true loyalty lay – and that ’s to its own power .
It looks like the Democrats will have to use reconciliation to govern around the Party of No once again .
Expect to hear squeals about a tyrannical government coming soon from your local Fox outlet .
Soon her car broke down , forcing her to rely on family and the public bus to get to work , which did not always happen .
Her boss had been kind , but patience wore thin .
“ She was like , ‘ Your baby sitter bailed on you , your car broke down .
What do you have left ? ’ ” Ms. Wallace said .
“ She said , ‘ If you ca n’t get something worked out , I ’m going to have to let you go . ’ ”
Even after she lost that job , Ms. Wallace remained confident she could find another .
Then it dawned on her .
Given the state of the social safety net , unemployment might provide the solution .
She could qualify for cash assistance , which would require her to enroll in a state jobs program and would include help securing child care .
“ It ’s something I have to do to get where I need to go , ” she said .
She plans to stay on cash assistance long enough to gain child care , then find another job .
She would then lose cash assistance , but could hang onto child care as long as her income stayed below the eligibility limit .
These were her thoughts as she stood in an airless office , amid the sounds of unhappy children in the arms of tired women , waiting to hand in the forms to receive welfare .
“ Oh no , ” she said , peeking inside a white envelope full of documents and spotting a brown smudge .
“ My kid got chocolate on her birth certificate . ”
She ducked into the ladies room and dabbed the stain with wet paper towel .
When she stepped outside an hour later , beneath a pounding Arizona sun , $ 220 a month was headed her way .
Her daughter was waiting at her parents ’ house .
Her future — a working car , a steady job — was waiting out there , too , she told herself , though it had a way of coming in and out of focus .
“ I ’m just trying to get my life situated to where I can look beyond the day to day , ” she said .
“ I hope it all falls together the way it all fell apart . ”
Many of the questions that I receive in my inbox at MyWifeQuitHerJob.com are related to opening a dropshipping business and I can definitely see the appeal .
When you run an online store that only offers dropshipped products , you do n’t have to worry about inventory and you do n’t have to worry about product fulfillment .
All you have to do is sell the product , take orders and make a decent profit .
Easy right ?
Unfortunately , it ’s not that simple and with anything that sounds too good to be true , there are always gotchas .
In theory , dropshipping sounds like a great idea because it ’s inherently scalable without you having to do a lot of work up front .
But when you dig down a bit further , there are a lot of complications that you need to be aware of .
Most people try to open up a dropshipped shop expecting it to be easy , but in reality , there ’s a lot more to it than you think .
This article will provide you with a realistic and comprehensive view of the pros and cons of dropshipping .

Dropshipping – A Video Overview
What Is Dropshipping ?
Dropshipping is an ecommerce business model where you can sell physical products online without having to deal with inventory , without having to own a warehouse to store your products and without having to deal with shipping and handling .
Basically , your supplier handles all of your product fulfillment needs .
When an order comes in , you notify your dropshipper and they ship your products directly to the customer on your behalf .
As a result , there is practically zero upfront cost to start a dropshipped online store because you do n’t have to invest any money on inventory .
In fact , you can literally start dropshipping for under $ 3 with a free open source shopping cart like WooCommerce .
All you need is a website , free credit card processing and you can start taking orders immediately .
Recently , my 9 and 11 year old kids launched their own dropshipped ecommerce store selling entrepreneurship t- shirts for only $ 2.95 .
You can check out their shop over at KidInCharge.com

Overall , dropshipping is the least expensive way to get started in ecommerce .
Is Dropshipping Legal ?
Dropshipping is 100 % legal as long as you obtain all of the necessary sellers permits like a traditional ecommerce store .
After all , a dropshipping business is just like any other online store except the supplier handles the shipping and you handle the orders .
In fact , many large companies like Target , Wayfair and Create & Barrel utilize dropshipping as an additional channel for generating sales .
However , certain forms of dropshipping are illegal on marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay .
For example , you are not permitted to dropship goods from Amazon to Ebay and vice versa .
In addition , dropshipping from AliExpress and other online markets are expressly prohibited on both Amazon and Ebay .
According to the terms of service for both marketplaces , purchasing products from another online retailer and having that retailer ship directly to customers is illegal if the shipment does not identify you as the seller of record .
However , if you only plan on dropshipping for your own website ( and not Amazon or Ebay ) , rest assured that dropshipping is 100 % legal as long as you obtain a business license and sellers permit .
How Much Money Can You Make Dropshipping
Dropshipping carries a much lower margin than a traditional ecommerce store .
In my experience , dropshipping margins range anywhere from 10 % - 30 % .
But this number can vary greatly depending on the type of products you sell online .
For example , I have friends who achieve 50% - 60 % margins dropshipping perfume , jewelry and large oversized items like stoves and outdoor grills .
I also know a colleague who dropships personalized funeral urns and caskets that command high margins because his niche is not price sensitive .
Overall , your margins will depend on how crowded your market is and the level of competition .
But for a typical dropshipped store , you should assume a 10 - 30 % margin on average .
The best part about dropshipping is that your ecommerce business is infinitely scalable once you gain traction .
Without the need to carry inventory or physically ship orders out , you can focus your efforts on marketing and sales .
How To Get Started Dropshipping
Does dropshipping sound attractive to you ?
Here ’s what you need to get started .
First off , you must setup a website or a platform to take orders from .
Then , you have to partner up with a dropship wholesaler or distributor that is willing to ship products direct to end consumers .
As part of your partnership , you and the dropship supplier will decide on a wholesale price for the products you want to sell .
Once an agreement is in place with your supplier , here ’s how dropshipping works .
The customer places an order for a product on your online store and you collect the money .

Here ’s how to get started with dropshipping in 3 easy steps .
Step # 1 : Start Your Dropshipping Website
Setting up your dropshipping website is actually the simplest part of the entire process because there are so many “ easy to use ” options available today .
Overall , your ecommerce platform decision will be based on your budget , what features you need and how tech savvy you are .
To save you time , here are my top 3 shopping cart recommendations .
Shopify
Shopify is a fully hosted shopping cart platform that handles everything for you and is the easiest way to get started .
Upon signup , Shopify will provide you with a secure website and free built - in credit card processing so you can start taking orders right away .
The main downside to Shopify is that it is the most expensive solution of the bunch but you can get up and running immediately without knowing anything about technology .

BigCommerce
Similar to Shopify , BigCommerce is also a robust , fully hosted platform that is very easy to use .
While it ’s less popular than Shopify , you get more bang for your buck and the support is excellent .

WooCommerce
WooCommerce is the most popular shopping cart in the world because the software is 100 % free .
But the downside is that you have to set up everything yourself and you need to host your own website .
However , the $ 2.95 price tag is tough to beat !

Step # 2 : Research Profitable Dropshipping Products To Sell
Because dropshipping margins tend to be lower , the best dropshipping products to sell are goods that carry a higher price tag .
If this is your first time selling online , here are some product guidelines that you should follow .
The product ’s inherent value should be ambiguous –
It is much easier to command premium pricing on products that are not easily comparison shopped .
As a result , try to stay away from electronics and focus on items that do n’t have an intrinsic value .

Choose a niche with lots of related products –
The key to running a successful dropshipped store is to cross sell your goods .
If a customer buys a BBQ grill , sell them cooking utensils and an outdoor thermometer .
Repeat business is key .

Sell goods where the average order size is at least $ 50 – Because margins are lower with dropshipping , you want to make sure that you can generate a decent profit per sale
– Because margins are lower with dropshipping , you want to make sure that you can generate a decent profit per sale Sell products that are timeless – Avoid products that go obsolete within a short period of time .
After all , the more often a product turns over , the more work it will be for you to update your product listings and maintain your website .
This is yet another reason to avoid electronic related products like iPhone cases because they change so often .
In addition to the guidelines above , you should also consider the following .
Is personalization an option ?
–
People are always willing to pay more for personalized goods so it ’s in your best interests to choose a product that lends itself to customization .

Step # 3 : Find Dropship Suppliers
Because dropshipping is so popular and the internet is ripe with scammers , you first must learn how to spot a FAKE wholesaler .
First off , a REAL wholesaler will never charge a monthly fee for the privilege of accessing their catalog of goods .
Genuine dropship wholesalers are merely distributors and their goal is to sell their product in bulk , not run a monthly membership site .
Second of all , a real dropship supplier will never sell their own products to the end consumer at wholesale prices .
Remember , a wholesaler ’s primary customer is a retail shop and it would go against their best interests to compete with their own customers .
In any case , once you know what to look for , you can start looking for real suppliers using the strategies outlined below .
Contact The Manufacturer
The easiest way to find a legit dropship supplier is to simply call the manufacturer and ask for a list of wholesale distributors .
Then once you have this list , you can contact the distributor directly and ask them if they are willing to dropship .
What ’s convenient is that most distributors carry a wide variety of products from a number of different manufacturers .
As a result , if you can land a big distributor , you ’ll almost always gain instant access to a large catalog of items to carry in your shop !
But establishing a partnership with a distributor can be hit or miss and you need to be prepared .
Most legit suppliers only want to deal with legit retailers so make sure you have all of your ducks in a row before you reach out to them .
Sometimes it helps to have a mock website up and running to show them you are serious .
But bottom line , you need to prove to your suppliers that you are the real deal and that you can actually move product !

Order From Your Competitor
If you know that your competitor runs a dropshipped online store , then you can find out who their suppliers are by simply placing an order .
Once you receive your package , you can look at the shipping label for a return address .
While the shipping label may not have the supplier ’s name on it , you can easily Google the address and find the name of the distributor .
Attend Wholesale Trade Shows
Instead of contacting vendors via email or phone , it ’s often much more efficient to find your suppliers at a tradeshow .
Not only does meeting face to face make it easier to develop a personal relationship , but you can also touch and handle the vendor ’s entire product catalog .
Most tradeshows ( at least in the US ) are 100 % free as long as you have a business license .
As a result , you have nothing to lose for attending .
Most major cities have wholesale tradeshows many times per year in a variety of niches .
Use Dropship Directories
A dropship directory is a database of suppliers that are organized by niche and it can be a convenient way to quickly find products to sell for dropshipping .
In addition , companies like Worldwide Brands pre-vet every company in their directory to make sure that they are legit .
The main downside to using a wholesale directory is that the distributors and products are easily accessible to other members who sign up for the directory as well .
As a result , the products you find in a directory may be more competitive .
However that being said , wholesale directories are a great way to brainstorm and find vendors immediately .

What To Look For In A Dropship Supplier
Because your business hinges on the quality of your dropshipper , here are a few attributes that you should look for when evaluating your suppliers .
Remember , successful dropshipping requires a partnership between you and your distributor and trust is essential .
As a result , before you rely on any dropship vendor , you should always place a test order to see how the order is handled .
Specifically , you should look for …
How Fast The Order Ships – Shipping time is extremely important for an ecommerce store and it ’s essential that orders are shipped within 1 - 2 business days
– Shipping time is extremely important for an ecommerce store and it ’s essential that orders are shipped within 1 - 2 business days How The Order Is Packed – Is the product shoved in a crappy box with packing peanuts ?
Is the box unmarked without the suppliers business name ?
Will the product arrive safely and undamaged ?

Is the box unmarked without the suppliers business name ?
Will the product arrive safely and undamaged ?
The Quality Of Customer Service – Do they respond in a timely manner ?
Do they provide tracking information and an invoice ?
Do they give refunds for defective merchandise and returns ?
Before you start selling , you should pick up the phone and ask the customer support rep in depth questions about the product to see if they know their stuff .
Specifically , here are some sample questions to ask .
Can you do customization ?
–
You can often command premium pricing for personalized goods so customization is a huge plus .

What is the warranty period and what does it cover ?
–

– How long are the products being sold covered under warranty and how can a customer redeem it ?
Do you use EDI ?
– EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange and is an automated way for a dropship supplier to transmit their inventory stock to your website in real time .
EDI keeps your store and your supplier in sync which makes customer support much easier .
In addition to the above questions , it ’s also important to ask for a single point of contact at your distributor to deal with customer support and product issues that may arise when you start selling their product .
For example , what happens when a product is out of stock ?
What happens if you sell a product that has been discontinued ?
What happens if shipping is late or misses a deadline ?
All of these factors matter and you should take some time to vet your vendor for quality .
Running Your Dropshipped Store And Issues That May Arise
While running a dropshipped ecommerce store is more hands off than a traditional online store , there are specific aspects of dropshipping that you need to be aware of as you run your business .
Handling Returns And Refunds
Even though you are not in charge of product fulfillment , you are still responsible for accepting returns and providing customer support for defective merchandise .
After all , you are the face of your business and the customer is not aware of the dropshipping arrangement you have with your supplier .
As a result , you have to deal with returns yourself and you ca n’t depend on your supplier for customer support .
Here ’s how returns are handled for a typical dropshipped store .
The customer asks for a refund by contacting your customer support phone or email .
for a refund by contacting your customer support phone or email .
You contact your supplier for an RMA number

Your customer sends the product back to your supplier with the RMA number clearly indicated on the packaging

You provide the refund to your customer
In addition to the above process , your supplier may charge a restocking fee which you can either pass along to your customer or you can choose to eat the cost .
Either way , it ’s all a part of doing business .
Dealing With Out Of Stock Products
When a customer orders a product that is out of stock , it is your responsibility to communicate this to the customer .
Typically , you should give your customer 3 options .
Wait for the product to come back in stock and provide an ETA
to come back in stock and provide an ETA Exchange the product for a similar item
for a similar item Refund their money
Dealing With Multiple Dropshippers And Shipments
If you work with multiple dropshippers , your customer may purchase multiple products that span multiple suppliers .
When this occurs , the customer will receive their order broken apart into multiple shipments .
In addition , you will be charged separate shipping costs from each dropship supplier .
When situations like this arise , you must inform the customer so that they are not confused .
Because it also costs you more money to ship across different dropshippers , you can either charge an additional shipping fee or eat the cost .
The Pros Of Dropshipping
If you are able to find quality dropship suppliers , then dropshipping is extremely attractive because you can run your business from anywhere .
All you need is a computer and an internet connection and you are good to go .
As a result if you are brand new to ecommerce with a small budget , you can use dropshipping as a stepping stone to get started and then transition to more lucrative business models when you are ready .
In addition to convenience , here are some other benefits of dropshipping .
Dropshipping Pro # 1 : The Setup Costs Are Practically Zero
Here ’s the bare minimum investment required to start a dropshipped online store if you use a free open source shopping cart platform .
If you tally everything up above , that comes out to between $ 2.95 and $ 52.95 .
Bottom line …
There is no upfront inventory cost .
There are no warehouse costs .
There is almost zero overhead .
I ca n’t think of any business model that is less expensive to start
Dropshipping Pro # 2 : It ’s Simple To Setup
Back when I started my online store , my options were limited .
But today there are literally hundreds of services out there that will help you setup an ecommerce store in less than a day .
The right option for you depends on your budget , what features you need and how extensible you need your ecommerce platform to be .

Dropshipping Pro # 3 : The Risks Are Much Lower
The beauty of dropshipping is that there is practically no risk .
Because you are investing so little money upfront , there is very little to lose .
Because your business is inventory - less , there ’s no pressure to make sales because you do n’t have to bear the overhead of storage or shipping .
In addition , you can carry a huge variety of items in your store because you do n’t have to store any of it !
If you browse dropship directories like Worldwide Brands , you ’ll find dropship suppliers for practically any niche you can think of .
You can choose to carry 1 product or 1000 products online .
It does n’t matter !
Once you figure out what you want to sell , you can usually find a dropship supplier to supply it .
Dropshipping Pro # 4 : Dropshipping Is Location Independent
A dropshipping business can be run from anywhere .
You do n’t need an office or a warehouse or any employees at all .
As a result of this freedom , you can focus your efforts on growing your business instead of taking care of inventory and overhead .
Overall , dropshipping is one of the most scalable ecommerce business models out there because your overhead does not grow linearly with sales .
In fact , I have several colleagues who run good sized dropship businesses with just a handful of people .
The Cons Of Dropshipping
If your gut is telling you that dropshipping sounds too good to be true , then your instincts are correct .
As with everything in life , there are always downsides to every business model .
Most people stumble into dropshipping with the expectation of quick riches only to realize that making money with a dropshipped store is actually much harder than they anticipated .
Below are all of the cons of dropshipping that you must consider .
Editor ’s Note :

Dropshipping Con # 1 : You Wo n’t Be Getting The Lowest Price
Most people open up a dropshipped online store with the misconception that they will be receiving the same wholesale pricing as everyone else for their products .
In reality however , dropship distributors often charge extra fees and / or tack these fees onto the quoted wholesale price .
Put yourself in your distributor ’s shoes for a moment .
Would you prefer to sell a large bulk quantity of products all at once to a store or would you rather sell onesy , twosy amounts to individual customers and be forced to individually ship and pack each item ?
The distributor is doing all of the work here and this will be certainly be reflected in your wholesale price .
To throw out some numbers , most dropship stores get between 10 - 30 % gross margins whereas most traditional shops that carry inventory have 50 % gross margins .
It ’s a huge difference !
Because your wholesale prices are higher than a traditional store , you will not be able to compete as effectively on price unless you take a good sized profit hit .
In addition , lower margins will inhibit your ability to advertise on sites like Facebook and Google .
Not only that , but less profit per sale also makes customer service problematic .
For example with our online store , our margins are between 70 - 90 % .
As a result whenever we get an angry customer , we simply give them a refund AND let them keep the product .
Because our margins are so high , we can afford to take the hit .
With dropshipping , the convenience of not having to fulfill orders comes at a cost .
Dropshipping Con # 2 : You Will Need To Charge Higher Shipping Costs
Often times , you will require the use of several dropship distributors to fully flesh out the product selection for your store .
Using 2 or more different dropshippers means that 2 or more companies will be making separate shipments to your customers , which means that 2 or more companies will be charging you their own separate shipping costs .
If I ’m a customer and I buy products from your store across 3 different distributors , you will have to charge me a much higher shipping cost just so you can break even .
The only way around this is to only use one dropship distributor which may not carry the breadth of products that you need .
The result is that you will have to pass these extra costs onto the consumer which reduces your price competitiveness .
Dropshipping Con # 3 : Dropshipping Can Be A Logistical Nightmare
You might think that since the dropship distributor is doing all the work that you can sit back and relax .
Unfortunately , you have to deal with your customer base .
You have to be the one that answers all of the questions .
You have to be the one to apologize when an order does n’t arrive on time .
The main problem is that when you use several different dropship distributors , getting the entire order to the end customer can be a logistical nightmare .
All distributors will have different shipping times and will be shipping from completely different locations .
If a customer orders products across 3 different distributors , they will end up receiving 3 different packages at varying times .
If an order is particularly time sensitive and needs to be rushed , you will have to make sure that all of your distributors can deliver the product on time .
In effect , you are staking the reputation of your online store and linking yourself to all of your dropship distributors in a single chain .
If even a single distributor is unreliable , then it will reflect negatively on your online store .
Dropshipping Con # 4 : Your Customer Service Will Be Out Of Your Hands
Customer service and your online reputation can make or break your business .
With the world wide web , social media and Twitter , news of a botched transaction can spread extremely fast so it is absolutely crucial that you maintain a great image for your online store .
Whenever I receive a call for our online wedding linens store , I always take the time to ask how they found us .
And the majority of the time , the people who find us do so because they were referred to us by one of their friends .
Word travels fast .
Our customer service is one of the main reasons why we have grown over 3 x in the past 3 years .
With dropshipping , you unfortunately have very little control over your customer service .
Since you are not in charge of product fulfillment , you ca n’t control when a customer will receive their product .
If a customer wants to make a return , it ’s a major pain because you have to make sure that you get your money back before you can provide a refund .
Sure , there are always ways to mitigate these problems but the solution inevitably involves either raising prices or taking a profit hit at the expense of customer satisfaction .
Dropshipping Con # 5 : Amazon Makes Dropshipping Even Less Attractive
Prior to Amazon , it was much harder for companies to sell their goods to the masses .
As a result , distributors had to rely on traditional retailers and dropshippers to help them move product .
Today , Amazon controls such a large piece of the ecommerce pie that most companies can get by with just selling on Amazon as a 3rd party seller .
Amazon handles your sales , your product fulfillment , your customer service … basically everything that a traditional retailer would typically take care of .
But the difference is that the distributor gets to keep all of the extra profit !
If you are a dropshipped store selling the exact same products that can be found on Amazon , it will be impossible to compete on price .
As a result , you will have very little leverage .
After all , would you rather buy from Amazon at a lower price or pay more to buy from an unknown shop ?

Other Dropshipping Business Models
All of the dropshipping methods mentioned thus far involve taking orders on your own website and relying on legit dropship suppliers to fulfill your orders .
However , there are other methods of dropshipping that you should be aware of but they are NOT recommended .
All of the dropshipping methods described below are not good long term business models and should be avoided altogether .
Dropshipping From Amazon To Ebay
Dropshipping from Amazon to Ebay became popular because it literally requires zero upfront cost .
You do n’t need a website and all of your sales come from Ebay .
Here ’s how it works
You put up a listing on Ebay for a product that you want to sell at a higher price than Amazon
for a product that you want to sell at a higher price than Amazon
When a customer places their order , you make an indentical purchase on Amazon and have it shipped to the Ebay customer
you make an indentical purchase on Amazon and have it shipped to the Ebay customer
You pocket the difference in price
First off , this form of Ebay dropshipping is no longer allowed and Ebay reserves the right to ban your account if you are ever caught .
While dropshipping is technically legal on Ebay , they only allow dropshipping when orders are fulfilled directly from a wholesale supplier .
You are NOT allowed to fulfill your goods from Amazon , Walmart or any marketplace .
Dropshipping To Amazon From AliExpress
Dropshipping is technically allowed on Amazon as well but the order must be fulfilled from a legit wholesale supplier .
And like Ebay , Amazon reserves the right to ban your account if you try to fulfill your order from a 3rd party marketplace .
For the past few years , “ get rich quick ” business owners started dropshipping cheap junk from AliExpress on Amazon and pocketing the difference in cost .
This process is called AliExpress Dropshipping and here ’s how it works .
You put up a listing on Amazon for an AliExpress product that you want to sell
for an AliExpress product that you want to sell
When a customer places their order , you make a purchase on AliExpress for the identical product and have it shipped to the Amazon customer
you make a purchase on AliExpress for the identical product and have it shipped to the Amazon customer
You pocket the difference in price
Please do not try this business model as it relies on a shipping loophole called ePacket that will soon be obsolete .
When Dropshipping Makes Sense
While I would never start a pure dropshipped store today , there are many ways to use dropshipping to your advantage .
Because you do n’t have to carry inventory , you can instantly throw up an online store with hundreds of products in a short period of time .
Then , you can use this shop to conduct market research .
Based on which products sell well , you can pick and choose the most successful products to buy inventory for and enjoy higher margins .
Dropshipping is best used as a vehicle for product validation or for fleshing out an online store that is sparse in certain categories .
Overall , it ’s best to use dropshipping when …
You need product validation – Dropshipping is a great way to test new products with zero upfront risk .
By running ads and quickly testing the market , you can decide whether you want to go all in on a product niche .

When To Avoid Dropshipping
Unless you are a brand new entrepreneur on a budget or an online store owner who is exploring new products , dropshipping is generally not a good choice for seasoned shop owners .
Because you are selling other people ’s products , it ’s difficult to build your own brand .
After all , there so many aspects of your supply chain and your customer service that are beyond your control .
For example , you have no control over the customer unboxing experience because more often than not , your product will arrive in an unmarked brown box with zero branding .
If an order is shipped late or never arrives , the blame is on you .
You also have no control over inventory .
If you have a hot selling product but the supplier is out of stock , then you wo n’t make any money .
In a nutshell , your dropshipped business lives and dies with your suppliers .
If they are not reliable , then you wo n’t succeed .
Therefore , if your goal is to build a brand , then dropshipping is not the way to go .
Overall , if any of the below describes your situation , then avoid dropshipping .
You are trying to build a brand – With dropshipping , you are fundamentally selling someone else ’s products which means that you are not building a brand .
In addition , because fulfillment is not under your control , you have very little sway when it comes to managing the customer experience .

You want high margins – Margins are always going to be a problem with dropshipped stores .
With only 10 - 30 % margins , your advertising options are limited and you ’ll often have to rely on SEO or social media to promote your business .
– Margins are always going to be a problem with dropshipped stores .
With only 10 - 30 % margins , your advertising options are limited and you ’ll often have to rely on SEO or social media to promote your business .
You want exclusivity – When you sell dropshipped goods , there are likely hundreds of other vendors selling the exact same product which always limits your pricing power .
You may also end up competing head to head with Amazon and larger stores as well .
Is Dropshipping Really Less Work ?
It really depends .
Arguably , the time that you save in not having to deal with inventory and fulfillment will be spent dealing with customers unless you have a reliable core of dropship distributors .
One thing that I forgot to mention is that many drop shippers do n’t use automated supply chain technology with a real time API .
What this means is that you may not be alerted in real time whether a particular product is available for sale or not .
Therefore if an item is out of stock , you will have to interface with the customer to let them know when they can have their items .
Unless your shopping cart is closely tied with your dropshipper ’s database , it will be difficult to maintain an accurate inventory count .
With dropshipping , you are trading off not having to deal with fulfillment logistics with having to deal with more customer headaches .
And depending on your personality , this may or may not be a wise tradeoff .
While the tone of this article has been anti-dropshipping in general , do n’t get me wrong .
Many people have been successful with dropshipping as it works very well with small niche stores but my personal opinion is to avoid it if you can .

The Football Association has made a complaint to World Cup organisers Fifa after a fan breached security and entered the England dressing room .
The incident came after England 's 0 - 0 draw with Algeria in Group C at the Cape Town Stadium .
The intruder was escorted out shortly after a " few verbals " but the incident has angered the security - conscious FA .
" This is not acceptable and thankfully no serious harm was done , " read an FA statement on Friday evening .
Princes William and Harry , who have been on a tour of southern Africa , were in attendance in Cape Town and had been present in the dressing room after the match .
However , both members of the Royal family had left the dressing room by the time of the security breach .
" There is a lot of Fifa security in the stadium but unfortunately one fan got through all of that and managed to get into the dressing room after the game but thankfully no real harm other than a few verbals , " said Adrian Bevington , managing director of Club England .
The FA will expect security to be watertight as England head to Port Elizabeth for their final Group C match against Slovenia on Wednesday 23 June .
" Thankfully no real damage done but we got to make sure this can't happen again for us or for any other team , " added Bevington .
Purshoth Chetty , managing director of the Cape Town Stadium , insisted a full investigation would take place into the why the fan had " slipped through the crack " in security .
Chetty said : " This merits a serious review .
Our security process covers all aspects and we do not believe we will need to change our general arrangements .
But we are conducting a full analysis of how this happened .
" It 's not our security people 's fault , they do a sterling job wherever they go .
I 'm sure Fifa will accept responsibility for this and we have to make sure it does n't happen again . "
Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot said the governing body was not prepared to lay blame until the matter was further investigated .
" It is of course totally unacceptable for Fifa that a fan finds his way up into a dressing room of any participating team at any Fifa competition , " he stated .
" This has been discussed at the daily security meeting of the local organisers , police and Fifa .
Security will be tight to ensure it will never happen again . "
England 's travelling fans showed their displeasure with their team 's efforts by booing them off the pitch at the end of their second group game .
Striker Wayne Rooney looked into a TV camera and said : " Nice to see your own fans booing you , that 's what loyal support is " .

Son of Antigay Professor Comes Out
Jonathan Katz , a Washington University physics professor who wrote a widely circulated homophobic screed in 1999 has a son who is proudly gay .
Isaac Katz , 22 , contributed an essay to the St. Louis Post - Dispatch in which he announced that he came out to his mother as well as his father , Jonathan Katz , this summer .
This year the elder Katz was nominated to be part of an elite group of scientists who would work on tackling the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
When an essay came to light that Jonathan wrote 11 years ago proudly declaring his homophobia and accusing gay people of being responsible for AIDS , he was removed from the team by Energy secretary Steven Chu .
Issac Katz writes in the Post - Dispatch that he is coming out publicly because of the spate of reported gay suicides .
He finishes his piece by telling young gay people that " it does get better . "
Recent discourse concerning the Chinese People ’s Liberation Army ’s ( PLA ) modernization has principally focused on technological advances and less on the human dimension of PLA force transformation .
In particular , a review of these discussions revealed the absence of a publicly available database of Chinese military leaders with the rank of full general ( shangjiang ) .
Against the backdrop of the PLA ’s stated intention to reorient the armed forces as part of its modernization efforts , an analysis of promotion patterns of the 118 PLA generals ( 1981 – 2009 ) may yield important insights into the foci of PLA force transformation .
PLA to Build Up Navy and Air Force
A string of recent statements by senior Chinese military officials alluding to the realignment of the PLA indicates that significant changes in the composition of the armed forces may be in the offing .
In April , the Chinese Defense Ministry ’s spokesperson Senior Colonel Huang Xueping stated during an interview that , “ It ’s quite natural that we want to build up a streamlined [ emphasis added ] military force which has more focus on technologies rather than man power ” ( NPR , April 22 ) .
Huang ’s statement , taken in the context of increasing Chinese naval assertiveness in international waters near Japan and in the South China Sea in recent years , has raised questions over the PLA ’s intentions and capabilities .
To be sure , the Chinese military leadership seems to be signaling its intention to depart from its long - held emphasis on the army for the air force and navy .
By enhancing the role of the navy and air force , the goal of its effort appears aimed at extending China ’s military power projection capability into the Pacific while reducing the size of its total military force .
According to Senior Colonel Yang Chengjun , a researcher with the Second Artillery Force of the PLA , the proportion of the army in the Chinese military is a “ problem ” rooted in history and points out the need to “ optimize the composition of different arms ” in order for the Chinese military to meet its modern day challenges ( Global Times [ China ] , January 28 ) .
Echoing the Chinese Defense Ministry ’s position , the director of the Centre for Arms Control and International Security Studies at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing , Teng Jianqun , considers China ’s focus on naval and air force development to be “ inevitable ” ( Global Times , January 28 ) .
Taking the analysis one step further , Xu Guangyu , a retired PLA major general now with the government think tank China Arms Control and Disarmament Association ( CACDA ) , believes that China can achieve these transformative goals with a budgetary allocation among China ’s army , navy and air force at a 50:25:25 ratio , representing a shift from the current 60:20:20 ratio .
Xu does not see a 40:30:30 ratio since he believes that China ’s naval and air power will “ mostly be used to enhance the combat effectiveness of our [ China ’s ] ground forces ” ( NPR , April 22 ; China Times [ Taiwan ] , April 24 ) .
Xu ’s statement seems to imply that the PLA — at least for the time being — is not emulating American global power projection capabilities supported and enabled by U.S. military budgets that have in recent years allocated resources among the army , navy and air force roughly along a 40:30:30 ratio [ 1 ] .
“ Far Sea Defense ” Strategy
The advent of the PLAN ’s “ far sea defense ” ( yuanyang fangyu ) strategy calling for the development of China ’s long - range naval capabilities , appears to be one of the major drivers behind the push to transform the composition of the Chinese armed forces ( New York Times , April 23 ) .
Yin Zhuo , a retired PLAN rear admiral who is now a senior researcher at the navy ’s Equipment Research Center , stated in an interview with People ’s Daily Online that the PLAN is tasked with two primary missions : preservation of China ’s maritime security ( including territorial integrity ) and the protection of China ’s burgeoning and far - flung maritime economic interests .
And while the former is still the PLAN ’s chief concern , the PLAN is beginning to prioritize more attention to the latter ( Ta Kung Pao [ Hong Kong ] , February 26 ) .
Rear Admiral Zhang Huachen , deputy commander of the PLAN ’s East Sea Fleet argues that , “ With the expansion of the country ’s economic interests , the navy wants to protect the country ’s transportation routes and the safety of our major sea lanes ” ( New York Times , April 23 ) .
The rear admirals ’ statements present a legitimate rationale behind the PLAN ’s new strategy .
The far sea defense strategy is significant for two reasons .
First , it declares that China ’s naval ambitions extend beyond its traditional coastal area or “ near sea ” ( jinyang ) .
Secondly , it expands the PLAN ’s defense responsibilities to include the protection of China ’s maritime economic interests — which China ’s latest defense whitepaper did not explicitly address [ 2 ] .
It stands to reason then that a possible key motivation behind the reorientation of China ’s armed forces stems from China ’s perceived need to project power beyond its coastal area to where the PLAN is required to carry out the newly expanded far sea defense duties .
CMC as China ’s Highest Military Commanding Body
As the highest military policy and commanding body in China , the CMC supervises and commands five service branches of China ’s armed forces : the PLA ground forces , PLAN , PLAAF , Second Artillery Corps ( SAC ) and the People ’s Armed Police ( PAP ) ( which falls under the joint leadership of the CMC and the State Council ) .
Since the restoration of military rank ( junxian ) in 1988 , the CMC has promoted 118 military leaders to generals : 17 under Deng Xiaoping ( 1981 -1989 ) , 79 under Jiang Zemin ( 1989 - 2004 ) and 22 to date under Hu Jintao ( 2004 - present ) ( see Table 1 ) .

( Source : www.baidu.com, www.hudong.com, and author ’s tabulation )
Ground Forces Represent Bulk of Chinese Generals
The Chinese military has traditionally been influenced by its ground forces because of China ’s historical status as a land power .
Additionally , the PLA ground forces can trace their roots to the 1920s , predating the founding of the People ’s Republic of China and all other service branches .
Therefore , ground forces generals not surprisingly represent a lion ’s share or 71 percent of the total .
Yet ,
Hu has promoted substantially more “ non- ground forces ” ( PLAN , PLAAF , SAC and PAP ) generals than his predecessors .
In percentage terms , 45 percent of Hu ’s generals are non-ground forces , compared to 25 percent and 24 percent for Jiang ’s and Deng ’s , respectively ( see Table 1 ) .
Strategic Second Artillery Corps
The CMC directly supervises and commands the SAC , which controls China ’s nuclear arsenal and conventional missiles .
Its small manpower ( estimated at 100,000 or 3 percent of Chinese military manpower ) notwithstanding , the SAC has produced a disproportionately large number of generals .
Of the 118 military leaders promoted to generals , 6 ( or 5 percent of the total ) were SAC generals — which may be an indication of the SAC ’s special status in China ’s armed forces .
Hu has promoted the most SAC generals in percentage terms ( 9 percent ) , compared to Deng ( 6 percent ) and Jiang ( 4 percent ) ( See Table 1 ) .
Hu ’s relative overweight in his SAC generals is a reflection of the strategic emphasis he places on the SAC .
Internally Oriented People ’s Armed Police
While other service branches are externally oriented , the internally oriented PAP is charged with “ the fundamental task of safeguarding national security , maintaining social stability and ensuring that the people live in peace and contentment ” [ 3 ] .
Jiang successfully incorporated the PAP into the CMC ’s command structure by promoting the first PAP general in 1998 .
Altogether , he promoted 5 PAP generals , representing 6 percent of his total .
Continuing the emphasis on PAP generals ,
Hu has promoted 2 PAP generals , representing 9 percent of his total ( see Table 1 ) .
Since domestic stability remains among Hu’s and the CCP ’s highest governing priorities , one can expect Hu to continue promoting PAP generals .
Hu to Promote More PLAN Admirals
Excluding the strategic SAC and the internally oriented PAP to determine the relative proportions among the army , navy and air force generals , one finds that 33 percent of Hu ’s generals are non-ground forces ( PLAN an PLAAF ) , compared to 17 percent and 19 percent for Jiang ’s and Deng ’s , respectively .
In other words , Hu ’s generals are 67 percent army , 11 percent navy and 22 percent air force .
Jiang ’s generals were 83 percent army , 7 percent navy and 10 percent air force , whereas Deng ’s generals were 81 percent army , 13 percent navy and 6 percent air force ( see Table 2 ) .
Hu appears to have begun the process of reorienting his generals by emphasizing the promotions of military leaders in the navy and air force .
Given China ’s naval ambitions and the relative under-representation of PLAN admirals ( when benchmarked against Xu ’s stated target proportion at 25 percent ) , one can therefore expect Hu to emphasize the promotions of PLAN admirals .
Table 2 . Relative promotion weightings ( % ) by service branch
Ground forces Navy Air force Total Deng 81 % 13 % 6 % 100 % Jiang 83 % 7 % 10 % 100 % Hu 67 % 11 % 22 % 100 % Total 80 % 9 % 11 % 100 %
( Source : author ’s calculation )
Hu Regularizes Promotions of Generals
As CMC chairman , Deng promoted 17 generals in a single “ class ” in 1988 .
Jiang on average promoted generals once every two years between 1989 and 2004 , with the average “ class size ” at about 10 generals .
Hu on average has promoted generals once every year between 2004 and 2009 with the average class size at 4 generals .
Where Jiang appears to have institutionalized the promotion process , Hu appears to have regularized the promotion process .
Implications
If Hu continues to promote generals at roughly the same pace as he has in the past , he could reasonably promote another 10 generals by the end of his tenure as CMC chairman in 2012 ( although he may hold on to CMC chairmanship beyond 2012 following Jiang ’s example ) .
Given the reorientation of China ’s armed forces as a PLA priority , one should expect to see an overweighting in the promotions of non-ground forces generals in Hu ’s remaining tenure .
Of the additional 10 Hu generals , assuming one slot is set aside for each of the SAC and PAP , one may find it reasonably likely that the other 8 could comprise 3 army , 3 navy and 2 air force generals .
This combination will result in a final relative weighting of 58 percent army , 19 percent navy and 23 percent air force for Hu ’s generals — a directionally consistent outcome when compared with Xu ’s stated goal of 50 percent army , 25 percent navy and 25 percent air force .
The number of PLA Navy admirals is not likely to leapfrog as Hu is expected to continue his gradualist and balanced approach in promoting his generals in the future , taking into consideration each service branch ’s interests and representation as in the past .
This also reflects
Hu ’s rather cautious approach to the military given his lack of a military background .
Yet the goals are clear .
This is only the beginning of a long - term trend .

Education Week 's Rick
Hess explains how snowbird retired teachers are screwing newbie instructors ( and us ) from the comfort of Florida 's lovely sandy beaches :
New York City 's teachers may do well to ask why their union , the United Federation of Teachers ( UFT ) , has an office in Boca Raton , Florida .
A recent article in the New York Post figured that rent alone for the Boca Raton branch costs UFT members $ 183,603 per year .
That 's not peanuts for a union fretting about its financially strapped members .
One reason for the Boca branch , as I noted a little while back , is that the retirees in the UFT are more active in UFT elections than the current teachers .
The UFT website notes , " The UFT maintains an office in Boca Raton to service our retired members in Florida .
These members make up a potent voting bloc , last year helping to elect two new members of Congress with favorable positions on our issues . "
NYC teachers may wonder whether their retired brethren are allies , or a competing constituency .
And what do these retirees get in exchange for their faithful participation ?
Thanks to something called " retention rights , " union members with seniority get first shot at sweet summer gigs in NYC :
Former teachers who desire a few extra bucks for greens fees or lawn care can up and keep returning to New York City to teach summer school–bumping current teachers from these per session jobs .
And , so long as they keep doing it , they can keep doing it .
One reliable source in the NYCDOE estimates that there are " hundreds of teachers who take advantage of retention rights . "
At the per session hourly rate of $ 41.98 , with average summer school lengths ranging from 60 to 150 hours , the average per session teacher is earning between $ 2,500 and $ 6,300 – that 's probably a million bucks or more a year that snow birds are claiming from current teachers .

Israel has released and is in the process of deporting the remaining British activists arrested in its raid on a Gaza - bound aid convoy .
Foreign Secretary William Hague has said 37 British nationals , including 11 with dual nationality , were involved .
Five have already been deported .
He said he was concerned at the raid taking place in international waters .
Prime Minister David Cameron condemned it as " completely unacceptable " , saying he deplored the loss of life .
In his first Commons question time , he said everything should be done to prevent it happening again .
Israel is in the process of deporting nearly all of the 682 detainees .
The remaining Britons are currently either on flights or awaiting planes at Ben Gurion airport , Tel Aviv , the BBC understands .
Consular staff are ready to provide assistance both at the airport and in Turkey , the Foreign Office has said .
' Humanitarian catastrophe '
None of the Britons was currently believed to have been involved in any violence against Israeli servicemen who boarded the ships , Mr Hague told MPs .
Nine activists died when Israeli commandos boarded the six - ship convoy on Monday , prompting increased international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Mr Cameron told the Commons : " We should do everything we can to make sure this does n't happen again .
" Friends of Israel - and I count myself a friend of Israel - should be saying to the Israelis that the blockade actually strengthens Hamas 's grip on the economy and on Gaza .
" And it 's in their own interests to lift it and allow these vital supplies to get through . "
He added : " We should do everything we can through the UN , where resolution 1860 is absolutely clear about the need to end the blockade and to open up Gaza . "
Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman called for the blockade to end and added : " This is a tragic loss of life which has angered the Palestinians and dismayed friends of Israel too . "
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg questioned whether it was in Israel 's interest to " confine " so many people .
He said the blockade was a " humanitarian catastrophe " and neither sustainable nor tenable " in its present form " .
Activist Hasan Nowarah , from Glasgow , said he was the first to be sent home because he had injured his leg during the raid .
Originally from Ramallah , he runs the Glasgow - based group Justice for Palestine and was in one of the smaller ships in the convoy .
" The minute they landed into our vessels they were shooting and killing innocent people , " he told the BBC .
" We were in the international water , we were not a threat of any kind to the Israeli civilan , government or army . "
Those held illegally by the Israeli government have committed no crime , they have simply attempted to avert a humanitarian disaster Betty Hunter
He said an Israeli soldier hit him on his back and leg with his gun .
" We were unarmed , all we had were the chairs and tables we were sitting on to defend ourselves from the Israeli guns , " he said .
Friends and relatives of those caught up in the raid have complained about the lack of communication .
Rachel Bridgeland , whose partner Peter Venner , 63 , from Ryde , Isle of Wight , was on the convoy , said more pressure should be applied on Israel .
She said : " It 's absolutely terrible not knowing what has happened to him and it's terrible that the British government has n't done more but they do n't want to fall out with Israel . "
Sarah Colborne , campaign and operations director for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign ( PSC ) , was also among those being held .
Image caption Israel had seized 682 people with the convovy of six ships
PSC general secretary Betty Hunter said : " Those held illegally by the Israeli government have committed no crime , they have simply attempted to avert a humanitarian disaster by bringing much - needed medical supplies into Gaza . "
Israel maintains the commandos were attacked first , saying its soldiers were attacked with " knives , clubs and other weapons " when they landed on the Mavi Marmara and had opened fire in self - defence .
Video clips show activists wielding a baseball bat and other objects , although some witnesses say they were acting in self - defence .
Former prime minister Tony Blair , a Middle East envoy , told the BBC the search for peace must continue , despite events .
He said : " We have got to continue the proximity talks that we want to turn into full blown direct negotiations over all the core issues between the Israelis and the Palestinians . "
He added any internationally - led inquiry must be " full and fair and impartial " .
How to produce feminized marijuana seeds
Creating feminized marijuana seeds is an art , there are a few different methods of application .
I have written about some of my different methods of making cannabis seeds in previous HIGH TIMES articles .
I have use gibberellic acid , light stress , ph stress , and fertilizer stress to force my plants to make marijuana seeds .
All these methods are harsh on the plants , and some like the gibbrellic acid , are not organic .
In my search for cleaner more earth - friendly ways of working with the cannabis plant , I have found a new way to make feminized cannabis seeds .
Feminized seeds occur as a result of stress , other than genetics .
All cannabis plants can and will make male flowers under stress .
Certain strains like a higher PH , some like a lower one .
Some like a lot of food , some like a lot less .
There is quite a lot of variety in marijuana genetics , and you ca n’t treat every plant the same way .
It takes many harvests before you really get to know a particular strain .
Just like getting to know human friends , it takes time .
I have grown strains for a decade and am truly getting to know every nuance the different plants exhibit .
I can recognize them from a distance .
I must say that I get a lot of help from my friends , both in making marijuana seeds and learning new and better ways of working with this sacred plant .
I named this new method “ Rodelization ” after a friend who helped me realize and make use of this way of creating female cannabis seeds .
After growing crop after crop of the same plant in the same conditions , I noticed that if I flowered the plants 10 - 14 days longer than usual , they would develop male “ bananas ” .
A male banana is a very slight male flower on a female marijuana plant that is formed because of stress .
Usually they do not let out any pollen early enough to make marijuana seeds , but they sometimes do .
They are a built in safety factor so in case of sever conditions , the plant can make sure that the species is furthered .
To me a male banana is quite a beautiful thing .
It has the potential of making all female pot seeds .
Many growers out there have male banana phobia .
They see one and have heart palpitations , they want to cut down the entire crop or at least take tweezers and pluck the little yellow emerging devices out .
I call them “ Emergency Devices ” because they emerge at times of stress .
In the Rodelization method , the male banana is very valuable .
After growing your female plant 10 - 14 days longer than usual , hang them up to dry , then carefully take them off the drying lines and inspect for bananas .
Each and every banana should be removed and placed in a small bag labeled very accurately .
These sealed bags can be placed in the fridge for one to two months and still remain potent .
For the second phase you need to already have a crop that ’s already 2 ½ weeks into flowering .
Take your sealed bag of pollen out of the fridge , and proceed to impregnate your new crop of females .
To do this , you must first match the female plant and the pollen from the same strain in the previous crop .
Shut down all the fans in the grow room .
Then take a very fine paint brush , dip it in the bag of pollen , and paint it on the female flower .
Do this to each different strain you have growing together .
I have done it with ten different kinds in the same room with great success .
I use the lower flowers to make weed seeds , leaving the top colas seedless for smoking .
This method takes time ( two crops ) , but is completely organic and lets you have great quality smoke at the same time you make your female cannabis seeds .
If you ’re one of those growers that has never grown marijuana seeds for fear of not having something good to smoke , you will love this method .
You can also use this pollen to make new female crosses by cross pollinating .
The older females with the bananas can be brought into the room with the younger , un-pollinated females when they are three weeks into flowering .
Turn all of the circulation fans on high , and the little bits of pollen will proceed to make it around the room .
Do this for several days .
Six to seven weeks later you will have ripe 100 % female seeds ; not nearly as many as a male plant would make , but enough to start over somewhere else with the same genetics .
As a farmer who has been forced to move his genetics far away from where they started , I know very well the value of seeds .
My friend Adam from THSeeds in Amsterdam has a motto that I love to borrow these days : “ Drop seeds not bombs ” .

LONDON -
The owners of a strip club in New Orleans have sued BP ’s boss Tony Hayward because they say the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has cost them their business .
Owners of The Mimosa Dancing Girls say that fishermen , who usually go to the club , now ca n’t afford it with the oil spill , the Sun reported .
BP is expected to start raising the cash to cover damages as early as next week through a 6.75 billion pounds bond sale , and is also understood to be in talks to raise 13.5 billion pounds through loans , with another 13.5 billion pounds from asset sales .
BP has already paid 70 million pounds to residents along the US Gulf Coast .

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration announced an agreement on Tuesday with other major powers , including Russia and China , to impose a fourth set of sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program , setting the stage for an intense tug of war with Tehran as it tries to avoid passage of the penalties by the full United Nations Security Council .
The announcement came just a day after Iranian leaders announced their own tentative deal , with Turkey and Brazil , to turn over about half of Iran ’s stockpile of nuclear fuel for a year , part of a frantic effort to blunt the American - led campaign for harsher sanctions .
“ This announcement is as convincing an answer to the efforts undertaken in Tehran over the last few days as any we could provide , ” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , describing the agreement as a “ strong draft . ”
But even if the Security Council adopts the new sanctions , it is unclear whether the provisions — including a mandate to inspect Iranian ships suspected of entering international ports with nuclear - related technology or weapons — would inflict enough pain to force Iran to halt its uranium enrichment and cooperate with international inspectors .
None of the previous three sets of sanctions passed by the Council during the Bush administration succeeded in their goal : forcing Iran to end its enrichment of uranium and to answer the many questions posed by international inspectors related to their suspicions about Iranian research into nuclear weapons .
( CNN ) -- South African activists are staging a " Poor People 's World Cup " to protest what they say is the exclusion of poor communities from the FIFA tournament .
The Cape Town - based Anti-Eviction Campaign ( AEC ) says it is staging the event because most South Africans are not benefiting from the official World Cup .
It says poor people can't afford match tickets and claims traders are being stopped from trading near stadiums , and that people were evicted from their homes in the run up to the competition .
AEC coordinator Ashraf Cassiem told CNN , " It 's an attempt by poor people in Cape Town to bring attention to their plight as a result of the World Cup and the effect it has on communities .
" It 's a platform created by poor people , for poor people , to expose the evictions and displacements affecting poor people in a negative way . "
People from 42 Cape Town communities have formed 36 teams , each of which is representing a World Cup nation -- plus four others .
The tournament , which is free , kicked off on 13 June at a playing field next to Athlone stadium and will continue over the next three Sundays .
" Everybody is crazy excited about it , " said Cassiem .
" More than 1,500 turned up despite a lack of transport for fans or communities .
People here are really crazy about soccer but wo n't get the opportunity to participate in the real FIFA World Cup . "
Cassiem said that poor South Africans would love the chance to see their footballing heroes play in the FIFA competition , but most can't afford match tickets .
The cheapest tickets cost $ 20 , which is more than some people earn in a week , Cassiem said .
FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke last month conceded that tickets might be too expensive for most Africans , with just 40,000 people from the rest of Africa traveling to South Africa for the World Cup .
And rather than benefiting financially from the influx of visitors , Cassiem claimed many people are losing their livelihoods .
He said many informal street traders are n't allowed to trade around World Cup stadiums , in an effort to protect FIFA 's official partners , and that many street vendors have been cleared from their usual trading locations in a bid to " clean up " Cape Town .
" Even the fan parks are run by FIFA and all goods traded in South Africa now have to be FIFA compliant , " said Cassiem .
" If you make goods with ' 2010 ' on them , they are confiscated .
For the next month and a half at least , FIFA owns all these host cities -- and they get the revenue . "
In April , informal traders ' spokesperson Cheche Selepe said he believed FIFA should adjust its rules and allow non-sponsors to sell their merchandise inside stadium perimeters .
" This is the African continent , there is great under - development , " he told CNN .
" There is big poverty in the country and therefore the majority of those survive in the informal sector of the economy , so to push them aside will be a recipe for disaster as far as we are concerned . "
However , FIFA argues that while it has created plenty of opportunities for small and medium - sized South African enterprises to benefit from the tournament , it also has a responsibility to protect its sponsors .
" A stadium is a FIFA perimeter , and within this perimeter there are people who have the rights to do things and others have no rights , " Valcke told CNN last month .
In an emailed statement to CNN , a spokeswoman for FIFA said it had been encouraging its partners to give preference to South African companies .
It said Adidas is now producing the majority of its World Cup - related shirts in South Africa and the South African company responsible for catering at stadiums has trained 5500 community staff to provide food and drink at venues during the tournament -- among them many of those who normally sell food in front of the stadiums .
The statement said : " FIFA is not targeting this sector [ informal traders ] and is letting the host cities run their own informal trading program .
" FIFA just wants [ to ensure ] that no counterfeits are sold and that the area directly surrounding the stadium is not used , but otherwise it is up to the host cities to regulate this form of trading . "
The AEC also claims some Cape Town residents have been moved to " Temporary Relocation Centers " outside the city in order to accommodate regeneration projects for the World Cup , and that homeless people have been removed so as not to offend visiting football fans .
Those claims were denied by city authorities .
City of Cape Town spokesperson Kylie Hatton told CNN that while there are FIFA - operated exclusion zones around stadiums , which have certain commercial agreements in place , street traders have not lost out because of the World Cup .
She said informal traders who have been moved to accommodate " Fan Fest " areas -- public screenings of World Cup matches -- are benefiting by being allowed to trade next to the Fan Fest areas and along a 2 ½ kilometer " Fan Walk " from the city 's train station .
" There 's been no relocation of people as a result of the World Cup , " she said , adding that rehousing in temporary relocation centers is part of an ongoing attempt to relieve the city 's chronic housing shortage .
Cassiem said there had been one upside to the tournament for poor communities .
" They say , ' this benefits us because we get the opportunity to show the world what 's really happening in South Africa . ' "

A paper published in Nature Materials this week details a new method for using nanotubes to generate significant amounts of power , at least for their size .
When multi- walled carbon nanotubes are covered with a material that produces an exothermic reaction , the nanotubes help conduct the heat in one focused direction .
To the apparent surprise of the researchers , this created an electrical pulse , a quick surge of power , that could be put to a number of uses .
When you couple a heat - activated material with exothermically - reactive chemicals , it 's theoretically possible to create self - propagating waves of heat .
However , there are a couple of problems with implementing systems like these .
The waves generally propagate in all directions , which is not terribly efficient for heat - or power - generating purposes .
Furthermore , materials that both prevent the wave of the pulse from scattering and can stand up to a large amount of heat are fairly rare .
To turn the theory into practice , scientists needed a material that was heat - proof up to a few thousand Kelvin and took a hard line against heat scattering , preferably concentrating it in a single direction .
They also needed it to be very small — the waves would propagate best , and at increasing velocities , if the phonons , or lattice vibration modes , had a mean free path about the same as the length of the material they propagated through .
Enter the carbon nanotube — a structure that is particularly apt at minimizing scattering .
When energy is given to them , it escapes , or dissipates , at very low rates .
Carbon nanotubes also have a high thermal conductivity and heat tolerance , making them ideal for functions that require them to be surrounded by very hot chemicals .
Being nano- , they are also small .
The team realized that if they could combine the carbon nanotube with the necessary exothermic reactions , they could create a very powerful system .
For the chemical reaction , scientists coated arrays of multi- walled carbon nanotubes with a thin layer of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine .
They then ignited the coated tubes on one end , with either laser irradiation or high - voltage electrical discharge , expecting that the coating would react to the heat , the reaction would propagate along the length of the nanotubes , and the nanotubes inside would help hold onto the heat generated by the reaction .
When the coating was ignited , scientists found that the waves generated by the reaction on the nanotubes moved 10,000 times faster than if the chemicals were burning in bulk .
The carbon nanotubes concentrated the heat , allowing the reaction to sweep along their length very quickly , which generated a sizeable amount of heat in a very short time and in a small space .
The rapid transit of the reaction down the nanotubes appeared to pull the electrons within it along .
This appears to be something that was n't predicted by theory , since the authors describe it by writing that they need to " introduce a new phenomenon that results from their effect on carrier propagation . "
( Of course , if it was completely unexpected , why measure current at all ? )
They refer to the combined reaction / heat / electrical pulse as a thermopower wave .
The maximum power the system could generate was 7 kilowatts per kilogram , greater than high - performance lithium ion batteries , and at a much higher discharge rate .
While this is significant , researchers found that this relationship decreased as the devices got bigger , and keeping them smaller helped preserve the larger power - to - mass ratios .
For generating thrust , the reactions on the nanotube had a similarly impressive metric : the impulse produced 300 Newton - seconds per kilogram .
Scaling this down to the size and weight of carbon nanotubes could make this number seem unimpressive , but the impulse was up to 100 times stronger than other microthruster systems .
While the power generated by these setups are large when measured next to a comparatively large unit of mass , the fact that they are necessarily small suggests their usage might be quite limited — at least , they probably wo n't be powering rockets off the earth anytime soon .
The systems are also single - use only since , once the reactive chemical is burned away , the nanotubes would have to be recoated to generate another reaction and more power .
Because of this , the system might be better suited for use in high - tech combustion applications .
Nonetheless , these coated carbon nanotubes could be an extremely powerful addition to many micro-mechanical systems , even in tiny doses .

An Indian outsourcing firm is to run one of its data handling centres in a local prison as part of a new public / private partnership .
Radiant Info Systems has come to a deal with the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to hire 200 inmates of a state jail to work on data entry , and the processing and transmitting of information .
" The idea is to ensure a good future for the educated convicts after they come out of jail , " CN Gopinath Reddy , director general of prisons in Andhra Pradesh , told the BBC .
" With their experience of working in the BPO [ business process outsourcing ] in jail , any company will absorb them in future . "
The outsourcing centre will handle banking information 24 hours a day using a shift system .
Inmates will be paid US $ 2.20 a day , compared to US $ 0.33 cents a day for other work .
The prison was chosen because it has almost 40 percent of inmates classified as educated .
The area also has good IT infrastructure .
" We have identified the area in the jail where the unit will come up .
It will have computers as well as connectivity , " Radiant Info Systems director C Narayana Charyulu said .
If successful the scheme will be extended to other prisons in the area .
A new study released this week finds that as the economy struggles to recover , and jobs slowly return , there will be a growing disconnect between the types of jobs employers need to fill and number of Americans who have the education and training to fill those jobs .
The report , Help Wanted : Projecting Jobs and Education Requirements
Through 2018 , by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce , notes that by 2018 , 63 percent of all jobs will require at least some postsecondary education .
The U.S. is on a collision course with the future , authors say .
Employers will need 22 million new workers with postsecondary degrees – and the report shows that we will fall short by three million workers without a dramatic change in course .
The data translates into a deficit of 300,000 college graduates every year between now and 2018 .
“ America needs more workers with college degrees , certificates and industry certifications , ” said Anthony P. Carnevale , one of the authors of the report .
“ If we do n’t address this need now , millions of jobs could go offshore . ”
At a time when every job is precious , a major shortfall will add to lost economic opportunity for millions of American workers , notes the report .
Our grandparents ’ economy , which promised well - paying jobs for anyone who graduated high school , is fading and will soon be altogether gone , says the study .
Over the past three decades higher education has become a virtual must for an emerging workforce .
Ultimately high school graduates and dropouts will find themselves left behind in the coming decade as employers demand for college degrees continues to surge .
It will take until 2015 for job creation to catch up to where it would have been before the massive recession losses .
In 2018 , America will need more college - educated workers than it will have .
A college education and training also determines access to the middle class and over the next five years as the economy gets back on track , 60 million Americans are at risk of being locked out .
Those that do n’t have degrees will end up in predominantly low - wage jobs that require high school diplomas or less .
“ The bottom line is : we are under - investing in education , ” said Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers in a statement .
“ This report shows that the demand for well - educated Americans is n’t being met by our current investments . ”
Gregory Cendana , president of the United States Student Association in a statement said , “ The threat of continued divestment from higher education presents one of the greatest social and economic challenges to our generation . ”
He continued , “ Young people must mobilize to advocate for local , state , and federal policies that invest in college education and workforce development . ”
The Obama administration has come up with an additional $ 36 billion for spending on Pell grants in its reform of the higher education financing system .
However this leaves $ 122 billion outstanding , which would have to come from state and local budgets .
Authors note , “ We recognize , in the current budget climate , that it will be difficult for states to come up with their share .
Ultimately , federal and state governments will need to engage postsecondary institutions as partners in finding ways to pay for achieving this goal .
Together they must develop reforms that result in both cost - efficient and quality postsecondary education and training programs . ”
In conclusion the failure to achieve the mix of funding and reform required by the goals of the Obama administration will not only leave more and more Americans behind – it will damage the nation ’s economic future , says the report .
“ And that , quite simply , is something we cannot afford , ” authors say .

In his speech , The Trouble with Trust , the BBC director - general Mark Thompson called for greater transparency in the BBC 's dealings with political parties :
" There are steps we should take to make our own dealings with politicians and other public figures more open to scrutiny .
When A refuses to debate with B or sets other conditions before an interview or debate , there 's often a case for letting the public know - for example , via the Editors ' Blog ... "
So here goes .
This week , for the first time in my three years as executive editor of Question Time , we were told by Downing Street that a cabinet minister would only appear on the programme if another member of the panel was replaced .
According to No 10 , a senior member of the cabinet was available to do Question Time but only if Alastair Campbell was replaced by a member of the shadow cabinet .
Very obviously , we refused and as a result no minister appeared , meaning that the government was not represented on the country 's most - watched political programme in Queen 's Speech week - one of the most important moments in the Parliamentary calendar .
No 10 stated that the objection to Alastair Campbell was that he was not an elected Labour representative or a front - bencher .
Not only is Alastair Campbell one of the most senior and influential figures in the Labour movement - an architect of New Labour - but Labour ministers regularly appeared on Question Time panels when the then opposition was represented either by someone outside of the front bench or by an unelected panellist - sometimes even a prospective Parliamentary candidate .
It is not an argument or an objection that bears scrutiny .
It is a fundamental principle of our independence that politicians cannot dictate who sits on the panel .
It is for Question Time , not for political parties , to make judgements about impartiality and to determine who is invited to appear in the interests of the audience .
Parties are free of course to accept or reject those invitations , but they do not have a right of veto over other panellists .
Licence fee payers rightly insist that the BBC must be free from political interference .

Panel 2 : Hat Dude teeters on the edge of falling off the cliff .
HAT DUDE : Oh Dear !
I am plummeting over a cliff !
SAVE ME KEYNES !
Panel 3 : Keynes has caught hat dude by the wrist and is pulling him to safety .
KEYNES : It ’s okay … I ’ve got you !
HAT DUDE : Thank you , Keynes !
Panel 4 : They resume their walk .
HAT DUDE : As I was saying , Keynes , you ’re of no use at all !
The Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday reeled in Aaron Kampman , who was arguably the biggest fish remaining in the sea of unrestricted free agents after a weekend spending frenzy across the NFL .
Provided he 's healthy , Kampman should immediately shore up the Jaguars ' anemic pass rush — the team managed a league - worst 14 sacks in 2009 , which is actually the fifth - worst total in NFL history .
BELL TOLLS : Restricted free agents create intrigue
Kampman played left defensive end in his first seven years with the Green Bay Packers and did it well .
The two - time Pro Bowler ( 2006 , ' 07 ) registered 37 of his 54 career sacks between 2006 and 2008 as one of the league 's premier pass rushers .
Coming off the left side , the relentless Kampman can often overmatch bulkier right tackles who are often not as adroit as protecting quarterbacks as the blindside protecting left tackles .
But Kampman had perhaps his most trying season in 2009 .
He was converted to an outside linebacker when new coordinator Dom Capers installed a 3 - 4 defense in Green Bay last year .
Kampman seemed uncomfortable with the transition , though he was often lauded by his coaches for his effort and attitude .
He only produced 3 ½ sacks last season but the new system did seem to take hold in Green Bay and the Packers were a more formidable unit , their 51 - 45 loss to the Arizona Cardinals in the playoffs notwithstanding .
" Obviously I 've gotten used to this 3 - 4 , " Kampman said earlier this year .
" I did n't get a chance to get a full year to critique and say , ' Hey , this is great . '
But I was starting to get more comfortable with it .
Having said that , I have a lot of experience in the 4 - 3 .
I think that I can do both . "
However he was n't present for that wild - card defeat after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament in November , an injury that may keep from being full speed to start 2010 , though he 's said his rehabilitation schedule is ahead of schedule .
" Things have gone very , very well , " Kampman said .
" I 'm very thankful . "
Getting to the quarterback is a premium priority in the AFC South , a division that requires the Jaguars to face Pro Bowlers Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts and Matt Schaub of the Houston Texans twice apiece annually .
Kampman will also be tasked with burying San Diego 's Philip Rivers , Dallas ' Tony Romo , the Giants ' Eli Manning and Philadelphia 's Donovan McNabb in 2010 .
The Florida Times - Union reports Kampman received a four - year deal worth $ 26 million with $ 11 million guaranteed , nearly the same terms fellow defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch got from the Detroit Lions earlier in the weekend .
The acquisition of Kampman represents a leap of faith for Jacksonville owner Wayne Weaver .
He felt burned after committing $ 66 million to wideout Jerry Porter and cornerback Drayton Florence two years ago .
Neither player was productive for the 2008 Jaguars , who plummeted to 5 - 11 after reaching the playoffs in 2007 .
The money thrown at Porter and Florence also caused bad feelings in a fractured locker room , and both players were released following the season .
" Obviously , I endorsed them or we would n't have done them , so I 'm not going to go back and second guess what was done , " Weaver said after that season .
" We just have to learn from our mistakes and move on . "
Obviously Jacksonville is banking that the 6 - 4 , 260 - pound Kampman , who will turn 31 in November , is a better investment .
He figures to return to the defensive line for the Jaguars , who alternated between 4 - 3 and 3 - 4 looks in 2009 , when they started 6 - 4 but stumbled down the stretch to a disappointing 7 - 9 finish .
Jacksonville drafted pass rushers Derrick Harvey ( 8th overall ) and Quentin Groves ( 52nd ) overall in the 2008 draft , but neither has lived up to advance billing .
The duo has combined for eight sacks over two seasons , clearly not what the team envisioned when investing such high draft picks .
Kampman was a fifth - round pick out of Iowa in 2002 .
He is the most famous NFL player to hail from the Aplington - Parkersburg ( Iowa ) High School program run by famed coach Ed Thomas , who was murdered by one of his former players last June .
The move is the biggest signing of the offseason for the Jaguars .
They landed Kassim Osgood , a noted special teamer for the San Diego Chargers , to a three - year , $ 6.6 million deal Saturday with the proviso he will get the chance to earn playing time at wideout .
Given last month 's release of veteran Torry Holt after one season , there should be opportunities available for Osgood .
The team has also quietly kept some of its own players , re-signing receiver Troy Williamson , tight end Ernest Wilford , guard Kynan Forney and defensive lineman Atiyyah Ellison before free agency opened league - wide Friday .
After winning a coin flip with the Denver Broncos at the scouting combine , the Jaguars will pick 10th in the first round of the 2010 draft .
Michael Geist sez , " Reports in the Canadian media confirm what was reported in the blogosphere several weeks ago – out - of - touch Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore has won the internal fight for a Canadian DMCA .
The reports say the Canadian government is likely to introduce the bill next week complete with digital lock provisions that mirror those found in the U.S. DMCA .
The bill may also include some important new exceptions , but those will be subject to the use of a digital lock .
In other words , they are new rights that come with a big caveat in that they can be eliminated anytime by a rights holder . "
A translation for the layperson .
In the USA , it 's illegal to break a " digital lock , " such as the one that prevents you from copying a DVD to your laptop or phone .
This prohibition extends to activities that are otherwise legal : if there 's a digital lock that stops you from buying unauthorized , third - party games or apps for your Nintendo Wii or Apple iPad , it 's illegal to break that lock , even though all you 're doing is buying copyrighted works from their authors ( no copyright violations are taking place ) .
This has been the law in the US for ten years , and it 's been an utter disaster .
It has n't stopped copying , but it has created monopolies through which hardware / service companies can lock out competitors and force creators to accept terrible terms in order to sell their works on their platform ( see , for example , the terms on which apps are admitted to the iTunes Store ) .
Canada 's Heritage Minister is so eager to kiss the ass of the American entertainment industry that 's he willing to repeat the mistake , creating a Canadian version of this law .
As a sop to the Canadian public ( who overwhelmingly rejected this approach in a national consultation on Canadian copyright law ) , he 's creating a few " exceptions " for copyright that give Canadians the right to do normal things like recording TV shows or ripping CDs .
However , he 's also putting this digital locks business into play .
So all of those exceptions can be overridden : if there 's a digital lock ( no matter how flimsy and ridiculous ) that stops you from exercising your rights under copyright , those rights go away .
Nice work , Minister .

When micronutrients like vitamins and minerals are in short supply they are temporarily reserved for the most essential organs , at the expense of less pressing tasks .
This is a survival mechanism , an example of physiological triage ( 1 ) .
Neglecting less essential functions on occasion may do no harm but chronic shortages due to bad diets will cause health problems in the long run .
That micronutrients are crucially important should come as no surprise .
Vitamins are defined as substances that the body needs but cannot make or cannot make in sufficient quantities ; and we obviously cannot make minerals .
Chronic micronutrient deficiencies therefore have to be expected to take their toll .
Vitamins and minerals play numerous roles ; they are antioxidants , stabilize protein structures and act as enzyme cofactors .
They are therefore involved in all aspects of physiology , including such fundamental tasks as DNA maintenance and repair ( 2 ) .
Inefficient or incorrect DNA repair due to micronutrient shortages leads to genome instability , a known contributor to increased cancer risk , accelerated aging and neurodegenerative diseases ( 2 ) .
Genome damage caused by micronutrient deficiencies is believed to be at least as common and extensive as genome damage from environmental genotoxins like chemical carcinogens , UV and ionizing radiation .
Genome instability caused by micronutrient deficiencies in turn increases DNA sensitivity to environmental genotoxins .
The increase in cancer risk with increased DNA damage was demonstrated in a case - control study involving participants from Scandinavia and Italy ( 3 ) .
Cancer patients and matching controls were divided into three groups according to the degree of chromosomal damage found in their lymphocytes .
Those in the groups with the most extensive DNA damage were 2.35 ( Scandinavia ) and 2.66 ( Italy ) times as likely to develop cancer as those with the lowest amount of damage .
Separate analyses of the data for non-smokers , smokers and people with past exposure to environmental toxins produced essentially the same results ( 3 ) .
In other words , it didn`t matter whether the chromosomal abnormalities were caused by smoking , environmental genotoxins or other factors such as nutritional deficiencies ; only the extent of DNA damage was important .
If micronutrient deficiencies cause DNA damage and DNA damage contributes to degenerative diseases , it makes sense to diagnose and try to prevent chromosomal damage by adequate micronutrient intakes .
This has led to a call for adjusting recommended dietary allowances ( RDAs ) to optimize genome stability : ( 2 ) Optimal intakes for most of the micronutrients known to be critical - the vitamins C , E , B , B , B , folate and niacin , and the minerals zinc , iron , magnesium and manganese - haven`t been determined yet .
However , for those that have been studied - folate and vitamin B12 - intakes in excess of current RDA values are required to prevent chromosomal damage ( 2 ) .
Yet , many people don`t even reach current RDA values .
Optimizing micronutrient intakes seems like an effective and affordable way to reduce the degenerative disease burdens threatening to bankrupt medical care systems in developed countries .

It 's not particularly news that the U.S. came in last in the Commonwealth Fund 's latest ranking of seven industrialized nation 's health - care systems , since we did the same in 2007 , 2006 and 2004 .
( We also spent the most on health per capita -- $ 7,290 in 2007 compared to an estimated $ 3,387 in the top- ranking Netherlands . )
What is interesting to ponder is whether -- and if so , how -- the recent health - care overhaul bill will help boost the U.S. 's future performance on the measures of quality , efficiency , access to care , equity ...
This post is a brief summary of how to get your Linux running on a tablet PC .
We ’ll be using the HP Pavilion tx2500 and Slackware13 .
These steps can be adapted for other tablets .
They should be easier on distribution such as OpenSUSE or Ubuntu , where a lot of the system configuration is done automatically behind the scenes .
Overall , you may find they all worked for you with minimal tweaking , or , that you could use one or 2 bits to help you where you got stuck .
This document will cover the ‘ few ’ bits that do not work out of the box with a pure GNU / Linux , mostly due to them being propriety hardware : Graphics ( FGLRX ) , WiFi ( Broadcom ) , Touch / Stylus ( Wacom ) , Touchpad ( Synaptics ) and Sound ( Intel HD ) .
This how - to should leave you with a fully working tablet , minus a fingerprint reader .
1. ATi’s FGLRX :
ATi ’s Radeon 3200 is a propriety chip-set , but the ATi drivers outweigh their open - source brother when it comes to 3D performance .
Download the latest FGLRX driver from ATi , make the binary executable , and run it with the ‘ –buildpkg Slackware / All ’ flag .
This will create a . txz package you can install with pkgtool .
Run ‘ aticonfig –initial ’ and ‘ ldconfig ’ as root , and reboot .
If FGLRX is not loaded , ‘ modprobe fglrx ’ .
2. Broadcom ’s WL :
Well , what can we say , Broadcom ’s 4328 R3 wireless chip - set is also propriety hardware .
To get your WiFi working , download the latest Linux STA 802.11 driver from Broadcom , unpack and compile with ‘ make ’ .
You must unload the ‘ ssb ’ module ( if loaded ) , and you must load ‘ lib80211_crypt_tkip ’ , before you may load the newly built wl . ko module with ‘ insmod / path/to/wl.ko ’ .
3. Stylus / Touch and Touchpad
This part is not much different in practice , but very different in essence – we ’ll be using opensource drivers from the Linux Wacom project .
Download the latest LinuxWacom version from the Linux Wacom Project , and build with X.org support .
Then place the HAL and UDEV rules along with the xorg driver at their designated locations :
$ ./configure --enable - wacom $ ./ make # ./ make install # cp src/xdrv/wacom_drv.so
/usr/lib64/Xorg/modules/drivers/wacom_drv.so # cp src/util/10-linuxwacom.fdi
/etc/hal/fdi/policy/10-linuxwacom.fdi # cp src/util/60-wacom.rules
/etc/udev/rules.d/60-wacom.rules # cp src/2.6.27/wacom.ko /opt/
Load the new module you made :
# insmod /opt/wacom.ko
Now , we have to modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf to let it know about those new inputs by adding new ‘ InputDevice ’ sections and adding them to ‘ ServerLayout ’ .
This involves identifying the correct / dev / input / event # for the touch , stylus and eraser .
You can do it by watching the dump from each event file while ( read : at the same time as ) you send input events by dragging the pen across the screen :
# cat / dev/input / event8
If you are running into difficulties with your xorg .conf , you can use this file for refrence : HP_Pavilion_tx2500.xorg.conf
Calibrate your tablet with ‘ xwacomcpl ’ .
Download and compile CellWriter for handwriting recognition .
Screen Rotation script :
Since this is a tablet , screen rotation is pretty handy .
Because we ’re using Wacom modules , we will also need to change the oriantation of the wacom devices .
Basicaly , xrandr can be used in conjunction with xsetwacom to rotate the tablet and the screen together .
Here ’s how it works – the following lines will rotate everything “ right ” :
# xrandr -o right # xsetwacom set WacomTouch rotate 1 # xsetwacom set WacomStylus rotate 1 # xsetwacom set WacomEraser rotate 1
You have to match the device name to the device identifier in xorg.conf , and use the right path for xsetwacom .
Instead of “ right ” for xrandr you may use “ left ” “ inverted ” or “ normal ” , and instead of “ rotate 1 ” for xsetwacom you may use 0 for normal , 2 for left and 3 for inverted .
Most people script this together into something , like the example I made here : wacom_rotate.sh
4. Sound
This was the easiest bit to get working .
All it took , is running alsaconf , and selecting the ‘ snd - hda - intel ’ option .
5. Automate
The easiest way is usually to put all the stuff that is not scripted on its own into ‘/etc/rc.d/rc.local ’ , or for some distribution ‘/etc/rc.local ’
( That would probably include loading ‘ wl.ko ’ and ‘ wacom.ko ’ ) .
I hope you found this helpful .

Image caption Campaigners have urged Lord Goldsmith 's advice to be released
The Iraq inquiry has released details of the legal advice given to Tony Blair prior to the invasion of Iraq after the documents were de-classified .
Copies of the draft legal advice given by former attorney general Lord Goldsmith was previously kept secret despite calls for it to be published .
The Cabinet Office said it had decided to de-classify now because of the " very exceptional " nature of the inquiry .
There has been long running controversy over whether the war was lawful .
In his evidence to the inquiry in January , Lord Goldsmith acknowledged he had changed his mind on whether a second UN resolution was needed ahead of military action in March 2003 .
He had thought one was needed but had ultimately concluded , shortly before the war began , that military action was authorised by existing UN agreements dating back to 1991 .
ANALYSIS
The irritation over the government 's reluctance to declassify key documents relating to the Iraq war erupted in January this year when Lord Goldsmith was giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry .
The chairman , Sir John Chilcot , shared Lord Goldsmith 's frustration that the former attorney general 's draft legal advice could not be made public at the time .
The documents in question had , of course , been seen by the inquiry 's committee , but remained classified .
Five months on , the government has made an exception by releasing Lord Goldsmith 's papers .
These are not the first documents to be declassified by the Cabinet Office for the Iraq inquiry , but perhaps the most significant .
The 27 pages , each one with the words " secret " or " confidential " struck out , were distributed without ceremony .
The documents contain much of what was already known about Lord Goldsmith 's legal advice on military action in Iraq , but his views are now on the public record to back up his earlier testimony .
He denied that this came as a result of political pressure from No 10 or anyone else .
The government published the details of Lord Goldsmith 's final legal advice to the Cabinet - issued on 7 March - in 2005 .
However , campaigners have long called for the release of details of the attorney general 's initial legal advice to the prime minister , provided on February 12 , 2003 .
In this published correspondence , he told Mr Blair that should military action be taken without further approval by the UN Security Council , he expected " the government to be accused of acting unlawfully " .
However , he said that following a visit to Washington in early 2003 , he was " prepared to accept that a reasonable case " could be made that military action was authorised by existing resolutions , including resolution 1441 in November 2002 .
He cited the fact British forces had undertaken military action in Iraq in 1998 , and Kosovo in 1999 , and in both cases his predecessors as attorney general had given the go ahead on the basis that doing so was " no more than reasonably arguable " .
But the documents also give further insight into Lord Goldsmith change of mind on the issue .
In a letter to the prime minister on 30 January , 2003 , Lord Goldsmith said he " remained of the view that the correct legal interpretation of resolution 1441 is that it does not authorise the use of military force without a further determination by the Security Council " .
Several government lawyers have told the Iraq inquiry that they believed the invasion was unlawful without explicit UN authorisation .
Elizabeth Wilmshurst , a senior Foreign Office lawyer who resigned in protest at the war , told the inquiry earlier this year that she believed the way the government considered the legal arguments for war was " lamentable " .
' Explanation '
In a letter explaining his decision to de-classify the documents , head of the civil service Sir Gus O'Donnell said it was a " long - standing convention " that legal advice to ministers was not published so as not to compromise their ability to provide " full , frank and candid advice " .
But he said arguments over the legality of the war in Iraq had a " unique status " .
" The government 's actions with respect to the decision to use military force in Iraq , have in party , contributed to a widely - held view that the public and Parliament are entitled to some explanation for the legal basis for the decision , " he said .
He added : " The Iraq inquiry was established with the purpose of learning lessons from how decisions were made and which actions were taken in the run-up to conflict , during the conflict and its aftermath .
I remain of the view that the correct legal interpretation of resolution of 1441 is that it does not authorise the use of military force without a further determination by the Security Council Lord Goldsmith , Note to Tony Blair , 30 January 2003 Lord Goldsmith draft advice : February 12 , 2003
" The question of the legal base for military action and how the advice that led to the government 's view on this developed is consequently a central part of the inquiry 's work ....
" I have considered the matter carefully and believe that , given the very exceptional nature , of the Iraq inquiry , this particular material can be declassified without prejudice ... to the convention in relation to the law officers ' advice . "
The Iraq inquiry panel had copies of the declassified documents before Lord Goldsmith appeared before them .
The BBC's World Affairs Correspondent Peter Biles said the documents " put on record " how Lord Goldsmith came to his final decision on the legality of the war but did not appear to shed new light on why he reached the decision .
Our correspondent said the former attorney general had already made it clear that his view on the issue had " evolved " and that he decided a further UN resolution , while desirable , was not necessary .
In January , inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot expressed frustration that certain officials documents relating to the legality of the war could not be published .
The coaches who presided over the alleged misdeeds -- football 's Pete Carroll and basketball 's Tim Floyd -- left USC in the past year .
The penalties include the loss of 30 football scholarships over three years and vacating 14 victories in which Bush played from December 2004 through the 2005 season .
USC beat Oklahoma in the BCS title game on Jan. 4 , 2005 , and won 12 games during Bush 's Heisman - winning 2005 season , which ended with a loss to Texas in the 2006 BCS title game .
The BCS is likely to force Southern California to vacate its national championship .
BCS executive director Bill Hancock says in a statement Thursday that the presidential oversight committee will meet soon to discuss whether USC will be stripped of its title .
If that happens , there will be no BCS champion for the 2004 - 05 season .
Hancock said no action would be taken by the BCS until the appeal is heard .
The NCAA says Bush received lavish gifts from two fledgling sports marketers hoping to sign him .
The men paid for everything from hotel stays and a rent - free home where Bush 's family apparently lived to a limousine and a new suit when he accepted his Heisman in New York in December 2005 .
The NCAA found that Bush , identified as a " former football student - athlete , " was ineligible beginning at least by December 2004 , a ruling that could open discussion on the revocation of the New Orleans Saints star 's Heisman .
Members of the Heisman Trust have said they might review Bush 's award if he was ruled ineligible by the NCAA .
" The Heisman Trophy Trust will have a comment at the appropriate time , " the group said in a statement .
" Until that time , it will have no comment . "
The rulings are a sharp repudiation of the Trojans ' decade of stunning football success under Carroll , who won seven straight Pac - 10 titles and two national championships before leaving for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks last January .
Floyd resigned last June , shortly after he was accused of giving cash to a middleman who helped steer Mayo to USC .
" I have a great love for the University of Southern California and I very much regret the turn that this matter has taken , not only for USC , but for the fans and players , " Bush said in a statement .
" I am disappointed by [ Thursday's ] decision and disagree with the NCAA 's findings .
If the University decides to appeal , I will continue to cooperate with the NCAA and USC , as I did during the investigation .
In the meantime , I will continue to focus on making a positive impact for the University and for the community where I live . "
Carroll says he's " absolutely shocked and disappointed " by the NCAA sanctions imposed on his former Trojans for improprieties surrounding Bush .
The new coach of the Seattle Seahawks said in a video produced Thursday at team headquarters that " the agenda of the NCAA 's infractions committee took them beyond the facts . "
USC plans to appeal some of the penalties it believes are excessive .
" There is a systemic problem facing college athletes today : unscrupulous sports agents and sports marketers , " Todd Dickey , USC 's senior vice president for administration , said in a statement .
" The question is how do we identify them and keep them away from our student - athletes ? "
First - year football coach Lane Kiffin said : " There is some guilt in some penalties , but the punishment is too severe and that 's why the appeal process is taking place . "
The NCAA took no further action against the men's basketball team , which had already banned itself from postseason play last spring and vacated its wins from Mayo 's season .
Second - year basketball coach Kevin O'Neill said he was glad the NCAA did n't impose further punishment on his program .
" I applaud them on realizing self - imposing was our way of saying , ' You know what , we did make some mistakes along the way and what we better do is be vigilant in our efforts , ' which we will , " he said on campus .
Floyd , who is coaching at UTEP , quit last June , after he was accused of giving $ 1,000 in cash to Rodney Guillory who helped steer Mayo to USC .
" As Coach has wanted to say publicly for a long time , ' It did n't happen , ' " Floyd attorney Jim Darnell said in a statement .
Under Floyd , the Trojans made three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and had three straight 20 - win seasons .
As part of its self - imposed punishment , USC will return to the NCAA the money it received through the Pac - 10 for playing in the 2008 NCAA tournament .
The Trojans lost one scholarship for last season and one for next season ; they lost one coach to off - campus recruiting this summer ; and lose 20 recruiting days for next season .
USC also vacated its 21 victories during the 2007 - 08 season , when Mayo competed while ineligible .
" We can't control people 24 hours a day , " said O'Neill whn asked about a lack of institutional control at a booster gathering on Thursday evening .
" That 's all there is to it .
You can not control people from the outside .
You can not control agents .
You can not control runners .
Those kinds of things get away from you sometimes because you have no way of knowing .
I do know this .
We do the right thing every single day by the university , by the athletic department , by the student - athletes . "
The women 's tennis team also was cited in the report for unauthorized phone calls made by a former player , but the NCAA accepted USC 's earlier vacation of its wins between November 2006 and May 2009 .
" The general campus environment surrounding the violations troubled the committee , " the report said .
The report also condemned the star treatment afforded to Bush and Mayo , saying USC 's oversight of its top athletes ran contrary to the fundamental principles of amateur sports .
" Elite athletes in high profile sports with obvious great future earnings potential may see themselves as something apart from other student - athletes and the general student population , " the NCAA report said .
" Institutions need to assure that their treatment on campus does not feed into such a perception . "
USC athletic director Mike Garrett , speaking at a previously scheduled USC Coaches ' Tour at the Airport Marriott in Burlingame , Calif. , had this to say to boosters : " As I read the decision by the NCAA , all I could get out of all of this was ...
I read between the lines , and there was nothing but a lot of envy , and they wish they all were Trojans . "
USC 's saga reached its climax on a tumultuous day in college athletics , when Colorado 's defection to the Pac - 10 from the Big 12 provided the first steps in what could be a radical nationwide conference realignment threatening to change the nature of amateur sports .
While the bowl ban is the most damaging to Kiffin , who will have to ratchet up his formidable recruiting skills to tempt players with no hope of postseason play before 2012 , USC also will lose 30 scholarships over a three - year period , 10 annually from 2011 to ' 13 .
You can find many good blog posts on what to name your tests .
We present instead an appropriate strategy for when and how to think ab ...
I 'm sure the wingnuts will love this one even if they take an honest look at heir own politicians .
This man is a joke :
People who falsely claim to have served in combat in the U.S. Armed Forces could wind up in jail and pay a stiff fine , under an amendment introduced today by Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) .
--
“ It is sad that there are those who attempt to inflate their record and make these claims , ” Hatch said .
“ To do that defiles the sacrifice and service of those who have served in combat .
Worse yet , it dishonors the sacrifice of the brave men and women in uniform who have given their lives in combat so that the freedoms we enjoy are defended . ”
--
The Stolen Valor Act President Bush signed into law in 2005 made it a federal crime for anyone to falsely wear military decorations and medals authorized by Congress and the Armed Forces .
Hatch ’s amendment extends this to those who make false claims about serving in combat .
“ It is a crime to dishonor the sacrifice of so many by falsely representing combat service for the purposes of self - promotion or benefit , ” Hatch concluded .
“ My amendment would deter those who would falsely prop themselves up in order to appear worthy of the award and title of ‘ combat veteran . ’ ”
A Democratic Senator should add an amendment to it that makes this measure retroactive so that whoever gets caught falsifying their combat record has to serve six months in jail immediately .
Getting caught in the lie is bad enough , but it 's sad that a member of Congress would stoop this low .
Well , it is coming from the House of Lords , and they think they are royalty , so it 's on par with their assaulted feeling of self - importance .
Digby has more :
I 'd laugh it were n't so obvious that the Republicans are cranking up their scandal machinery ( which relies on a flurry of unintelligible accusations that eventually adds up to a narrative of political " trouble . " )
Meanwhile , it might be useful to point out that this is going to result in some very uncomfortable moments in the Senate men's room :
Long before he was the Senate 's most powerful sometimes - moderate who wo n't support the climate bill he helped draft because of personal pique , Lindsey Graham was just another politician who repeatedly lied about fighting in a war overseas .
According to his ( current ) official bio , " Graham logged six - and - a - half years of service on active duty as an Air Force lawyer . "
After he left the active duty force , he joined the South Carolina Air National Guard .
During the first Gulf War , Graham was called up to act as staff judge advocate at McEntire Air National Guard Base in South Carolina .
As staff judge advocate , Graham 's duties " included briefing pilots on the law of armed conflict , preparing legal documents for deploying troops , and providing legal services for family members of the South Carolina Air National Guard . "
His service never took him out of South Carolina .
And so , naturally , for years afterward , Lindsey Graham referred to himself in his official biography and elsewhere as " an Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm veteran . "
And then there 's this one ...
How about George Bush 's lies of war ?
Mother Jones has a nice time line on his military career including this :
George W. Bush on sacrifice :
" I 've been to war .
I 've raised twins .
If I had a choice , I 'd rather go to war . "
Houston Chronicle , January 2002
Bush on lessons learned :
" I learned some good lessons from Vietnam .
First , there must be a clear mission .
Secondly , the politics ought to stay out of fighting a war .
There was too much politics during the Vietnam War . "
Associated Press , March 2002

The Guard begins testing for drugs during physicals .
Spring 1971 :
Hired by Texas agricultural importer , Bush uses F - 102 to shuttle tropical plants from Florida .
May 26 , 1972 :
Transfers to Alabama Guard unit so he can work on Senator William Blount 's reelection campaign .
According to his commanding officer , Bush never shows up for duty while in Alabama , nor can anyone confirm he ever serves in the Guard again .
August 1972 :
Bush is grounded for missing a mandatory physical .
November 1972 :
Bush returns to Houston , but never reports for Guard duty .
How about we have an amendment that says if your Vice President and Secretary of Defense did everything they could to avoid serving in the military during a time of war when a draft is being held , then they need to be removed from office when a call for war emanates from the White House ?
ARM10852 - False Statement of Military Service
The Australian Defence Force has confirmed two Australian soldiers from a Brisbane - based regiment died when their foot patrol was hit by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan yesterday .
The men , who have not been named , were on patrol in the Mirabad Valley on Monday morning ( Afghan time ) when they were attacked .
Acting Defence Force chief Lieutenant General David Hurley said one soldier died at the scene while another died of his wounds in a Coalition medical facility .
The incident is the first time two Australian soldiers have been killed as a result of enemy action on the same day since the Vietnam War .
Earlier NATO confirmed that 10 International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan on Monday in the deadliest day in months for foreign forces .
The dead Australians , who were both on their first tours in Afghanistan , were from the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment based at Brisbane 's Gallipoli Barracks and were working with the Mentoring Task Force .
Their deaths take the ADF death toll in Afghanistan to 13 since 2002 .
An explosives detection dog also died but there were no other casualties among Australian or Afghan troops at the scene .
" I speak for the entire Australian Defence community when I tell you I am deeply saddened by the loss of these two brave Australian soldiers , " Lieutenant General Hurley said .
Lieutenant General Hurley also read from a statement by Defence Force Chief Angus Houston - who is travelling to Pakistan - in which he said he was " devastated " by their deaths .
" I want [ the soldiers ' families ] to know that these two fine soldiers were outstanding Australians , " he said in the statement .
Speaking on behalf of Defence Minister John Faulkner , Minister for Defence Materiel and Science Greg Combet offered his condolences on behalf of the Government .
" Two of our finest Australians have been taken from us , " he said .
" Sadly their sacrifice reminds us that the mission in Afghanistan is extremely dangerous . "
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd extended the Government 's condolences to the dead soldiers ' families .
" This is a sober reminder to us all about the difficult and dangerous work that our soldiers are doing each day in Afghanistan , whether it's in the news or whether it 's not .
It 's a sobering reminder that we are up against a determined and dangerous enemy , " he said .
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott described the soldiers ' deaths as a tragedy for their families and the country .
" It shows just how dangerous is the work that our armed forces are doing in Afghanistan .
It 's very dangerous work , but it 's a very important cause , and I know that all Australians will be reaching out to the families of those killed soldiers in their hour of need and grief , " he said .
The soldiers ' deaths were confirmed earlier by Queensland Premier Anna Bligh .
" I think on all sides here today our hearts go out to the families of these two soldiers who have died in the war on terror and the fight for peace , " she told the Queensland Parliament .
" These two soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice and it's a very sad day for their families . "
A Polish priest living in Brazil has been arrested on charges of paedophilia after turning his home into an " erotic dungeon " where he organised orgies with teenagers , Brazilian media reported .
The judge overseeing the case says the priest , identified only by his initials MMS , ran a church in the west of Rio de Janeiro state and used his spiritual authority over the youths to prey on them .
" [ The priest is ] a person compulsively attached to sex with adolescents , " Alexandre Abrahao Teixeira said in his decision to issue a preventive detention order .
He said the priest 's house was transformed into " a sort of erotic dungeon where these youths were thrown into orgies " .
The investigation was opened in 2007 when one teenager told police the priest persuaded him to engage in kissing and sex acts .
If convicted , the priest could be jailed for 10 years .
Church officials in the state declined to comment on the case , which , if confirmed , would add to a growing paedophilia scandal implicating Catholic priests in several countries to the increasing discomfort of the Vatican .

Tesla 's Roadster has done a lot to add a dash of sport to the stereotypical image of the electric vehicle as dreamy , dowdy , dutiful , or dull .
But Tesla 's business model and retail potential have yet to be proven -- as does its upcoming product line .
But as the company prepares for its initial public offering of stock ( IPO ) CEO Elon Musk has revealed what it plans to do and how it plans to do it , including sketches of its next three vehicles .
The three vehicles include the previously announced family sedan , a crossover , and a van - like utility vehicle .
Tesla did n't release any target dates for production of the cars , but in his presentation Musk describes Tesla as a " friggin ' technology velociraptor " and says the cars to come will be " frickin ' badass . "
As Tesla 's technology and product volume grows , it is projecting a reduction in the cost to produce the batteries that power its cars , with the Roadster Sport already demonstrating a 31 percent savings over the original Roadster , and the Model S planned to save 56 percent in terms of dollars per kilowatt - hour .
In addition to the new vehicle plans , Tesla is selling itself to potential investors as the leader in the electric vehicle market .
Musk claims to have the best motor , battery , and control electronics technology .
While that may be up for debate , the company 's powertrain agreements with Daimler and Freightliner do show industry confidence in Tesla 's hardware , as does Toyota 's investment in the company .
Whether that confidence is justified remains to be seen , however .
Also included in the presentation at Retail Roadshow are several videos pitching the Model S and explaining how Tesla has built its team , processes and technologies .

Are Cameras the New Guns ?
The move to stop recording of police misconduct .
by Wendy McElroy
In response to a flood of Facebook and YouTube videos that depict police abuse , a new trend in law enforcement is gaining popularity .
In at least three states ( Illinois , Massachusetts , and Maryland ) , it is now illegal to record an on - duty police officer even if the encounter involves you and may be necessary to your defense , and even if the recording is on a public street where no expectation of privacy exists .
The legal justification for arresting the â€œshooterâ€ rests on existing wiretapping or eavesdropping laws , with statutes against obstructing law enforcement sometimes cited .
Illinois , Massachusetts , and Maryland are among the 12 states in which all parties must consent for a recording to be legal unless , as with TV news crews , it is obvious to all that recording is underway .
Since the police do not consent , the camera - wielder can be arrested .
Most all - party - consent states also include an exception for recording in public places where â€œno expectation of privacy existsâ€  ( Illinois does not ) but in practice this exception is not being recognized .
Massachusetts attorney June Jensen represented Simon Glik who was arrested for such a recording .
She explained , â€ œ [ T ] he statute has been misconstrued by Boston police .
You could go to the Boston Common and snap pictures and record if you want .
â€ 
Legal scholar and professor Jonathan Turley agrees , â€ œThe police are basing this claim on a ridiculous reading of the two - party consent surveillance law â€ ” requiring all parties to consent to being taped .
I have written in the area of surveillance law and can say that this is utter nonsense.â€ 
The courts , however , disagree .
A few weeks ago , an Illinois judge rejected a motion to dismiss an eavesdropping charge against Christopher Drew , who recorded his own arrest for selling one - dollar artwork on the streets of Chicago .
Although the misdemeanor charges of not having a peddlerâ€™s license and peddling in a prohibited area were dropped , Drew is being prosecuted for illegal recording , a Class I felony punishable by 4 to 15 years in prison .
In 2001 , when Michael Hyde was arrested for criminally violating the stateâ€™s electronic surveillance law â€ ” aka recording a police encounter â€ ” the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld his conviction 4 - 2 .
In dissent , Chief Justice Margaret Marshall stated , â€ œCitizens have a particularly important role to play when the official conduct at issue is that of the police .
Their role cannot be performed if citizens must fear criminal reprisalsâ€ ¦.â€ 
( Note : In some states it is the audio alone that makes the recording illegal . )
The selection of â€œshootersâ€ targeted for prosecution do , indeed , suggest a pattern of either reprisal or an attempt to intimidate .
Glik captured a police action on his cellphone to document what he considered to be excessive force .
He was not only arrested , his phone was also seized .
On his website Drew wrote , â€ œMyself and three other artists who documented my actions tried for two months to get the police to arrest me for selling art downtown so we could test the Chicago peddlers license law .
The police hesitated for two months because they knew it would mean a federal court case .
With this felony charge they are trying to avoid this test and ruin me financially and stain my credibility .â€ 
Hyde used his recording to file a harassment complaint against the police .
After doing so , he was criminally charged .
In short , recordings that are flattering to the police â€ ” an officer kissing a baby or rescuing a dog â€ ” will almost certainly not result in prosecution even if they are done without all - party consent .
The only people who seem prone to prosecution are those who embarrass or confront the police , or who somehow challenge the law .
If true , then the prosecutions are a form of social control to discourage criticism of the police or simple dissent .
A recent arrest in Maryland is both typical and disturbing .
On March 5 , 24 - year - old Anthony John Graber IIIâ€™s motorcycle was pulled over for speeding .
He is currently facing criminal charges for a video he recorded on his helmet - mounted camera during the traffic stop .

Are Cameras the New Guns ?
The move to stop recording of police misconduct .
by Wendy McElroyIn response to a flood of Facebook and YouTube videos that depict police abuse , a new trend in law enforcement is gaining popularity .
In at least three states ( Illinois , Massachusetts , and Maryland ) , it is now illegal to record an on - duty police officer even if the encounter involves you and may be necessary to your defense , and even if the recording is on a public street where no expectation of privacy exists .
The legal justification for arresting the â€œshooterâ€ rests on existing wiretapping or eavesdropping laws , with statutes against obstructing law enforcement sometimes cited .
Illinois , Massachusetts , and Maryland are among the 12 states in which all parties must consent for a recording to be legal unless , as with TV news crews , it is obvious to all that recording is underway .
Since the police do not consent , the camera - wielder can be arrested .
Most all - party - consent states also include an exception for recording in public places where â€œno expectation of privacy existsâ€  ( Illinois does not ) but in practice this exception is not being recognized .
Massachusetts attorney June Jensen represented Simon Glik who was arrested for such a recording .
She explained , â€ œ [ T ] he statute has been misconstrued by Boston police .
You could go to the Boston Common and snap pictures and record if you want .
â€ 
Legal scholar and professor Jonathan Turley agrees , â€ œThe police are basing this claim on a ridiculous reading of the two - party consent surveillance law â€ ” requiring all parties to consent to being taped .
I have written in the area of surveillance law and can say that this is utter nonsense .
â€
The courts , however , disagree .
A few weeks ago , an Illinois judge rejected a motion to dismiss an eavesdropping charge against Christopher Drew , who recorded his own arrest for selling one - dollar artwork on the streets of Chicago .
Although the misdemeanor charges of not having a peddlerâ€™s license and peddling in a prohibited area were dropped , Drew is being prosecuted for illegal recording , a Class I felony punishable by 4 to 15 years in prison .
In 2001 , when Michael Hyde was arrested for criminally violating the stateâ€™s electronic surveillance law â€ ” aka recording a police encounter â€ ” the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld his conviction 4 - 2 .
In dissent , Chief Justice Margaret Marshall stated , â€ œCitizens have a particularly important role to play when the official conduct at issue is that of the police .
Their role cannot be performed if citizens must fear criminal reprisalsâ€ ¦ .
â€  ( Note :
In some states it is the audio alone that makes the recording illegal . )
The selection of â€œshootersâ€ targeted for prosecution do , indeed , suggest a pattern of either reprisal or an attempt to intimidate .
Glik captured a police action on his cellphone to document what he considered to be excessive force .
He was not only arrested , his phone was also seized .
On his website Drew wrote , â€ œMyself and three other artists who documented my actions tried for two months to get the police to arrest me for selling art downtown so we could test the Chicago peddlers license law .
The police hesitated for two months because they knew it would mean a federal court case .
With this felony charge they are trying to avoid this test and ruin me financially and stain my credibility .
â€ 
Hyde used his recording to file a harassment complaint against the police .
After doing so , he was criminally charged .
In short , recordings that are flattering to the police â€ ” an officer kissing a baby or rescuing a dog â€ ” will almost certainly not result in prosecution even if they are done without all - party consent .
The only people who seem prone to prosecution are those who embarrass or confront the police , or who somehow challenge the law .
If true , then the prosecutions are a form of social control to discourage criticism of the police or simple dissent .
A recent arrest in Maryland is both typical and disturbing .
On March 5 , 24 - year - old Anthony John Graber IIIâ€™s motorcycle was pulled over for speeding .
He is currently facing criminal charges for a video he recorded on his helmet - mounted camera during the traffic stop .
The case is disturbing because : 1 ) Graber was not arrested immediately .
Ten days after the encounter , he posted some of he material to YouTube , and it embarrassed Trooper J. D. Uhler .
The trooper , who was in plainclothes and an unmarked car , jumped out waving a gun and screaming .
Only later did Uhler identify himself as a police officer .
When the YouTube video was discovered the police got a warrant against Graber , searched his parentsâ€™ house ( where he presumably lives ) , seized equipment , and charged him with a violation of wiretapping law .

Ladies and Gentlemen : The Deepwater Horizon sinking caused twisted 21 inch riser piping to start leaking in three places at 5,000 feet in the Gulf Seabed .
Sadly the proven methods to stop the leak still have not been used since 042010 until today at 052010 for reasons unknown .
BP , Governor of Florida and Governor of LA were all given , along with the President , the Counter Pressure Plug information from a UK inventor Branko R. Babic as he invented same in 1991 for Kuwait Oil Fires above the ground and they will work underwater with ROV welding special thick steel tubes with washers to be welded to the interior while the tubes allow full flow of gas , oil , water through tubes into the gulf .
ROV 's can be used to weld underwater the 5 inch thick washers compressed with thick rubber washers against the inside pipe sealing off all leaking oil , gas and water while the straight through pipe could take the contents flowing through to the top of the sea into barges .
Keep in mind the CPP with flow pipe has a ball valve wheel operated to shut down the flow and BP could then try to seal the BOP stopping the leak entirely .
BP and Horizon personnel reviewing the messages since 041610 first started denying the idea had merit and they put a straw type pipe six inches inside with rubber flaps then started drawing off oil and gas from one leaking area but BP refused to consider the CPP Invention of Branko R. Babic or suggestion to use a " Jet Swet ' type invention to seal the big pipe and allow the small pipe to function until welded in place then the ball valve would shut down the well so they could try to use the BOP to seal .
What is odd is a survivor who was the Chief Electronics Technician knew the BOP annular was damaged weeks earlier and that the rubber had come up through the piping and was shown to proper supervisors .
Also the BOP electrical module was damaged plus a battery problem prevented the BOP from shutting down at the time of the alleged accident or incident causing the disaster .
Sounds like criminal negligence causing the death of 11 men and risking the death of 15 others that has to be investigated .
I am , as a Professional Plumbing Contractor and former Welder , amazed that BP ignored the requests to use an 8 hour window to make and test the CPP and CPP with piping and ball valve then stop the leak since 042610 through today 052010 .
More amazing is the failure of the United States President and others to take over the site in the interest of national security until everything is removed from the sea bed and confirmation of criminal acts or terrorism if not murder are confirmed .
The BP people have been paid an insurance policy of hundreds of millions of dollars without any proof the damage was an accident or even covered events with knowledge of BOP or other problems ignored .
Anyone desiring a copy of PDF'S confirming failure of BP to act send an e-mail to backflow2@verizon.net .
asking for same and it will arrive .
I just finished sending e-mails to everyone and LABEOC on how to siphon off the oil and water then separate the oil from water and store the oil in barges using special equipment known to work for skimming oil .
pray for Florida , gulf coast and east coast of America plus Islands !
True Evolution : A Peter Molyneux Interview
By Christian Nutt
Evolution .
Innovation .
Change .
Peter Molyneux sees an industry - wide renaissance driven by a mixture of heightened creative impetus and better understanding of what players want and need from games .
Games can be both a product and an art form , argues the Lionhead co-founder and Microsoft Game Studios creative director ( Populous , Black & White , Fable series ) , who sees creative evolution as driving audience engagement as much as research and marketing : " Why can't pieces of art be as successful as anything else ?
I think they should be ; I think there 's very good reason to be . "
At this year 's GDC , he explained that in quest of a larger audience he and the team at Lionhead have decided to simplify the much - awaited upcoming Xbox 360 / PC title Fable III -- make the gameplay tie into the world more directly , and eschew statistics and menus in favor of instantly - accessible and comprehensible in - world reflections of game concepts .
Making Fable III 's combat made the game simpler for new players , but also made it " more complex and sophisticated " for experienced players , argues Molyneux .
Not only is Fable evolving , but we 're seeing the RPG genre as a whole changing .
Peter Molyneux :
It is ; it really is .
We feel like the whole industry 's kind of evolving , itself .
There 's a huge amount of innovation now .
Only a few years ago , everyone was saying , " Oh , there 's no innovation . "
Now , there 's a lot of stuff happening .
There 's a lot of social stuff happening ; there 's a lot of casual games happening ; all the motion controllers are changing ; there 's new titles coming out that kind of change people 's thoughts like Heavy Rain ; [ with ]
Fable -- we keep on trying to reinvent ourselves a little bit .
A lot of this stuff is happening , and it 's really fascinating .
You know , I think , to me , if you do n't evolve , you die .
This is true evolution in an industry that needs to push itself .
Absolutely .
I think that 's going to be fascinating when we come out the other side in five years .
Fable III
Do you think it 's because production processes and technical capabilities have evolved to the point where it 's more possible ?
PM : I think there 's a lot of forces all coming together at once .
First of all , there 's the hardware force : the fact that the hardware manufacturers -- Sony , Nintendo , and Microsoft -- have really realized , " Look , if we really want to revolutionize things , it 's not about faster processors and more memory .
It is actually about things that are being held in the player 's hands . "
You 've got that side of it , and then you 've got the side where , at last , we 're starting to get what online really means .
At last , we 're starting to realize it 's so much more than just being able to download maps and play them .
There 's this new thing called the digital relationship : we have a digital relationship with players now where now , in Fable III , any of the shops in the world can be online - enabled .
PM : So this little village here [ indicating screen ] -- you may not realize it , but what 's in a shop in this village may actually be downloaded from online .
So we can populate those shops remotely .
This is a new digital relationship ; that , coupled with the fact that we can give things episodic content .
There 's digital relationship ; what people do online is far more about social spaces , and there 's this shared creativity .
If you think about co-op in something like Fable III , now the co-op is not only co-op ; it 's being able to come in and play Fable III in my world , not attached to me but separate from me .
Allow players to marry each other ; allow them to have children together .
All this stuff is all new stuff , which just makes a big difference to the game .
So , firstly , you 've got the hardware change ; you have motion control .
Secondly , you 've got the online side ; thirdly , you 've got us as software engineers and designers and creators actually keep on saying , " Hey , we can make emotional experiences . "
Games like Heavy Rain giving you a true emotional roller coaster ride .
All of that 's happening in one year .
You put all of that stuff together , and you start to realize that , in two to three years ' time , when we all get used to all of this new stuff , all this new colors and the paint palette of design -- it really is going to make new genres happen .
It 's interesting , because you are talking about the complexity actually increasing , right ?
Your goal with Fable III is more about streamlining the design decisions to make the game more accessible , but now you 're talking about things that actually are additive again .
So is it a priority shift ?
PM : What it is , is that one of the big design problems is , when you 've got all this new stuff , what is also happening that wraps all this up is making stuff accessible and understood .
You can have all of this new tech , but if it 's not presented in a way which is ultimately -- especially in today 's world , where everybody just needs to get to the point as quickly as they possibly can -- if it's not presented in an amazingly accessible way , it 's just going to fail .
That 's why the in - game shop in Fable III is actually an important idea .
It 's not that that 's anything new ; you could go onto the dashboard and download new stuff , but that 's not accessibility .
You 're relying upon people to remember to go to the dashboard , whereas this way of doing it , presenting it to the player as part of the world , means that that it 's ultimately more accessible .
That applies to everything from Natal to the Sony Move to the Wii to online to digital to what happens when you get your new box and plug it in .
All the interfaces to our technology and our gaming experiences are really changing radically -- and very quickly , as well .
It 's fascinating , Christian , if you just look at tutorials .
What was the last game you played that had a tutorial ?
Like " Now push X and ... "
PM : Yeah , exactly .
" Push X , and that will take your sword out . "
I have n't played one for ages !
No , and I 'm glad , because those were one of the worst parts of gaming .
PM : Yes , they were like forewords in books ; you never read them .
It would be arduous .
Now , we do n't have them anymore .
When you go back to a game and play them again , they just seem arduous and tedious and , oh God , I just want to know the game ; I just do n't want to be taught to play the game .
They seem so old - school , but three years ago we had them all over the place .
You know , there were a few games that came out that actually made the tutorial part of your world , which showed the way .
We would n't think about it now .
Look at Fable III ; we had a really interesting journey with the tutorials .
" We 've got to teach the player to use the sword and use guns and use magic ! "
And we then said -- you remember this , Josh -- Josh [ Atkins ] is our lead designer on Fable III -- we said to ourselves , " What if we just had one sentence that said , ' To do a quick attack , press the button quickly ; to do a build - up attack , hold the button down . '
Suppose we said nothing else after that . "
Because of that , we then made swords work in a very similar way to guns to work in a very similar to magic .
Suddenly , the whole hour of tedium went away for players because we unified that combat system and actually made it much more accessible for the more casual side of Fable III players , and made it much more interesting for the core players because they could start combining magic together and switching between guns and swords , because they were the same .
That meant that , even though it was simpler , it was actually more complex and sophisticated .
I think that 's something the game industry has , up to this point , struggled with : " complexity equals depth " , which it does n't , necessarily .
PM : Well , that was my big mistake .
It took me years , you know -- a ridiculous number of years -- to realize that adding more features actually took away from the game rather than added to the game .
It 's not the number of features you 've got ; it 's how well - exploited those features are .
You know , Fable 1 especially and Black & White and The Movies -- those were all games where I just kept on saying to the team , " Let 's have this idea !
Let 's have this idea !
Let 's have this idea ! "
Kept cramming features in , just expecting them to shine like gold , where actually it just muddied it and made the games a more brown color rather than making them brighter .
Now , it 's been a very interesting journey with Fable III : taking a lot away from Fable III actually adds a lot to it .
We took away leveling up .
Taking away the leveling up in the GUI and saying , " We 'll make leveling up part of the game experience .
We 'll put it into the world . "
So taking away the complexity and abstraction of it and making it all part of the world actually made it better and more understood .
People anticipated it more , and that really worked well .
If you look at the genre , you see similar decisions are being made in parallel ; I do n't necessarily think that people are referring to each other when they do this .
It all seems like it 's happening at the same time .
If you look at Mass Effect 2 , they dropped a tremendous amount of fiddly complexity from it and made the gameplay action - based .
PM : Yes , it 's right .
Fable 1 , Fable 2 , Mass Effect --
I think all of those games we probably were inspired in some sort of way by other games like ...
Things like BioShock came along , and that had a great start .
BioShock 1 had a great start to the game ; it threw you in there .
Then you look at something like Uncharted 2 , which was another great start ; there were no tutorials , and you were just kind of thrown in there .
That was great .
And the Modern Warfares and Call of Dutys -- that 's looking really , really good .
It 's all happening at once .
So often , this happens like that .
If you look at films and books and TV , everyone seems to have the idea at the same time .
An evolution towards simplicity has Final Fantasy XIII , as well , which , coming from kind of its own silo of development -- it 's been quietly bubbling ...
PM : Yeah .
I 've really got to go back and play the Final Fantasys .
But I find them a huge time - sink , and it 's kind of like saying , " Right .
I 'm going to go on a massive marathon now .
I 've got to get ready for it . "
I really enjoy them , but I have n't played Final Fantasy XIII at all .
So what 's it like ?
What have they done with it ?
It 's extremely streamlined .
I think part of it was due to production difficulties , and they 're pretty honest about that .
But it 's extremely linear for the first half of the game , and it gradually introduces gameplay in a measured way .
Unlike a lot of games , they 've made the decision to stick with turn - based combat , so to actually try to make it understood by the player they very gradually introduce new elements over the course of the first 15 , 20 hours of the game .
Every so often , they just feed you another piece .
PM : See , that is such an interesting -- now , I 've got this talk that I gave , which is all about steeds in World of Warcraft , because when I played World of Warcraft this was like a dawning moment of realization for me : that the steeds in World of Warcraft , brilliantly , did n't come until you were level 40 .
That anticipation that it built up in me as a player -- I did n't care what the gameplay was like ; I did n't care how tedious it was .
I just wanted to get a steed !
The fact that I 'd be trudging along as a Tauren and someone would speed past me on a horse would just piss me off !
Measuring out those gameplay features so that they do n't come at once .
So often , as an industry , we 've made the mistake of , " Oh my God ; we 've got to give everybody everything all up front , or otherwise they 're going to get all pissed off ! " and then , within half an hour , you should have everything in the game .
Now , it 's much more about -- I mean , Fable III is like this -- okay , you 've got your time with magic ; you 've got your time with the guns ; you 've got your time with the swords ; you 've got your time with judgments ; you 've got your time with rule ; you 've got your time with touch ; you 've got your time with the dog .
If you measure them all out and get people to anticipate them , then they 're so much more powerful .
That just is another one of those things where you think , " Well , why did n't I just think like this five years ago ?
Why was n't it like this before ? "
It 's a real inspirational thing .
You said , " I do n't care how tedious this is ; I just want the reward . "
Chris
Hecker spoke about the fact that , that if we keep giving rewards for actually tedious gameplay , we 're going to create a situation where gamers expect rewards and slog through tedium to get to them .
PM : Yeah .
I think you 've got to be careful .
I do n't mind grinding ; I actually quite like grinding , and I actually quite like the idea that I 've got this highly dramatic moment -- it 's all about emotional gameplay , and it's all about the feeling of winning and victory and challenge -- and then I 've got a bit of downtime .
I 've got a bit of peaceful time .
It 's very interesting how , as game designers , you have to battle against , when you 're in development , people 's perceptions .
The jobs in Fable II -- everyone hated the jobs in Fable II when we were in development .
" Oh , you know ; hitting a hammer against an anvil for half an hour -- no one 's going to do that .
It 's ridiculous .
It 's awful .
Where 's the fun ?
Show me the fun . "
A lot of senior management people would say , " Why are you wasting your time on these jobs ?
No one 's going to do them . "
But the point was that doing those grindy things can actually feel really nice , especially if you feel like , " I 'm doing this grinding for a particular purpose .
I want to get this much gold . "
That 's fine !
The trouble is if you overplay that hand or if the grind turns into tedium , then it ends up being an experience where you think , " Why am I doing this ?
This is just ...
I 'm just wasting my life ! "
It 's kind of like watching bland television , and you go off and think , " Why am I grinding , watching this television ? "
You 've got to mix it all together and all part of the whole experience , and so I do think , when I look at something like FarmVille -- which is a lot of grinding , but there 's a social side as well ; they just get away with it .
It seems like , when you play an RPG as a gamer who likes the genre , at different times you want different things ; that 's one of the reasons why the genre has its own unique fan base .
I have very fond memories of grinding levels in certain RPGs that I 've played , and it seems like in other genres there 's this pressure to propel people forward always and to always be showing them something new .
PM : It is an overwhelming urge , and that 's all part of the craft of what we 're making .
There are n't many -- if you look at this in an analogous way to movies -- there are n't many movies like action games , which are all about actions .
Most action movies have the love interest bit ; they have the " Ah , my parents are wonderful " bit ; the sort of enriching bit .
They have those -- to me , a lot of them are very bland -- but the good movies that do it right , just when you think , " Oh , God , I do n't want any more action ; I just want a bit of downtime , " then they give you that downtime .
I think we 're just realizing that what we 're making is a sort of arc of enjoyment , and that arc of enjoyment should have definitely a variety in it .
It 's so easy to get the balance of that wrong , I think .
It 's like the basic philosophical argument that , without evil , good can't exist ; without some downtime , action does n't have any meaning .
PM : That 's right ; absolutely right .
Yeah , you need the high action moments , and you need the low action moments .
Quite often the journey to the action moment can be as enjoyable , in a very different way , than the actual action and the anticipation of defeating the enemy .
It 's a very interesting thing with Fable .
I do n't keep on saying " Fable III " because I want to market Fable III to you ; I 'm just saying it to show that we think about these things .
With Fable III , building up the bad guy -- and Josh will remember this -- I keep on saying , " Make the bad guy a real bad guy .
Do n't make him a little bit of a nice guy ; make him a bad guy .
Make me want to defeat him ! "
And then , when I defeat him , that will feel more emotionally powerful , and then you can turn the cards and say that this bad guy is n't all he 's cracked up to be .
Then it becomes more interesting .
But there 's a lot of craft and skill which all comes together , which makes games a true art form now ; I think it is growing up to be a true art form .
You also talked about how some of your motivation for streamlining or making Fable III accessible is commercial .
PM : Yeah .
I mean , a lot of it is commercial .
A lot of it is -- I said " We want five million people to play our game . "
That 's me as a greedy kid just saying , " I want more ; I want more . "
Of course you want people to enjoy it more .
A lot of times , I think , if I speak to someone and they say , " Ah , I really liked Fable , once I got into it " -- that 's a disaster !
That 's a disastrous thing to think that you were crafting something which somebody has to struggle to get into .
That 's never going to work , and that 's what accessibility and simplicity are -- making sure , when you get the game , within a few minutes you 're understanding who you are and who your allies are .
These are all impossibly hard crafts that we 've had to learn , and it is all about getting more people to enjoy it , for sure .
I think that people have a knee - jerk negative reaction to a commercial impetus .
PM : It 's an odd thing , that , is n't it ?
It really is .
I think it 's kind of saying , " I want to make a game because I want to make it just for the creative sense . "
Is that right to do that ?
I think that you can be unbelievably brave and be commercial as well .
I do n't think one is the polar opposite of the other .
Quite often , we mistake this altruistic reason for making a game for being " Oh , well , that 's just a piece of art . "
But why can't pieces of art be as successful as anything else ?
I think they should be ; I think there 's very good reason to be .
It 's almost as if we 're ashamed of success -- especially being British !
The British people hate successful people ; that 's why our newspapers are so successful -- because we as a nation build people up , and as soon as they smell success we smash them down into the ground again !
That 's part of the British culture ; we 're ashamed of success .
I think the problem is sometimes people overreact ; you see people go , " Well , this has got to be commercial .
We can't innovate . "
I think people get a bit nervous themselves when they 're faced with that problem , and we 're finding out as things evolve that that 's not actually true .
PM : Yeah .
This is where , I think , creative people really have to have a voice : when something starts to be successful , the overwhelming urge is to use things like focus groups and research saying , " Well , 90 percent of the people enjoyed this in your game , so you should do more of this and less of this .
Oh , no , we do n't want any new stuff because they might not enjoy it as much . "
I think that 's where you need creative people to say , " Look ; this is what we created .
It was this successful , but that does n't mean that we should n't carry on innovating . "
When something -- like what so often happens in the movies -- when something gets into that rut and it's almost defined and created by the research , then I think bad things tend to start happening .
I have no doubt in my mind that a film like Avatar would never have existed if it had n't been for James Cameron 's force of will in saying , " Look , now I 'm going to create six - legged animals .
Why ?
Because I think it 's right . "
I could bet you that some logistical people would sit down and say , " Why do n't you make them four - legged animals , because they 're so much easier to animate ? "
" No. I want six - legged animals . "
And it ends up , as a whole , being a more successful thing .
It 's the creative texture that 's required .
PM : Yeah , it 's the creative texture and the belief in the creative process ; the belief that the creative process should allow you the flexibility to do things against what research says and that bucks the trend of research .
Sometimes , like in Fable , we use research a lot to actually say , " Okay , what bits did n't work , and what bits did work ? "
But I think if you feel like the creative direction of something is led by research , then that 's a bit scary .

Here ’s a great quote from a great article posted on the Nation .
Thanks to Tim Lambert for the link .
Yet when it comes to coverage of global warming , we are trapped in the logic of a guerrilla insurgency .
The climate scientists have to be right 100 percent of the time , or their 0.01 percent error becomes Glaciergate , and they are frauds .
By contrast , the deniers only have to be right 0.01 percent of the time for their narrative–See !
The global warming story is falling apart !–to be reinforced by the media .

With all the spotlight on Sprint ‘s EVO 4G , it seemed like efforts to root Verizon ‘s Incredible were but a distant memory .
Says AllDroid.org ’s Jake Day and Boostdscoob … fear not , “ we have root ! ”
At around 10:15 PM UTC , the duo posted a screenshot of what they claim to be a rooted HTC Incredible .
No details were released on how they obtained root access , but few are calling this out as a prank .
This particular phone has taken quite some time for the dev community to root , but as we ’ve seen in the past , where there ’s a will , there ’s a way .
Jake Day says that a download with instructions will be posted soon .
Congrats guys !
UPDATE : Perhaps the fact that today is Memorial Day has made me a bit overly congratulative ( is that even a word ? ) .
According to a post by boostdscoob himself over on XDA , the root is a load of crock .
Here ’s what he had to say about it :
Ok , heres the deal people ..
I had absolutely nothing to do with this , so me being mentioned is sign # 1 this isnt Jake .
Jake wouldnt give me credit for something i had nothing to do with , and i dont have my incredible yet , so again clue # 1 second , Jake does not come to XDA anymore ..
look at his post count .
also , the original post on alldroid , is by Jake Day .
Jake is Jake ’s screen name .
The picture is fake , i can guarantee you that .
the poster is not Jake .
if you dont believe me , contact him , or me directly .
this person / people have gone to a great length to try to embarass a proven developer .
he has all but lost interest in the android community as a result of this .
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama toughened his call for Israel to loosen its blockade of goods headed to Gaza , in a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas aimed at keeping the beleaguered Middle East peace process on track .
Mr. Obama called the situation in Gaza unsustainable and said he and Mr. Abbas had " very extensive " conversations about how to promote " a better approach " in the wake of the May 31 raid on a Turkish aid flotilla that had sought to break Israel 's blockade of the territory .
Nine men were killed by Israeli soldiers in the incident .
The U.S. , joining in a United Nations resolution , condemned the action and called for a credible investigation .
In the aftermath , the international community has ramped up pressure on Israel to ease the blockade of the Mediterranean coastal tract .
The episode has left Mr. Abbas politically weakened by making it appear to ordinary Palestinians that his strategy of negotiating with Israel has once again proved fruitless .

Cooking with Aji Amarillo Kidney Beans Stewed with Aji Amarillo Sauce »
Even at common mainstream supermarkets a wide variety of chiles has become increasingly available .
Fresh , dried , powdered , canned , and puréed versions abound .
Gone are the days when our only choices were red pepper flakes , cayenne , and jalape ños — anchos , pasillas , and cascabels can now roam free .
But beneath this happy variety lurks a dark secret : there 's some serious chile discrimination going on .
Whole chile families are disenfranchised , ignored by grocery stores , forcing shoppers to seek them out in out - of - the - way ethnic markets or on the perilous internet .
And that 's if they 're told about them at all .
Capsicum baccatum is one of the five families of chiles .
Compared to C. annum — the family of bell peppers , jalapeños , poblanos , and New Mexico chiles — it 's not that well - known .
Though if you 've ever had Peruvian food , there 's a good chance you 've had the most recognizable of this relatively unknown chile family : aji amarillo .
What Does It Taste Like ?
Native to South America , aji amarillo is a bright - orange , thick - fleshed chile with a medium to hot heat level .
It 's ubiquitous in Peruvian cuisine , working its way into soups and sauces , which are used in pretty much everything .
Besides its phylogeny , aji amarillo is worth seeking out for its unique flavor , which offers a lot of fruitiness for its heat .
It 's a different kind of fruitiness from other chiles like poblanos : less sharp and harsh , more full - bodied , and a lot more subtle .
If there were a chile to taste like sunshine , this would be it .
It may sound odd to use the word " comforting " to describe a hot chile , but for aji amarillo , it seems fitting .
Forms of Aji Amarillo
Aji amarillo is available at Peruvian markets and some Mexican markets ( as well as online ) in fresh , canned , paste form , or dried .
The paste ( which is just boiled , blended fresh aji amarillo ) is probably the most common , and is well - worth purchasing if that 's all you can find .
And since most sauces involving aji amarillo call for paste instead of minced chiles , it 's certainly a time - saver .
I personally prefer them dried ; I like the concentrated , sweeter flavor reminiscent of raisins or sun-dried tomatoes , and they remain just as subtle and rounded as their fresh counterparts .
Dried chiles are also convenient : you can buy as many as you like since they 're good for years , and then only use what you need , unlike with canned varieties .
How To Use It
Aji amarillo is most frequently made into sauces , either green ( the famous dipping sauce at Pio Pio in New York City ) or orange .
The orange variety , thickened with dairy , mayonnaise , and / or some form of bread , is ladled on meat , poultry , fish , starches , beans , and vegetables .
My version , tailored to kidney beans , is pretty bare - bones , with just a bit of cheese , sugar , and lemon juice for balance and a brief fry - up with some garlic to gain some depth of flavor .
But this is a sauce that begs for customization .
Ground , dried aji amarillo is perfect for cooking rice , lending vibrant color and sweet , rounded flavor .
You can also experiment using it in place of other harsher chiles in spice blends like chili powder for a fruitier variation .
If you 're wary about adding yet another chile to your pantry , keep in mind that aji amarillo tastes different from other more widely available capsicums .
It 's a perfect everyday chile to compliment a meal without overwhelming it , as versatile and inimitable as it is delicious .

Today I 'm editing the Modern Perl book and the Rakudo Perl 6 book .
The human brain is wonderful at seeing patterns , even unintentional and nonexistent .
I saw the word " Perl " in both book titles and wondered at the confusion .
Why is Modern Perl clearly about Perl 5 ?
Why does Rakudo Perl 6 need a version number ?
As Patrick wrote a couple of weeks ago :
Granted , Modern
Perl is my book , published by my company , and I have the final say on anything on or in the book — but can anyone think of a good reason not to rename it to Modern Perl 5 ?
( Note that Andy Lester suggested saying " Perl 5 " when you mean " Perl 5 " almost a year ago , and he was right . )

The Invitation
OK guys , here 's the deal :
I was planning my winter break and was wondering the best method for getting to Southern California for Christmas , and someone suggested I get people I know ( and a few strangers ) to drive me down and back , passing me off from one to the other , like a bunch of mini-roadtrips with a bunch of different people .
I talked a little more with some people and decided to go with something completely different , and not even make SoCal my ultimate destination .
My goal now is to take a trip to the East Coast and back over winter break , by whatever route I can .
I have about 15 volunteers already , each offering their services ranging from a floor to sleep on , to " quasi - concierge service " in a city , to a bed and an 8 - hour driving radius .
I have a map that I 've been drawing on , and it 's showing that I 'll need a lot more volunteers to make this feasible .
So now I 'm asking everyone I know for their help .
If you are going to be in any state ( or province ! ) other than Oregon between December 8th and January 8th , and you think a little roadtrip might be fun , let me know as soon as possible !
The information I need to be able to plan this thing is :
1 ) What city you will be in , and when ;
2 ) Which days you would be able to dedicate to this ( e.g. " any day except Christmas , " " any weekday , " etc. ) ; 3 ) If you have a bed or floor that I can stay a night on ; and 4 ) How far you 're willing to drive me .
If I get enough people in enough places to make a complete chain , I will be buying a videocamera so I can document the whole thing .
ALSO : If you know someone that I do n't know , and they 're not the kidnapping type , tell them to get in contact with me , too !
On an adventure like this , I 'd want to meet as many new people as possible ... plus , the more volunteers I have , the more likely I 'll actually be able to go through with it .
If you 're interested , there are close to a trillion ways to get in contact with me .
Email ( LukeTheRunner@gmail.com ) and phone ( 541-255-5027 ) are the two that most readily come to mind .
Thanks , and looking forward to hearing from you .
- Luke .

REGINA — While the Regina Police Service remains silent on its investigation into the brutal assault of Dustin LaFortune — including the apparent search of a Regina apartment this week — a resident from the building claims to have information that further connects LaFortune to this city .
Dann McKenzie lives at 2158 Halifax St. , the Regina General Hospital - area building police reportedly searched on Tuesday .
While he did n't see or hear the search take place , McKenzie said he 's heard plenty more during the past couple of months .
" There were so many strange noises coming from that apartment , " he said .
" I slammed on the roof and told him to shut up a couple of times and he came down and wanted to fight me once or twice even .
Scary stuff .
I complained about it multiple times even . "
It was mid-March when McKenzie first met the man who'd moved into the apartment above his .
But it was n't until recently — when McKenzie saw a Facebook photo of the man LaFortune 's family allege assaulted him — that McKenzie realized what might have been happening in the upstairs apartment .
" Everything starts clicking and all the tumblers and the little locks start fitting and you just realize that terrible things might have been going on right above me , " he said .
McKenzie said he complained several times to his landlord , but not the police , when the noise continued over time .
" Initially it started off as a moan out here , every morning around nine or 10 in the morning , like a low , drawn - out moan , " he said .
" And I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt .
I thought maybe he had some creepy sexual habits .
I mean , you 're in an apartment .
Sometimes noises get through .
" After that , I started hearing fighting and it was like one - sided fighting .
I recognized ( the upstairs neighbour 's ) voice and it was him screaming at the top of his voice , and then I heard thumping and stomping .
The most twisted was I heard the yelling that went on when these hits were going on .
I just heard things like . . .
' Open your eyes ! ' "
McKenzie said he never saw LaFortune , although he said he learned from the landlord that the upstairs apartment was rented out in LaFortune 's name .
McKenzie added that neighbours he'd talked to also were n't certain they 'd ever seen the 26 - year - old — although some said they 'd seen a man who may have been LaFortune in and around the apartment .
McKenzie said he talked to numerous people about the noises upstairs , asking for advice on whether he should contact police .
He said he remained uncertain about what was happening up there since he never heard anyone other than the neighbour he'd met — including in response to what sounded like violence .
He added the noises stopped sometime in early April , soon after the landlord responded to McKenzie 's complaints by reportedly talking to the upstairs resident .
A woman who answered a telephone call to the landlord 's residence said they 'd been told by police not to discuss the matter .
Part of the Series The Public Intellectual
The best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina .
– Arne Duncan Visions have nowadays fallen into disrepute and we tend to be proud of what we should be ashamed of .
– Zygmunt Bauman Market - Based Educational Reform and the Politics of Fraud
In Arne Duncan ’s world , the language of educational reform is defined primarily through the modalities of competition , measurement and quantification .
Competition is now one of the most important registers organizing and defining schools and classroom pedagogical practices – no doubt made obvious by the name of Obama ’s educational reform policy “ Race to the Top , ” with its allusion to Wall Street values and casino capitalism .
Within this discourse , there seems to be little understanding , as Stuart Hall has argued , “ that there is a limit to the good that can be produced by individual competitiveness . ” [ 1 ]
Of course , competition itself is not the problem since competition can be healthy in a number of areas .
The real issue is when competition becomes , as Christopher Newfield points out , “ the sole organizing principle of society . ” [ 2 ]
And when that happens in educational policies such as those pushed by the Obama administration , one consequence is that the ultimate agent of schooling is modeled after the unattached individual competing for financial rewards , status and a job in the workforce .
But there is more at work here than the vulgar instrumentalization of the curriculum , homage to an unchecked mode of market competition and the crude reduction of teacher work to thoughtless methodologies and techniques .
There is also a neoliberal agenda in which public money is channeled into the hands of wealthy individuals and corporations .
In addition , there is the ongoing infatuation with privatization and the push for charter schools , largely used to siphon off and privilege middle - class students , while promoting forms of tracking and social dumping that often mark underfunded public schools .
[ 3 ]
There is also the push for governance structures shaped in the image of a largely disgraced business culture , whose aim is to restructure the administrative apparatus in public schools as part of a broader political project to weaken the power of faculty and unions , while placing unaccountable power in the hands of corporate elites .
As the forces of privatization merge with the destruction of public housing in many urban areas such as Chicago , charter and privatized schools become the beachheads for gentrification and the emergence of gated communities .
Moreover , the values that produce such spaces are now replicated in the schools themselves as they are filled by administrators , teachers and students who do not “ know how to share public space to common advantage ” [ 4 ] or who have not learned how to deal effectively with racial and economic differences .
[ 5 ]
Gaining ground since the 1980s , these reform measures represent the triumph of neoliberal ideology and policies over public education , formerly viewed as a repository of democratic ideals , values and practices .
Rather than challenge reform measures whose heritage has more to do with fighting desegregation than fostering democratic modes of schooling , Obama and Duncan have simply legitimated and further extended them .
The elements of such a reactionary educational policy are well known : unrestrained individualism in all realms , unbridled competition and corporate values as the master metaphors for educational change , all of which signify a gross perversion of democracy and anything approaching an empowering education .
Duncan , in particular , appears to have no language for addressing problems , values , issues and goods that cannot be measured and quantified or are not subject to the profit - making dictates of the market .
If public schools have the potential to be vibrant spaces for engaging young people in critical dialog , exchange and creativity , such potential is absent from Duncan ’s view of schooling .
In fact , it is fair to argue that Duncan ignores , if not disdains , a long tradition in American life extending from Thomas Jefferson to C. Wright Mills and Hannah Arendt in which it has been recognized that citizens are produced , not simply born , and that public schools are the crucial political site where socialization for a healthy democracy takes place . [ 6 ]
Increasingly , students are being subjected to a stripped - down notion of schooling , making it more difficult for them not just to think critically , but also to imagine a world beyond the gospel of competition and profit and the economic calculus of financial gain and loss .
Public schooling is more and more being shaped by a pedagogy of containment , security and conformity that undermines critical thought , teaching and dialog while emphasizing market values that often create what William Black calls a “ criminogenic environment ” – one that promotes and legitimates market - driven practices that include fraud , deregulation and other perverse practices .
[ 7 ]
Black claims that the most extreme pedagogical expression of such an environment can be found in business schools , which he calls “ fraud factories ” for the elite .
[ 8 ]
He writes :
We now have the entitlement generation as CEOs .
They just plain feel entitled to being wealthy … with no responsibility , no accountability .
They have become literal sociopaths .
So one of the things is , you clean up business schools , which right now are fraud factories at the senior levels , right ?
They create the new monsters that take control and destroy massive enterprises and cause global economic crises , cause the great recession . [ 9 ]
These same values described by Black now drive the reform movement shaping public education .
What is disturbing about Duncan ’s position is that he rarely makes reference to the corruption , fraud , scandals , greed and criminal behavior in the larger society often associated with the ruthless , business - culture model he has adopted as a model for public education .
There is no mention or the slightest bit of self - reflection in Duncan ’s view of education to indicate that the values driving his call for the reform of public schools share an uncanny alignment with the values that gave us the Enron scandal , the Madoff Affair , “ liar ’s loans , ” the subprime mortgage crisis and the larger economic recession .
Duncan ’s indifference functions like an autoimmune system that , instead of protecting life , has turned on the body politic , destroying its life - supporting organs and functions . [ 10 ]
His political and ethical indifference to the death - dealing values that define the business culture to which he is so attached blinds him to the corruptions , illegalities and scandals that now fill the air like the volcanic ash that put Europe in a crisis in the early part of the summer of 2010 .
Some of these corrupt practices are obvious and can be found in recent reports of school administrators and teachers in Georgia , Indiana , Massachusetts , Nevada , Virginia , and other states doctoring test results in order to get either salary bonuses or promotions . [ 11 ]
They can also be found in the desperate attempts by many schools to mimic market - based values by resorting to financial incentives in which they sell not only baked goods to raise money , but also test points for grades . [ 12 ]
In Chicago and Washington , DC , students in some schools have been paid to get good grades , as if quick financial gain is the most important motivation for learning .
In reality , it may pose a serious threat to forms of teaching and learning that enable critical thinking , active citizenship and a heightened imagination .
Would it ever occur to students educated to believe that financial gain is the best motivation for learning to question an educational system in which “ disciplines such as history , literature , classical studies , and philosophy would be valued only to the extent that they sell themselves as tools of the growing economy ” ? [ 13 ]
Would they be able to recognize the importance of values that cannot be commodified or treated solely in terms of their exchange value on the market ?
Where do matters of honesty , civility , trust , compassion and responsibility for others enter into this discourse ?
Clearly , money has the power not only to corrupt , but also to make those educational nonreformers who view it as the most important force for influencing students either stupid or disingenuous .
Exchanging grades for money does more than teach students the wrong lessons ; it also makes clear that selling out education has now become standard fare . [ 14 ]
What is rather startling about these stories is that they mimic the same values and practices of Wall Street bankers who shamelessly and without apology engaged in destructive and exploitative financial practices in order to reap large short - term profits , practices that eventually led to the economic meltdown and unbearable hardship and suffering for millions of people around the globe .
One would think that schools , of all institutions , would be the last establishment where matters of motivation and teacher merit would be connected primarily to monetary rewards .
It appears that Obama and Duncan do not recognize in their own reform policies the unapologetic appropriation of casino capitalism so flagrantly exhibited in the practices of high - flying venture capitalists , who eagerly search out schools as part of their efforts to generate quick and lucrative profits , or who bundle together financial transactions that are bound to fail and then bet against them at the expense of their own investors .
Do Obama and Duncan not see a connection between the values that informed the banking and financial industries , who swindled poor people with subprime mortgages , and the incentives behind their own reforms ?
The corrupting nature of these market - oriented values on higher education was recently made clear in a “ Frontline ” television documentary that highlighted a number of educational entrepreneurs , who were in the business of buying failing universities and schools , injecting them with larger amounts of capital , and then turning them into for - profit schools .
When asked how he makes such schools successful , one such entrepreneur , Michael Clifford , responded that it took “ money , management and marketing , ” and that his financial backers make profits so large from these deals that he was embarrassed to provide a figure . [ 15 ]
What he does n’t mention , however , is that for these schools to be profitable , they do away with tenure , hire teachers on short - term contracts , charge inflated tuition rates and promote aggressive marketing campaigns to secure students who have to take out huge federal loans in order to attend these schools .
The problem is that , for the schools to be profitable , they have to attract an endless stream of students , and they do this by making it easy for them to secure government - backed loans , which , for many students , are almost impossible to repay , leaving them saddled with thousands of dollars in debt .
Moreover , the pressure for growth has resulted in the use of questionable high - pressure recruiting techniques to attract students who cannot succeed or graduate and eventually drop out .
The largest for - profit school , the University of Phoenix , spends 20 to 25 percent of its total revenue on marketing , while only spending 10 to 20 percent on faculty . [ 16 ]
In some cases , students are recruited on the basis of fraudulent claims such as being told that the degree program in which they are enrolling is accredited , when it is not .
Argos University - Dallas is being sued by a number of students who were told that the university ’s graduate psychology program was going to be accredited by the American Psychology Association .
It never received the accreditation , leaving the students with worthless degrees and huge debts . [ 17 ]
Moreover , enrollment counselors are paid solely through the number of students they recruit , which gives them incentive to use often questionable tactics to recruit such students and hook them up for a quick loan .
For instance , Drake College of Business , a for - profit higher education company recruited young people from homeless shelters , while charging them over $ 15,000 annually in tuition fees . [ 18 ]
Many of these students defaulted on their loans , providing a profit windfall for Drake .
In fact , it has been estimated that “ the default - rate at for - profits could be as high as 50 percent . ” [ 19 ]
When Duncan was asked in the “ College Inc. ” documentary about the loan scam and default rate for these students , he answered tepidly that it was “ something we need to watch . ” [ 20 ]
Indeed !
But if there were any doubt expressed by Duncan about for - profit schooling , he rescinded it in a later luncheon speech in which he insisted on the “ vital role ” that “ for - profit institutions play in providing job training for students . ” [ 21 ]
Profit once again trumps the needs of students as Duncan enshrines market - driven forces while overlooking the havoc and hardship imposed on students who fall for the high - pressure recruiting tactics and the instant loans .
In the “ College Inc. ” documentary , one former recruiter stated , “ If our numbers started dropping , trainers would come around and start telling you to up your outgoing calls anywhere from 300 to 450 calls a day to meet these quotas , to get those applications . ” [ 22 ]
Even more disturbing is that the “ Federal aid to for - profit colleges has jumped to $ 26.5 billion in 2009 from $ 4.6 billion in 2000 . ” [ 23 ]
Yet , the American taxpayer is subsidizing the loans given to students while private investors are reaping the profits on the defaulted loans .
Daniel Golden , an education reporter for Bloomberg News claims , “ The taxpayers are essentially funding this industry .
Something like 75 percent of their revenue comes from federal grants and loans . ” [ 24 ]
The University of Phoenix now gets “ 86 percent of its revenue from the federal government , up from something like 48 percent ten years ago . ” [ 25 ]
It is also worth noting that taxpayers have made John Sperling , the founder of the University of Phoenix , a billionaire and have financed the millions in revenue he has handed out to his top executives .
Not only are the financial costs of these colleges often much higher than their public counterparts but they also aggressively recruit vulnerable working - class and poor minority students using dubious tactics .
Once again , the students who attend these schools are often disproportionally saddled with a heavy debt load , especially if they drop out .
As Zygmunt Bauman points out , “ Students have been forced / encouraged to live on credit – to spend money which at best they might hope to earn many years later ( assuming the prosperity and consumerist orgy lasted that long ) .
The training in the art of ‘ living in debt ’ and living in debt permanently , has been incorporated into the curriculum of national education . ” [ 26 ]
These are the same predatory neoliberal policies , values and motivations that are also driving the privatization , voucher and charter school crowd that has a strong supporter in Duncan .
The people who are leading the charge for charter schools might as well be taking their cues from the wealthy entrepreneurs investing in for - profit universities .
As reported recently in the New York Times , many hedge fund managers now have their sights on charter schools “ because they see an entrepreneurial answer to the nation ’s education woes . ” [ 27 ]
What is left out of this alleged concern with the problems of public education is the market - addicted infatuation with the cult of privatization and the lure of easy profits .
Charter schools allegedly “ appeal to the maverick instincts of many who run hedge funds . ” [ 28 ]
One wishes that such statements were merely fodder for late night comics .
Instead , they reveal how little these rich , business tycoons and corporate moguls have learned from the financial crisis for which they are responsible .
These Wall Street gamblers , whose corrupt and “ naked speculation … drove financial markets off a cliff in 2008 , ” want to use the same disparaged values that sank banks and wiped out the savings and jobs of millions of Americans to develop charter schools and promote educational reform . [ 29 ]
In the stories surrounding the charter school movement , the incessant search for new markets to invest in surfaces as the main factor influencing its supporters , and certainly not social values or civic conscience .
One charter school advocate for Wall Street indicates what appears to be the real motive behind the hedge fund managers ’ obsession with charter schools .
He writes : “ It ’s the most important cause in the nation , obviously and with the state providing so much of the money , outside contributions are insanely well leveraged . ” [ 30 ]
Hedge fund managers believe that charter schools are a hot cause and , allegedly , “ appeal to the maverick instincts of many who run hedge funds . ” [ 31 ]
But there is more at stake here than fashion and inflated testosterone levels , there is also the usual suspect , greed .
Of course , in addition to accessing a money flow that requires little accountability , there are also opportunities to break unions , employ cheap and overworked teachers and organize curricula and classroom pedagogy to teach business values and principles that legitimate the investors ’ own casino capitalist approach to public goods such as education .
Some advocates of privatization who call for the destruction of public schools are quite clear about how they view the role of charter schools .
For example Andy Smarick , a think - tank wank at the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute , argues that closing allegedly bad public schools – code for all public schools – need to be subject to the “ creative destruction ” of market forces and that charter schools provide a way station to implementing that goal .
Put simply , charter schools should be allowed to fail so they can be then taken over by private industry .
As for reforming public education , he argues :
The beginning of the solution is establishing a clear process for closing schools .
The simplest and best way to put this into operation is the charter model .
Each school , in conjunction with the state or district , would develop a five - year contract with performance measures .
Consistent failure to meet goals in key areas would result in closure … .
The churn caused by closures is n’t something to be feared ; on the contrary , it ’s a familiar prerequisite for industry health . [ 32 ]
David Harvey has a better term for this process , he calls it “ accumulation by dispossession , ” [ 33 ] and Ken Saltman in his analysis of how market forces capitalize on disaster in education uses the apt phrase “ smash and grab privatization . ” [ 34 ]
Unlike Smarick and his ilk who want to replace markets with a market - driven society , Harvey , Saltman , and others make it clear that , after the endless corporate scandals of the last two decades extending from Enron to American International Group ( AIG ) to the current shameless behavior of BP in the Gulf , what is good for the health of an industry actually may be bad for democracy , the environment and everyone else .
There is a lot of money to be made in supporting charter schools , as seems evident in the number of hedge fund managers , wealthy Americans and Wall Street executives now lining up to support them .
Unprecedented numbers of wealthy foundations – what one prominent educator calls “ The Billionaires Boys Club , ” which includes the Gates Foundation , the Walton Family Foundation and the Broad Foundation – “ are committed now to charter schools and to evaluating teachers by test scores . ” [ 35 ]
It is worth repeating that the reasons are not always philanthropic .
New York Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez wrote an important article indicating that a piece of legislation called the New Market Tax Credit , passed under the Clinton administration in 2000 , gave banks and equity funds an enormous federal tax credit when they invested in charter schools . [ 36 ]
The unsavory business practices , Ponzi scheme corruption and hardships that have been endured by schools as a result of these tax breaks and financial investments are explained by Gonzales .
In an interview with Amy Goodman , he states :
What happens is the investors who put up the money to build charter schools get to basically or virtually double their money in seven years through a thirty - nine percent tax credit from the federal government .
In addition , this is a tax credit on money that their [ sic ] lending , so they ’re also collecting interest on the loans as well as getting the thirty - nine percent tax credit .
They piggy - back the tax credit on other kinds of federal tax credits like historic preservation or job creation or brownfields credits .
The result is , you can put in ten million dollars and in seven years double your money .
The problem is that the charter schools end up paying in rents the debt service on these loans and so now a lot of the charter schools in Albany are straining paying their debt service – their rent has gone up from $ 170,000 to $ 500,000 in a year – huge increases in their rents as they strain to pay off these loans , these construction loans .
The rents are eating up huge portions of their total cost .
And , of course , the money is coming from the state .
One of the big issues is that so many of these charter schools are not being audited .
No one knows who are the people making these huge windfall profits as the investors .
Often , there are interlocking relationships between the charter school boards and the nonprofit groups that organize and syndicate the loans . [ 37 ]
As a strong advocate for charter schools , Duncan rarely acknowledges that such schools are fraught with problems , in spite of the many red flags now being brought to the public ’s attention .
For example , there is increasing evidence that charter schools are no better or worse than public schools in terms of student achievement . [ 38 ]
Moreover , in many instances they produce egregious amounts of fraud , corruption and criminal behavior and , increasingly , they exploit the labor and professionalism of teachers who work in these schools .
Regarding the latter point , John Funiciello points out , “ The toll [ taken ] on teachers in charter schools by long hours and lack of job security has not been much discussed or analyzed , but a clue might be found in a study by a pair of Vanderbilt University researchers [ that ] showed that charter school teachers were 132 percent more likely to leave their jobs , than teachers in traditional schools . ” [ 39 ]
We get a hint of why in a statement by one founder of a charter school in New Orleans , who told a Times - Picayune reporter , “ the teachers in his school , founded in 2008 , are paid for a 50 - hour week , but that they often put in 60 - 70 hours .
He also said that none of his teachers is married – and , they do n’t have children . ” [ 40 ]
It gets worse .
Diane Ravitch , the renowned educational theorist and former assistant secretary of education for the administration of President George H.W. Bush , also indicates that the “ Philadelphia Inquirer reported that at least four charters were under federal criminal investigation for nepotism , conflicts of interest and financial mismanagement .
The managers of other charters in Pennsylvania created private companies to sell products or services to their schools or placed relatives on the payroll .
One charter , the Inquirer found , paid millions of dollars in rent , salaries and management fees annually to a for - profit company owned by the charter ’s chief executive officer . ” [ 41 ]
There is more to be said about Duncan ’s support of charter schools beyond even his unwillingness to recognize the limits of charter school performance , the drawbacks of turning public money and governance structures for public schools over to private investors , the growing evidence of corruption and fraud and the increased hardship for teachers , students and parents that often accompanies charter school development .
Duncan ’s silence on these issues stems from his willingness to view schools like a business and those who run them as CEOs whose job is similar to managing corporate portfolios .
But at work here is something even more pernicious than Obama ’s and Duncan ’s support for educational reforms that represent a deep distrust of public values and disregard for the notion of schooling as a public good : there is also the broader element of a neoliberal project that view charters as an interim measure on the way to ending public education and replacing it with publicly funded private schooling .
While there are individuals and groups who advocate for charter schools as part of an attempt to strengthen public education , they often fail to realize that once a public school is transformed into a charter school , it then becomes easy to close and replace with private services .
We get a hint of these concerns and the political project that drives them in a recent op - ed by Charles Murray , a firm supporter of charter schools .
Writing in The New York Times , Murray claims conservatives should no longer defend charter schools based on the achievement of higher standardized test scores .
He now claims that test scores prove very little and that the real defense of charters should be issued on the “ basis of … shared parental calculation . ” [ 42 ]
Charters should be endorsed as part of a larger movement to create schools that replace “ the progressive curriculum used in the country ’s other public schools ” with a more traditional curriculum . [ 43 ]
It is becoming daily more evident that the unapologetic conservative justification of parental “ choice ” is code for organizing schools in opposition to the landmark United States Supreme Court desegregation ruling in the 1950s ( Brown v. Board of Education ) .
Murray ’s support for charter schools , vouchers and other elements in the neoliberal knapsack of reforms exemplifies this type of separatist logic , one that , in this case , comes from an ideologue who has utterly disavowed notions of democratic equality in favor of a commitment to what he calls the “ cognitive elite , ” a category of people that excludes the working class and minorities .
Given that Murray has argued for the inherent genetic superiority of whites , is a primary architect of social policies that favor the dismantling of the social state and is an apologist for racist modes of segregation , it is not surprising that educational policies favoring vouchers , charters and privatization are compatible with his sectarian notion of schooling .
Yet , more is at stake in the promotion of charter schools than a retooling of public education as an adjunct of the corporation or as a gated institution and bulwark against minorities of class , color and ethnicity .
There is also a more capacious attempt to dismantle public schooling as a public good within the broader context of American society being systematically refashioned through the domination and rule of corporations , religious bigots and the rich and powerful . [ 44 ]
The discourse of “ educational reform ” promoted by the Obama administration really veils a movement that is attempting to disinvest in the public schools and to dismantle the social state .
While Duncan may not go so far as to support the end point of neoliberal policy with its destruction of all things public , he certainly plays a formative role in legitimizing and asserting the values that underpin this neoliberal anti-public ideology .
Educational Casualties
Again and again , but particularly in recent years , it has been noticed that intellect in America is resented as a kind of excellence , as a claim to distinction , as a challenge to egalitarianism , as a quality which almost certainly deprives a man or woman of the common touch .
The phenomenon is most impressive in education itself .
American education can be praised , not to say defended , on many counts ; but I believe ours is the only education system in the world vital segments of which have fallen into the hands of people who joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise . [ 45 ]
Richard Hofstadter
The first effect of Duncan ’s educational policies is the sabotaging of the formative pedagogical culture , governance structures , and democratic values necessary for educating young people to think critically , embrace democratic civic values and be willing to intervene in the world in order to expand and deepen the processes of justice , equality and democratization .
The first casualty of Duncan ’s stripped - down notion of reform encompass more than the capacities students need to live in a just society , extending even to those elements absolutely crucial to any viable democracy – the ability of citizens to be able to think for themselves , to question authority and to dialog critically with the diverse traditions that enrich American society .
Obama and Duncan have defaulted on their responsibility to address schooling as one of the most crucial institutions the nation has for educating young people , to maintain and improve upon its democratic institutions .
What is striking in their educational reform efforts is the degree to which the imagination has been left out of their approach .
Conceiving of education as anything beyond thinking , reading and relating within the dull confines of memorization , empty drills and punishing social relations , does not appear of even remote interest to the current administration , such that one is left wondering if it has the slightest clue about educational reform .
The second , equally insidious casualty involves the skills and purpose of those who teach and foster critical thinking among young people .
Continuing the educational legacy of the Bush / Cheney regime , Obama and Duncan seem intent on stripping teachers of the autonomy , decent working conditions , power and creative tools that would enable them to think and act imaginatively in their classrooms .
Removing the pedagogical conditions necessary to foster teacher autonomy in the classroom leads inexorably to the deskilling and dumbing down of existing and prospective teachers .
In Duncan ’s corporatized world , teachers are reduced to cogs and limited to teaching standardized lessons , memorization and test - taking skills in an effort to get schools to “ Race to the Top . ”
But the current administration is not content with just preventing existing teachers from thinking critically and acting creatively .
It wants to go further by also attacking any vestige of critical pedagogy and education .
Indeed , it seems quite terrified of those modes of critical education that might create future generations of teachers who view their role as more than corporate drones and drab accountants who eagerly embrace teacher - proof lessons and gleefully collect and assess knowledge that is empirically - based and marketable .
The depoliticization of teachers means making sure they do not have access to any critical notions of theory , literacy , pedagogy and knowledge .
Consequently , conservatives are increasingly developing alternative paths of certification for teachers in an effort to narrow their education to the learning of classroom skills , methods and techniques .
At work here is an attempt to transform teacher education programs into simplified forms of instrumental training .
Within this model of reform , teaching and learning are viewed primarily as corporate - based management problems divorced from matters of agency , experience , ethics , theory , history and politics .
Anti-intellectualism fuels and works alongside attempts to reconfigure education in utterly instrumental terms , limiting the meaning of education to the narrow and reductive demands of economic development , the acquisition and disposal of commodities , the branding of identities and the legitimation of a life in which all interpersonal and social relations tend to be subordinated to logic of consumerism . [ 46 ]
Such moves are both poisonous for democracy and severely proscribe any humanistic understanding of education , but they explain how a liberal arts college in Maine recently chose to advertise itself quite shamelessly as the “ Home of the Guaranteed Job . ” [ 47 ]
The third casualty of the Obama - Duncan reform movement are those students who are marginalized by class and race .
All students are increasingly subjected to curricula that initiates them into corporate values , but such an education can provide the right credentials and opportunities for only a very select group of privileged students .
Not all students are from the privileged precincts of the rich and famous ; in fact , few students are positioned to benefit from this type of education .
Those who are marginalized by virtue of their race and class are often , instead , subjected to a punishing form of pedagogy , one that dumbs down the curricula and forces students to submit to harsh disciplinary tactics such as zero tolerance policies , while also subjecting teachers to performance - based measures and students to the memorization and regurgitation of information as part of the misguided aims of high - stakes testing .
These are the students who now constitute a major part of the human waste industry , often pushed out of schools and eagerly marched into the military or prisons .
Yet , while such an education bears down disproportionately hard on some students , it does a disservice to all students , as it does little to educate anyone to be able to recognize anti-democratic forces in the culture or provide the knowledge and skills they need to actively participate in critically engaging and shaping affairs of public importance .
Duncan likes to describe his educational reforms as part of the legacy of great civil rights movement .
And there is an equalizing impulse in such reforms , but one that has less to do with civil rights and more to do with the practice of standardization , conformity and training , and for many poor white , black and brown students the protocols of harsh disciplinary practices .
In the end , such reforms largely initiate all students into the values of the corporate factory , which as Stanley Aronowitz points out , may be one of the nation ’s most authoritarian institutions . [ 48 ]
Under the regime of high - stakes testing , the reality of the society in which most young people live is ignored or viewed as a threat to canonical knowledge .
The dreams , experiences , cultures , knowledge forms and modes of literacy that exist and flourish outside of schools are viewed as either worthless forms of knowledge or subject to the most superficial attention – making schools all the more alien and oppressive to this generation of young people .
Finding themselves in schools that resemble prisons and classrooms that actively remove any vestige of joy , critical learning and meaningful knowledge from the educational experience , students are blamed for their academic failures , while school authority and the larger system that drives it go unmentioned and unaccountable for the fate of these students .
Money now follows how students perform on high - stakes testing , which means there is a transfer of huge amounts of public money to publishers , testing organizations and large consulting companies . [ 49 ]
It also means “ that school districts where the affluent live get more than their share and make up for state budget deficits by raising local property taxes and soliciting annual subventions from parents , measures not affordable by even the top layer of wage workers and low - level salaried employees . ” [ 50 ]
This surely is a system that promotes a race to the top , but one that neither begins with a level playing field nor attempts to create one .
Beyond the social inequities , corporate corruption , deskilling of teachers and commercial vulgarization of curricula produced by the corporatization of public and higher education , the Obama - Duncan reform movement will inevitably contribute further to removing education from the realm of democratic politics and ideals by undermining the critical formative culture that makes dissent , dialog , thoughtfulness , public values and a commitment to democracy even possible .
This speaks to a real crisis in education – one that takes on a certain urgency in light of the fact that , when 73 percent of young people were surveyed in 2009 , they responded that their top goal was being financially wealthy , as opposed to only 37 percent who supported that position in 1971 . [ 51 ]
The culture of intemperate greed unleashed in the late 1970s has taken a terrible toll on the civic skills and imaginations of an entire generation , putting the future of democracy itself in danger .
Education now suffers from a democratic deficit and is getting worse .
The mission of public and higher education and the role of teachers in American schools and the institutions that educate them deserve more than to be forced to acclimatize to a market - based culture in which anything that cannot be quantified , measured and consumed is viewed as useless , especially if it fails to set individuals in competition with each other and does not lend itself to making an immediate profit .
Removed from democratic ideals , education is aligned with an order of privatization increasingly positioned at odds with all public institutions that promote the social foundations of human solidarity .
From a Pedagogy of Technique and Containment to Critical Pedagogy
Any viable notion of school reform has to recognize that public schooling in the United States now suffers from a crisis of vision , power and pedagogy .
Schools are no longer viewed as democratic public spheres but as credentials mills , training centers and discipline factories .
Clearly , schools must reaffirm their role as foundational institutions in preparing students for citizenship in a global democracy .
Education is essential not just for educating students for the workplace , but also for teaching them the skills of civic courage , leadership and social responsibility .
This means any viable reform movement must first recognize that the genuine purpose of education is not training , but providing students with the capacities necessary for self - determination and the motivation crucial to maintaining the conditions for an aspiring democracy .
Second , genuine educational reform must address not merely the democratic mission of schooling , but also its fiscal crisis .
Within a society racked by massive inequalities in wealth and income , schools suffer from such inequities and reproduce them in the lives of students who are poor and undeserved .
In the midst of an inadequate funding scheme based on property taxes , schools fail too many poor white , brown and black students , while foregoing any commitment to the mutually determining registers of equity and excellence .
In the midst of a recession , the corrosive effects of a damaged and underfinanced public school system are now crossing over into the suburbs .
Even wealthy suburban parents are digging into their own pockets to provide school supplies , fund extracurricular programs and hire teachers . [ 52 ]
American schools cannot begin to address the class divide , race - based disparities or the challenge of providing the intellectual culture and practical competencies needed by students in a democracy without rectifying how education is funded .
Needless to say , this is not merely an economic issue , but a profoundly political one and it goes to the heart of how we define federal budgets , government policies and priorities and the importance of the social state as the fundamental mechanism for promoting the common good .
The third element of educational reform must address how teachers should be treated as intellectuals and work under policies that give them individual and collective power over their working conditions along with salaries commensurate with the importance of their professional status and public roles .
Teachers matter in a democratic society ; the degree to which they are currently devalued , overworked and underpaid contribute to the erosion of the educational conditions and formative culture necessary for a viable democratic society .
Corporate ideologies , values and management practices devalue teachers , degrade instruction and demean students .
Fourth , a careful consideration of how learning happens in the classroom is central to making schools , teaching and learning meaningful , imaginative , critical and transformative in the lives of young people .
While I have outlined the first three elements of reform above , I want to conclude with a commentary on the crucial importance of incorporating critical pedagogy into classroom teaching and learning , if educational reform is going to make a difference for democracy .
We have heard a lot of talk among so called educational reformers about access to equal opportunity , parental choice , privatization , teacher quality and smaller classrooms , but rarely is the issue of pedagogical theory and practice a subject of debate .
Teaching for many conservatives such as Duncan is often treated merely as a set of strategies used in order to teach prespecified subject matter .
In this context , teaching becomes synonymous with a method , a technique or the practice of a particular set of skills .
The role of the teacher in this approach has more to do with a clerk offering a grab bag of techniques than a critically informed teacher willing to do more than “ serve up well worn and obvious truths that reinforce both common sense , the self - evident and existing relations of power . ” [ 53 ]
Critical pedagogy rejects this notion that teaching can be reduced to a set of prepackaged techniques implemented regardless of the contexts in which they are used .
Critical pedagogy views education , instead , as a political and moral project attentive to matters of agency and to the history and specificity of the contexts in which students learn .
Learning is always political because it is connected to the formation and acquisition of agency .
For this reason , pedagogy can never be viewed merely as a method or disinterested practice simply because it always represents , whether consciously or not , a deliberate attempt on the part of educators to influence how and what knowledge and subjectivities are produced within particular sets of social relations . [ 54 ]
As a political project , critical pedagogy illuminates the relationships among knowledge , authority and power , drawing attention to questions such as who has control over the conditions for the production of knowledge , values and skills .
It raises important questions about the kind of life presented to us in the classroom and whether it enables students to be autonomous , self - determining and capable of self and social critique .
Moreover , it sheds light on the ways in which knowledge , identities and authority are constructed within particular circuits of power and whether such relations neutralize or make visible the meaning and challenges facing an aspiring democracy .
Ethically , critical pedagogy stresses the importance of understanding what actually happens in classrooms and other educational settings by raising questions regarding what knowledge is of most worth , what it means to know something and desire knowledge , and what future is being imagined within particular modes of pedagogy .
It also takes seriously the important relationship between how we learn and how we act as individual and social agents .
In this instance , critical pedagogy is concerned with teaching students not only how to think , but also how to assume a measure of individual and social responsibility – namely , what it means to be responsible for one ’s actions as part of a broader attempt to be an engaged citizen who can participate individually and collectively in society in order to expand and deepen the possibilities of democratic public life . [ 55 ]
There is no such thing as a disinterested pedagogy .
Nor should there be since a noncommittal pedagogy is an impossibility .
Rather than forfeiting the responsibility that comes with authority , critical pedagogy embraces it as both an object of ongoing self - reflection and a source for critical agency .
Authority in this instance is used to provide students with the pedagogical conditions necessary to enable them to face the responsibilities and choices they have to make in society about their role in addressing human misery , suffering and a sustainable future in which the struggle for equality , reason , freedom and justice is ongoing .
Critical pedagogy at its most ambitious offers an approach for educators to foster the conditions that enable students to think critically , take risks and reflect on the connection between the knowledge they gain and the obligations of civic and social responsibility .
At the same time , critical pedagogy encourages recognition that effective learning is not about passively receiving knowledge as a commodity or a predesigned method .
Pedagogy is not merely about providing information for consumption – what Paulo Freire called banking education – it is about actively engaging classroom knowledge through critical dialog , judgment , argument and analysis .
Public schools and the pedagogies they invoke need not be limited to learning how to take tests and mastering instrumental methodologies designed to produce and use empirical data .
They can be about creating spaces that unsettle and inspire , problematize common sense and make knowledge meaningful , challenge authoritarianism both in and out of the classroom and empower students to be informed and critical of the world around them .
Such pedagogies can evaluate students through the protocols of writing essays , doing research papers , working collectively on projects , learning how to read and use the new media critically and productively and connecting what they learn not only to their immediate environment , but also to those times and places that exist far removed from their own experiences .
This orientation of critical pedagogy toward social justice through transformative personal and social analyses may be one reason why it seems to be viewed as dangerous by Duncan and many of his supporters , including David Steiner , the current commissioner of the New York State Department of Education .
If critical pedagogy is considered dangerous by Duncan and his followers , it may also be because it is , in part , about recognizing the importance of different educational contexts and how these contexts affect the conditions for both teaching and interacting with students .
Critical pedagogy is context sensitive and makes the issue of specificity central to the practice of teaching .
In doing so , it recognizes that the current emphasis on the standardization of curricula , knowledge , teaching and social relations does an injustice to the different narratives , issues , histories and experiences that students bring to schools .
Such outside forces operate in classrooms within different cultural , economic and political contexts , and it makes no sense to ignore them given the unique resources , insights and opportunities they present for teachers .
Critical pedagogy begins with an understanding of students as individuals with enormous capacities to be critical , knowledgeable , imaginative and informed citizens , workers and social agents .
Consequently , schools are viewed as a crucial resource in a developing democracy and teachers are valued as the front line of academic labor responsible for educating young people in the ideals , goals and practices of a sustainable democratic society .
This is a vision of schooling that should be valued and defended by Americans as part of an ongoing attempt to stop Obama and Duncan from reducing public and higher education to models of economic development and a source of profits for the exorbitantly rich and powerful , asset - stripping corporations .
Young people deserve better ; an aspiring democracy demands more , and Obama and Duncan should work toward an educational reform movement that embraces public values , democratic ideals and critical teaching over the market values and lifeless pedagogies that are so closely allied with standardized curricula , privatized education , charter schools and high - stakes testing .

Online here .
What Goodman and so many other liberals seem to miss in their slavish adulation of Ravitch ’s new liberal credentials is why they and she have ignored leftist critics of education for so long – a position that is also evident in liberal journals such as The Nation ( its recent issue , June 24 , 2010 , on educational reform does not include one prominent leftist educational critic ) .
Ravitch ’s newly found liberalism is spelled out in greater detail in her book , “ Diane Ravitch , The Death and Life of the Great American School System : How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education , ” ( New York : Basic Books , 2010 ) .
While Ravitch criticizes venture philanthropists such as Gates , Broad and Walton for promoting neoliberal educational policies , she does so in defense of a larger conservative attempt to restore Western - based curricula marked by fixed disciplines and traditional core knowledge .
There is little in this position that recognizes the importance of the knowledge that young people experience daily or the broader cultures and modes of literacy that shape their lives .
As Stanley Aronowitz reminds us , teacher authority must be earned by recognizing the traditions , historical and popular , that shape kids ’ lives , though this should not suggest either romanticizing such experience or doing way with teaching the best of the canon .
See Stanley Aronowitz , “ Against Schooling : For an Education That Matters , ” ( Boulder : Paradigm Publishers , 2008 ) .
Another insightful and critical argument against the casino capitalist philanthropists can be found in Kenneth Saltman ’s work .
Unlike Ravitch , he does not blame progressive education for the system ’s current failings , and he takes up the current reform movement now bankrolled by “ the billionaires club ” as part of the neoliberal assault on both schools and democracy itself .

Industrial policy is back in fashion .
Our new coalition government claims that the financial industry is too big .
They promise to “ rebalance the economy ” , mainly in favour of high tech and green industries .
These excellent but mysteriously under - funded industries will be encouraged with subsidies .
Industrial subsidies are a bad idea .
They replace the judgement of investors risking their own money with the judgement of politicians playing with other people ’s money .
Not only does this reduce the chance of wise investment , it distracts entrepreneurs from their proper business .
They devote themselves to winning the sympathy of the subsidy dispensers rather than producing things that consumers will pay for voluntarily .
A planned economy is an economy of political favours .
But these perverse effects of subsidies are not my concern here .
An even simpler point about subsidies suffices to show where our politicians have gone wrong in their analysis of the financial crisis and our inflated banking sector .
And that point is this .
If a subsidy is offered , it will be accepted .
Whatever doubts Messers Cameron , Osborne and Cable may harbour about their industrial policies , it has surely never crossed their minds that they will be defeated by techies and greenies refusing to take taxpayers ’ money .
Perhaps a fiercely independent farmer once refused an agricultural subsidy , but I doubt it .
If our politicians could only remember that subsidies are always accepted , they would see that it was their own policies , not the peculiar greed of bankers , that caused the financial crisis and that they will almost certainly cause another .
For they offer a subsidy that bankers can cash - in on only by taking the excessive risks that lead to financial crises .
The subsidy I have in mind is the government ’s guarantee of loans to banks .
Before the financial crisis the government explicitly stood behind loans to banks of less than £ 35,000 ( retail deposits ) .
If the bank failed to repay the depositor , the government would .
Where larger , “ wholesale ” loans were concerned , the government did not explicitly promise to repay bank creditors .
But it was widely and rightly assumed that they would .
Such a guarantee makes lending to a bank as safe as lending to the government , no matter how risky the bank is .
Which means that banks need not pay their creditors a “ risk premium ” : that is , the higher rate of interest that creditors demand in return for lending to riskier borrowers .
If a bank took very little risk , making itself as unlikely to default as the government , then the guarantee would be worthless .
Even without it , the bank would be able to borrow at the same low rate of interest .
Only by increasing its risk – for example , by increasing its ratio of debt to equity – can a bank cash in on the guarantee .
Consider , for example , a bank with £ 500 billion of debt .
If it takes risks that would normally carry a 1 percentage point risk premium , then the government guarantee is worth £ 5 billion a year .
And the more risk the bank takes , and hence the higher the risk premium it would normally have had to pay , the greater the value of the guarantee .
The government guarantee means banks can pursue the revenue that comes from risk - taking without having to pay the price that would normally constrain them .
In the run up to the financial crisis , government subsidies of bank risk - taking ran into the hundreds of billions of dollars .
So it is unsurprising that banks took so much risk .
It is just another example of the immutable law of economics that if a subsidy is offered , it will be accepted .
The politicians who arranged the subsidy now like to complain about the greed and irresponsibility of the bankers who accepted it .
This is like a man who has had his wife murdered protesting in court that he never imagined the hitman would be so wicked as to do what he was paid for .
When it comes to absurdity , however , our politicians ’ rhetorical response to the crisis is nothing compared to their policy response .
They have not removed the risk subsidy by eliminating the guarantees – perhaps by making it a criminal offence to administer a bailout of bank creditors .
On the contrary , they have made the formerly implicit guarantee to wholesale bank creditors explicit .
But do not fear .
This time , things will be different .
This time the laws of economics will be suspended and the subsidy will not be taken .
Financial regulators will come up with rules that prevent bankers from taking excessive risks , even as politicians increase the subsidy for bank risk - taking .
The most comprehensive attempt to ensure bank solvency through regulation , the second Basel Accord , came into force shortly before the financial crisis .
All the banks that collapsed complied with its new rules .
Yet this fiasco has not dimmed our politicians ’ faith in the wizardry of financial regulators .
They persist in telling us that a handful of bureaucrats can prevent the Masters of the Universe from getting their hands on hundreds of billions of pounds worth of subsidies .
Such tenacious wishful thinking might be endearing in children .
In policy - makers it is catastrophic .
The middle class has been systematically shackled by large amounts of debt , banking debt to be exact in a new form of financial serfdom .
Much of this started in the early 1970s on par with the deficits do n’t matter policy that engulfed our monetary policy for the next four decades .
Like any giant structure built on debt , there is usually a point where a sort of debtor ’s spiral will hit .
Many middle class Americans have seen this occur with their credit card debt , mortgages , and auto loans .
This also comes at a time when we have a record amount of two ( or more ) income households .
More people are working under one roof but earning less and less in low paying service sector jobs .
If it was n’t for the two income trap , we ’d see how shackled the public is to the banking debt that is so pervasive in America .
This amount of debt will cripple any recovery .
Take a look at the current trap :
Source : CNN
You can see how with even two breadwinners , many families are merely running fast enough to stay on the middle class treadmill .
Lose one job like many millions of Americans are and the semblance of any middle class lifestyle is now gone .
That is why we have 40 million Americans receiving food assistance and stories of people waiting at midnight at Wal - Mart during the end of the month for food purchases as their debit cards are refilled with government funds .
You have to ask where these funds come from .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have bailed out everything in their line of vision including trillions of dollars to the banking system .
Is it any wonder why foreclosures and bankruptcies are near peak levels ?
It is a carte blanche insolvency .
This massive growth in debt can be seen rather clearly starting in the 1970s :
But if we want to break down the debt even further , we can put the debt into smaller categories :
Add up the above sectors and you will find that the U.S. has $ 45 trillion in total outstanding debt !
The household sector carries roughly $ 13 trillion of this but I think there is a misnomer when delineating between household debt and also , government debt .
What is the government if not the aggregate of all the people in the nation ?
Who will carry the cost of all this debt going forward ?
If you want to try some troubling hypothetical scenarios try figuring out how long it will take us to pay off $ 45 trillion .
It will never happen .
How heavy are the debt shackles for Americans ?
Let us simply look at the U.S. household debt sector that includes mortgage debt , student loans , auto loans , and credit cards .
Total U.S. households
113,000,000 / $ 12.77 trillion household debt = $ 113,000 average debt for each household
Now the above is a stunning figure .
The median household income in the U.S. is roughly $ 52,000 so each household would have to put 100 percent of their gross income for two years to pay off their share of the household sector debt .
If we run the numbers for the above $ 45 trillion the figure is simply daunting :
Total U.S. households 113,000,000 / $ 45.65 trillion in multiple sectors of debt = $ 403,000 average debt for each household
Now debt in itself is n’t necessarily bad .
Yet when you rely on debt for the primary engine to move the economy that is when problems begin to arise .
The two income trap for middle class Americans has been softened by the use of debt :
The single - income family in the early 1970s had more financial stability and wealth than the current middle class family that has a large part of their income going to servicing large amounts of debt .
This all came to a boiling point with the housing bubble .
Middle class Americans are now taking on the brunt of this current correction while the banking sector seems protected from any outside influence .
Banks can still suspend mark to market accounting while any middle class household that tries this will be foreclosed on or see their credit rating slashed .
Imagine if you had the ability to value your assets as you saw fit at hyper inflated levels .
Also imagine that you had the ability to borrow what would seem like an unlimited amount of money at zero percent from the Federal Reserve .
Life would be better but you are no part of the banking elite so you have to operate in a world that is governed by artificial market forces .
The debt you pay to banks operates under free market rules while the debt banks take on from the government operates in an oligarchic fashion .
The middle class is quickly disappearing .
It does n’t seem like any political party is willing to take on the battle for what is right for the nation .
Piecemeal type of approaches wo n’t have any impact on a market that is crying for radical reformation .
Instead , this crisis has actually provided a platform for the banking sector to consolidate power and really squeeze every ounce of productivity from the middle class .
The chains of debt are being tightened on the hands of the working and middle class .
The data we are seeing do not show any reversal of this trend .

Meat producers should use certain antibiotics only to assure animal health and stop using the drugs to increase production and promote growth , the Food and Drug Administration said Monday .
The recommendation to cut back on the use of antimicrobial drugs comes amid rising concern that extensive use in animals contributes to antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria afflicting humans .
“ The development of resistance to this important class of drugs , and the resulting loss of their effectiveness as antimicrobial therapies , poses a serious public health threat , ” the FDA said in a draft guidance statement .
The FDA guidance applies to antibiotics deemed “ medically important ” because they also are useful in treating human illness .
It calls on meat producers to consult more closely with veterinarians about when to use drugs and which compounds to employ .
The FDA statement upset a leading meat industry group and disappointed a key nonprofit science organization calling for sharper restrictions on the use of antibiotics .
The recommendation could fuel legislative efforts to more strictly regulate the use of antibiotics in the food chain .
The National Pork Producers Council said the FDA guidance was overly burdensome and would rob the industry of drugs important to the health of animals .
“ There is no scientific study linking antibiotic food use in food animal production with antibiotic resistance , ” the council said in a statement .
Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists called that assertion “ patently untrue .
There is a mountain of studies linking the use of antibiotics in animals to the evolution of resistant pathogens that cause human disease . ”
Mellon chided the FDA for moving tentatively , with recommendations rather than with actions to cut down on the use of antibiotics .
“ I was expecting an action plan .
I was disappointed that all we have here are principles , ” Mellon said .
“ They ’re apparently expecting voluntary action .
It ’s my belief that the industry ’s not going to act until it has to . ”

Although unknown to many English speaking users , China has some of the best HD torrent trackers in the world .
In fact , almost all private trackers from China seem to specialize in HD content ( and they all seem to be built on the NexusPHP BitTorrent tracker script ) .
After last week ’s post about TorrentGui , here are two more dedicated HD trackers ( both based in China ) open for signup ; TorrentCCF and BDMKV .
TorrentCCF ( aka ET8 ) is a fairly large HD tracker that ’s been around for a while .
BDMKV on the other hand is relatively new , and specializes in untouched Blu Ray / MKV movies and TV shows .
If you are interested in becoming a member of either of these trackers , registrations are currently open - note that open signups wo n’t last forever so get in while you can .
BDMKV
BDMKV has over 200 untouched Blu Ray movies and more seem to be getting uploaded every day .
In addition to there , there are some MKV movies as well as high quality lossless audio files available here .

These foxes were photographed by Tony Pember on 10 January on the Taff Trail at Tongwynlais , a few miles from the Llanishen schools
Pupils at two primary schools have been kept indoors at lunch - time after a fox was spotted in the playground .
The animal was spotted outside Cefn Onn Primary School , which shares a site with Ysgol Y Wern Primary School in Llanishen , Cardiff .
It followed an incident where twin babies in east London needed hospital treatment after being mauled by a rogue fox in their home .
Cardiff council said the children were kept in as a precaution .
The fox was first spotted on Monday when teachers at both schools were instructed to keep the children away from the playground at lunch - time .
The schools acted in a routine way Spokeswoman , Cardiff council
The fox was spotted again before school began on Tuesday and the council sent its pest control team in to investigate .
A council spokeswoman said : " A fox was sighted in the school grounds earlier this week .
The children were kept inside the school building as a precautionary measure .
" The schools acted in a routine way and in much the same way as they would have done had a dangerous dog been loose on the premises . "
She said pest control officers had searched for a possible den for the fox and located signs of one underneath a temporary classroom on the site .
She added : " Investigations are ongoing but there is the possibility that the fox has left after being disturbed . "
Neither school would comment directly on the incident .
' Precautionary measure '
There have been concerns about the potential risk foxes pose after nine - month - old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were attacked while sleeping in their cots at their home in Hackney on Saturday , 5 June .
Police said the fox apparently entered the house through an open ground - floor door before attacking the babies in an upstairs room .
Lola suffered injuries to her face and arm and Isabella was also bitten on the arm .
The twins ' mother Pauline Koupparis told the BBC that she went to check on them after hearing a " funny cry " .
She described the " living nightmare " when she switched on the lights to see the girls covered in blood and the fox still there .
Their four - year - old brother , who was also sleeping upstairs , was not hurt .
After the attack London mayor Boris Johnson said councils needed to " get together " and look at how they tackled pests .

You can hear the aircraft voice warning system telling them ey have a problem and referring to the " D - 6 NL " which means there is no engine RPM .
They made 2 attempts to re-light the jet engine , but vidently there was too much damage from the bird strike and they had to eject .
These guys were very cool ; note the heavy breathing .
They certainly flew longer than one would expect before ejecting .
Airspeed can be observed on the HUD 's upper left corner .
It goes down to the low 120's as they struggle to get the engine going again , but as the plane noses over and dives to earth it increases to at least 175 just before impact .
It just goes to show how quickly your day can go to pieces - 45 seconds from strike to ejection .
All and all , not bad .
They ran the Emergency Checklist , made two re-light attempts , and picked out a plowed field for impact before ejecting .
You can follow the audio attached to it and hear the conversation between the pilot and instructor pilot and then the tower .
Including the pilot saying they were punching out .
The tower did n't seem to completely understand it all , and missed the significance of the last transmission .
The towers last radio call , he 's talking to an empty aircraft .
The video continues until impact , even after they both eject .
A classic " buying the " farm " as you can see the plowed rows get bigger .
A real nice job from the aircrew by keeping their cool and turning the aircraft away from populated areas .
No one hurt and no one killed but the dirty bird did cost the Taxpayers a " few " million dollars !
The British have a long history of improbable and unlikely quests .
Sometimes they succeed , sometimes they fail .
So the attempt by a group of 20 - something engineers to boost the image of electric cars in the public eye by driving the length of the Pan - American Highway in an electrically powered two - seat supercar might not seem so audacious .
Except that they 're planning to do it in a car that has no windscreen , and merely 3 inches of ground clearance .
And , oh yes , they designed it all themselves to boot .
Electric range : 300 miles
The EV in question , created by the Racing Green Endurance team out of London 's Imperial College of Engineering , is an EV with a range of 300 miles - among the highest of any electric car announced or planned .
Still , it 's not a car you can just top up with a gallon of electrons if it runs out of juice on one of those long , remote stretches of highway with more grizzlies than drivers .
To test their car and get some early publicity , the group did two complete laps of London 's orbital M25 motorway a few weeks ago , traveling a total distance of 265 miles - with 14 percent of battery capacity still left after covering that mileage at highway up to 70 miles per hour .
This past weekend , they planned a further test : a drive from London to Paris on a single charge , a road distance of 284 miles .
" Not the most practical ... but quite engaging "
The Racing Green Endurance vehicle is based on an adapted racing - car chassis from the firm Radical .
Its welded - steel space frame is covered - barely - with low - slung fiberglass bodywork .
The cockpit barely holds two adults , and they 'd better be friendly , because they sit very close .
Their choice of vehicle , admits the team 's PR director , Andrew Holland , is " not necessarily the most practical " vehicle you might choose to navigate 15,000 miles of primitive roads .
But with British understatement , he notes that it's " quite an engaging car " - - easily confirmed by the scores of pedestrians snapping photos of it at every stoplight -- and asks , " Really , now , would a 4 - by - 4 get this much attention ? "
Errrrr , no , it would n't .
But there 's still that problem of just 3 inches of ground clearance ....
Less power for more durability
The powertrain consists of a pair of Evo electric AC motors , a design so new they 're not yet available for commercial sale .
These motors have been ‘ downwound ' to reduce their power output in the interests of longevity and reliability .
Racing Green Endurance electric car , Imperial College , London , June 2010
While the standard Evo motor puts out 150 kilowatts ( 200 horsepower ) , each now peaks at 75 kW , with a continuous output of just 44 kilowatts .
That 's still quick enough to make the car accelerate more quickly than most traffic , owing in part to its weight of just 2,580 pounds ( 1170 kg ) .
And the motors are designed to run at their most efficient at speeds of 50 to 60 mph .
Each motor , incidentally , drives one rear wheel directly , with no gearing or differential between the output shaft and the wheel hub .
This keeps the drive very efficient , and is one of the car 's unique features .
Thundersky cells from China
Power for those motors comes from an air - cooled battery pack containing 164 Thundersky lithium iron - phosphate cells , with a total energy capacity of 54 kilowatt - hours .
That gives a range of 300 - plus miles ( 480 kilometers ) , or one - third again that of the 2010 Tesla Roadster , which has a 53 - kWh pack , albeit of a very different design .
The Chinese Thundersky cells , they note , are designed to maintain their performance over 3000 to 5000 full - discharge cycles .
How'd they come to pick Thundersky over other lithium cell makers ?
" Because they said yes , " said team founder and project leader Alexander Schey candidly .
Racing Green Endurance electric car , Imperial College , London , June 2010
Rather than using Thundersky 's control logic , however , the Racing Green Endurance team opted to write their own Battery Management System ( BMS ) software .
They 've kept the parameters conservative , to take good care of the electric components during a lengthy and grueling endurance trial .
We experienced the system 's limits during an exhilarating 20 - minute blast around London 's West End and museum district - home of Imperial College , where the members of the team all received their degrees .
After a burst of acceleration by our driver , powertrain engineer Aran Kankiwala , the temperature of one motor spiked above its 100 - degree - Celsius limit .
The safety systems promptly shut down the car to protect the motor from any potential overheating , even though we were sitting in the middle of traffic .
The two motors can actually operate safely at temperatures far higher than 100 degrees , but the team wants to take no chances .

Bad roads , thunderstorms , and moose
That is , at least , unless you consider their choice of vehicle a bit risky for the route they 're taking .
The Pan -American Highway stretches from Anchorage , Alaska , down through the west coast of the U.S. , into Mexico and then Central America , all the way to the southern tip of South America , a total distance of more than 15,000 miles ( 26,000 km ) .
Along the way , they 'll encounter roads that are little better than trails of crushed stone .
They may also meet moose , which weigh most of a ton - and can kill them if they happen to hit one .
They 'll get snow , and tropical thunderstorms , and stifling heat .
They 'll also have to contend with gigantic semi tractors towing multiple trailers , who may not even see a car that 's less than 3 feet high and almost silent .
The suggestion of a large orange flag to raise the car 's visibility seemed intriguing to Kankiwala .
For their safety , we hope they consider it .
They 'll be wearing full racing helmets to avert the worst effects of hitting mosquitoes the size of golf balls and having gravel tossed up directly at them over the minimal bodywork -- since they defiantly refused to fit a windscreen that might block both .
The team does say , cheerfully , that they expect the driving to be arduous .
Racing Green Endurance electric car , on the road to Paris
Quiet motor , creaky body
Riding in the vehicle itself is like being in a race car , which is what the Radical started out as .
The passenger 's head is no more than 30 inches above the pavement , and you look up even at cars as small as Fiat 500s .
The turning circle is huge , requiring muscle - building three - and five - point turns , and while the powertrain is nearly silent -- without the motor whine of so many amateur - built electric cars -- the bodywork creaks and groans over every imperfection in the road .
This quixotic venture has nonetheless amassed 27 different sponsors , and the team has raised almost £ 500,000 ( $ 738,500 ) , representing £ 150,000 ( $ 221,500 ) in cash and the rest in kind - including the Radical chassis , the Evo motors , and the Thundersky lithium cells .
Just like the college teams of the Challenge X competition , and the contenders in the Auto X Prize , the members of the Racing Green Endurance team have sacrificed a lot .
Their time off , personal lives , incomes , and quite a lot more has gone by the boards while they logged months of 16 - to - 18 - hour days to design , build , and test a car they believe can change the perception of electric vehicles .

" Electric cars are awesome "
The group came together during an earlier project to build an electric go - kart with a hydrogen fuel - cell range extender , while they were still students at Imperial College .
In the words of Andrew Hadland , the team 's front man and PR director -- he's one of the few members who is n't a mechanical engineer -- their basic takeaway from that project was , " Electric cars are awesome ; why is n't everyone driving one ? "
Founder and project manager
Schey initially wanted to compete in an " Around the World in 80 Days " race for alt - fuel vehicles , but that event never came together .
Then the longest highway in the world beckoned , so in January 2009 , the team began to design their electric vehicle .
And they deliberately made it as striking and noticeable as possible .
Although the car was actually built in a hired garage in Ladbroke Grove , it spends much of its time being shown off to sponsors , students , and the public at Imperial College .
Why do it ?
" It 's all about fun , and excitement , and adventure , " says powertrain engineer Kankiwala .
Racing Green Endurance electric car , Imperial College , London , June 2010
Getting students interested too
In addition to changing the public perception of EVs , says Schey , they want to stimulate interest among students in studying electric - vehicle technology .
The goal is to get more engineers to take part in the Mechanical Engineering discipline known as ‘ mechatronics , ' or the design of systems of computer - controlled electrical and mechanical devices - including hybrid and electric vehicles .
84 days , top to bottom
The Racing Green Endurance team and their car will arrive in Anchorage at the end of July .
They 've planned 84 days for the entire north - to - south trip .
That includes , they admit , about three weeks of contingency time .
They 'll have two support vehicles traveling with them to carry repair parts , including at least four spare wheels and tires , along with backup drivers and supporters .
If you 're interested in learning more about the Racing Green Endurance team , they have a website , a Flickr site , and a Facebook page .
You can follow them on Twitter , and Hadland promises they 'll issue regular updates on the progress of their journey .
BAYOU LA BATRE , Ala . —
Nine weeks into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , there is more money in this small , hardscrabble fishing town than there has been in decades , residents say .
There are more high - paying workdays , more traffic accidents , more reports of domestic violence , more drug and alcohol use , more resentment , more rumors , more hunger , more worry .
On a recent afternoon , Delane Seaman scowled at a procession of boats starting to come in to the town dock , each owner or captain with a promise of a day ’s pay of more than $ 1,400 , each mate with around $ 200 , all courtesy of a BP program created to employ boats to help with the oil spill cleanup .
The program , called Vessels of Opportunity , has been a lifeline for hundreds in this town of 2,300 at the mouth of Mobile Bay , paying several times more than they could make fishing .
But for others , like Mr. Seaman and his brother , Bruce , whose oyster - processing business has been closed since May , it has been a target for frustration .
“ These folks you see right here , they should n’t be hired on , ” Mr. Seaman said , pointing to a group of sport - fishing boats from Florida .
“ We heard BP was going to be hiring the people directly affected by the oil spill .
But we ca n’t get hired , and they ’re hiring all these people who quit their jobs to come here .
We ’ve had our application in for two months . ”
From a hamlet of independent fishermen and seafood handlers , many second or third generation , Bayou La Batre has become something close to a one - employer town , with BP acting as both the destroyer of livelihoods and the main source of income , through cleanup programs and compensation for lost business .
Congress is on the verge of passing the most sweeping banking and financial regulations since the 1930s – or so the catch phrase goes .
At the same time many say the reform bill does not go far enough to regulate Wall Street and curb the chances of another financial meltdown like the one in September 2008 .
Sound like déjà vu ?
Such a debate sounds similar to the wrangling around health care reform .
“ Well one reason it ’s being hailed as the most sweeping regulations since the 1930s is there has n’t been any new regulations implemented on capital for 30 - plus years , ” charged Scott Marshall , head of the Communist Party ’s labor and union work .
“ For most of the population , we have spent our lives under the era of deregulation , which directly led to the current economic crisis . ”
Marshall said the fight on Wall Street reform is like the fight on health care reform .
“ Not enough for the people , but as much as the people could win , given the corporate and far - right ’s attack on the role of government and where Congress and the country is at politically . ”
On June 25 , after 20 hours of straight negotiations , the House and Senate Joint Committee agreed on the details of a combined financial reform bill , which President Obama says has in it 90 percent of what he wanted .
The joint bill goes back to each chamber for a vote , expected sometime this week .
With the death of Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia , it may be tougher to pass the reconciled bill in the Senate and get it to the president ’s desk for a July 4 signing .
Republican Sen. Scott Brown from Massachusetts , who was one of the four Republicans who voted for the original Senate bill in May , says he wo n’t go for the joint bill because it includes a fee on banks .
The bank fee would raise $ 19 billion to offset the cost of the bill , pay down the national debt and guarantee no more taxpayer bailouts .
Brown says it ’s a “ tax increase . ”
Two Democrats , Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington State and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , voted against the previous Senate bill since , they said , it did not go far enough .
They , like other critics , say the bill does n’t break up the Big Banks , and thereby the “ too big to fail ” scenario can be repeated .
Some of the features of the House - Senate bill include :
A new consumer protections agency , housed under the Federal Reserve , would put new scrutiny on numerous financial institutions , including pay day lenders , check cashers ; FDIC increases insurance level to $ 250,000 ; no more hidden credit card or mortgage fees , buried in pages of fine print .
Regulation and transparency of the shadowy derivatives and credit markets .
Derivatives would be traded out in the open with some regulatory oversight like record - keeping and reporting ; hedge funds must register with regulators .
Outlawing predatory loan practices , which led to the crash of the housing bubble , and the biggest shift of wealth out of the African American and Latino communities , and working - class communities overall , to the big banks .
Many sought to make regulatory control outside of the Federal Reserve , which is run by the bankers themselves .
But the Fed maintains its regulator role over thousands of community banks and complex financial companies .
However , the bill eliminates the role of bankers in picking presidents at the Fed ’s 12 regional banks .
Another compromise was the implementation of the so - called “ Volker Rule , ” named after President Carter ’s former Treasury Secretary Paul Volker .
Instead of separating commercial banks from owning and operating hedge funds and private equity – the banking industry got a concession so banks can invest up to 3 percent of their core capital in such funds .
But government regulators may seize and break up troubled financial firms whose collapse whose collapse might cause widespread damage .
Marshall said a transaction tax on big banks and Wall Street firms is necessary to get the “ real ” economy going again and create jobs .
“ Part of the sweeping reforms of the 1930s was a stock transfer tax , which was repealed in the 1950s .
That was the opening guns of shifting the tax burdens from the corporate and super - wealthy elite to small business , middle - class and working people .
Such a wealth shift continued to this day , like in the form of the Bush tax cuts . ”
A coalition of U.S. unions , civil rights and community groups , called Jobs For America Now , are demanding such a tax be levied to create necessary and good - paying “ green jobs , ” rebuild the infrastructure and prevent layoffs of teachers and other public workers .
A global transaction tax proposal was recently floated by Germany Prime Minister Angela Merkel at the recent G - 8 meet , which rejected the idea .
The UK instituted such a tax , three years ago .
The European Union may pursue such a tax on its own .
Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is not supportive of Elena Kagan ’s nomination to the Supreme Court .
He believes she is too liberal and that her vast academic experience is not a substitute for experience “ in the harness of the law . ”
But at least media speculation about her sexuality has not become an issue in her confirmation hearings .
Not yet , at least .
Judicial appointments always generate substantial interest , but appointing women to top courts seems to produce a peculiar brand of anxiety , curiosity and consternation .
I ’ve experienced this firsthand .
A few years ago I was shortlisted for a vacancy on South Africa ’s equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court .
In South Africa , candidates are interviewed by the Judicial Services Commission , a body composed of judges , lawyers , legal academics , politicians and members of civil society .
During my public interview , one of the commissioners suggested that I “ get a boyfriend ” as an incentive to return to South Africa ( I reside in the U.S. ) .
I was flabbergasted , and unsure whether I should laugh or respond angrily .
“ You ’re kidding , ” I responded , giving him the opportunity to rectify what I considered an insulting question .
He repeated the question .
After an uncomfortable moment I was asked another question by a different commissioner .
This exchange was not lost on the press .
If I was a man , would I have been asked about whether a girlfriend would bring me back to my homeland ?
My guess is no- the question reflected the stereotype that men migrate for professional reasons , women for “ love ” .
And I ’m not alone among women judicial candidates in facing bizarre questioning or out - of - proportion reactions during the screening process .
Remember the hysterical response to Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayer ’s statement that “ a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience ” might more likely reach a “ better conclusion than a white male who has not lived that life ” ?
Conservatives claimed she was suggesting that her Latina identity would bias her decisions .
But one wonders if such a statement would elicit a comparable reaction if uttered by a man .
There was little outcry over Justice Alito ’s statement , in a similar vein , on how his experiences as an Italian male shape his worldview .
Already , it ’s been suggested that Kagan ’s unmarried status ( and a photo of her playing softball ! ) is evidence that she is a lesbian .
Would a single male judicial nominee receive the same kind of scrutiny regarding his sexuality ?
Similarly , some years back , when applying for a promotion to a higher court , a South African judge who is a lesbian was asked whether having a woman as a partner would be a “ hindrance ” to her colleagues .
Why should the sex life of female justices matter ?
Why should their personal lives be a “ hindrance , ” or “ get a boyfriend ” be a viable piece of advice ?
The intrusive curiosity seems to reflect an inability to accept the competence and mental equilibrium of women judges .
There appears to be an underlying fear that without the “ balance ” of a heterosexual home life , female judges will emotionally disintegrate from the stresses of the position .
Such attitudes should be of great concern to us , because the appointment of women judges is not just morally the right thing to do .
Studies show it is necessary if the legal system is seen to represent marginalized individuals and groups , and , more importantly , if the legal system is to retain its credibility with the majority of the population .
Women judges also bring a different judicial voice , which makes sense given the discrete experiences of women as the major caregivers of children and the elderly .
As Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has noted , “ Women professionals still have primary responsibility for the children and the housekeeping , spending roughly twice as much time on these cares as do their professional husbands . ”
Women more openly exhibit concern about issues such as reproductive rights , sexual harassment and maternity leave .
Take , for example , the two first women judges of the South African Constitutional Court , Justices Yvonne Mokgoro and Kate O’Regan .
The two decided a prominent case regarding an action former president Nelson Mandela took shortly after his inauguration , pardoning all female prisoners ( except the most dangerous ) who had children under 12 .
The challenge by a male prisoner who was similarly situated was rejected on the grounds that this on - the - face - of - it discriminatory pardon did not violate the principle of substantive equality .
In other words , Justices Mokgoro and O’Regan looked at the reality of women ’s lives in South Africa , noting that they are the major caregivers of children , and concluded that they would overwhelmingly benefit from the pardon .
Many people in the U.S. probably believe that justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsberg made a positive difference regarding the issue of gender equality by virtue of being women , as well as by the force of their intellect and knowledge .
Justice O’Connor voted with the majority not to overturn Roe v. Wade in 1989 , while Justice Ginsberg recently was the deciding voice in ruling the strip - search of the young woman plaintiff unconstitutional , noting that her colleagues “ have never been a 13 - year - old girl . ”
The very presence of women judges challenges the traditional image of the detached , neutral judicial figure–essentially male –that has pervaded law practice and legal education .
Women judges open the possibility that judging itself requires an aesthetic of empathy , understanding and compassion .
These traits create the space for a wider societal understanding of the judge as quintessentially human , not a distant judicial automaton .
Diversity on the bench , whether based on race , gender , sexuality , or disability , opens the possibility of a court that embraces a cacophony of societal voices and perspectives , removed from the historical singular voice that is neutral , impassive and detached .
As a woman , Elena Kagan will certainly make a difference on the Supreme Court–helping its credibility , challenging the notion of the white male judicial automaton , bringing a distinct worldview on issues of concern to women , and providing inspiration to other women that they can potentially be judges .
Most significantly , in Kagan ’s case , a third woman on the U.S. Supreme Court may just provide the “ tipping point ” that will render the return button inoperable .

Only known photographs of French Resistance fighters facing Nazi firing squad are shown for first time
The only known photographs of French Resistance fighters facing a Nazi firing squad at an execution site on the outskirts of Paris have gone on display for the first time .
The three pictures were taken by a German soldier who hid in the bushes on February 21 , 1941 and secretly captured the executions at Mont - Valerien .
Despite more than 1,000 ' hostages ' being killed at the site , it was thought no pictures existed as Nazis prohibited the taking of photographs for fear they would be used as anti-propaganda .
Unseen photographs of French Resistance fighters being executed by a Nazi firing squad on the outskirts of Paris in February 1941 have gone on public display for the first time
Taken only months after the French surrendered to the Nazis in June 1940 , members of the Resistance fought the Nazi occupation as well as the collaborationist Vichy regime .
After four years of occupation , France was liberated by Allied forces in August 1944 .
The photographs are being permanently exhibited at Mont - Valerien - the 19th - century fort in a Paris suburb that was the Nazis ' largest execution site in France during the Second World War .
German soldiers sit outside a Paris cafe on the Champs Elysees on Bastille Day in 1940 .
France was invaded by Nazi Germany earlier that year and was liberated in 1944
France 's most famous Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfield identified those being executed as members of an anti-Nazi network led by Missak Manouchian
The condemned , who were captured in revenge for the death of German soldiers and tried by military tribunals , were driven in lorries to the remote fort in western Paris and held in a chapel before they were executed .
Some scrawled their final messages on the walls of the chapel , which have recently been restored .
Men were blindfolded and tied to wooden poles in a clearing before being shot by a group of 60 soldiers .
Women were usually sent to Germany and beheaded .
Clemens Ruter , who provided a motorcycle escort to the prisoners , took the photographs with his Minox camera .
The non-commissioned soldier never told anyone about the shots and the film was left in the camera for 40 years .
Shortly before his death , while on a pilgrimage , Roman Catholic Mr Ruter confided his secret to a fellow German pilgrim .
Mr Ruter 's confidante worked for the Franz Stock association , who developed the negatives , although the pictures were not made public until France 's most famous Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfield took an interest in those members of the Resistance captured in the photographs .
SACRAMENTO , Calif . – The Board of Supervisors of California ’s capital city has voted 3 - 2 to reject “ labor harmony ” contract language that would have saved 100 union jobs .
The June 15 vote was a slap at the jobs of unionized retail concession workers in the new Terminal B , now under construction and expected to open in 2011 at Sacramento International Airport .
“ I am pissed , I am really mad ! ” declared Chris Rak , president of Unite Here Local 49 , as union members and supporters rallied outside the County Administration Building after the vote .
“ That airport has been union for decades , and that airport will remain union for decades , ” he continued .
Airport contracts with concession owners are to be awarded this October , and the supervisors voted on the contract criteria for businesses catering to airline passengers .
Previous agreements had included the requirement that businesses negotiate with the unions representing their workers , while the unions on their part agreed not to strike , picket or boycott at the airport .
*CORRECTION
Similar agreements are in force at the San Francisco , Oakland and Los Angeles airports , it was noted .
At a previous meeting on June 1 , over 150 union members and supporters , wearing their distinctive red Unite Here T - shirts , filled the board chambers , testifying to the need to retain workers experienced in meeting the needs of airline passengers , and to the disadvantages to Sacramento County of visitors encountering picket lines and struck airport shops .
Local 49 has a reputation as an activist union , assembling enormous union / community picket lines accompanied by chanting , songs and noisemakers in front of hotels that resist union contracts .

* Editors ’ note :
After publishing this story , we received the following e-mail .
We will report any further clarification as it becomes available .
Thank you for taking the time to read this email .
We know that the People ’s World is a great example of successful representation of the independent free press .
We also know that accuracy is important to you and want to bring the following to your attention for possible clarification , such as what Gail Ryall did to clarify the jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors in her recent story , “ No labor peace at Sacramento Airport . ”
In the same story , the following paragraph seems a bit confusing to the reader :
“ Airport contracts with concession owners are to be awarded this October , and the supervisors voted on the contract criteria for businesses catering to airline passengers .
Previous agreements had included the requirement that businesses negotiate with the unions representing their workers , while the unions on their part agreed not to strike , picket or boycott at the airport . ”
To clarify , no previous agreements or those currently in effect with the Sacramento County Airport System for concessions at Sacramento International Airport contain labor harmony language .
The Board of Supervisors did consider inclusion of the language in agreements to be released in relation to the RFP but voted to not include it .
Again , thank you for your time ,

Methane at 100,000 times normal levels have been creating oxygen - depleted areas devoid of life near BP 's Deepwater Horizon spill , according to two independent scientists
Scientists are confronting growing evidence that BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico is creating oxygen - depleted " dead zones " where fish and other marine life cannot survive .
In two separate research voyages , independent scientists have detected what were described as " astonishingly high " levels of methane , or natural gas , bubbling from the well site , setting off a chain of reactions that suck the oxygen out of the water .
In some cases , methane concentrations are 100,000 times normal levels .
Other scientists as well as sport fishermen are reporting unusual movements of fish , shrimp , crab and other marine life , including increased shark sightings closer to the Alabama coast .
Larry Crowder , a marine biologist at Duke University , said there were already signs that fish were being driven from their habitat .
" The animals are already voting with their fins to get away from where the oil spill is and where potentially there is oxygen depletion , " he said .
" When you begin to see animals changing their distribution that is telling you about the quality of water further offshore .
Basically , the fish are moving closer to shore to try to get to better water . "
Such sightings – and an accumulation of data from the site of the ruptured well and from the ocean depths miles away – have deepened concerns that the enormity of the environmental disaster in the Gulf has yet to be fully understood .
It could also jeopardise the Gulf 's billion - dollar fishing and shrimping industry .
In a conference call with reporters , Samantha Joye , a scientist at the University of Georgia who has been studying the effects of the spill at depth , said the ruptured well was producing up to 50 % as much methane and other gases as oil .
The finding presents a new challenge to scientists who so far have been focused on studying the effects on the Gulf of crude oil , and the 5.7 m litres of chemical dispersants used to break up the slick .
Joye said her preliminary findings suggested the high volume of methane coming out of the well could upset the ocean food chain .
Such high concentrations , it is feared , would trigger the growth of microbes , which break up the methane , but also gobble up oxygen needed by marine life to survive , driving out other living things .
Joye said the methane was settling in a 200 - metre layer of the water column , between depths of 1,000 to 1,300 metres in concentrations that were already threatening oxygen levels .
" That water can go completely anoxic [ extremely low oxygen ] and that is a pretty serious situation for any oxygen - requiring organism .
We have n't seen zero - oxygen water but there is certainly enough gas in the water to draw oxygen down to zero , " she said .
" It could wreak havoc with those communities that require oxygen , " Joye said , wiping out plankton and other organisms at the bottom of the food chain .
A Texas A&M University oceanographer issued a similar warning last week on his return from a 10 - day research voyage in the Gulf .
John Kessler recorded " astonishingly high " methane levels in surface and deep water within a five - mile radius of the ruptured well .
His team also recorded 30 % depletion of oxygen in some locations .
Even without the gusher , the Gulf was afflicted by 6,000 to 7,000 square miles of dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi river , caused by run -off from animal waste and farm fertiliser .
The run -off sets off a chain reaction .
Algae bloom and quickly die , and are eaten up by microbes that also consume oxygen needed by marine life .
But the huge quantities of methane , or natural gas , being released from the well in addition to crude presents an entirely new danger to marine life and to the Gulf 's lucrative fishing and shrimping industry .
" Things are changing , and what impacts there are on the food web are not going to be clear until we go out and measure that , " said Joye .
Last Thursday , in the early hours of the morning , a Palestinian community leader 's home was raided by Israeli security forces .
In front of his family , the wanted man was hauled off to detention without access to a lawyer , while his home and offices were ransacked and property confiscated .
While this sounds like an all - too typical occurrence in West Bank villages such as Bil'in and Beit Omar , in fact , the target in question this time was Ameer Makhoul , a Palestinian citizen of Israel and head of internationally renowned NGO network Ittijah .
After being snatched last week , Makhoul 's detention was subject to a court - enforced gagging order , preventing the Israeli media from even reporting that it had happened .
This ban was finally lifted yesterday , as Israeli newspapers were being forced to report on angry protests by Palestinians in Israel without explaining the specific provocation .
It turned out that another Palestinian citizen of Israel , Balad party activist Omar Said , had also been arrested , and interrogated by the Shin Bet since the end of April .
Now , both Makhoul and Said are to be charged with espionage and " contact with a foreign agent " – namely , Hezbollah .
On Monday night , hundreds of demonstrators rallied in Haifa to protest against what they call " an escalating campaign to crack down on Israel 's Palestinian citizens " .
The gagging order recalls the Anat Kam case , where for several months it was forbidden to report that the former soldier was under house arrest and being investigated by the Shin Bet for " leaking classified military information " .
The facts about Kam were first circulated by bloggers and campaigners , something repeated in Makhoul 's case ( including this Facebook group ) .
The night raids , interrogations , and charges are not isolated incidents – indeed , Makhoul had been prevented from leaving the country in April , according to an order ( PDF ) by the interior minister .
Days later , a West Bank Palestinian non-violent resistance organiser , Iyad Burnat , was also banned from travelling at the Jordan crossing , en route to , among other things , a conference on the Geneva conventions .
Several examples now point to an uncomfortable reality for the self - proclaimed " only democracy in the Middle East " : practices that have long been routine in the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza are being used in Israel to suppress dissent and limit civil liberties .
The green line is increasingly blurry .
There are the Sheikh Jarrah protests , where marches and rallies against the eviction of Palestinians from their homes have been targeted by the police , including the arrest of an organiser at his home – only for him to be released without charge and no evidence presented .
Then there is the trend towards repressive legislation , with the so - called nakba law making its way through the Knesset , the Israeli parliament , that will ban state funding for any group that marks the expulsions of Palestinians in 1948 .
Two weeks ago , a new bill was proposed by more than a dozen cross-party members of Knesset ( MK ) , which would outlaw any organisation " if there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the organisation is providing information to foreign bodies or is involved in lawsuits abroad against senior officials in the government in Israel and / or officers in the Israeli army regarding war crimes " .
Adalah , one of the groups specifically targeted , stated : " Only a state that commits prohibited acts would be interested in such legislation . "
Arab members of the Knesset are also increasingly under attack .
MKs Mohammad Barakeh and Said Naffaa have had their parliamentary immunity stripped so that they can face criminal proceedings , with the chair of the committee which deals with immunity issues reported to have suggested that " a serious decision " would have to be made as to " whether or not these parties can continue to sit in the Israeli parliament , even while they operate against the country " .
More recently , a trip by Arab MKs to Libya has been greeted by attempts to " strip the members of their immunity " , with MK Michael Ben- Ari declaring " an historic opportunity to abolish once and for all the immunity and rights of Knesset members who hate Israel and denigrate the state " .
At the heart of this and other cases against Palestinian citizens is contact with the wider Arab world .
According to Adalah , the " charge of meeting a foreign agent " is so broad that it criminalises " almost any Arab who establishes legitimate relations with political and social activists in the Arab world " .
So why is this happening now ?
First , it is the latest manifestation of a deteriorating atmosphere in Israel , with political dissent and human rights groups under attack .
Depressingly , there is considerable support among Jewish Israelis for this kind of crackdown : one poll found that 57.6 % of respondents " agreed that human rights organisations that expose immoral conduct by Israel should not be allowed to operate freely " .
Second , there is also a specific focus on Israel 's Palestinian minority .
Three years ago , it was revealed that the Shin Bet intended to " thwart the activity of any group or individual seeking to harm the Jewish and democratic character of the state of Israel , even if such activity is sanctioned by the law " .
This is no doubt in part a response to the kind of developments Makhoul talked about in January when I met him in Haifa : how " this generation " of Palestinian citizens " has grown up with October 2000 .
The green line disappeared – in terms of thinking , behaviour , and consciousness . "
Hussein Abu Hussein , the lawyer for both Makhoul and Said , stressed the role of someone like Makhoul in being a prominent advocate internationally for " the need for accountability " – in other words , " the state has enough reasons to stop this voice " .
Mohammad Zeidan , of the Arab Association for Human Rights ( HRA ) , says that the arrests are " clearly political " .
He believes that for some in Israel , the work being done by NGOs and Arab parties on the international level is " crossing a red line " – " they want to remind us that this is not a democracy " .

The disastrous BP oil spill is now believed to be the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history .
Even worse than Exxon Valdez .
Exxon Valdez stirs up strong memories .
Who can forget the images of birds covered in black oil slick ?
Imagine an Exxon Valdez happening every year for 50 years .
Pretty unimaginable .
Yet , this is what residents of Nigeria ’s oil - producing Niger Delta have been living with for the last 50 years .
Experts estimate that some 13 million barrels of oil have been spilt in the Niger Delta since oil exploration began in 1958 .
This is the equivalent of one Exxon Valdez every year for 50 years .
Although the Obama administration has come under much criticism for not responding quickly enough , nor adequately , to the BP oil spill , there is no denying that top government officials , including the president himself , have felt compelled to speak about the spill and to insist that BP will be held accountable .
A man has been charged with illegally importing the mephedrone derivative A bid to smuggle £ 500,000 of mephedrone derivative into Scotland has been foiled by police and customs officials .
Parcels containing 50kg of the compound 3 - Fluoromethcathinone were intercepted at Glasgow Airport last week by UK Border Agency officials .
A 21 - year - old man was later charged with illegally importing the substance .
Mephedrone , also known as M - CAT and Meow Meow , was formerly considered a " legal high " .
It was categorised as an illegal Class B drug last week .
The parcels which were uncovered at Glasgow Airport were destined for addresses in Ayrshire .
Three properties in Stevenston were searched by officers from the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency ( SCDEA ) on Thursday .
Classifying the drug under the Misuse of Drugs
Act sends a clear message that the substance is harmful and it is vital that users understand the risks
Det Ch Sup Allan Moffat
SCDEA A 21 - year old man from the town later handed himself into Saltcoats police station .
He was charged under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 .
Subsequent to this , a further search was carried out at a fourth property in Kilmarnock .
Det Ch Sup Allan Moffat , from the SCDEA , said : " Until recently , the legal status of mephedrone and its chemical derivatives may have implied to users that the substance is safe , which it is n't .
" Classifying the drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act sends a clear message that the substance is harmful and it is vital that users understand the risks .
" Our priority is to disrupt and prevent the distribution of this drug .
With greater enforcement powers we will be firm and tackle those individuals who continue to sell or traffic this harmful drug . "

HARARE , Zimbabwe — Robert Mugabe plans to send a " Noah 's Ark " of Zimbabwean wildlife to fellow dictator , North Korea 's Kim Jong-il .
Zimbabwean conservationists are furious about the plan and put up such fierce resistance that the plan may be dropped .
At first it was reported that the animals — including pairs of baby elephants , giraffes , rhinos , zebras , hyenas , antelopes , monkeys , warthogs and several types of birds — would be a personal gift to the North Korean leader .
Later Zimbabwe 's state news media reported that the animals would be displayed to the North Korean public in a zoo .
The scheme could be in doubt as Zimbabwean wildlife experts say the animals would not survive conditions in North Korea .
The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported today that Mugabe 's plan has been shelved .
Wildlife experts say the animals will have a tough journey during the 7,000 mile flight and then are unlikely to survive North Korea 's cold temperatures and bad conditions .
Particularly at risk are the two baby elephants who are 18 - months - old and 24 - months - old , according to experts .
" Elephants typically breast feed until they are four , so these two babies have been taken away from their mothers much too early .
I have seen them in their quarantine units and it is heartbreaking , " said Johnny Rodrigues , chair of the Zimbabwe Conservation Trust .
" It is inhumane to send these animals to concrete cages in a zoo in a place as cold and inhospitable as North Korea .
They can't look after their own people there , how are they going to care for these animals ? " said Rodrigues to GlobalPost .
" These animals belong to Zimbabweans .
North Korea has a low track record of looking after animals and we can't have our animals living in cages , " said Rodrigues .
" We should be working on a plan to improve our tourism .
We cannot export the beauty of our country to other countries .
What will future generations have if we export our heritage ? "
In the 1980s Mugabe sent two rhinos — a male called Zimbo and a female named Zimba — to North Korea but they died a few months after being relocated .
Zimbabwean officials defend the export of the animals .
“ From our professional judgment , these people ( North Koreans ) have the capacity to handle these animals , ” said National Parks boss Vitalis Chadenga .
“ This is a legitimate business trade . ”
He said Zimbabwe will earn $ 30,000 for the animals .
Zimbabwe has an estimated 60,000 elephants and they cause havoc when living in close proximity to people in villages in the north of the country .
Crops are trampled and people injured .
But Rodrigues and other conservationists object to moving the animals .
" It 's not a good business deal and it's not good for the animals , " said Rodrigues .
" We have beautiful parks .
It 's better to encourage people to come see the animals in their natural environment . "
Robert Mugabe 's controversial gift is embroiling Zimbabwe in its own version of the Korean War .
Mugabe has a longstanding intimate relationship with North Korea ’s Stalinist leadership although suggestions that he intervened to order the transfer have been denied by Chadenga .
North Korea trained the Zimbabwe army 's notorious Fifth Brigade which savagely suppressed an insurrection in Zimbabwe 's southern Matabeleland provinces in the 1980s .
An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Zimbabwean civilians were killed in the brutal campaign .
When it was recently announced that the North Korean soccer team would camp in Zimbabwe ahead of the World Cup soccer tournament , there was such an outcry in Matabeleland that the North Koreans decided to train in South Africa .
While Mugabe ’s regime is close to Pyongyang , his government of national unity ( GNU ) partners headed by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai are not .
They are on good terms with South Korea .
Tsvangirai recently returned from an official visit to Seoul where he received an award for his record on governance and claimed he had signed a Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement ( Bippa ) with the South Koreans .
Mugabe ’s spokesmen immediately put out a statement claiming only the president could sign such an agreement and charged that Tsvangirai had exceeded his constitutional authority .
The South Koreans had been informed of the official position , the statement said .
When the prime minister ’s office said it would discipline presidential spokesman George Charamba for undermining Tsvangirai , he dared them to go ahead .
“ I am not worried about undermining anyone , ” he said , suggesting Tsvangirai was guilty of “ undermining government processes . ”
Minister of State in the Prime Minister ’s Office Gorden Moyo said undermining Tsvangirai had assumed a pattern “ which has been allowed to go on for too long . ”
Whether Tsvangirai ’s followers are able to discipline Charamba remains to be seen .
He is seen as heading that faction of former ruling party Zanu - PF hardliners who oppose any compromise with Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change .
Negotiations within the government of national unity for structural reform in line with an agreement signed in 2008 have meanwhile hit a brick wall .
Mugabe recently proceeded to appoint High Court judges without consulting his GNU partners .
They include a judge who headed the electoral commission at the time of the 2008 presidential and parliamentary polls which observers declared less than free and fair .
It took five weeks to get the results published because Mugabe lost the popular vote .
Across the board Mugabe ’s minions are blocking change and clawing back power .
A supposedly independent media commission was recently appointed but its chief executive officer is the same person who presided over the closure of independent newspapers in 2003 to 2005 .
The Attorney - General ’s office is being used to prosecute and punish MDC supporters and civic activists .
The latest victim appears to be Farai Muguwu , the head of a diamond monitoring agency who informed the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme monitor Abbey Chikane of human rights violations by the army and police in the diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe .
His prosecution was , Mines minister Obert Mpofu said , “ a case of a criminal nature in a law - abiding country . ”
International NGO Global Witness this week published a report on the extent of the plunder in the Marange district .
Zimbabwe ’s political and military elite are seeking to capture the country 's diamond wealth through a combination of state - sponsored violence and the legally questionable introduction of opaque joint - venture companies , the report reveals .
Critics say that Mugabe 's sending of wildlife in a " Noah 's Ark " to North Korea is just one example of how his regime regards all of Zimbabwe as theirs to plunder .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was loudly interrupted by hecklers during a speech at a conference Tuesday morning in Washington .
The standoff got so heated that an aide , telling Pelosi that " they 're throwing stuff , " tried to get her to leave the stage .
Pelosi refused to go and delivered her speech over the heckling .
" I 'm used to noise .
I talk to the Democratic caucus every single day , " she told the crowd .
Pelosi was speaking at the Campaign for America 's Future Conference , where a mixed bag of protesters was in attendance .
The group Code Pink had a sign in the crowd that said " stop funding Israel terror , " but the protesters making the most noise were angry about health care .
" I am not going back to a nursing home , " one of them screamed out , triggering more protesters to start chanting : " Our homes , not nursing homes . "
Pelosi tried to calm them down and proceed .
" I 've heard your message .
I hear what you 're saying .
I appreciate your concern , " she said .
As the chanting and shouting continued , a man walked up behind Pelosi to tell her , " I do n't know if we can stop it .
There are too many of them . "
Shortly afterward , another aide told Pelosi : " Ma'am -- they 're throwing stuff .
We need to leave . "
Pelosi did not move .
" I 'm going to make my speech over your voices , because I came here to thank you for helping us to get health care reform passed , " she said .
The rest of the audience cheered , but the chanting continued while Pelosi launched into the rest of her speech .
The protesters shouted out that they had supported President Obama and Pelosi .
The Washington Post reports that the protesters claimed to be from a group called ADAPT , which advocates for the rights of the disabled .

In his 2002 book Lost Languages , Andrew Robinson , then the literary editor of the London Times ’ higher - education supplement , declared that “ successful archaeological decipherment has turned out to require a synthesis of logic and intuition … that computers do not ( and presumably cannot ) possess .
” Regina Barzilay , an associate professor in MIT ’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab , Ben Snyder , a grad student in her lab , and the University of Southern California ’s Kevin Knight took that claim personally .
At the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Sweden next month , they will present a paper on a new computer system that , in a matter of hours , deciphered much of the ancient Semitic language Ugaritic .
In addition to helping archeologists decipher the eight or so ancient languages that have so far resisted their efforts , the work could also help expand the number of languages that automated translation systems like Google Translate can handle .
To duplicate the “ intuition ” that Robinson believed would elude computers , the researchers ’ software makes several assumptions .
The first is that the language being deciphered is closely related to some other language :
In the case of Ugaritic , the researchers chose Hebrew .
The next is that there ’s a systematic way to map the alphabet of one language on to the alphabet of the other , and that correlated symbols will occur with similar frequencies in the two languages .
The system makes a similar assumption at the level of the word :
The languages should have at least some cognates , or words with shared roots , like main and mano in French and Spanish , or homme and hombre .
And finally , the system assumes a similar mapping for parts of words .
A word like “ overloading , ” for instance , has both a prefix — “ over ” — and a suffix — “ ing . ”
The system would anticipate that other words in the language will feature the prefix “ over ” or the suffix “ ing ” or both , and that a cognate of “ overloading ” in another language — say , “ surchargeant ” in French — would have a similar three - part structure .
The system plays these different levels of correspondence off of each other .
It might begin , for instance , with a few competing hypotheses for alphabetical mappings , based entirely on symbol frequency — mapping symbols that occur frequently in one language onto those that occur frequently in the other .
Using a type of probabilistic modeling common in artificial - intelligence research , it would then determine which of those mappings seems to have identified a set of consistent suffixes and prefixes .
On that basis , it could look for correspondences at the level of the word , and those , in turn , could help it refine its alphabetical mapping .
“ We iterate through the data hundreds of times , thousands of times , ” says Snyder , “ and each time , our guesses have higher probability , because we ’re actually coming closer to a solution where we get more consistency . ”
Finally , the system arrives at a point where altering its mappings no longer improves consistency .
Ugaritic has already been deciphered : Otherwise , the researchers would have had no way to gauge their system ’s performance .
The Ugaritic alphabet has 30 letters , and the system correctly mapped 29 of them to their Hebrew counterparts .
Roughly one - third of the words in Ugaritic have Hebrew cognates , and of those , the system correctly identified 60 percent .
“ Of those that are incorrect , often they ’re incorrect only by a single letter , so they ’re often very good guesses , ” Snyder says .
Furthermore , he points out , the system does n’t currently use any contextual information to resolve ambiguities .
For instance , the Ugaritic words for “ house ” and “ daughter ” are spelled the same way , but their Hebrew counterparts are not .
While the system might occasionally get them mixed up , a human decipherer could easily tell from context which was intended .
Nonetheless , Andrew Robinson remains skeptical .
“ If the authors believe that their approach will eventually lead to the computerised ‘ automatic ’ decipherment of currently undeciphered scripts , ” he writes in an e-mail , “ then I am afraid I am not at all persuaded by their paper . ”
The researchers ’ approach , he says , presupposes that the language to be deciphered has an alphabet that can be mapped onto the alphabet of a known language — “ which is almost certainly not the case with any of the important remaining undeciphered scripts , ” Robinson writes .
It also assumes , he argues , that it ’s clear where one character or word ends and another begins , which is not true of many deciphered and undeciphered scripts .
“ Each language has its own challenges , ” Barzilay agrees .
“ Most likely , a successful decipherment would require one to adjust the method for the peculiarities of a language . ”
But , she points out , the decipherment of Ugaritic took years and relied on some happy coincidences — such as the discovery of an axe that had the word “ axe ” written on it in Ugaritic .
“ The output of our system would have made the process orders of magnitude shorter , ” she says .
Indeed , Snyder and Barzilay do n’t suppose that a system like the one they designed with Knight would ever replace human decipherers .
“ But it is a powerful tool that can aid the human decipherment process , ” Barzilay says .
Moreover , a variation of it could also help expand the versatility of translation software .
Many online translators rely on the analysis of parallel texts to determine word correspondences :
They might , for instance , go through the collected works of Voltaire , Balzac , Proust and a host of other writers , in both English and French , looking for consistent mappings between words .
“ That ’s the way statistical translation systems have worked for the last 25 years , ” Knight says .
But not all languages have such exhaustively translated literatures :
At present , Snyder points out , Google Translate works for only 57 languages .
The techniques used in the decipherment system could be adapted to help build lexicons for thousands of other languages .
“ The technology is very similar , ” says Knight , who works on machine translation .
“ They feed off each other . ”
Shartak is a massively - multiplayer online role - playing game ( MMORPG ) set on a mysterious island where natives and outsiders hunt and explore .
For several hundred years the island of Shartak has been populated by three native tribes from the villages Dalpok , Raktam and Wiksik .
More frequently in recent weeks , strangers known to the natives as " outsiders " are appearing on their island wearing odd looking clothes and carrying flashing boxes and loud sticks .
Initially the strangers kept to the coastline and out of the jungle , but now they 're getting adventurous and heading inland towards the villages .
It wo n't be long before they stumble across the villages and learn of the treasures of the tribal ancestors .
The US Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of a federal law that makes it illegal to teach members of a foreign terrorist group how to use peaceful means to pursue political goals .
The statute , outlawing the provision of “ material support ” to designated terrorist organizations , does not violate free - speech and free - association protections of the First Amendment , and it is not unconstitutionally vague , the majority justices declared .
In a 6 - to - 3 decision , the high court said the law – part of the USA Patriot Act – is specific enough to provide would - be violators fair notice of when their conduct crosses the line into illegality .
IN PICTURES : Life at Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp
The majority opinion , written by Chief Justice John Roberts , says that Congress intentionally wrote the statute with a broad sweep to outlaw material support to terror groups in any form , including assistance or expertise that might help nudge the group toward nonviolence .
Chief Justice Roberts quoted a congressional finding in support of his broad reading of the statute : “ [ F ] oreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct . ”
In a dissent , Justice Stephen Breyer said that the majority ’s broad reading of the statute raises “ grave ” doubt about its constitutionality .
“ ... I would read the statute as criminalizing First - Amendment - protected pure speech and association only when the defendant knows or intends that those activities will assist the organization ’s unlawful terrorist actions , ” Justice Breyer wrote .
For example , if an aviation expert gave advice that facilitated a hijacking , the expert could be prosecuted for his role in facilitating the hijacking , he said .
But teaching leaders of a terror group how to petition the United Nations would not .
Roberts said Congress and the executive branch have rejected this view .
Support is fungible , he said : “ Such support frees up other resources within the organization that may be put to violent ends . ”
He added that diplomatic and legal assistance might help bolster the international image of a terror group that the US considers an enemy .
“ In the dissent ’s world , such training is all to the good .
Congress and the Executive , however , have concluded that we live in a different world , ” Roberts said .
The material - support law has been one of the most effective tools in the government ’s effort to fight international terrorism .
It is designed to isolate extremist groups that use wanton violence for political ends by cutting them off from all potential supporters .
It is also designed to enable prosecutors to act preemptively to disrupt terror plots in the planning stages .
The law , broadly interpreted , will make it easier for prosecutors to win convictions against those suspected of helping international terror groups .
Critics have attacked the statute as being so broadly worded that it renders illegal any assistance to a designated terror group – including independent statements of support of a particular group .
The majority opinion says that the First Amendment protects the right of individuals to publicly support – and even join – terror groups .
But statements of support must be free of any coordination with terror - group members , the court said .
The decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project stems from a lawsuit filed on behalf of human rights activists who were working with members of the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
The PKK is an underground group seeking to establish an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey .
The LTTE wants to establish Tamil independence in Sri Lanka .
Both groups have carried out terrorist attacks in support of their goals , and both have been designated as terrorist organizations on a US State Department list .
The material - support statute was first passed in 1996 and was later amended as part of the Patriot Act in 2001 and 2004 .
Initially , the law was aimed at blocking financial and other types of assistance that might help terror groups carry out acts of terrorism .
But after the 9/11 attacks , Congress expanded the statute to make it easier to prosecute individuals seeking to maintain any contact with designated terror groups .
Roughly 150 individuals have been prosecuted under the material - support statute since 2001 .
So far , about 75 have been convicted , according to the government .
A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that the law ’s use of ill - defined terms like “ training ” and “ service ” rendered it unconstitutionally vague .
A panel of the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed .
The Supreme Court on Monday reversed that holding .
Voting with Roberts were Justices John Paul Stevens , Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas , and Samuel Alito .
Breyer ’s dissent was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor .

There are two other people who are strongly affected here : your husband and your boyfriend .
Their reputations could be sullied by folks who misconstrue your situation .
You should discuss with those two how much they ’d like you to disclose .
As to your housekeeper , my friend says , “ That ’s tricky when you think someone may have seen you in bed , because even a monogamous couple might feel a little awkward about that . ”
Indeed .
That ’s why God created doors .
That close .
And lock .
It is also possible to obtain something called a “ calendar ” on which you can record the dates when your housekeeper is expected , dates when you can deploy that “ door . ”

Our small nonprofit , the Opportunity Fund for Developing Countries , offers scholarships to African boys and girls who agree to keep up their grades , stay out of trouble and refrain from pregnancy .
When a 20 - year - old orphan we ’ve supported for many years had a baby , we revoked her scholarship .
( Significantly , we have never dropped a male ’s scholarship for impregnating a female . )
Now she wants to return to school .
We ’d like to readmit her to our program , but wo n’t that set a precedent ?
DEB DAY OLIVIER , SALT LAKE CITY
To restore this girl ’s scholarship may well set a precedent , and I think it should .
As you seem to realize , to apply this rule only to one sex is strikingly unfair and violates your own agreement with the students .
What ’s needed is a new policy , one with a better response to young people ’s lives than “ just say no babies . ”
By definition , nobody welcomes an unwanted pregnancy .
As Cynthia Lloyd , an authority on population and education issues and a lead author of the book “ Growing Up Global : The Changing Transitions to Adulthood in Developing Countries , ” put it in an e-mail exchange , “ Obviously in Africa , many young women who get pregnant have not necessarily made that choice willingly or with any control . ”
I admire your wish to help these students avoid obstacles to education , like too - early parenthood , but I admire even more your reluctance to let an imperfect policy inflexibly applied thwart a young woman ’s desire for an education and a better life .
What form should that new policy take ?
Here I defer to educators and experts in family planning .
Lloyd suggests one that you might consult : Codou Diaw , executive director of the Forum for African Women Educationalists , an N.G.O. operating throughout the continent from its headquarters in Nairobi .

Receiver Isaac Bruce will retire as a member of the St. Louis Rams .
Bruce , who holds every major receiving record in Rams history , was traded from the San Francisco 49ers to the Rams on Monday so the receiver could retire with St. Louis .
The ceremonial trade did not include an exchange of players or draft picks , Rams spokesman Casey Pearce said .
A league source , however , told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that the 49ers would receive a conditional 2012 draft pick if Bruce plays this season for St. Louis , which is extremely unlikely .
The 37 - year - old Bruce and the Rams will hold a news conference Wednesday to announce his retirement .
Among the Rams marks Bruce holds : most career receptions ( 942 ) , career receiving yards ( 14,109 ) and receiving touchdowns ( 84 ) .
He also leads the Rams in all - time postseason yards with 759 and is the only Rams player with four 100 - yard receiving games in the playoffs .
In his 16 - year career ( 14 with St. Louis ) , Bruce ranks second in receiving yards ( 15,208 ) , fifth in receptions ( 1,024 ) and ninth in touchdowns ( 91 )
The latest version of cap - and - trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging a shift to more sustainable energy sources was unveiled by Sens.
John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on May 12 , 2010 .
It 's called the American Power Act .
One of the biggest knocks on the bill from conservative opponents is that the bill would be a job killer .
Sen .
Kerry addressed that claim on ABC's '' This Week ' ' on June 6 , 2010 :
" Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our ( cap - and - trade ) legislation .
And if you wind up pricing carbon . "
Kerry accurately cited the findings of the May 20 , 2010 , analysis of the American Power Act 's job impact by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics .
According to the report , " The American Power Act prompts $ 41.1 billion in annual electricity sector investment between 2011 and 2030 , $ 22.5 billion more than under business as usual .
Given that the United States is currently below full employment with most economists projecting a slow labor market recovery , this investment is more stimulative than inflationary in the first decade , resulting in an average annual increase in U.S. employment of 203,000 jobs above business as usual , with the net of the jobs lost in fossil fuel production and as a result of higher energy prices between 2001 and 2020 .
In the second decade of the program , higher energy and product prices offset the employment gains from new investment . "
But was Kerry right that every other major study done by a legitimate group came to the same conclusion that the bill would create hundreds of thousands of jobs ?
First of all , we could n't find any other studies that specifically analyzed the employment impact of the American Power Act .
It was only introduced less than a month ago .
Several economic groups have studies underway , but the Peterson Institute appears to have reached the clubhouse first .
But there are plenty of economic studies of generic cap - and - trade plans , as well as ones that specifically analyzed the version passed by the House last year .
And some of their conclusions about job impact contradict the findings of the the Peterson Institute .
In fact , on May 5 , 2010 , the government 's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on how policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could affect employment .
The CBO 's analysis of research " concluded that total employment during the next few decades would be slightly lower than would be the case in the absence of such policies .
In particular , job losses in the industries that shrink would lower employment more than job gains in other industries would increase employment , thereby raising the overall unemployment rate . "
CBO reached its conclusion based primarily on the review of three economic modeling studies , by analysts at Resources for the Future ( RFF ) , the Brookings Institution and the consulting firm CRA International .
The CBO " basically found that most of the studies found there 's likely to be a small decrease in employment levels , relative to not doing anything , with the cap - and - trade policy , " said Adele Morris , policy director of Climate and Energy Economics at the Brookings Institution .
They are n't the only ones .
Last year , for example , the Marshall Institute produced a report that found " estimates of job losses ( due to cap - and - trade legislation ) range from hundreds of thousands to millions . "
Said Morris :
" It is certainly not the case that every major study done by a legitimate group found that there would be hundreds of thousands of jobs created .
I would like to consider Brookings to be a legitimate group . "
The primary difference for the disparate findings , said Trevor Houser , who led the Peterson study , is that the Peterson study specifically evaluated the effect of the American Power Act , while the reports in the CBO did not .
The Peterson report also assessed the bill given the real - time reality of a U.S. economy with unemployment near 10 percent and economists predicting a slow recovery .
The reports cited by CBO are " full employment " models designed to assess the long - term impact ( 30 to 50 years ) , Houser said .
Whitney Smith , press secretary for Kerry , also stressed that the three studies cited in the CBO report were not about Kerry 's American Power Act specifically .
And Smith cited a Peterson Institute response to the CBO study , which argues that the " methodological approach of the studies included in the CBO report arguably overstates potential job losses . "
So what other reports was Kerry referring to when he said " every major study that has been done by a legitimate group , most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics ... " ?
According to Smith , Kerry was also referencing a report from Third Way , which describes itself as a " moderate think - tank of the progressive movement . "
The report concluded that job losses in " old industries " will be more than offset by an increase in clean energy jobs so that " that carbon pricing will result in net job growth " of somewhere between 118,000 to 1.1 million jobs .
But the Third Way report is n't a study of the American Power Act either .
It 's a review of two dozen studies over the last three years of various plans to put a price on carbon .
Third Way rejected reports from the ideological left and right and considered just those " in the middle . "
While the Third Way review did not specifically address the American Power Act , there is nothing in this latest cap - and - trade bill that would make it differ much with regard to the projections about the broad impact on the economy and the number of jobs gained , said Josh Freed , director of the Third Way Clean Energy Program .
If Kerry is going to hang his hat on the fact that none of the other studies ( such as those cited in the CBO report ) looked at the American Power Act specifically , then we are really only talking about one study , the Peterson Institute study .
We are n't aware of any others .
Neither are the folks at the Peterson Institute .
And the Third Way study cited by the Kerry spokesman is n't an analysis of the American Power Act either .
So the question then is whether the American Power Act is so different from past versions of the cap - and - trade bill , or the generic versions modeled by various economists , that it would render their conclusions irrelevant in analyzing the American Power Act .
And many economists we spoke to said that 's not the case , that the earlier versions are substantially similar to Kerry 's , especially for the purpose of analyzing the bills ' jobs impact .
And the fact that Kerry 's spokesman included the Third Way study suggests they think it 's fair game to consider older versions of cap - and - trade legislation for comparative purposes as well .
Economists at the Peterson Institute , the Brookings Institution -- or for that matter at , say , the conservative Heritage Foundation , which projected a cap - and - trade bill could cost millions of jobs -- certainly disagree about each others ' methodology .
Various economic models employ different assumptions about everything from the viability of doubling the number of nuclear power plants to the prospects for the economy .
They all look at different timelines .
You may agree or disagree with the findings and methodology of the Peterson Institute study , but the fact is that other " legitimate groups " have performed studies and reached different conclusions .
Kerry 's statement suggests there is some unanimity of opinion among legitimate organizations about cap - and - trade 's effect on jobs .
And that 's just not so .
There is quite a bit of disagreement .
So we rate Kerry 's claim False .
A former mayor of Waverley allegedly paid $ 12,000 to his nephew to organise the " serious torture " and murder of a male prostitute , a court has heard .
James Robert Markham , 73 , is charged with soliciting the murder of male escort Paul Dunshea or an unknown person .
He is also charged with recruiting a person for the purpose of criminal activity .
Mr Markham , who suffers from Parkinson 's disease , was formally excused from appearing at his committal hearing at the Downing Centre Local Court today .
He is accused of ordering the hit which was recorded by Channel Nine 's A Current Affair program , with reporter Ben Fordham posing as the hitman .
The court was played the recording during which Mr Markham tells Fordham he wants the escort to be strung up at an abattoir before being tortured , including being mauled by a dog , having a plasticine and glass suppository inserted and engaging him in a sex act with an animal to " humiliate " him .
You live in a world where , from a young age , girls are taught that their appearance is valued above anything else .
Girls must live up to this standard or the ridicule that follows will be a deserved consequence .

" Too much advertising depicts women , and to a lesser extent men , as just pretty objects .
Flip through the pages of Vanity Fair or even GQ , and you can't help but feel all there is to life is pouting your lips , sucking your cheeks in , and looking pretty .
Preferably with an off - camera fan blowing your generously conditioned locks , " says Paul Venables , founder of the San Francisco advertising agency Venables Bell & Partners .
He 's talking about the growing societal problem that is the objectification of women .
We need more realistic and positive images of women in the media .
End of story .
As a girl growing up in the twenty - first century , constantly surrounded by advertisements , movies , songs , and more , referring to my gender , I 've begun to notice this problem more and more .
Seeing these repeated negative images of women in the media makes those images seem like the right way to be .
Could the increasing number of ditzy women on air be increasing the number of ditzy women ?
Could the rising number of advertisements featuring huge breasts and tiny waists be contributing to the rising number of my friends who may have eating disorders ?
And could the constant bombardment of " Be like this , " " Be like her , " " Be skinny , " " Be popular , " " Be dumb , " be the reason behind self - consciousness and the desire to be like that , to be like her , to be skinny , popular , dumb ?
Could it ?

Renowned scientists and doctors agree that low self - esteem , poor body image , depression , perfectionism , and rigid thinking patterns can lead to anorexia in adolescent girls .
All of these are things that can come from viewing negative images of women in the media .
Studies have shown that even a small exposure to these types of images can cause immediate drops in self - esteem , positive body images , and happiness .
Rigid thinking patters can come in the form of stereotypes that girls feel the need to conform to , and the idea of perfectionism collides with the idea of the " perfect " body .
Really , what is that ?
Does anyone have the " perfect " physique , hair , eyes , nose , face , breasts , everything ?
Whose job is it to decide what the " perfect " person is like ?
We look at the outcome of whatever godly planning meeting decided this , in every from of media , everyday .
But who decided ?
Why are we mindlessly following these people who we do not know , these stereotypes of what we should be ?
Why are they forced upon us ?
Why do we allow them to be forced upon us ?
As I go from childhood , to teendom , to adulthood , I have questions about myself , life , the world I live in .
We all do .
We have all asked ourselves , gazing at some form of " beautiful " or " perfect " person in the media , " Is that how I 'm supposed to be ? "
We are looking to the unrealistic images in the media for role models that will allow us to discover our own realistic images .
Really , the models on television should not be our looking glass into the real world .
Our chance to find role models should be a day - to - day look at the strong , powerful women that exist in our society .
These are the images that should be publicized .
The facts that we should receive should not be the ones that sell size zeros , not the ones that make anything else " fat , " not the ones that make girls feel ugly for achieving academically .
Those are not the facts that we need to take in , in this time of growth in our lives .
Instead , we should get facts that empower both girls and their role models .

In my experience , adolescent girls are at an age during which they are finding themselves .
They look to each other , and , when peers do not know all the answers , they look to the media .
When we watch TV , we look at the way the pretty heroine walks , talks , dresses .
We might try on her persona , walking her walk and talking her talk .
Of course , when the women that we are shadowing breaks the dress code on a daily basis and act as dumb as anything , following them does not help us to grow .
It affects us negatively .
This is something that I feel personally affected by .
In sixth grade , I tried to be myself by being out of the box , by being anything but what I saw in the media .
Looking back , I realize that this is a separate persona projected by the media .
There 's " perfect " and there 's " other . "
There are also those who fit neatly into " trying to be perfect . "
As we look to the media for advice , " trying to be perfect " is what most of us become .
Only recently do I feel like I have grown up into myself , a comfortable " other , " though not the negative " other " projected by television and advertising .
I realized that " perfect " is entirely fictional .
I now wear clothes because I like them , not because Selena Gomez 's stylist does or does not .
I feel like I have overcome some pressure from the media , but it will always be there .
One must be strong and continually try to overcome it .

When facing all these facts , which , in reality , bombard us every day , in the media , it becomes quite clear that the objectification of women is a problem that needs to be fixed .
This will take effort from all of us : the advertising community , women , men , everyone .
Some people who have been making a commendable effort are socially responsible advertising agencies like Venables Bell & Partners .
Venables said that his firm values talent over looks .
" From my perspective , " he laughed , " rejecting pretty faces in favor of real people who have real talent is kind of a fun part of the job . "
Those who are directly involved in the media are not the only ones who can do good .
At this point , you are probably wondering what you can do to help .
First of all , spread the word .
When girls and boys , men and women , understand that there are still problems in our society with the objectification and degradation of women , they will want to help .
A raised awareness is one of our most powerful weapons .
Also , products and companies that use advertisements that unrealistically or negatively depict women should be notified of the severe problems with this .
Write a petition .
Call in .
Anything and everything helps .
Advertising agencies and other forms of media are not out to get women , though hurtful projections of women may make it seem this way .
Tell them what they 're doing wrong , and , chances are , they 'll want to stop , and make it right .
Finally , do your best to remain unaffected by negative images of women in the media .
Do not allow stereotypes , negative expectations , or anything else to get the better of you .

Do n't believe in stereotypes ; believe in yourself .
Do n't look up to airbrushed and enhanced female role models ; look to your mom , older sister , or best friend .
And do n't fall in love with the " perfect " everything ; fall in love with you .

Paul Waldman wonders “ What Ever Happened to Ann Coulter ? ”
Remember Ann Coulter ?
Seems like just yesterday she was Queen of the Right , the whole political world hanging on her every bile - laced tirade .
Yet she ’s all but disappeared .
Not that she is n’t trying .
She ’s still got her weekly column over at Human Events ( latest entry : “ Alvin Greene : The Most Qualified Democrat I Have Ever Seen ” – Har har ! ) .
She still makes regular appearances on Fox , showing up to gab with Bill O’Reilly or Sean Hannity .
But she seems to have completely lost her ability to move from the right - wing outlets into the mainstream discussion .
So what happened ?
First , her shtick just got old .
“ Ann Coulter said something offensive ! ” could only be big news so many times .
After a while , it seemed like she was just trying to be outrageous for the sake of outrageousness .
I ’ll attack 9/11 widows !
I ’ll call Al Gore “ a total fag ” !
Are n’t I outrageous !
Look at me !!!
After a while it ceased to be interesting .
But something else happened .
These are boom times for the right .
Certain political sectors thrive when their side is out of power , and commentary is one of them .
Being on the outside , and being angry at those on the inside , can be invigorating .
That ’s why subscriptions to liberal magazines tend to go up when there ’s a Republican in the White House , and subscriptions to conservative magazines go up when there ’s a Democrat in the White House .
But even though Barack Obama should have been great for Coulter , Inc. , the right wing has passed her by .
Her act seems somehow out of place .
It ’s not that there is n’t plenty of hate on the right , but Coulter ’s hate was just pure venom , without much point to it .
She had none of the crazy conspiracy theories that have become de rigueur .
She shot out in all directions , while the people at the top of the heap now , like Glenn Beck , are convinced they are driven by a complex and coherent ideology , complete with a Founding Father fetishism that would sound insincere coming from Coulter .
Strangely awesome video from John Stossel about the Drug War. Damn .
He pretty much wiped up the floor with the prohibitionist propaganda here .
Honestly this is a really great piece with a debate , information , statistics , and pretty much all the evidence you need to compile to show what a failure the war on drugs has become .

A few weeks ago I set out to create a new multipart / form - data parser for node.js .
We need this parser for the new version of transloadit that we have been working on since our setback last month .
The result is a new library called formidable , which , on a high level , makes receiving file uploads with node.js as easy as :
var formidable = require ( ' formidable ' )
, http = require ( ' http ' )
, sys = require ( 'sys ' ) ;
http. createServer ( function ( req , res ) {
if ( req. url == ' / upload ' && req. method .
toLowerCase ( ) == ' post ' ) {
// parse a file upload
var form = new formidable .
IncomingForm ( ) ;
form . parse ( req , function ( fields , files ) {
res . writeHead ( 200 , { ' content - type ' : ' text / plain ' } ) ;
res. write ( 'received upload :
' ) ;
res. end ( sys. inspect ( { fields : fields , files : files } ) ) ;
} ) ;
return ;
}
// show a file upload form
res . writeHead ( 200 , { ' content - type ' : ' text / html ' } ) ;
res .
end
( '< form action= " / upload " enctype=" multipart / form-data " method= " post " >'
+ '< input type =" text " name = " title " >< br > '
+ '< input type =" file " name = " upload " multiple = " multiple " >< br > '
+ '< input type =" submit " value= " Upload " >'
+ '< / form >'
) ;
} ) ;
Essentially this works similar to other platforms where file uploads are saved to disk before your script is invoked with a path to the uploaded file .
What 's nice about this however , is that you can hook into the whole thing on a lower level :
form . parse ( req ) ;
form .
addListener ( ' file ' , function ( field , file ) {
// file looks like this :
// {path : '...' , filename : '...' , mime : '...'}
} ) ;
We use that interface for processing HTML5 multi- file uploads as they come in , rather than waiting for the entire upload to finish .
You could even overwrite the onPart handler , which gives you direct access to the raw data stream :
form .
on Part = function ( part ) {
part .
addListener ( ' data ' , function ( chunk ) {
// do cool stuff , like streaming incoming files somewhere else
} ) ;
} ;
All of this is possible thanks to the underlaying multipart parser which makes heavy use of node .js buffers .
Buffers in node are basically just ( efficient ) arrays of raw memory that you can access byte by byte .
The parser works by looping over each incoming buffer chunk , while maintaining as little state as possible to do its work :
// simplified excerpt from MultipartParser.write
// chunk = Buffer of incoming data
for ( var i = 0 ; i < chunk .
length ; i++ ) {
var character = chunk [ i ] ;
switch ( this . state ) {
case ' BOUNDARY - BEGIN ' :
if ( character != this .
boundary [ i ] ) {
// unexpected character , abort parsing
return 0 ;
}
if ( i == this .
boundary .
length ) {
// emit event , advance to next state
this .
onPartHeaderBegin ( ) ;
this .
state = ' HEADER - BEGIN ' ;
}
break ;
case ' HEADER - BEGIN ' :
// ...
break ;
}
}
But , as you can imagine , this approach turned out to be somewhat limited in speed .
I was only able to get about 16 - 20 mb /s out of this .
My goal however was to get somewhere around 125 mb/s , enough to saturate a 1 gbit network connection .
So I started to look for ways to optimize .
The data I was parsing looks like this :
-- AaB03 x content - disposition : form - data ; name = " title " A picture of me on my unicycle !
-- AaB03x content - disposition : form - data ; name= " pic " ; filename= " unicycle.jpg "
Content - Type : image / jpeg ... binary data ... -- AaB03 x --
The sequence here being :
Series of boundary characters ( - - AaB03x ) , announcing the beginning of a new part Headers for that part \r
\r
Data for this part Series of boundary characters , announcing the end of the part or end of the stream
What stands out is the fact that there is no parsing needed for step # 4 .
All the data of a part itself is a plain octet stream .
So after talking to Ryan about it , he recommended me to look into the Boyer - Moore algorithm to speed things up .
The algorithm is usually the fastest method to find a sub string within a string of text .
It basically works by analyzing the needle string and building a lookup table of its characters to efficiently skip over parts of the haystack .
But implementing it , was not exactly easy .
The algorithm is not trivial , and many of the example implementations I found were wrong .
That however was not the problem .
The real challenge was that I was working with a stream of data , rather than a big string I had full access to .
This meant keeping lots of additional state in the parser , as well as creating a very complicated piece of code .
I like challenges , but I also like efficiently using my time , so I started looking for a shortcut .
And then it hit me .
Most of the boyer - moore algorithm is designed to improve the performance of the worst - case scenario .
The worst - case scenario for this problem is the case where you hit a character in your haystack that is also a character in the needle string .
Boyer - moore deals with this case by knowing the offset of each character in the needle string , so it can maximize the number of characters to skip in any case .
But file uploads rarely cause these worst - case scenarios !
With human text , character repetition is pretty high .
But file uploads are binary data , so most bytes are likely to fall outside the ASCII range of characters usually used for the boundary .
That made the solution much simpler .
All I had to do was generating a list of all characters in the boundary , and whenever I hit a character that was not in that list , I knew I could safely skip the full length of the boundary :
while ( i + boundary .
length <= chunk .
length ) {
if ( chunk [ i + boundary .
length - 1 ] in boundary Chars ) {
// worst case , go back to byte by byte parsing until a non-matching char occurs
break ;
}
i += boundary .
length ;
}
This resulted in an incredible speed up , allowing to parse uploads at 500 mb/sec .
The parsing can be even faster if a longer boundary sequence is used .
Short boundaries and hitting the worst - case scenario frequently will slow things down .
The benchmark I created is using an actual boundary created by Mozilla Firefox .
Your milage may vary slightly .
The whole thing could still be optimized further , but at this point I believe it is fast enough to make other parts of the system more likely to become the bottleneck .

Questions & suggestions regarding the library , node.js or the parser would be most welcome .

President Obama just finished speaking to an audience in Columbus , Ohio about the economic stimulus plan .
The event kicks off what the White House is dubbing " The Summer of Recovery , " a major push to highlight the results of the president 's $ 787 billion stimulus plan -- and to make the case for more spending to goose the economy .
The president did that in Ohio , arguing that projects like the road construction he came to see in downtown Columbus are investments that will pay off in the long run .
At the beginning of his address , the president acknowledged two Democratic candidates in hot Ohio races : Gov. Ted Strickland , who is running for re-election against former Republican congressman John Kasich , and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher , who is competing with former Republican congressman Rob Portman for Senate .
Below is our live - blog .
All times are Eastern .
12:07 p.m. : " We know what we can achieve when we act boldly and invest wisely , " the president said
12:06 p.m. :
Thanks to investments made by the federal government 's recovery program , by 2015 , American manufacturers will have 40 % of global market for advanced batteries , the president said .
12:04 p.m. : " If we 're going to rebuild America 's economy , then we 've got to rebuild America , period , " said the president .
He says the nation not only needs to rebuild existing infrastructure but add more .
He says other countries should not " get the jump on us " in Internet infrastructure and alternative energy .
Noon : As Vice President Biden would say , " this is a big ( pause ) deal , " said the president , making a joking allusion to an overheard comment by the veep that included an adjective that can't be published in a family newspaper ( no , not even on a blog ) .
11:59 a.m. :
More than 100,000 Ohioans are working today because of the economic stimulus , the president said .

Imagine if Excitebike and Trials HD got together and totally did it .
Their baby would be Joe Danger .
It 's a stunt motorcycle game that combines the physics play of Trials with the cartoon presentation and level editor of Excitebike .
I like Trials HD a lot , but those later levels were incredibly frustrating .
Joe Danger is a much breezier , lighthearted affair .
The later levels are definitely challenging , but I was always ready to get back on my bike and try again .
It 's great , great fun and a must - download for any PlayStation 3 owner .
Joe + Danger ,+motorcycle+hero .
Joe is a motorcycle stuntman who was knocked out of the game after a debilitating injury .
He 's ready to get back into it , but he 's a little rusty , so you 'll have to help him remember how to pull off all those amazing stunts .
They 're actually not that difficult to pull off , thanks to the simple , responsive controls .
You know how some games just feel good to play ?
That 's Joe Danger .
Each stage has several objectives that will grant you a star when completed , and you can spend those stars to unlock additional levels .
I really like the amount of freedom Joe Danger provides us .
A stage may have eight objectives and you can go after them in any order you like .
Maybe you 'll try to collect all of the letters spelling " Danger " or maybe you 'll try to complete the stage under the time limit – it 's up to you .
If you ever get stuck on a challenge , you can go to another level and try something else for a while .
These are n't just race tracks .
Levels are laid out like platforming environments with hidden areas and items to find .
You 're not just trying to reach the finish line as fast as you can – this is a game you can explore .
Two players can go head - to - head in local splitscreen races , and Joe Danger also includes a sandbox where you can make your own levels .
The editor is interactive , so you can ride through it and drop objects right in front of Joe at any time .
A tutorial for this mode is cleverly worked into the regular game , where Joe has to enter the editor to remove obstacles from his path and create ramps to proceed .
Creating levels is almost as fun as playing them .
Once you 've got a great track you can upload it to share with your friends .
One side of the lyric sheet shows Lennon 's amendments
Enlarge Image
John Lennon 's handwritten lyrics to Beatles song A Day In The Life have sold for $ 1.2 m ( £ 810,000 ) at auction , well above the price expected .
The double - sided sheet of paper with notes written in felt marker and blue ink was sold at Sotheby 's in New York .
The lyric sheet also contains some corrections and other notes penned in red ink .
The song - co-written with Paul McCartney - is the final track on the band 's 1967 Sgt Pepper album .
The buyer was an anonymous American telephone bidder .
The lyric sheet had previously belonged to Mal Evans , the Beatles ' road manager .
According to the auction house , the previous record for a sale of Beatles lyrics was All You Need Is Love , which fetched $ 1 m ( £ 655,450 ) in 2005 .
Rolling Stone magazine listed A Day in the Life at number 26 in its compilation of the greatest 500 songs of all time .
The album went on to win four Grammy awards .
The BBC banned airplay of the track in 1967 because of the lyric " I 'd love to turn you on " , which was interpreted as a reference to drug use .
This also led to several Asian countries to release Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band minus the song .
The lyric was apparently a later addition by Lennon .

Back in the late 1960s , researcher Walter Mischel conducted an experiment that has come to be known as the " Marshmallow Test . "
This test consisted of giving marshmallows to 4 - year - olds , with the promise of more marshmallows to come if they could delay eating the first for 15 minutes .
Those who resisted the sugary treat were shown to do well later in life , while those who failed to resist were more likely to suffer from lower test scores , even issues of drug dependency .
More than 40 years later , Facebook has proved to be an even sweeter marshmallow to its millions of users than any puffed confection Mr. Mischel handed out .
While beginning to write this piece , I could n't resist the temptation to check my own Facebook profile .
Has anybody commented on my latest status update ?
Has Jenna from high school accepted my late - night friend request ?
I can just click right over and find out , but I know once I do I 'll end up spending the rest of the afternoon playing Scrabble and commenting on tagged photos .
I 'm not alone with this struggle .
Comb through any random Facebook page and you 'll find people around the world updating statuses from their offices , from classrooms , even from behind the wheel .
The deferred rewards of keeping one 's job , learning arithmetic , or even staying alive are no match for the compound - worded monster .
The temptation to let others know how happy or sad we feel , and more important , the numerous supportive messages we 'll receive from our " friends , " is an exercise in deferred gratification that we all lose on a daily basis .
And who 's to blame us ?
With its complicated algorithms and formulas , Facebook takes the legwork out of friendship .
Do you know Bob ?
Why not send a friend request to his girlfriend Jane ?
You have n't talked to Lee in a while .
Maybe you should send him a message .
Why go through the trouble of going out and cultivating one new friendship when Facebook lets you meet and befriend hundreds in less time than it takes to watch an episode of " Jersey Shore " ?
Every day many people do choose the hundreds of online friends over that one real friend .
And what 's truly sad is what we 're teaching our nation 's younger , more impressionable generation .
Those born after 1990 have never known a world without the Internet , and it 's clear they 're fully ingrained in the culture of " right now . "
In choosing the cozy , instant world of online socializing and gaming over human interaction and exercise , this generation has broken records ( and scales ) for childhood obesity .
According to the latest findings of the Centers for Disease Control , childhood obesity has more than tripled in the past 30 years .
When I worked at a video - game retailer , I saw much of this behavior firsthand .
Children would update their Facebook statuses or tweet from their iPhones while their parents shrugged in a " What can you do ? " fashion as they handed me a stack of video games .
More often than not , these children were obese .
There are positives to having access to the world at our fingertips .
Last year 's violent protests in Iran were made real by the video of Neda Soltan 's death , distributed through sites such as YouTube and Facebook , and footage of the quakes in Haiti helped raise millions of dollars for the rescue efforts .
But while many people were called to action by such tragedies , many never made it past the " share " button at the top of their Facebook pages .
When your country leads the way in obesity , it 's time to put down the BlackBerry and pick up a basketball .
I 'm not advocating a Facebook boycott or a video - game bonfire .
What I am calling for is a little participation in the analog world .
Unplug for one day a week .
Play flag football instead of Madden 10 .
Build houses for Habitat for Humanity instead of a barn in Farmville .
Meet and befriend real people .
After all , it 's not as if Facebook could give you a ride to the airport .

I won 19 Emmy Awards by reporting a myth : that business constantly rips us off — that capitalism is mostly cruel and unfair .
I know that 's a myth now .
So I was glad to see the publication of The 5 Big Lies About American Business by Michael Medved .
I invite him on tonight 's Fox Business Network show to talk about that .
" You can only make a profit in this country by giving people a product or a service that they want , " he says .
" It 's the golden rule in action . "
Medved used to write about the movies , so he 's familiar with the businessman as villain .
I 'll play a clip from the movie Syriana , in which an oil tycoon makes this ridiculous speech :
" Corruption keeps us safe and warm .
Corruption is why you and I are prancing around in here instead of fighting over scraps of meat out in the street . "
" What 's interesting , " Medved commented , " is that in the old days , Hollywood would have businesspeople who were very positive : George Bailey , the Jimmy Stewart character , is a banker in It 's a Wonderful Life . "
No longer .
Today 's movie capitalists are criminals or playboys .
Apparently , Hollywood writers think it 's plausible that CEOs have lots of time to sip cocktails and chase women .
" In school , we all studied a book called The Theory of the Leisure Class , which … indicted the leisure class and these people who were out there exploiting other people and really had nothing to do except sit on their yachts and go to their swimming pools and their vacations . "
In real life , that 's nonsense .
" The higher up on the income scale you go , the less leisure time you have .
You make money in this country by working hard . "
Medved 's second myth is that when the rich get richer , the poor get poorer .
This is the old zero - sum fallacy , which ignores that when two people engage in free exchange , both gain — or they would n't have traded .
It 's what I call the double thank - you phenomenon .
I understand why politicians and lawyers believe it :
It 's true in their world .
But it 's not true in business .
" If you believe that when the rich get richer , the poor get poorer , then you believe that creating wealth causes poverty , and you 're an idiot , " said Medved .
" One of the things that I hate is this term ' obscene profits . '
There are no obscene profits … .
( The current economic downturn shows ) " that when the rich get poorer … everybody gets poorer . "
Myth No. 3 : Government is more fair and reliable than business .
" Remember the last time you went into Starbucks , and then remember the last time you went into the DMV to get your license , " Medved said .
" Where did you get better treated ?
And it 's not because the barista is some kind of idealist or humanitarian .
She wants a tip .
She wants you to come back to the Starbucks … . "
But the left does n't get it .
" This is the suspicion of the profit motive — the idea that if somebody is selflessly serving me , they 're going to treat me better than somebody who wants to make a buck , " Medved said .
But " ( i ) f you think about it in your own life , if somebody is benefiting from his interaction with you … it 's a far more reliable kind of interaction than someone who comes and says I 'm in this only for you . "
Myth No. 4 : The current downturn means the death of capitalism .
" Capitalism is alive and well , " Medved said .
I 'm also bugged when people argue that today 's problems prove that capitalism " failed . "
What failed ?
We had a correction .
A bubble popped .
But from 1982 to now , the Dow rose from 800 to 11,000 .
Had it happened without the bubble , we 'd say this is one of the great boom periods .
Medved added : " This is one of the biggest lies — the idea that because of capitalism , we 're all suffering .
…
Poor people in America today , people who are officially in poverty , have a higher standard of living in terms of medical standards , in terms of the chances of going to college , in terms of the way people live , than middle - class people did 30 years ago .
It 's an extraordinary achievement of technology and of the profit sector . "

Two brothers have gone on trial accused of raping and abusing their younger sister who was four at the time of the first alleged attack .
The boys , aged 15 and 13 , live in Birmingham and cannot be named .
At the city 's crown court they denied charges of rape and sexually assaulting the girl , now seven , between September 2006 and May 2009 .
The older brother has also denied sexually assaulting another sister who is now 10 .
Toy train
Prosecuting , Mark Heywood told the court : " The prosecution case , in a nutshell , is that each of these two boys sexually abused their sister ... and , in the case of the eldest , abused his other sister as well . "
In a recorded police interview shown to the jury the alleged rape victim was seen playing with a toy train as she described what happened to her .
The girl told the officer one brother had assaulted her 15 times and the other brother had assaulted her at least 10 times .
The 15 - year - old is charged with two counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault of a child .
His brother is charged with two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault of a child .
Neither boy was made to sit in the dock during the opening of the case and instead sat with their grandparents .
The trial continues .
I like teasing out cause , effect , and consequences : this is why I watch all versions of “ Law & Order ” except for “ Law & Order : Special Dead and Beatup Ladies Unit . ”
I like history , which is why my paperback copies of Shelby Foote ’s The Civil War all have creases in the spine from being reread so often .
And I like sexy people who are n’t wearing a lot of clothing , which is why I continue to watch “ Lost ” even as it builds up to a conclusion that is going to be the network TV version of being poked in the eye by an annoying seven - year old who chants “ Nyaa - nyaaa - nyah . ”
So it ’s little bit surprising , even given that I did n’t have Showtime until recently , that I never got around to the you - like - it - despite - yourself trashiness of “ The Tudors . ”
Intrigue !
Wars !
Conniving ecclesiasticals !
Surprisingly modern French !
Lovers who have clearly been reading Ye Aulde Joie of Sexe !
( In an age of missionaries , that seems to be about the least common position the show ’s May dance of lovers use . )
Now , “ The Tudors ” is revisionist history in both the good and bad ways you can do revisionism .
You might know one of the bad ways , it ’s playing in theaters now :
I mean , this is a Tea Partier Robin Hood .
Forget rebelling against the hyper-rich and redistributing wealth to the needy !
Russell Crowe is fighting for freedom from high taxes !
He ’s a libertarian Robin Hood !
A Randian Robin Hood !
A… backlash Robin Hood .
I doubt you ’re surprised .
It ’s been a big couple of years for anything that is even lightly scented with the redolent odors of sending brown people to the fields , queers to the closet , and ladies to the kitchen .
Make no mistake , “ The Tudors ” is Backlash Entertainment as well .
The main character , after all , is a guy who divorced two of his wives and killed two others because they could n’t give him a son .
You do n’t get much more patriarchal than that .
Yet because the show is revisionist to its core –the whole point of it was to radically revise the popular perception of Henry VIII – their are some sneaky moments of … something else shining through .
Casting a handsome , young actor as the youthful Henry is far more historical than you might realize : he was the son of Elizabeth of York , widely considered one of the most beautiful women of her day , and he inherited her good looks .
As a young man he was an athlete , widely read , and possessed of deeply humanist philosophical convictions .
He was also a bad - tempered , spoiled lout with little compunction about shoring up his relatively weak claim to the throne with the exercise of brutal absolute power .
And in a move that is either cynical , inspired , or both , he ’s played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers , a handsome , bad - tempered lout .
Is it acting or is it Memorex ?
I sure ca n’t tell .
Henry is played like the douchebag as Renaissance Man .
But that makes sense .
Because the Renaissance was the time when not only the modern nation - state came into being , but the modern patriarchy .
“ The Tudors ” is more than a modern backlash myth ; it shows the foundation of what the backlash defends , and the story of the very first attempts to defend it .
After all , it was a period of tremendous change and social mobility .
Distrustful ( with good reason ) of the old nobility , Henry ’s court was filled with New Men , ambitious gentry who rose to great station despite their background .
And in addition to these New Men were New Women .
It was the time of St. Catherine of Genoa ’s theology ( she was the first woman to be given the title Doctor of the Church ) , and Christine de Pisan ’s The City of Ladies .
Joan of Arc was winning battles against the English ; Margery Kempe was inventing the autobiography ; Isabella of Castille was conquering a continent .
Something had to be done .
“ The Tudors ” shows What Was Done in its sordid glory .
The calculating Thomas Boleyn quite literally pimps out his daughters to catch the King ; Anne of Cleves is booted like a football between her German uncle and unsatisfied English husband ; Catherine Howard is ( ahistorically ) pulled out of a brothel to distract a depressed monarch .
Women are tokens passed around , tools for the advancement of the men who own them , and ultimately , mere petri dishes for the creation of a male heir .
To its credit , though , “ The Tudors ” gives us ladies who are n’t such willing pawns–especially Natalie Dormer ’s Anne Boleyn .
She refuses to be the mere tool of her father ’s calculation , but pursues her own ambitions as well .
Her embrace of Protestantism is shown as more than just a method of gaining a husband , but a sincere expression of her personal belief .
( Given that the most ardent Protestants in the government were either Boleyn retainers or people Anne used her influence to bring to power , she probably deserves to be called the mother of English Protestantism . )
She struggles with the demands of being a ruler , and with satisfying her unstable and treacherous husband .
She acts unheroically , scheming to eliminate Princess Mary and the king ’s lover Jane Seymour , but her death has a dignity that the gruesomeness of the show ’s graphic special effects cannot dispel .
There ’s something like that in the portrayals of all of Henry ’s wives so far –Catherine of Aragon ’s noble resignation and burning anger at being tossed aside like a worn out shoe , Anne of Cleves ’ elation at going from being a wallflower , locked away and out of view , to a trusted friend of the king ( after their star - crossed marriage ) and center of her own social whirl .
Catherine Howard ’s disastrous affair becomes much more sympathetic when you realize she was barely out of her teens , suddenly rich and powerful and married to a worn - out , ill - tempered grump with no time for her .
( She alone of the people we ’ve seen executed refuses to ask for forgiveness or to offer bland sanctimony from the scaffold : “ I die a Queen , but I would rather have died the wife of Culpeper . ” )
Even Jane Seymour , depicted ( as always ) as sweet , pure , and too damn good to be true , might have concealed her own ambitions ( bringing Princess
Mary back to court was more than getting her stepdaughter back into her father ’s good graces ; for the anti-reformist Seymour family , it was a way to find a Catholic successor to the king ) and is also constantly aware that her own survival depends upon giving birth to a son .
That of course is the crucial matter .
While depicted as a lover of sex , Henry also never forgets that women are only a means to the end of his ambitions : “ I am your Lord and Master ! ” he bellows at women several times , and he means it literally : he owns them , and while he may give them leave to enjoy their frivolous pursuits ( like , I guess , the Protestant Reformation ) , in the end his is the only law , the only resort , the only mercy , the only judgment .
Of course , that does n’t apply to just the women .
Henry is as fickle with his male favorites as he is with his wives , and one by one his most trusted advisors find their way to disgrace–or the block : Cardinal Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , the Boleyns .
Every member of court is constantly aware that their very lives depend on the satisfaction of the king ’s desires .
And a curious thing develops .
We find these men aping the current styles , slavishly agreeing with Henry ’s pronouncements , in constant fear of losing at a moment ’s notice all the gifts he has bestowed on them .
Only custom , tradition , and obsequiousness protect them .
In short , they act a lot like women have had to act throughout most of Western history : trapped by the whims of a patriarchal tyrant , without a legal existence outside his good graces .
Even at its inception , patriarchy gnawed upon itself , and the story of liberation from absolute tyranny has , until very recently , been mostly the democratization of who does the gnawing and who gets gnawed .
“ The Tudors ” may be trashy soap opera , but it ca n’t escape the tragedy of its subject any more than we can escape the tragedy of our history .
Books can change the world .
That 's not a controversial statement : From the Holy Bible to Reading Rainbow , just about everybody acknowledges the importance and influence of the written word .
Even psychopaths .
5 The Lord of the Rings - Neo-Nazis

The Classic Book
Lord of the Rings basically defined the fantasy genre .
Its staples -- elves and dwarves , dragons and orcs -- are still the groundwork of most fantasy fiction today .
It was a tale of brotherhood versus greed , good versus evil and like eight different kinds of midget versus the grim reaper .
It was awesome , is what we 're saying here .

The Offenders
Neo -Nazis .
Wait ... seriously ?
For example , take this discussion on the white pride forum Stormfront featuring musings on which Middle Earth species represent each race .
But it 's not an isolated Internet shenanigan : Italian fascists also viewed the book similarly , going as far as naming their fascist training facilities " hobbit camps . "
A whopping three - thousand kids attended , because it sounds way more fun when you phrase it as " romping about the shire with friends " as opposed to " learning how to combat the economic stranglehold of the Jews on modern Europe . "

And that was n't even relegated to antiquity :
The modern equivalent of those same factions have also screened the first film .
So it 's not like you 're missing something subtle they 're interpreting in those dense tomes ; they totally think the story as presented by the movies is pro-Nazi .
Why the Bullshit Interpretation is Exactly That
Lord of the Rings is a work that shows multiple races setting aside their mistrust and hatred of each other , and working together for a peaceful world .
It would be much easier to analyze the novel as a veiled condemnation of Nazism and racism than twisting it to be pro-fascist .
The only hidden meaning to Lord of the Rings as confirmed by the author is the horror of rapid industrial expansion at the expense of nature .
Which pretty much opposes the policies of the Nazi party completely .
Whatever else they were , they were not " green . "

The economy was in a tailspin a few years ago , and although things have improved , many people are finding themselves either unemployed or underemployed .
We all need to make sacrifices at times in order to make ends meet – but sometimes it can be hard to come up with new ways to save .

Today I thought I would try and list a bunch of ways to save that my family uses , and hopefully a few of them will be ideas that you had n't thought of before .
10 Easy Ways To Save Money
Here are 10 ways that our family is saving .
Have your own ways to save ?
tell us in the comments .
Stop paying for cable or satellite TV : Stopping your subscription TV service can save a ton of money on a regular monthly basis .
On average when we 've been paying for service the bill can run anywhere from $ 35 - $ 125 / month .
Over an entire year canceling your TV service can save you $ 420 - $ 1500 !
Instead of paying for cable try watch TV shows for free using a software like Playon , or by hooking up your computer to the TV .
Check out my article “ How To Watch TV For Free Or Cheap Without Paying For Cable ” for a detailed look at this option .
Make it a point to shop for better rates on insurance :
One place that a lot of people overpay is when it comes to insurance .
Take a day off from work and shop your homeowners , auto , health , life and other insurance coverages to see if you can find a better rate .
The last time I did this I ended up saving over $ 1000 a year on my rates !
Use subscription services ?
Cancel them and use a cheaper alternative :
Are you paying $ 15 a month to pay for a subscription movie rental service like Netflix – but only rarely watch movies ?
Cancel the subscription and use a cheaper alternative like the Redbox movie rental kiosks .
Paying for several magazine subscriptions ?
Read the magazines at your local library instead !
Realize that you do n't need to buy new :
When buying things that you need , realize that you do n't always need to buy those things new when used can be bought for a much smaller price .
Save $ 5 - 6 grand by buying a used car , or save hundreds by buying a used version of last year 's model of digital camera .
Buy used clothing , books , electronics or other high ticket purchases .
Eat out less often :
It can be extremely easy to justify spending when it comes to eating out .
We did it at our house until we actually kept a budget and realized we were overspending by hundreds of dollars every month just because we were eating out .
Packing lunches and making dinner at night meant we saved in excess of 2-300 dollars a month !
Save on entertainment at the movies :
My wife and I love going to the movies , but nowadays you almost have to take out a second mortgage in order to afford the movies .
But there are ways to save on going to the cinema .
You can go to a matinee , see the movie at a second run theater , buy packages of tickets at a reduced rate , bring your own snacks ( if they allow it ) , seek out free family movie days in the summer or join movie watcher loyalty clubs .
Maintenance saves money :
By maintaining the things you own you 'll end up spending a little up front , and saving a ton down the line .
Go for regular oil changes and service checks , and do regular maintenance around the house in order to ensure that all of your things are in good working order .
Sleep on it : A lot of people like to buy things on impulse and the result is they overspend on a ton of things they end up realizing they do n't need .
Give yourself a waiting period for purchases over a certain dollar amount , and quite often you 'll realize while you 're waiting that you do n't want or need the item .
My waiting period ?
At least 24 hours , but more depending on the cost of the item .
Make a list – and use coupons :
One of the biggest things that I do n't do when grocery shopping sometimes is actually making a list of the items we need to buy .
The result is that we end up buying a bunch of junk food or other items that are n't needed .
Instead , make sure to shop when you 're not hungry , make a list – and actually clip some of the coupons you see in the paper to save some extra cash .
It never hurts to ask for a discount :
There are so many times that you can save big just by asking for a discount .
For example , we recently called up our internet service provider and asked them to reduce our rate in order to keep us as a customer .
They found a promotion that was currently running , and applied it to our account to save us $ 15 / month .
Another big one we ’ve used is to ask for a discount on medical bills .
Often if you call up the hospital billing department you can save 10 - 20 % off of your bill just by asking , and paying cash .
This can end up saving you hundreds or thousands of dollars !
So there are 10 easy ways to save money on your regular and not so regular bills .
Get creative , do n't accept the status - quo and look for savings in places you maybe did n't even think to look before .
Where do you find savings in your budget ?
Tell us some creative ways that you save money every month !

Scientists are finding enormous oil plumes in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico , including one as large as 10 miles long , 3 miles wide and 300 feet thick in spots .
The discovery is fresh evidence that the leak from the broken undersea well could be substantially worse than estimates that the government and BP have given .
“ There ’s a shocking amount of oil in the deep water , relative to what you see in the surface water , ” said Samantha Joye , a researcher at the University of Georgia who is involved in one of the first scientific missions to gather details about what is happening in the gulf .
“ There ’s a tremendous amount of oil in multiple layers , three or four or five layers deep in the water column . ”
The plumes are depleting the oxygen dissolved in the gulf , worrying scientists , who fear that the oxygen level could eventually fall so low as to kill off much of the sea life near the plumes .
Dr. Joye said the oxygen had already dropped 30 percent near some of the plumes in the month that the broken oil well had been flowing .
“ If you keep those kinds of rates up , you could draw the oxygen down to very low levels that are dangerous to animals in a couple of months , ” she said Saturday .
“ That is alarming . ”

With the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 now announced all eyes are on the upcoming iPhone 8 , and there ’s no shortage of rumors about Apple ’s flagship , with the latest being that it will come with up to 512GB of storage .
According to Chinese phone repair company GeekBar , which posted to Weibo ( a Chinese microblogging site ) , the iPhone 8 will come in 64GB , 256GB and 512GB sizes .
Those are the same sizes as the iPad Pro 10.5 comes in , up from the 32GB , 128GB and 256GB selection available for the iPhone 7 .
If true , you ’d be able to get an iPhone 8 with double the storage that any current Apple handset is available with .
A 64GB RAM module , supposedly made by SanDisk for the iPhone 8
No change to the RAM
The source , who included an image supposedly showing a 64GB RAM module intended for the iPhone 8 , added that whichever storage size you opt for you ’ll get 3GB of RAM , so that ’s one thing that might not be changing , as the iPhone 7 Plus already has 3GB – though the iPhone 7 only has 2GB .
Given that Apple only just moved to 3GB last year we would n’t expect another jump for this year ’s iPhones , so 3GB makes sense , and indeed it ’s been rumored before .
As for the storage , we ’d heard before that it would top out at 256GB , so we ’d take the 512GB claim with a pinch of salt , but it does n’t seem out of the question .
Of course , all these things only apply to the top - end iPhone 8 .
The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus may well come with less storage .

Researchers have discovered that education not only delays the early symptoms of dementia , but can also slow down the development of the disease -- a finding that could result in faster diagnosis and treatment of dementia , reveals a thesis from the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg , Sweden .
Previous studies have shown that education offers some degree of protection against the symptoms of disorders of the brain .
" This mechanism has previously been observed at a late stage of the disease , primarily in cases of Alzheimer 's , which is a type of dementia , " says Sindre Rolstad , researcher at the University of Gothenburg .
" We wanted to investigate how education affected the disease in the early stages of dementia , known as mild cognitive impairment . "
People with mild cognitive impairment can be affected by a reduction in their ability to think , such as reduced memory and a short attention span .
" We wanted to find out whether highly educated patients with mild cognitive impairment differed in terms of tolerance of the disease from patients with intermediate and low levels of education , " says Rolstad .
By analysing the patients ' spinal fluid , the researchers were able to examine whether there were signs of dementia in the brain .
" Highly educated patients with mild cognitive impairment who went on to develop dementia over the next two years had more signs of disease in their spinal fluid than those with intermediate and low levels of education , " says Rolstad .
Despite having more disease in the brain , the highly educated patients showed the same symptoms of the disease as their less well educated counterparts .
This means that patients with higher levels of education tolerate more disease in the brain .
The researchers also studied patients with mild cognitive impairment who did not go on to develop dementia over the next two years .
" We found that the highly educated patients who did not develop dementia during the course of the study showed signs of better nerve function than those with lower levels of education , " says Rolstad .
" This finding means that the highly educated not only tolerate more disease in the brain but also sustain less nerve damage during the early stages of the disease . "
The results indicate that a higher reserve capacity delays the symptoms of dementia and the progress of the disease .
This can help the care sector to be more aware of dementia in highly educated patients , and thus increase the chances of the correct treatment being given .
Though we have n’t heard a peep out of Rockstar or Sony on the matter , owners of leaked copies of the upcoming sandbox action - adventure title Red Dead Redemption are reporting that the PS3 version carries two pieces of exclusive DLC not found in the Xbox 360 version .
According to the sticker on the PS3 packaging , the exclusive content offers the “ Solomon ’s Folly Gang Hideout ” and the “ Walton Gang Outfit ” , the sticker is absent from the 360 packaging .
Weird that there ’s been no mention from any parties involved , as the game officially launches next Tuesday , May 18 .
Of course , if you ’re dying to play the game , you could always locate one of the date - breaking stores this weekend .

Clements talked to Jon Bougie and Lyn Kotecki about his experiences and about the rally planned for the first day of Burge 's trial .
Clements became an activist while behind bars .
Finally , in the summer of 2009 , with protest and pressure building for new trials for Burge torture victims who are still behind bars , Clements was finally freed -- after serving 28 years for a crime he did n't commit .
Today , he is a member of the Jail Jon Burge coalition , a board member of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty and an activist with the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression .
Jon Burge is former police commander who oversaw a squad of detectives who were notorious for using torture techniques to coerce false confessions out of suspects .
One of their victims was a 16 - year - old Clements .
The incriminating statement that was tortured out of him was the main evidence used at the trial where he was convicted .
Clements was sentenced to four life sentences plus 30 years .
The man responsible for the torture of Mark Clements and some 200 other African American and Latino men in Chicago will go on trial on Monday in a downtown courtroom .
JON BURGE is the former Chicago Police commander who ran a torture ring that abused approximately 200 suspects in the 1970s and ' 80s .
He is scheduled to go on trial in Chicago on May 24 .
Can you tell us a bit about your experience with Burge 's torturers in 1981 ?
AT 16 years of age , I was taken into police custody by Virgil Jones and Aaron Gibson .
I was arrested earlier for an alleged disorderly conduct charge , which resulted in police transporting me down to Area 3 Violent Crimes .
I had no idea why I was being taken to Area 3 Violent Crimes .
They told me a fire had occurred , and that four people died as a result of the fire .
They said someone informed them that I set these fires in the neighborhood .
I told them repeatedly that I did n't set this fire , I did n't know who set this fire , and I wanted to call my parents .
I was 16 years of age .
The detectives told me " no . "
There was no youth officer contacted who was with me throughout this interrogation .
Because I was denied access to a phone , my parents had not been contacted .

I asked to use the bathroom .
Inside the bathroom , I saw a Caucasian police officer ( who turned out to be Detective John McCann ) drinking liquor and looking out of a window .
I was intimidated and scared , so I used the bathroom real fast .
After using the bathroom , police took me into a different interrogation room .
They put me in a closet - sized interrogation room .
I was handcuffed to a ring .
Inside of this room , because it was so small , the only thing that could fit in it was a desk - - a small table , with two chairs and three chairs up against the wall .
Detective McCann came into the room and told me he was sent to help me .
He shut the door , sat behind the desk , and asked , " Did you commit this crime ? " I said no .
The detective said he thought I was lying .
He moved his chair from behind his desk , and set it directly in front of the chair that I was sitting in .
He placed it right up against me .
He started hitting me in my arms and my legs and using racial slurs , like calling me " little nigger boy . "
He started hitting me in the chest .
I was only 120 pounds .
It knocked the air out of me .
He was hitting me in the back , along my legs .
What you can do A demonstration is planned for the first day of Jon Burge 's trial .
If you 're in or around Chicago , come to the Daley Plaza , 55 W. Randolph , at 8:30 a.m .
Find out more about the protest and the campaign against Burge at the Jail Jon Burge Web site .
For more background on the long struggle to win justice for Burge torture victims , visit the Web site of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty and the Campaign 's newsletter , the New Abolitionist .
He basically fed me the facts and circumstances of what he wanted me to say to a man who was an assistant Cook County state 's attorney .
His name was Kevin Moore , and he told me that he represented the people .
I told him the police did n't allow me to call my parents , I had not seen a youth officer , and the police beat me .
Just hearing that , he packed his stuff up and left .
Detective McCann returned to the room , slammed the door and locked it .
McCann said I was trying to get him in trouble with his boss .
He started hitting me in the arms , smacked me a couple of times , hit me in the chest several times , and I remember bending my head down , and he was beating me in the back .
He was beating me in my legs with his fists and open hands .
He was beating me in the back and trying to get me to rise up .
He grabbed my genitals and began to squeeze .
He kept squeezing harder and harder and harder .
He told me , " You 're going to cooperate , little nigger boy . "
That 's what he was calling me .
I started crying , and I told him I would cooperate .

He re-fed me the facts and circumstances of the crime .
This time , he got all of the detectives , and they all sat in the room .
He had me tell them exactly what I would tell the state 's attorney .
Kevin Moore returned , and he acted like nothing had happened .
WHAT ROLE did race play in the Burge torture ring ?
IT WAS very racist .
In all of these cases , these men were called racist names while they were beaten .
And some of Jon Burge 's Black colleagues say he commonly used racist terms .
WOULD YOU say that torture and abuse by police officers is limited to Chicago , or is it spread wider than that ?
Well , it is spread wider .
California had a problem with police torture back in the '60s and ' 70s .
Torture is no stranger to New York .
There was a young man who was sodomized by a plunger , Abner Louima .
There is the young man who was shot forty - some times reaching for his wallet , Amadou Diallo .
There have been cases of unthinkable tortures in New York and California as well as Chicago .
YOUR CASE and many of the other Burge torture cases happened over 20 years ago .
Some of those incidents you just mentioned were much more recent .
Do you have thoughts on what goes on today , and how similar or different it is compared to what was happening then ?
THE SYSTEM has really not changed .
Even with recorded confessions , there are errors and flaws with that .
There have been individuals who have had their confessions tossed out because it was determined that police strategized ways to turn off the recording device and inflict beatings or brutality on the suspect to force them to give confessions against their will .
I do n't give Barack Obama credit for saying he wants change .
Now , he is the president of the United States of America , but he has n't done one thing to correct the torture that has happened to Iraqi citizens .
He claimed when he was running that he would make change .
We need to question what was behind Burge .
Who gave Burge the power to do what he was doing ?
Burge went to war and learned the techniques of torture in Vietnam .
But who was giving Jon Burge the power to do what he was doing -- because he was untouchable for a great time .
Mayor Daley knew of these tortures .
There are 20 Chicago police torture victims who remain incarcerated .
Our system is destroying us -- from the prisons to the police .
YOU'RE VERY involved in the Jail Jon Burge ( JJB ) Coalition , which is calling for a rally on May 24 , the day of Jon Burge 's trial .
Can you tell us about the current activity around the call to Jail Jon Burge ?
WE HAVE gotten great responses from many colleges .
I want to see May 24 turn out to be another May Day , like the immigrant rights march .
Chicago needs to see this for criminal justice reform in my opinion .
I keep hearing about criminal justice reforms .
Where are the reforms ?
There are no criminal justice reforms .
Some people had a problem when I went to Springfield and spoke at the lobby day .
When I spoke , I asked them , what would they do if their child was accused of a crime and sentenced to natural life ?
Many people look at that as criticizing government officials .
Society has it wrong when you 're the ones serving the politicians .
The politician is supposed to be serving you .
People are worried about retaliatory behavior by the city of Chicago .
But I 'm not worried .
They already took 28 years .
I never really got over prison .
WHY IS it important that Burge face consequences for what he did ?
Why is it important for people to come out on May 24 and call for jailing Jon Burge ?
" JAIL JON Burge " was a slogan that was used by the Campaign to End the Death Penalty for many years .
And it is a rightful slogan .
Most of these individuals can't deal with the heat that they dish out .
Chances are that Jon Burge will see , at most , about 18 months in federal prison .
If he gets any more , I will probably faint in the courtroom .
That 's how the criminal justice system operates .
But perhaps if he gets a prison sentence , he 'll talk .
Most of these 20 [ people who were tortured and are still behind bars ] are going to require more than the special prosecutor 's report to get them new hearings , because that report focused primarily on about four cases .
It 's going to require detectives singing on other detectives and getting other detectives indicted to break down that machine that they have , because they have a strong machine .
WHAT SIGNAL do you think Burge 's trial will send to police who might be engaging in torture or to judges who look the other way on abuse ?
BURGE HAS been headline news , but every year , we hear about detectives and street cops engaging in unthinkable acts .
Look at what the officer did to that bartender [ Chicago cop Anthony Abbate , whose beating of bartender Karolina Obrycka in 2007 was captured on tape ] .
These things will not stop until the ring of Burge is brought down .
That will cause others in the police department to stop and think .
Right now , they are thinking it 's just Burge and some retired officers .
But there are new officers out there today , and they have their own operations as to what evils they 're doing .
What I do believe is that Jon Burge Day can force politicians , judges , and prosecutors to come along with charges against additional officers .
Taking Jon Burge down does n't solve the problem .
When you 're dealing with broad issues such as police tortures or the health care issues or prison abuses , we all have to come together to correct that .
If we want to build the organizations that we need to do this , we need to get young people involved .
What I will say about May 24 is that I want to rock Chicago .
I believe that it can be done .
I do n't believe that things are so impossible that we can't come together , old and young , and whatever .
Change is n't saying " I want change , " but then backing down .
From the mayor of the city of Chicago , to former Cook County State 's Attorney Dick Devine , to every abusive police officer who victimizes suspects , I believe that before I leave this Earth , you will be indicted -- because I will work day and night to be sure that you are held responsible for your behavior .
Actor Russell Crowe has stormed out of a BBC Radio interview after suggestions that he made the quintessentially British legend Robin Hood sound Irish in his latest movie .
New Zealand - born Crowe , who was raised in Australia , has been the target of criticism in the British media for his accent in the Robin Hood action adventure movie which opened this week with its world premiere held at the Cannes Film Festival .
BBC Radio arts reporter Mark Lawson said his impression from Crowe 's performance was that " Robin Hood was an Irishman who took frequent holidays in Australia " .
" You 've got dead ears , mate - seriously dead ears - if you think there 's an Irish accent , " Crowe , 46 , retorted in the interview , broadcast on Thursday ( UK time ) .
Lawson then asked Crowe if the accent was meant to be northern English .
Robin Hood , a 13th century archer who according to folklore robbed the rich to give the poor , lived in a forest near the northern English city of Nottingham .
" No , I was going for an Italian ... missed it ?
F--- me , " Crowe replied .
The actor could then be heard muttering , " I do n't get the Irish thing by the way .
I do n't get it at all , " as he walked out of the interview .
Crowe , who won an Oscar for his role in the 2000 movie Gladiator , has a reputation for being bad - tempered which culminated in a 2005 arrest for throwing a telephone at a New York hotel employee .
The actor described that incident at the time as " possibly the most shameful situation that I 've ever gotten myself into " .

Think Progress has evidence that FreedomWorks , Dick Armey 's army of teabaggers and patriots , was used to build grassroots support for their offshore drilling initiatives .
While BP has spent hundreds of millions building its brand , it has offshored the dirty work of promoting expanded drilling to right - wing front groups and trade associations .
In a 2007 PowerPoint presentation obtained by ThinkProgress , BP appears to have been interested in fighting to open up protected waters to new offshore drilling .
The presentation , organized by the BP - funded front group “ Consumer Energy Alliance , ” was delivered at the American Gas Association ’s marketing meeting in Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida .
The presentation calls for a five - year plan to build grassroots support to open wide swaths of both the East and West coasts to new drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf : ( read more ... )
No !
Say it is n't so .
After all , FreedomWorks condemned the federal government , the Obama administration and just about everyone else on their hit list in defense of BP just two days ago , accusing them of putting their boots on the neck of industry .
This should n't surprise anyone who has been paying attention , but what it proves beyond all doubt to me is how similar the Dick Armey model is to the Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon model .
The Freedomworks ' grassroots movement - building prototype is nearly a carbon copy of the Scanlon pitch for the combined PR / lobbying effort to Indian tribes .
The Abramoff - Scanlon Model
It goes like this : Scanlon sells the tribes on a full - service political solution to reach their goal .
Here 's the opener from a pitch to Michigan tribes :
The sell is a plan to ' form an army ' .
This army will , of course , be formed by the Scanlon - Abramoff team and will consist databases and campaigns created via targeted polls , databases , mailings , and ' grassroots ' efforts .
In the Abramoff model , Ralph Reed , Grover Norquist , and even Dick Armey were the go - to people for grassroots .
One example used Reed 's Christian Right groups to oppose one tribe 's efforts to open a casino so Abramoff and Scanlon could pick up the pieces and convince that tribe to turn the verdict around using their services .
Here 's one of their schemes with Grover Norquist in the center :
The money would then flow through non-profits to the pockets of Abramoff , Scanlon , Reed , Grover Norquist , and Dick Armey .
Here 's an excerpt outlining Grover Norquist 's requirements for supplying grassroots support :
When pressed for details by the client on what a $ 50,000 contribution to Grover 's organization will buy , Abramoff responds : " everything they need for him to do to win . "
How noble of these slimy characters not to want to tip their opponents to think they 're trying to buy the taxpayer movement even while admitting they are doing that very thing .
The FreedomWorks Model
From ThinkProgress again :
Slide 14 lists the groups involved in doing grassroots outreach .
Under “ affiliated groups , ” FreedomWorks — a right - wing “ grassroots ” group that helped plan the tea parties and continues to lobby aggressively against clean energy reform — is listed along with the 60 Plus Association , the American Conservative Union , and others .
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute are some of the trade associations involved .
Slide 14 also shows that BP is one of the member companies supporting the campaign .
Not a lot of difference between the two .
Ralph Reed routinely rented out the Christian Right for Abramoff 's causes .
Now Dick Armey does it for his own causes .
It would be interesting to know how much of Freedomworks Foundation 's 2007 donations of $ 4 million were from BP .
Or the percentage of the almost - $ 3 million donated in 2008 .
Of course , if they waited until 2009 to make the payoff , we might have awhile to wait before we know .
This is how right - wing grassroots armies are made .
One dollar at a time .
LeanServer has created for IIS 7.0 an extension called ScaleUp , solving some of the problems related to file uploading and plaguing Microsoft ’s web platform .
According to its creators , ScaleUp increases upload speed , supports unlimited upload file sizes , scales up to thousands of uploads per server , and includes progress reporting , streaming and filtering .
ASP and ASP.NET have long had a number of problems uploading files .
In the beginning , one could not extract a file from a POST message unless he wrote custom code parsing the post and retrieving the file data .
ASP.NET introduced the FileUpload control which improved the uploading process by synchronously loading the POST data into the memory , parsing the data to extract the file , and consequently saving it to the disk .
This solution had a number of problems , the most severe one being the quick fragmentation of the memory leading to OutOfMemory exceptions because the entire file would go to memory first before being transferred to disk .
ASP .NET 2.0 introduced more enhancements including a disk buffering option which saved to the disk any upload exceeding 80 KB .
Still , there remained some limitations :
The maximum size of uploaded files was 2GB ( ASP.NET ) or 4GB ( IIS )
There was one thread per upload , leading to thread starvation
Disk buffering had a serious negative performance impact
Uploads could not be streamed and there was no report on progress
ScaleUp promises to solve all these problems .
The features of the framework promise :
Faster uploads , up to 20 x times
No limit for the upload size
Scaling up to thousands of simultaneous uploads for server
Features like progress reporting , streaming and filtering
Enterprise performance monitoring of the uploading process across servers
Mike Volodarsky , former PM for IIS at Microsoft and currently CTO for LeanServer , has explained how ScaleUp works :
The secret behind ScaleUP is its use of the IIS 7.0 ’s native extensibility layer to completely replace the platform ’s upload handling with its own high - performance preload engine .
This allows it to eliminate the pre-existing upload limitations , while allowing any existing IIS - compatible application to handle web uploads with virtually no application changes .
At the heart of ScaleUP ’s upload engine is fully asynchronous request preload , which eliminates thread starvation and enables us to fully take advantage of multi-core power provided by today ’s servers .
The entire engine is fully asynchronous from reading network data , to parsing multipart / form - data uploads , streaming entity filters , and disk storage .
Internally , we use advanced Windows performance technologies like async unbuffered IO , advanced cache management and pretty much every IIS 7.0 trick in the book to significantly boost upload throughput , and reduce resource usage on the server .
Currently ScaleUp is used by MySpace to handle 25 million uploads per day , and they say they reduced the number of uploading servers after installing the IIS extension .
ScaleUp can be used for ASP , ASP.NET , and PHP applications and can be used with existing applications without requiring modifications .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. consumers have tightened their belts in the wake of the global financial crisis , which if sustained would break a trend of steady increases in the consumption rate since the 1980s , according to an International Monetary Fund study published on Monday .
The rate of U.S. household consumption is likely to fall from its current level , causing the saving rate to rise to about 6 percent of disposable personal income from nearly 5 percent in 2009 , the study found .
Compared to years of over - consumption by Americans , fueled by a credit boom , the IMF said the savings rate implies a decline in U.S. private - sector demand in the order of 3 percentage points of gross domestic product .
Using economic simulations , the IMF said U.S. household consumption and saving rates are expected to settle at 89.5 to 91.5 percent and 5 to 7 percent of disposable income , respectively , over the next several years .
Similar levels of consumption and savings rates were last seen in the early 1990s , it said .
The IMF said the future of U.S. consumption had “ tangible macroeconomic implications ” for the U.S. economic recovery and for global growth and current account imbalances .
“ If U.S. private - sector demand remains at a subdued level , global economic growth will be less vigorous than otherwise , and the distribution of current account balances will need a realignment -- a smaller deficit in the U.S. will have to be matched by smaller surpluses or larger
The latest USA Today / Gallup poll delivers a shot across the bow to those who believe the disaster in the Gulf is an argument for complacency on energy policy :
The oil spill off the Gulf Coast is staining more than Louisiana 's beaches .
The response to the disaster by energy giant BP , President Obama and the federal government all get terrible grades from Americans in a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll .
Nearly three - fourths of those surveyed Monday and Tuesday say BP is doing a " poor " or " very poor " job in handling the calamity .
Six of 10 say that of the federal government .
And a 53 % majority give Obama a poor rating .
Unfortunately , there is no magic wand that we can wave to immediately cure the damage that has already been done in the Gulf , but we can help make sure it never happens again by adopting new energy policies that will break our addiction to oil and fossil fuels .
And according to this poll , that 's exactly what the American public wants :
Now , a majority say protection of the environment should be given priority , " even at the risk of limiting energy supplies . "
The 55%-39 % divide on that question was a reversal of American views in March , before the April 20 explosion sent crude oil spewing into the gulf .
Then , by 50 % - 43 % Americans said development U.S. energy supplies should be given priority , " even if the environment suffers to some extent . "
On a similar question , those surveyed divided 50 % - 43 % over whether the environment should be protected " even at the risk of curbing economy growth " or if growth should be given priority , " even if the environment suffers to some extent . "
That 's a big swing from March , too .
Then , by 53 % - 38 % Americans chose economic growth as their priority .
Even though Americans are willing to sacrifice in order to to break our addiction to oil , there is ultimately no trade - off between moving towards an oil - free future and the economy .
Indeed , if we do n't develop alternatives , we 'll not only wreck our ecology , we 'll erase the best opportunity before us to achieve new prosperity , not just for the United States , but for the world .
We can't unspill the millions of barrels of oil that are now flooding the Gulf , we can only hope to limit the damage they cause .
But we can move towards a new energy economy .
There is probably no single more urgent priority for our nation than doing just that and this poll offers yet more evidence that the time for action is now .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The United States has 5,113 nuclear warheads in its stockpile and many thousands more that have been retired and are awaiting dismantling , according to a senior defense official .
The release of the number of warheads marks only the second time in U.S. history the government has released the once top secret information .
The Pentagon statistics show the nuclear stockpile was reduced by 75 percent between the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and September 30 , 2009 , and 84 percent since its peak of more than 31,255 in 1967 .
The 5,113 warheads include active and inactive ones , according to the senior defense official .
The numbers released Monday also include yearly statistics on the strategic long - range and nonstrategic short - range weapons dating back to 1962 .
Previously released information on the stockpile size showed the number of warheads from 1945 through 1961 .
The release of the most recent stockpile accounting by the U.S. government " is important to nonproliferation efforts , and to pursuing follow - on reductions " after the upcoming ratification of the updated START treaty , according to a fact sheet released by the Pentagon on Monday .
" We think the United States has set an example of transparency , " according to a senior defense official .
Reporters were briefed on the statistical information at the Pentagon as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the United Nations during a conference to review of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty .
Active warheads are those ready to be used within a short period of time , while inactive warheads are maintained but have key parts removed from them , the official said .
The United States has thousands more nuclear warheads that have not been dismantled but are slated to be taken apart .
Those weapons have key parts removed from them and are not maintained , the official said .
The warheads are only being kept secure and it would take a good deal of effort and money to restore them to working order , the official said .
The Pentagon did not provide a figure on the number waiting to be dismantled , but did acknowledge there are thousands .
Kepler Mission Manager Update
June 4 , 2010 May was a busy month for the Kepler Mission .
On May 12 , 2010 , the Kepler project team marked the one - year anniversary of on - orbit operations .
As we commemorated the date , the team was in the final stages in its preparations to release Kepler ’s first 43 days of science data to the public .
Scheduled for June 15 , 2010 , the data will include observations from more than 150,000 stars ( more information below ) .
Meanwhile , the project successfully completed another monthly science data download on May 20 , 2010 .
This data volume was about 95 gigabytes , and represented Kepler ’s Quarter 5 , Month 2 collection .
As the download was completed , the team was already making preparations for the upcoming June science data download , scheduled for June 22 - 25 , 2010 .
This science data download will also be made in conjunction with another quarterly roll of the Kepler spacecraft .
The roll will place Kepler in its summer attitude for three months .
This allows for Kepler ’s solar arrays to be optimally aligned toward the sun for spacecraft power generation .
The science team has worked very hard this last month preparing for the upcoming release of data to the public .
On June 15 , 2010 , the first 43 days of data will become publicly available at the Multi-Mission Archive at STScI ( MAST : http://archive.stsci.edu).
The team worked around the clock to identify as many transit - like events in those data as possible .
Consequently , the number of planet candidates has more than doubled in the last month .
And as we search for planet candidates , we inevitably find eclipsing binary stars .
In fact we found many thousands of these eclipsing binarys !
We 've catalogued nearly three thousand such systems .
Both the binary catalog and a list of a few hundred planet candidates will be published this month to coincide with the data release .
It 's our hope that the public and the astronomical community will join us in the analysis of Kepler 's incredible data and in the painstaking and methodical process of sorting out which candidates are , indeed , new worlds .
To present a comprehensive overview of these results to the public , four papers are being written .
The first discusses the characteristics of planetary candidates in the released data with respect to the distributions of size , semi-major axis , and orbital period .
The location and magnitude of the stars they orbit also are provided , so that they can be analyzed by other observers .
To avoid wasting valuable telescope time , a second paper identifies and discusses the candidates in the released data that are believed to be " false alarms . "
These are events in the released data that are caused by astrophysical phenomena that mimic the transit pattern expected for exoplanets .
Over 2,000 eclipsing binary stars have also been found and their identity and characteristics are discussed in a third paper .
The fourth paper discusses the discovery of several stars that show the presence of two or more candidates transiting the same star .
If these candidates prove to be planetary systems , they will be the first transiting multi-planet systems ever discovered .
I thought the apps gold rush - which saw bright young developers making thousands from software developed in their bedrooms - might be over , with the big boys moving in to crowd them out .
It seems not - I 've been hearing the stories of two British teenagers who 've made small fortunes from smart ideas .
One is making money despite being barred from Apple 's App Store ; the other has hit the jackpot because Apple has chosen his game as its App of the Week .
My first example , Greg Hughes , is a 19 - year - old computer - science student at Birmingham University .
Software development has been a hobby for a while , and he works for a web design firm when he 's not studying .
A while back , he came up with a way of synchronising his iPhone to his computer over a wireless network ; as things currently stand , you have to plug the phone in .
After paying the £ 60 fee for Apple 's iPhone software development kit , he turned his idea into an app and submitted it for approval .
Greg admits that he never really expected the wi-fi sync app to be approved because , in effect , he was messing with Apple 's own technology .
" I thought it was a bit of a grey area .
It does n't break specific rules , but it 's something that Apple would prefer to do themselves . "
What surprised him was that , rather than just a flat rejection , he got a phone call from a man at Apple 's California headquarters :
" He indicated to me that there was no way it would ever be accepted .
But he was very complimentary about the app - he told me the iPhone team had been impressed , and asked me to send my CV when I graduated . "
All very well - but no reward for Greg 's hard work .
There was , however , another market for his app , albeit one with far less traffic and therefore less lucrative for developers .
There are plenty of users with so - called " jail - broken " iPhones , which means they can install apps that do n't need to be approved by Apple .
The young developer decided last week to place his app in a marketplace for indie apps at $ 9.99 - quite a chunky price - and see what happened .
The result ?
In just 72 hours , 2,500 people bought it .
So Mr Hughes has been able to make over $ 20,000 in a few days , even without the backing of Apple .
You 'd think he'd be over the moon .
But he reckons he could have been a millionaire if he had managed to get wi-fi sync into the App Store .
" I accept they are a business and they answer to their shareholders , " he told me .
" But they are stifling innovation .
It 's not a good sign for the industry as a whole . "
My second case study has no complaint about Apple , even though his app first made a splash on Microsoft 's Xbox platform .
Edward Bentley , another teenage student , started a few years back by making some online games using Flash , but none caught on and he got bored and gave up .
Last autumn , he started working with Microsoft 's free Visual Studio sofware to make a game for the Xbox Live games platform .
By November , he was ready to submit The Impossible Game - a simple but compelling game involving jumping a cube over a series of obstacles - to the Xbox Indie marketplace .
Unlike Apple 's App Store , this outlet has no corporate gatekeeper - the games are reviewed and rated by the community .
Edward 's game got through the process , and he then had to choose a price .
Users pay in Microsoft points , and he went for the lowest price , 80 points , equivalent to $ 1 .
The game was an instant hit , with a few hundred sales most days in November and December , and then a surge of sales after Christmas , as Xbox players used the points they 'd been given as gifts .
Edward was cagey about giving me exact numbers but I got the impression that over the space of a few months , sales had hit five figures , and at a dollar a download , that 's a sizeable amount of cash for a teenager .
But that was just the start .
Edward , who 'd previously always coded on a PC before , spent some of his earnings on a Mac mini and set about creating an iPhone version of The Impossible Game .
" You have to start from scratch , " he told me .
" It 's a completely different language .
You have to get everything pixel perfect , and as it's on a small screen you have to rework everything . "
So it took a while but when he submitted the game to the App Store in mid-April , it took just seven days to get through the process and into the store .
This time , he decided on a marketing plan , setting up a website to promote the game and sending it to reviewers with a request to publish on 30 April .
This was a total failure - the reviews dribbled out , hits on the website were meagre , and it seemed the game might disappear without trace .
But a few days later , it was featured in the " new and noteworthy " section of the US App Store , and began to take off , making it into the Top 10 .
Then , a week ago , the phone rang : " I got a call from Apple in California , " says Edward .
" They said we want to do some promotion for the game . "
The promotion Apple had in mind was making The Impossible Game its " App of The Week " .
So right now , millions of iPhone and iPod Touch users who take a look at the United States App Store see a banner ad for the game .
" It 's the kind of advertising that money could n't buy , " says Edward .
When I last looked , Edward 's game was at number four in the US chart , so he 's done what many British stars have failed to achieve - he 's made it big in America .
He 's still very coy about what that means in terms of sales and cash , but I 've had a look at the sales of apps which have had similar chart positions and I think it 's safe to say that university tuition fees are not going to be a worry .
So , we have two smart young self - taught developers who have found that in the new app economy they can compete with software giants and win .
They may turn out to be one - hit wonders .
But both Greg and Edward are now planning to develop more apps , and their success may inspire others to try their hand .
Wise continues to imagine what would happen if black protesters surrounded and intimidated white Congresspersons .
He imagines if a famous ( black ) hip hop artist said of a white president , " He ’s a piece of shit and I told him to suck on my machine gun . "
Would Sean Hannity invite that performer onto his show and call him a " friend and frequent guest of the program " ?
Wise continues :
Imagine that a black radio host were to suggest that the only way to get promoted in the administration of a white president is by “ hating black people , ” or that a prominent white person had only endorsed a white presidential candidate as an act of racial bonding , or blamed a white president for a fight on a school bus in which a black kid was jumped by two white kids , or said that he would n’t want to kill all conservatives , but rather , would like to leave just enough — “ living fossils ” as he called them — “ so we will never forget what these people stood for . ”
After all , these are things that Rush Limbaugh has said , about Barack Obama ’s administration , Colin Powell ’s endorsement of Barack Obama , a fight on a school bus in Belleville , Illinois in which two black kids beat up a white kid , and about liberals , generally .
Marc Ambinder noted ( both new and old media 's ) growing - consensus adjective for the conservative base in America today ( i.e. , " epistemic closure " ) :
It is absolutely a condition of the age of the triumph of conservative personality politics , where entertainers shouting slogans are taken seriously as political actors , and where the incentive structures exist to stomp on dissent and nuance , causing experimental voices to retrench and allowing a lot of people to pretend that the world around them is not changing .
The obsession with ACORN , Climategate , death panels , the militarization of rhetoric , Saul Alinsky , Chicago - style politics , that TAXPAYERS will fund the bailout of banks -- these are n't meaningful or interesting or even relevant things to focus on .
( The banks will fund their own bailouts . )
I think that Tim Wise 's piece more eloquently explains the reason for this " epistemic closure " -- many whites ' vision of their race 's superiority is severely threatened .
Facts will always give way to such deep - seated and long standing racism .
Would that members of the media unapologetically call much of the Tea Party what it is : racist .
Of course , then they would have to analyze their double - standard when it comes to protests .
For example , just recently thousands of people right here in Seattle rallied for immigration reform , but from my perusal of the tradmed it 's as if it never happened .
How would CNN cover thousands of white people gathering to protest " socialism " ?
I hope some of tradmed 's journalists and producers consider Mr. Wise 's thought experiment regarding what if the Tea Party were black ...
Protest is only seen as fundamentally American when those who have long had the luxury of seeing themselves as prototypically American engage in it .
When the dangerous and dark “ other ” does so , however , it is n’t viewed as normal or natural , let alone patriotic .
Which is why Rush Limbaugh could say , this past week , that the Tea Parties are the first time since the Civil War that ordinary , common Americans stood up for their rights : a statement that erases the normalcy and “ American - ness ” of blacks in the civil rights struggle , not to mention women in the fight for suffrage and equality , working people in the fight for better working conditions , and LGBT folks as they struggle to be treated as full and equal human beings .
This is the heart of the matter -- as portrayed in the media , dissent from conservative middle - aged or elderly white people is somehow a part of the American tradition that deserves constant coverage , while any other form of protest is portrayed ( if at all ) as subtly a threat to the status quo .
Would that the Iraq War protests of which I was a part prior to the invasion have had the same coverage ...
In any event , thank you Tim Wise , for pointing out the inherent racism in the media 's coverage of protest in 2010 .
Would like to think that sometime in the future when hundreds or thousands of people who do n't spout racist conservative views gather to protest or demand action from the government , it might get some coverage in the media ( from Seattle 's immigration reform rally ) :
1 . We 're here at QCon London 2010 and I 'm sitting here with Dan Ingalls .
Dan , why do n't you explain to us what you 've been doing for the last 40 years ?
It 's a long story , but if we go back to the period that I talked about in my talk , from 40 years it began with my first experience in programming and then becoming associated with Alan Kay in the work on Smalltalk .
That kept us busy , productive and entertained for really a couple of decades .
There was a period when I left the industry for about 10 years to run a family business , but then I came back and that was the time when I did Squeak with some other people .
That grew out of the fact that it seemed to me that when I came back software had not changed much , but the computers were much faster and allowed us to do a lot of things , it was really sort of a better time for Smalltalk .
Then I retired for a brief period then came back to work at Sun and at that point , things were happening on web that I wanted to play with and spent a while wondering why that was so complicated and got the idea for the Lively Kernel and that 's kept me busy pretty much since that time .
2 . Let 's start out with the first period - the Smalltalk period at Xerox PARC .
What was Smalltalk - 72 like ?
It 's a very different language than the language we find in Squeak .
It 's based on message passing , is that true ?
Smalltalk - 72
I think of as the coolest scripting system that ever was .
What it is , it 's a programming model where in the code you have access to essentially the token stream of the code that called you .
If you look at some of the original compiler compiler work , in current compiler works , you are essentially looking at the incoming token stream .
If you allow that to happen in a program , it allows the program to parse on the fly , which is a mistake in normal programming , but what it allowed us to do is to play with different syntaxes for what we wanted to do and to actually choose to have message oriented semantics in the language .
We put together the system Smalltalk - 72 , which could have just been something like Logo , except that it was powerful enough to talk about messages and we had the opportunity to develop a style for an extensible language , one with classes and instances and a style for message sending , as the model for processing .
It actually was used productively for 4 years .
We did several iterations of a curriculum for a school with children to find out if that was teachable .
Then we had pretty creative people in the group working also on graphics and music , which we also used the system to describe .
We got a lot of experience with how we wanted the object oriented style to work .
3 . The fact that in Smalltalk - 72 you were parsing essentially the token stream , this reminds me a bit of Lisp macros .
Do you see any connection to that ?
Did those exist back then ?
We were aware of Lisp .
It was an inspiration for Alan and for me and for other people in the group , but I 'm not sure if there is really about that .
I think of Smalltalk - 72 as being sort of a marriage of Lisp and Meta .
The META I 'm talking about there is a paper about it called META - II , it was written by Val Schorre in 1962 and it's a beautiful paper .
It ends up with a compiler compiler that 's written in itself in about a quarter of a page .
It 's another gem like McCarthy 's Lisp eval .
I recommend that paper to anybody who is so interested .
4 . It strikes me also that Smalltalk - 72 was very focused on the messaging , because there was no concept of methods , as in later Smalltalk .
Because you are really just getting a stream of data and you have to interpret it .
Right , we were just in the process of discovering that .
If you look at code , in Smalltalk - 72 you 'll see a class description that is just like a function with a whole lot of code , but the style we quickly evolved was one where that code was testing to see if it was this message or this message or this , like keyword testing .
Then , the little sub - bodies of code that went which each of those corresponded to methods .
We thus got experience with that style , but it 's true that the language did not have a syntax for it , that came later .
5 . That was then Smalltalk - 76 .
What were the big changes , the big feature list for Smalltalk - 76 ?
Smalltalk - 76 came to me all as a unit during a weekend at the beach .
When we had gathered this experience of how we wanted things to be , but the language itself ( or at least the programs ) ran really slow because they were having to parse on the fly .
I really wanted to get it to where it could be compiled and run by some sort of virtual machine .
We had come up with this style of using keywords to make things more readable , especially for the kids and essentially for doing all of the message testing was testing on token names .
That 's where I came up with the keyword syntax .
You can actually see pieces of it .
The colon that takes an evaluated argument in Smalltalk - 72 , wound up being a piece of the keyword in Smalltalk - 76 .
Also , infix arithmetic had been dear to my heart ever since I encountered APL so that I preserved so that 's a part of the syntax , but the syntax of Smalltalk - 76 and Smalltalk - 80 is very simple .
I think that 's one of its virtues .
Anyway , part of that whole gestalt that came to me was not only that way of having a fixed syntax , but that could flexibly allow for all sorts of message patterns .
Together with a byte encoding that you could compile to .
In that I was motivated by another thing that was happening at the same time at Xerox PARC , which was the development of microcoded computers .
In the back of my mind there was some previous work done by Peter Deutsch on a microcoded Lisp or a byte encoded Lisp .
I knew that if we could compile the pieces of our language to small code syllables , we could execute that very fast in these microcoded processors .
That was in the back of my mind and , if you take a look at the Smalltalk - 80 virtual machine it all goes back to that sort of whole gestalt .
6 . When did Smalltalk images come along , the image concept ?
Was that in Smalltalk - 72 ?
Did it come later ?
It began with Smalltalk - 72 and I would trace it back even earlier to one of the things that I had loved about APL - it was the APL workspaces .
In APL you could do some work , you could bind some variables , you could define some functions and you save that workspace and when you start it up again you could load that workspace and everything would be exactly as you left it .
Because of course they did n't have any graphics on the screen .
Then , when we did Smalltalk - 72 there was that convenience in the back of my mind and also the Alto Machine - we had these disk packs that stored less than a floppy disk , but you could load the entire program state from the disk to run .
It was like a personal computer , but used by different people .
People would come in , they would load the disk pack and then start to work and then leave and take the disk pack with them .
We were working with children and we wanted the children to be able to do some project , put some stuff on the screen .
Then , if it was the end of their session , we wanted them to be able to save that and come back exactly the way it had been when they next had a chance to work .
It might be on a different computer .
The simplest way to do that was the Alto operating system had something that would in just like one second unload the entire state of memory onto the disk and another symmetric operation that would load it back in from the disk .
We seized on that and said " Fine , just load the whole session out and load it back in . "
That became the image model .
It stood the test of time for us .
There is a downside of working that way , but it worked great for our productivity and you see that later on in Squeak 's rampant portability .
Squeak runs bit identically across platforms of different endianness and different processors , so you can take a Squeak image that 's been stored out , ship it across the world to somebody with a different shaped screen , different color depth , all that and it just works .
7 . You mentioned the downsides of the image .
How could you work around these downsides or what are the downsides ?
There are a couple of downsides .
One is that it makes the system somewhat a slightly heavier weight thing , although nowadays , with the size of current computers it 's nothing .
The other is ( people talk about it as ) the walled garden , where you tend to do everything in your own system , which is a wonderful thing and many of the virtues of the Smalltalk world come about that way .
But if you then want to work with other external programs , other systems , it 's harder to do that because you may have your own encoding for objects and they have to be translated going in and out and so on .
I think of that as being less and less a problem now as we go to thinking more in terms of network computing than we get used to these interfaces to foreign systems .
But during that period , it was a barrier for Smalltalk to integrate as well as other say systems in Unix or Linux that were set up to flexibly use a bunch of different things at the operating system level .
9 . You mentioned the Alto computer at Xerox PARC .
A question I always wanted to ask is there is a rumor that Smalltalk was the GUI at Xerox PARC , the only GUI .
Is that true ?
What were the systems at Xerox PARC ?
That 's not the case .
Xerox PARC had a couple of different laboratories .
There was the so - called Computer Science Laboratory and we were in what was called The System Science Laboratory .
Our group is actually called The Learning Research Group .
There was the Smalltalk system , but there was another project that produced Interlisp and they had their own GUI .
Then , in the Computer Science Lab , there was a similar other system that was worked on by Chuck Gaskin , Martin Newell and people like that and they produced other systems like the Bravo text editor and a lot of that work went on into the later Star product that Xerox actually sold .
10 .
Those other systems had their own GUI ?
Yes , each of them had their own GUI .
A couple of things showed up first in our group and it was wonderful at Xerox PARC that there was a lot of sharing of work .
I think this has been written about in books .
We had this usually weekly meeting called " Dealer " where we would participate along with people from the Computer Science Lab and somebody would say " Would n't it be cool if we could do this particular graphic thing ? " and we'd come back and program it up and give demos back and we'd share back and forth in that way ?
Some of the things were done first in Smalltalk and then spread quickly .
Pop - up menus is an example of that and we had overlapping windows on the screen before the other groups , but something like that you just see once and you want to do it .
That kind of thing spread virally within Xerox
11 . Which system did Steve Jobs see ?
The system he saw was Smalltalk and I was one of the 2 people who gave the demo I guess Adele was involved in the negotiations and talking about it .
12 . Moving on another 4 years to Smalltalk - 80 .
How did that come about ?
What were the changes to Smalltalk - 76 ?
Smalltalk - 80 is very much like Smalltalk - 76 .
The Smalltalk - 80 virtual machine is almost identical .
All of that was really done with Smalltalk - 76 .
We changed the numbering on it mainly because it was a time when we were getting ready to put Smalltalk out into the world .
One of the things you see in Smalltalk - 76 if you look into it is we had our own special character set with lots of glyphs that made sense to our language , but did not appear in the Ascii set .
One of the first things to do was to make it Ascii compliant and we did that almost completely .
The one thing we did n't do is we left the left arrow for assignment which looked funny on computers that had underbar in that place .
That was one of the changes .
There were a couple of real improvements , we put in , Booleans .
The Smalltalk - 76 was more in the Lisp model of nil equals false , and then I unified blocks in a way that was different from Smalltalk - 76 .
That 's pretty much it .
13 . Blocks had appeared in Smalltalk - 76 .
What was the change in Smalltalk - 80 ?
One of the problems with Smalltalk - 76 is you did n't get an object for a block that was passed in .
You got essentially a pointer back to where it came from and it made it the case that if you wanted to pass a block , there was no a way to pass a block that you were handed onto another procedure at a lower level .
If you had something like that that was 3 levels deep , you had to essentially do the overhead of creating blocks 3 times down .
There was some complication in the syntax in order to allow the effect of unevaluated variables in a block call in Smalltalk - 76 that complicated the syntax so that you can have a keyword that either evaluated its argument or did n't .
We got rid of that in Smalltalk - 80 .
14 .
Where did blocks come from originally ?
What lessons did you learn in Smalltalk - 72 to get to blocks in Smalltalk - 76 ?
Smalltalk - 72 , as I say was this completely flexible thing that parsed on the fly .
When I did Smalltalk - 76 one of the hardest things to do was to figure out how to make something compilable there to go there and yet that would pass essentially variables by name and not by value and still have it compiled .
I just did what it took and if you look at Smalltalk - 76 , you 'll see what the solution was .
But it did the job and in Smalltalk - 80 the blocks that we got there were just a more mature version of that and simpler in a way in that you did n't have this difference between unevaluated and evaluated keywords .
15 .
There was some controversy about blocks in Smalltalk - 76 or Smalltalk - 80 .
Some people did n't like them .
What was the case there ?
I think one of the aspects of blocks that people object to is that they hand out a capability an access to within an object that is n't in its external protocol .
If you store that capability somewhere , it 's a breech of security .
What we did at that time - that put us on a new plateau was really great , but I think since that time we 've learned some lessons and that aspect of blocks is one of the lessons we learned .
16 .
Has that problem been dealt with or I suppose it 's still a problem that you expose an internal information with closures ?
One of the things you want to do is not be able to store blocks .
I think the approach of closures is a better approach in that sense .
Some other things we 've learned , such as the bad aspects of shared mutable state .
If you want to look around at Smalltalk - like work that 's more forward looking , I think Gilad Bracha 's work on Newspeak is probably a good place to look .
A lot of that goes back also to the work done by Mark Miller on the language E. Actually I do n't think of E as being as much a language as an architecture , but it has informed a lot of current work on more secure systems .
17 .
The language E brings the concept of capabilities , is that right ?
The basic idea is only , a piece of code should only get a handle that has only operations that are safe to perform on it .
You do n't give somebody a handle to the file system , you give them a handle to a specific file if you want it to be written on .
18 . That avoids having to do security checks and things like that .
In fact it constitutes a security check because what else can you do with it ?
21 . The '80s passed and then you invented Squeak .
Who came up with Squeak ?
Here is how Squeak came about .
I was about to go back and work with the old crew at Apple and we knew we needed a software system that we had domain over and so we figured out that would probably be Smalltalk and we had specifically the old Apple Smalltalk as something we could use because it was in the public domain , but the virtual machine we had for it was a pile of 68 K assembly code and we did n't want to have to go deal with that .
This was after my time of being away from the computers for 8 years and they had gotten so much faster that it occurred to me we probably could actually run the reference implementation of Smalltalk that was in the Blue Book and actually use it .
It would run slowly , but it would be usable .
I had this flash - I still remember driving in the rain and thinking this thought that the way that code was written , it could be translated to C .
It was specifically written to not use messaging really , although it was in the Smalltalk syntax , so that it could be a guide to other implementers who read the Blue Book .
Therefore , by definition , it was translatable to something like C and we ought to be able to just write a translator in Smalltalk from that to C .
That was the germ of Squeak .
Other than that , Squeak is just another Smalltalk - 80 , but the cool thing was that it would then include the code for the Virtual Machine , which would a ) mean we had a Virtual Machine that we could easily debug and change , so it would be nice and malleable and b ) it would be really easy to give to other people to do ports .
Squeak has a very different character , you know - it 's full of flexible graphics and stuff that you do n't see in the other Smalltalks and the reason ( I think ) is that having the system including the primitives , the virtual machine and the graphics , all written in good old malleable debuggable Smalltalk .
It meant that there were lots of things that would be fun to do , would be creative that we would n't normally have done if the graphics were done in some less malleable way , but we could just try them very simply .
The work that I did on WarpBlt , this flexible scaling rotating version of BitBlt , I do n't think I ever would have approached it if I 'd had to do that in C , just because it 's a big complicated thing .
But I wrote a version of it in Smalltalk , which I can sit there and debug .
That was also during a trip to New Hampshire and it took 3 days to get the kernel of it all working .
Then , because of this wonderful simple push button translation to C , we had it working at full native code speed a day later .
22 . In your talk , you mentioned the concept of a kernel as a basic set of concepts that you can build on .
Could you go into that a bit ?
What does this entail ?
A kernel it's an abstract term and people use it all different ways .
People talk about the Unix kernel and this and that .
I think of a kernel as just something that a lot of people talk about it as a platform .
It 's just a set of APIs or definitions that you then can build other stuff on top of .
You can have a graphics kernel and what is that 's all you need to do whatever you want in the world of graphics .
There are other kernels that maybe provide all that you need to run an operating system .
24 .
The word kernel brings us to your current project - the Lively Kernel .
The Lively Kernel is written in JavaScript .
The first question - why ?
JavaScript is here .
It 's all over .
The project came out of my being interested in getting into what people were doing on the world wide web .
When I looked at it , it looked really complicated because I was looking at it from the standpoint of personal computing and how do you take this medium which is the web and your browser and turn it into something active .
I think of a system like Smalltalk or Squeak and yet what I found was a text markup language that is coming from a server and it just did n't feel like any of the immediacy that I like to feel in personal computing .
I took a deep breath and thought " There is good graphics in the browser and there is a dynamic programming language there .
Why do you need all this other stuff ?
If we have that why do n't we just take that and make a little kernel out of it and see what you can get from there ? "
26 .
But you did n't like the idea ?
No , actually it's an experiment that we 're playing with in the Lively Kernel .
I did n't do that originally with the Lively Kernel because partly I view this as a new world and I thought to go and try and just translate Squeak into this new world .
For one thing it would have been politically incorrect and for another thing I felt like that I would be carrying some baggage from the past .
The only thing that I wanted to bring from the past was the experience from Squeak that it 's really simple to do this stuff .
You take a dynamic language , you build a graphical structure like the Morphic system in Squeak and that 's all you need .
I thought to rewrite it in JavaScript would be a challenge and it was and it's a little bit different , maybe better in ways and not as good in ways .
But the essential thing that it preserves is that simplicity of a simple graphical structure in a dynamic language .
Then , coming around the full circle to where it is self - supporting .
27 .
Does the Lively Kernel also have an image concept like Squeak or how does that work ?
It does n't really .
Except that we 're going in that direction .
The Lively Kernel runs as you 'd expect , it loads like a web page .
When you click on its web page what comes into your computer is a pile of JavaScript which then starts running and in some cases some XML that 's been stored .
But we 're going to change that probably .
That 's just running as a web page .
When we get into the notion of persistence in the Lively Kernel that 's up to whatever you happen to be writing in the Lively Kernel .
What we have in the Lively Kernel is a WebDAV file access protocol , so that if you have an account on a server somewhere , then you can store your world as a new web page and that then is like the image model .
We actually did the work so that we store XML for the existing graphics on the screen and there is a way to store also any definitions that you 've made that are beyond those that come with the Lively Kernel .
In that sense , once you start one of these pages , if you click on it , it comes up and you 're pretty much back where you were .
We use the web page as the persistence model that 's pretty much like the Smalltalk image .
It has the same nice features that you store it that way from a Windows computer and you load it that way on a Macintosh in a different browser and it's all the same " it still works .
That 's the benefit of working with we get that for free because of these various protocols that have been a part of the Internet standards for quite a while .
28 . How do you do graphics in the Lively Kernel ?
Do you use Canvas or SVG or what 's your current approach ?
The Kernel approach is the Morphic model that comes from Squeak essentially .
Squeak got it from the work done on Self by Randy Smith and John Maloney and Dave Ungar , I think worked on it , too .
That 's basically a model of a scene graph that is in the language itself , so it 's programmable and flexible .
The first version that we did of the Lively Kernel uses SVG .
SVG is scalable back to graphics and it's one of the world wide web graphic standards .
It 's was n't a perfect match for morphic because it presents its own scene graph and morphic has a scene graph model , so we actually had to do pairing between the components .
Pairing is also an invitation to complexity , but we dealt with that .
Then , about a year ago or so I did another version that would use just the Canvas protocol .
Just for people who do n't know about it , SVG is a retained graphics model .
In other words , it includes the model for graphic nodes and if you change one , it has all the logic built in that will repaint the screen .
Canvas is a graphic standard that just gives the screen as a canvas , like a bitmap , a pixmap and if you want to change something on the screen you have to take care on repainting the damaged area .
Morphic is ideally set up for dealing with that kind of updating .
It just took me a week to make a layer and make a change so that all the Lively Kernel would run on the Canvas model equally well .
The answer to your question " to come back to it " is that the Lively Kernel has there 2 versions : one runs on SVG and one runs on Canvas and they are pretty much identical .
29 .
Is there any difference in speed ?
The SVG will render somewhat faster because SVG code for rendering and for dealing with updating damaged areas is all native .
But what we 're finding is that Canvas code runs just as fast .
I think it 's actually going to run faster .
The reason being that the actual painting on the screen is still native in the Canvas version .
We do n't have to go through the pairing and updating of SVG nodes at all .
You would think that managing the damaged areas in JavaScript would slow it down , but the JavaScript engines are now getting fast enough that that 's not a problem .
30 .
Talking about speed , it strikes me that the Lively Kernel was quite courageous when you started it because it was before the Google V8 wathershed .
How did that feel back then ?
It was slow , but speed was n't the first figure of merit that I was after .
I wanted something that felt like a personal computer .
I felt like individual programmers were getting disenfranchised , because in the good old days any computer you bought came with BASIC and you just start it up and you could write a program and have it running in 5 minutes and all very simple .
It seemed to me that nowadays we had come supposedly so much further and you could n't do anything simply on the computer without getting something that had an inch of documentation that you had to read through and just know simple access .
The figurative merit that I was after with the Lively Kernel was something that would be simple to start up , simple to program , simple to play with and if it ran slowly , I did n't care .
The truth was it ran reasonably well .
SVG is performant graphics and even those slow JavaScripts were reasonably performant .
32 . Are you going to get an iPad and run Lively Kernel on it ?
Absolutely .
I say something more about the iPad and that kind of world , which is I think there is another role for the Lively Kernel , which has to do with simple authoring .
The fact that the Lively Kernel is just a web page and you click on it and you 're running this system , it 's a system that can do graphics editing , can produce images , can do simple programs , like Squeak that you can save a page from , means that basically anywhere you have a network computer , you can have authoring .
That 's one ingredient .
Another is I noticed that there is a certain challenge you have before you can become a developer for say the iPhone and yet the iPhone has Safari in it and it runs Lively Kernel applications just fine .
It seems to me there is an opportunity here for something much more open than the App Store in which everybody can contribute and produce and share active content .
HTC has let the ROM hacking community know , in no uncertain terms , that they mean business .
They have issued a C&D letter to one Android ROM hacker and distributor , Conflipper , who runs Shipped - ROMs .
HTC is alleging that Shipped - ROMs is in violation of rights by “ illegal copying of HTC ¡¦s original art work ” , and that this could be “ causing HTC irreparable harm ” .
Seriously ?
It seems to me that this site is doing little to no harm by simply providing end users with ROMs , but it ’s more likely that HTC ’s big issue is with their software being hosted in places that they do n’t approve .
However , considering HTC ’s fight with Apple over intellectual property rights , it ’s entirely possible that HTC is taking precautionary measures to keep their own property safe for themselves .
Either way , it looks like Conflipper has sent a request back to HTC , asking them exactly which ROMs they would like taken down , according to his Twitter page .
Read the full C&D below :
“ Dear Sir or Madam :
I write to you on behalf of HTC Corporation ( “ HTC ” ) , a Taiwanese company with a global business , who is the owner of certain intellectual property ( “ HTC ¡¦s Intellectual Property ” ) .
It is our understanding that you are responsible for the hosting of an internet webpage located at http://shipped-roms.com ( the “ Site¡¨ ) .
HTC has also recently learned that the Site contains software / ROM related to HTC ¡¦s Intellectual Property which entails illegal copying of HTC ¡¦s original art work .
We have very strong reasons to believe that the HTC Intellectual Property was illegally obtained by fraudulent means .
The subject dissemination and publication of HTC ¡¦s Intellectual Property is in clear violation of HTC ¡¦s legal rights and is an infringement of the HTC ¡¦s copyrights , goodwill , as well as the other intellectual rights .
The continuing distribution of HTC ¡¦s Intellectual Property without authorization has constituted a serious criminal offence under the Copyright Act in the U.S. and the EU and other countries where similar laws are enforced .
As you would expect , HTC is the owner and the use of the copyrighted work described above has not been authorized by the owner .
By publishing and displaying the Intellectual Property on the Site , you , as the publisher , along with the information source are infringing HTC ¡¦s Intellectual Property rights , including but not limited to causing HTC irreparable harm .
For the above reasons , HTC requests that you immediately remove the Intellectual Property from the Site or of all infringing works derived from the Intellectual Property .
You shall desist from this or any other infringement of HTC ¡¦s rights in the future .
The above information is true and correct .
If we have not received an affirmative response from you within two weeks indicating that you have fully complied with these requirements , we shall take further legal action , and pursue all means necessary to protect HTC ¡¦s legal and equitable rights .
HTC reserves all its rights against you , including legal and equitable remedies . ”
What do you think ?
Should HTC be taking these legal routes to keep their “ art work ” under thumb , or should they be focusing on other things ?

The new season of Weeds premieres on August 16th .
Here is a short teaser to keep you going until then .
Video after the break .
EDIT : Video has been removed , sorry .
NETHERLANDS 2-0 DENMARK , Johannesburg , 14/06/10
Agger ( OG ) 46 , Kuyt 85
Two second - half goals , one of them an own goal , were enough for the Netherlands to retain the UFWC title and start their World Cup campaign with a victory .
The first half was one of very few good chances , with both teams mostly restricted to long - range efforts as they failed to break through the defence in the final third of the pitch .
However it was Denmark who had the two best chances of the half .
In the 27th minute a cross from Rommedahl found the head of Bendtner , who headed the ball just wide .
Then in the 37th minute Kahlenberg broke into the box from the left and aimed a decent shot for the top corner but Dutch goalkeeper Stekelenburg was equal to it as he palmed it out of play .
Luckily for Dutch fans the second half started off much better , with a goal only 36 seconds after the restart .
Robin Van Persie broke forward straight away and crossed the ball into the box .
The ball found the head of Dane defender Simon Poulsen , who accidentally headed the ball backwards , and deflected off Agger into the net .
The goal seemed to knock Denmark off their feet , as they failed to make any decent chances for the rest of the match .
Van Persie could have got a goal himself six minutes later , but his feet failed him as the ball went harmlessly wide .
The game went into another period of relative calm after this , before the introduction of Eljero Elia for the Netherlands , as he burst forward splitting the defence open on several occasions , making it seem inevitable that the Dutch would score again .
And indeed they would , with Elia unlucky to not be the scorer .
A through - ball from Sneijder set Elia one - on - one with Dane ‘ keeper Sorensen .
He succeeded in hitting the ball past the keeper but failed to score as his shot hit the post .
But it all worked out as Kuyt had followed through after the shot , as he slotted the ball into an empty net .
It was n’t all bad news for Denmark as Poulsen gained a measure of redemption by clearing the ball off the line after Afellay headed the ball past Sorensen .

Guessing subreddits with the Prediction API
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , app - engine , prediction - api , google - storage
Edit : Now with a live demo !
I 've written before about the new BigQuery and Prediction APIs , and promised to demonstrate them .
Let 's take a look at the Prediction API first .
The Prediction API , as I 've explained , does a restricted form of machine learning , as a web service .
Currently , it supports categorizing textual and numeric data into a preset list of categories .
The example given in the talk - language detection - is a good one , but I wanted to come up with something new .
A few ideas presented themselves :
Training on movie / book reviews to try and predict the score given based on the text Training on product descriptions to try and predict their rating Training on Reddit submissions to try and predict the subreddit a new submission belongs in
All three have promise , but the first could suffer from the fact that the prediction API as it currently stands does n't understand a relationship between categories - it would have no way to know that the ' 5 star ' rating tag is ' closer to ' the ' 4 star ' one than the ' 1 star ' tag .
The second seems very ambitious , and it's not clear there 's enough information to do that .
The third one , though , seemed just right .
With that in mind , I started collecting data on reddit submissions .
Using the API , I collected every submission to reddit between 2010-06-02 13:39:31 UTC and 2010-06-09 23:11:34 , using this simple script :
import logging import time import urllib2 import simplejson REDDIT_URL = ' http://www.reddit.com/r/all/new/.json' class RedditProcessor( object ) : def __init__ ( self , outfile ) : self.seen = set ( ) self.
outfile = outfile self.interval = 120 def run( self ) : self.init ( ) while True : data = self.get_reddit_data( ) if data : self.process_reddit_data(data ) time.sleep(self.interval ) def init ( self ) : fh = open( self.outfile , 'r ' ) self.seen.update(simplejson.loads(x ) [ ' id ' ] for x in fh ) fh.close ( ) logging .info(" Read %d IDs " , len( self.seen ) ) self .
writer = open ( self.outfile , 'a ' ) def get_reddit_data ( self ) : try : request = urllib2.urlopen(REDDIT_URL ) return simplejson.loads(request.read ( ) ) except urllib2.URLError , e : logging .exception ( " Request failed " ) return None def process_reddit_data ( self , data ) : if ' data ' not in data or ' children ' not in data [ ' data ' ] : logging .
warn ( " Data does not contain expected keys : %r " , data ) return try : num_written = 0 for entry in data [ ' data ' ] [ ' children ' ] : entry_data = entry [ ' data ' ] if entry_data [ ' id ' ] not in self .
seen : simplejson.dump(entry_data , self.writer ) self.writer.write ( '
') num_written += 1 self.seen.add( entry_data[ 'id ' ] ) logging .
info( " Wrote %d new entries " , num_written ) except Exception , e : logging .exception ( " Error processing entries " ) def main ( ) : logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG ) processor = RedditProcessor ( " reddit_dump.json " ) processor.run ( ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : main ( )
In total , I collected a little over 75 MB of JSON - encoded data , comprising 72,986 submissions .
I then determined the 20 subreddits with the most submissions over that time , and generated a training dataset from just the submissions to those subreddits .
This subset made up 42,753 submissions , or about 58 % of the original .
Submissions were randomly split into either the training set ( 98 % ) or the validation set ( 2 % ) :
import csv import random import simplejson fh = open ( ' reddit_dump.json ' , 'r ' ) subreddits = {} for line in fh : data = simplejson.loads ( line ) subreddits [ data [ ' subreddit ' ] ] = subreddits.get ( data [ ' subreddit ' ] , 0 ) + 1 top20 = sorted ( subreddits.items ( ) , key=lambda x :x [ 1 ] , reverse= True ) [ : 20 ] print top20 top20_set = set ( x [ 0 ] for x in top20 ) fh = open ( ' reddit_dump.json ' , 'r ' ) training = csv.writer(open ('reddit_training.csv' , 'w ' ) ) validation = csv.writer(open ('reddit_validation.csv' , 'w ' ) ) for line in fh : data = simplejson.loads ( line ) if data [ ' subreddit ' ] not in top20_set : continue row = ( data [ ' subreddit ' ] . encode ( ' utf - 8 ' ) , data [ ' title ' ] . encode ( ' utf - 8 ' ) , data [ ' domain ' ] . encode ( 'utf - 8 ' ) ) if random.random ( ) >= 0.98 : validation.writerow(row ) else : training.writerow(row )
The top 20 reddits , incidentally , are :
Reddit Submissions reddit.com 14578 pics 4157 AskReddit 3375 reportthespammers 3258 politics 3162 funny 2176 WTF
1773 gaming 1367 worldnews 938 videos 849 atheism 834 Music 833 technology 732 trees 703 comics 639 nsfw 611 circlejerk 600 news 567 environment 537 DoesAnybodyElse 537
Next , I uploaded the new dataset to the Google Storage service , using the ' gsutil ' tool , and followed the getting started instructions for the Prediction API to start it training on my model :
$ curl -X POST - H " Content - Type: application / json " -d " { \" data\ " : {}} " - H " Authorization : GoogleLogin auth=$ XAPI_AUTH
" https://www.googleapis.com/prediction/v1/training?data=reddit-dump%24reddit_training.csv { " data " : {" data " : " reddit-dump$reddit_training.csv" }} $ curl - H " Authorization : GoogleLogin auth=$ XAPI_AUTH
" https://www.googleapis.com/prediction/v1/training/reddit-dump%2freddit_training.csv { " data " : {" data " : " reddit-dump/reddit_training.csv " , " modelinfo " : " Training has not completed .
"
}}
Once training completed , we can see the Prediction API 's own estimate of accuracy :
$ curl - H " Authorization : GoogleLogin auth=$ XAPI_AUTH
" https://www.googleapis.com/prediction/v1/training/reddit-dump%2freddit_training_2.csv { " data " : {" data " : " reddit-dump/reddit_training_2.csv " , " modelinfo " : " estimated accuracy : 0.61" }}
That 's not bad , though perhaps not as stellar as we might have hoped .
For perspective , if we simply picked the most popular category ( reddit.com ) every time , we 'd only get it right about 34 % of the time .
Let 's run our own test with the data we set aside for validation , though , and see how it goes .
Here 's our test script :
import csv import logging import simplejson import sys import urllib import urllib2 def predict ( target , auth , text ) : request_data = { ' data ' : { ' input ' : { ' text ' : text , } } } request = urllib2.
Request ( ' https://www.googleapis.com/prediction/v1/training/%s/predict' % target , data=simplejson.dumps(request_data ) , headers={ " Authorization " : " GoogleLogin auth= %s " % auth , " Content - Type " : " application / json " , } ) response = urllib2.urlopen( request ) response_data = simplejson.load( response ) return response_data [ ' data ' ] [ ' output ' ] [ ' output_label ' ] def main ( args ) : infile , auth , target = args [ 1:4 ] reader = csv.reader ( open ( infile ) ) count = 0 correct = 0 for tag , text , domain in reader : count += 1 retries = 0 while retries < 10 : try : result = predict ( target , auth , [ text.strip ( '\r
\
' ) , domain ] ) break except urllib2.HTTPError , e : retries += 1 if result == tag : correct += 1 else : print ( " Incorrectly predicted %r ( %s ) as %s ( should be %s ) " % ( text , domain , result , tag ) ) print " %d of %d predicted correctly . " % ( correct , count ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : main( sys.argv )
And the output ...
$ python training_check .py reddit_validation.csv $ XAPI_AUTH reddit-dump%2freddit_training_2.csv ... 484 of 857 predicted correctly .
56 % - not far off the system 's own estimate .
Let 's take a look at some of the failures to predict , though :
Incorrectly predicted ' Small Businesses Still Worried About Reform Bill ' ( nytimes.com ) as politics ( should be reddit.com )
Incorrectly predicted ' Seriously Reddit ? ' ( imgur.com ) as pics ( should be reddit.com )

Incorrectly predicted ' 15 Million Unemployed and 41,000 non census jobs created last month . ' ( cnbc.com ) as politics ( should be reddit.com )
Incorrectly predicted ' EU ruling prompts calls for overhaul of gambling laws ' ( telegraph.co.uk ) as worldnews ( should be reddit.com )
Incorrectly predicted ' I woke up this morning to find my car had been towed out of my driveway [ pic ] ' ( imgur.com ) as pics ( should be reddit.com )
Incorrectly predicted ' Old White Guy Late Night Talk Show ' ( buzzfeed.com ) as funny ( should be reddit.com )
Hm .
There 's an awful lot that look correct , but were actually posted to reddit.com .
The reverse is true , too :
Incorrectly predicted ' Coulomb Details Huge Electric Car Charging Infrastructure Plans ' ( earthtechling.com ) as reddit.com ( should be technology )
Incorrectly predicted ' AT&T Announces Tethering Support For iPhone 4G / HD ; Updates Data Plans ' ( mygadgetnews.com ) as reddit.com ( should be technology )
Incorrectly predicted '" And those are the facts " Same faulty arguments from all theists . ' ( youtube.com ) as reddit.com ( should be atheism )
Incorrectly predicted ' For VPS users !

Incorrectly predicted ' \xe2\x80\x9 cIsraeli commandos had paintball guns\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Israeli Ambassador ' ( rt.com ) as reddit.com ( should be worldnews )
Incorrectly predicted ' Cool , Rayguns ! ' ( cnn.com ) as reddit.com ( should be technology )
Incorrectly predicted ' India vows to sabotage ACTA . ' ( arstechnica.com ) as reddit.com ( should be technology )
Incorrectly predicted ' Spy on my dog ! ' ( ustream.tv ) as reddit.com ( should be funny )
Incorrectly predicted ' California poised to OK supertoxic pesticide ' ( sfgate.com ) as reddit.com ( should be environment )
Incorrectly predicted ' Voters of Reykjavik know where their towels are ' ( news.bbc.co.uk ) as reddit.com ( should be WTF )
And , of course , there 's ordinary errors too :
Incorrectly predicted " WHAT'S UPPPPPPPP ? " ( i.imgur.com ) as pics ( should be funny )
Incorrectly predicted ' Google Chrome extensions the new facebook apps when it comes to privacy ? ' ( imgur.com ) as technology ( should be pics )
Incorrectly predicted ' DAE actually understand the words to the songs " Smells Like Teen Spirit " or " Song 2 " ?' ( self.DoesAnybodyElse ) as politics ( should be DoesAnybodyElse ) Incorrectly predicted ' BP May Sell Prudhoe Bay Stake as Spill Costs Mount ' ( bloomberg.com ) as politics ( should be news )
Incorrectly predicted ' Bananas are pervert ' ( i.imgur.com ) as pics ( should be funny ) Incorrectly predicted ' New BP Logo ... anyone else ? ' ( imgur.com ) as pics ( should be environment )
Incorrectly predicted ' Petition for Net Neutrality - 74 Democrats sold you out to AT&T , Verizon and Comcast ' ( self.technology ) as politics ( should be technology )
Incorrectly predicted ' Neighborhood Watch ' ( i.imgur.com ) as pics ( should be funny )
Incorrectly predicted 'U MAY BE A GEEK IF ...' ( streetwalkermag.ca ) as funny ( should be technology )
Incorrectly predicted ' Ron Paul says criticism of Obama on oil spill is wrong ' ( content.usatoday.com ) as news ( should be politics )
Incorrectly predicted ' Watching CNN and the cap appears to be in place over the well ' ( self.worldnews ) as gaming ( should be worldnews )
Based on this , it looks to me like we can talk about three distinct types of categorization errors :
reddit.com vs other subreddit posts .
This occurs because the reddit.com subreddit gets an amazingly diverse set of submissions , and does n't really have its own ' type ' of posts like most of the other subreddits to .
Ambiguous categorization .
Many pics are also funny , and a lot of news is also politics .
In some cases , you could even argue that the submitter got it wrong , and the learning API got it right !
Ordinary , legitimate errors .
The last one above is a good example of that .
There 's not much we can do about category 3 , and it 's debatable that anything needs to be done about category 2 , but let 's see what we can do about category 1 by excluding the reddit.com subreddit from consideration , and concentrating on everything else :
$ curl -X POST - H " Content - Type:application / json " - H " Authorization : GoogleLogin auth=$XAPI_AUTH " -d " {data : {}} " https://www.googleapis.com/prediction/v1/training?data=reddit-dump%2freddit_training_nodotcom.csv ... $ curl - H " Authorization : GoogleLogin auth=$ XAPI_AUTH
" https://www.googleapis.com/prediction/v1/training/reddit-dump%2freddit_training_nodotcom.csv { " data " : {" data " : " reddit-dump/reddit_training_nodotcom.csv " , " modelinfo " : " estimated accuracy : 0.63 " }} $ python training_check .py reddit_validation_nodotcom.csv $ XAPI_AUTH reddit-dump%2freddit_training_nodotcom.csv ... 375 of 581 predicted correctly .
The API has modestly increased its estimate to 63 % accuracy ; our test supports that with a more significant increase to 64 % ( from 56 % ) .
Of the remaining miscategorizations , most fall into category 2 - here 's the last 10 miscategorized results , unedited - judge for yourself :
Incorrectly predicted " As rumours swell that the government staged 7/7 , victims ' relatives call for a proper inquiry " ( dailymail.co.uk ) as funny ( should be news )
Incorrectly predicted ' Wow . ' ( pici.se ) as WTF ( should be nsfw ) Incorrectly predicted ' Gabe : What if Coruscant had a newspaper ?
What would their stupid political cartoons look like ? ' ( penny-arcade.com ) as funny ( should be comics )
Incorrectly predicted " Abramoff released from Md. prison to halfway house .
Can we have a pool to see how long before he 's back at work with the Republicans ? " ( google.com ) as worldnews ( should be politics )
Incorrectly predicted " Lady Gaga ' Alejandro ' music video released - Very , very sexy .
Potentially [ NSFW ] . " ( newsfeed.time.com ) as funny ( should be WTF ) Incorrectly predicted ' Official Decree - Take Notice . ' ( farm2.static.flickr.com ) as science ( should be funny ) Incorrectly predicted ' Philosophy of Ghost In the Shell ' ( video.google.com ) as WTF ( should be funny )
Incorrectly predicted ' Taco Bell Petitions National Reserve To Circulate More $ 2 Bills ' ( knucklesunited.com ) as politics ( should be WTF )
Incorrectly predicted ' Seriously , how is Japan not fat from eating this ?!' ( i.imgur.com ) as pics ( should be WTF )
Incorrectly predicted ' Cuba declines UN mission related to torture ' ( wireupdate.com ) as politics ( should be worldnews )
In conclusion , even for more subjective categorization tasks like this , and with a fairly large number of categories ( 20 ) , thus increasing the number of possible ways to be wrong , the Prediction API performs fairly well , with most of the errors being ones humans would plausibly make as well .
Determining the actual error rate - by going through the errors and categorizing them based on legitimacy - would be an interesting task .
If there 's interest , I may put up an App Engine app that allows you to query for Reddit predictions yourself - but right now , this blog post is already 2 days late , so it 'll have to wait .

The Roman philosopher Seneca may have put it best 2,000 years ago : " To be everywhere is to be nowhere . "
Today , the Internet grants us easy access to unprecedented amounts of information .
But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the Net , with its constant distractions and interruptions , is also turning us into scattered and superficial thinkers .
The picture emerging from the research is deeply troubling , at least to anyone who values the depth , rather than just the velocity , of human thought .
People who read ...
The swallowtail butterfly has exceptionally large wings relative to its body mass , a feature that makes its in - flight movements unique .
This scale model , which copies the shape of the swallowtail 's wings and the thin veins and membranes that cover them , reveals that the insect achieves forward motion with simple flapping movements .
Other butterflies have different flight characteristics .
The mechanical butterfly was built by Hiroto Tanaka and Isao Shimoyama at the University of Tokyo and is reported in the journal Bioinspiration and Biomimetics .

On May 1st , I put several men to shame in a College Times eating contest and a personal tribute to Adam Richman .
I went down to Lobby ’s Beef Burgers & Dogs in Tempe , AZ to take on their 3lb .
Burger Challenge–
A massive tower of burger that needed to be taken down in less than 10 minutes !
I ’ve done burger challenges in the past .
I ’m well known around Lindy ’s on 4th in Tucson , AZ for conquering their OMFG burger , which is 3lbs of progressively less delicious eating experience .
( once you hit the 8th patty , you do n’t exactly crave the taste of hamburger meat . )
But their burger is different in 2 ways .
(1) It ’s twelve 1/4 lb patties and 12 slices of cheese .
( The Lobby ’s burger is nine 1/3 lb patties and 9 slices of cheese )
Difficulty advantage : Lindy’s .
(2) You have 20 minutes to finish in order to get a free burger .
( Lobby ’s burger is 10 mins )
Difficulty advantage : Lobby ’s — by a long shot .
I ’ve eaten the Lindy ’s OMFG burger 3 times .
I finished it all 3 times , but only beat the time limit during my second and third attempts .
Why the third attempt ?
Because I wanted to try it “ Two Finger Peek - a - Boo ” style .. which is to say …
.
.
* Instead of buns , each “ bun ” is an entire grilled cheese sandwich .
.
.
* Between each patty is not only a slice of cheese , but also an onion ring .
.
.
* Also featured , grilled onions and mushrooms .
.
.
So I guess you can say I ’m not exactly a stranger to burger eating challenges .
I pride myself on doing the seemingly impossible .
I learned my strategy after my first attempt , and it ’s made my life a lot easier .
But for the Lobby ’s challenge , I was nervous .
10 fucking minutes ?!
My record for Lindy ’s was 17 and change .
10 did n’t even really seem possible .
.. which is why I had to try it .
So here ’s the scene .
On May 1st , College Times had their challenge , and they wanted to make it exciting .
Three of us sat behind a table with our burger towers before us .
.
.
My competitors : two decent sized guys who looked like they could each take down a small goat .
.
And then there ’s me .
The girl .
The small girl at that .
It ’s no wonder they scoffed at the strategies I shared with them .
Ok , so not literally .
They politely listened .. but they did not heed .
.
.
With our burgers before us , I suggested waiting a few extra minutes before starting the challenge .
You see , these burgers are steaming .
These gases will fill up your stomach and make you hate life .
A 3 lb burger fills you up .
You do n’t have much more room for anything else .
Also , these burgers are steaming !
They ’re hot .
Tongue - damaging hot .
Fuckin’ hot .
Have you ever eaten anything that burned your tongue ?
Now imagine shoveling that down bite after scalding bite as the roof of your mouth falls apart and your taste buds singe clean off .
Now imagine three pounds worth of that .
You see where I ’m going with this .
So after my third warning , they say , “ Ok , we ’re ready to start , let ’s just start . ”
I shrugged and said , “ Alright , bring it on . ”
We began .
I opened my patties up to let them cool off a bit .
I took some bites .
WOAH .
Hot .
Worse than I expected .
To put this in perspective , for two days following , eating was excruciating .
The roof of my mouth was destroyed .
It felt like everything was made of knives and glass .
But I digress .
The burger was retardedly hot , so I did what any normal , sane person would do .
I reached in my soda cup , grabbed a handful of ice , and threw it on my field of burgers .
..
And I kept eating .
.
.
I was taking on this challenge with pure , unadulterated focus .
I had a clock to beat and a reputation to uphold .
The burger was doomed from the start .
.
.
A few minutes in , I decided to check out my fellow competitors .
The towers before them did not bode well for their chances .
So what can pure determination and a pact with the devil get you in this day and age ?
Bragging rights and a permanent place on the wall of fame .
… where my time beats all !
6 Minutes .
I ’ll let that sink in .
I ate 3 lbs of burger .. in 6 minutes .
This , of course , left me 4 additional minutes of supporting my fellow competitors .
… through torturous in - your - face , who ’s - your - daddy style mockery .
Yes , caption , victory IS sweet .
Low volume settings should be avoided at all costs for a song like Amp Live ’s latest single , “ Turn It Up . ”
With the new song , the producer , best known for his work as one half of the hip - hop duo Zion I , is preparing fans for the release of his album , Murder At The DiscoTech , while simultaneously announcing a new release date for the project , now scheduled for a June 15th release through Om Records .
The single kicks off , appropriately , with an electronic voice commanding the listener to turn up the volume before a deep bass beat emerges joined by the vocal stylings of guest MC , Mickey Factz , well known for his own forays into electro - inspired , club - oriented hip - hop and also a past collaborator with Amp through work with Zion I and their recent Search And Seizure mixtape .
A long - time pro of melding various genres into hip - hop , Amp ’s expertise is on full display with this new single :
The tracks deep bass , resonating synthesizer lines , and highly addictive drums make the single perfect for the nearest set of bass - booming speakers a listener can get their hands on .
Upon completion , selecting the song to serve as a single from the album was a no - brainer .
“ It was definitely super solid beat banger that I set out to make , ” says Amp of the final product .
“ I was wanting to do a song with Mickey Factz for a while , and everything came together perfectly for this song . ”
British Petroleum set off an unprecedented ecological disaster , bungled it and then their commander appeared on TV to exposit exactly what it is they 're doing : that 's not an industrial accident , that 's a COBRA scheme running backwards and escaped into the real world .
At least Cobra Commander could read his To Do list the right way up .
We could have done with that warning .
It 's an ecological apocalypse , an economic horror story , a PR - mageddon , and it could n't be better timed .
America has n't really won a war in over 40 years * ,
Lost just ended and the only sport on TV is something called " soccer . "
If the U.S. plays this right it could be the best natural accident since Adam fell on top of Eve and decided to try jiggling .
Because if America invades BP it'll be the most popular war since the original Star ones .
* They do n't count as a win if you have to go back for a do - over .

NEW ORLEANS –
The BP oil explosion offshore has already snuffed out the lives of workers and threatened the economic survival of at least 200,000 residents in this state alone .
The oil spill , scientists here warn , could also transform one of the nation ’s most ecologically valuable areas forever .
As expected , tar balls and oiled seaweed are beginning to wash up on beaches here , as they have after other big oil spills .
But scientists say the environmental disaster unfolding is dramatically different from anything the nation has yet experienced .
The oil spreading across the Gulf , much faster than many previously believed , is the first major spill in U.S. waters whose worst effects may largely be hidden under water .
BP has been trying to take credit for slowing the movement of oil and tar balls toward the coast , saying that the chemical dispersants the company uses are doing their job .
But Ronald Kendall , a professor at Texas Tech University who has done extensive research on the effects of oil in various ecosystems , said , “ To me , it ’s a disaster already .
It does n’t have to go up on the beach . ”
Kendall said the spill ’s effects on deep sea life might not be fully understood for years and that what is happening in the Gulf is a “ massive experiment ” in how to poison an entire ecosystem .
Because of the leak ’s extreme depth , and the use of 500,000 gallons of dispersants , the idea that oil floats no longer holds , environmental scientists here say .
Contrary to BP ’s claims that the dispersants are saving the coastline , the oil is settling on sensitive corals and poisoning ecosystems that produce shrimp , snapper and many other types of fish – all in places that are too deep for humans to intervene in a helpful fashion , scientists say .
Several scientists in the immediate area are concerned that far too little is really known about the spill .
They note that oil on the surface can be spotted by planes and satellite images but there is little equipment telling where oil has traveled below the surface .
“ By dispersing the oil at depths , you create smaller globules of oil and it makes the oil more likely to be affected by even the slow moving currents , ” said James Cowan , a professor of oceanography at Louisiana State University .
“ We just do n’t know where it is , and we do n’t know where it is going . ”
Environmentalists worry the oil could be reaching coral formations on the Gulf floor which support major fish populations or that the oil could be absorbed or eaten by small animals or plants at the base of the Gulf food chain .
The toxins would then accumulate in larger animals , possibly killing them or destroying their ability to reproduce .
Prosanta Chakrabarty , an assistant professor at LSU and expert on fish and marine life , said , “ People think of oiled birds and animals and things like that and overlook the effects of the BP oil spill in the deep sea .
There will be effects .
This is where the oil is coming from . ”
“ When the Exxon Valdez spilled , it was at the surface , and it stayed at the surface , ” Chakrabarty said .
“ This is totally different .
A lot of oil is coming up , but some of it is at different levels . ”
He said that oil is spreading both at the surface and at levels well below .
He said that the 2,000 species that live in the deep sea environment are facing two major assaults that they , unlike life forms near or on the surface , have n’t had to face before – the massive oil leak itself and the chemical dispersants with which they are being bombarded .
In the area ’s marshes , there is another world even less visible to the human eye that is also at risk .
Its fate is particularly important because the entire marsh ecosystem depends on the survival of the microscopic creatures that live in a slim top layer of marsh mud .
“ The top 2 millimeters of that marsh muck is where the action is in a coastal estuary , ” said Kevin Carman , dean of the College of Basic Sciences at LSU .
“ That ’s the base , the food that fuels the whole system .
If you lose that in a large enough area it could have a disproportionate impact on the food web , and everything that depends on it – fish , shrimp , oysters , all the species that rely on the estuary . ”
Carman describes the slimy zone that is just seven - hundredths of an inch thick as “ an incredible engine for a wide range of life . ”
The larger animals , including birds , wild hogs and even humans are part of the chain , environmentalistsnote .
For ages , that thin zone of microscopic life has survived all the hits nature delivers , from hurricanes to freezes .
The worry now is how well it will cope with a giant oil spill washing ashore .

An extraordinary thing happened last weekend .
The world 's most secretive strategy group , Bilderberg , poked its nose out of the shadows and launched its own website : bilderbergmeetings.org .
For an organisation that prefers to cordon the press a mile from its meetings , whose press relations policy to date has been to arrest , harass and search journalists , this was an astonishing turnaround .
Until now , David Rockefeller 's policy forum carried on quietly out of sight .
It welcomed politicians ( David Cameron in 2008 , George Osborne 2006 - 2009 ) to strategise in secret with corporate heads , European royalty and bank bosses .
This year saw Google CEO Eric Schmidt take part alongside Robert Zoellick ( president of the World Bank ) , Bill Gates and the usual sprinkle of EU commissioners and Goldman Sachs heavyweights .
If you did n't know it was going on , that 's understandable .
It 's what they wanted .
This year , in the Spanish seaside town of Sitges , the sheer weight of attention on Bilderberg became too much for its policy of " ignorance management " .
TV crews at the police line , bloggers blogging , the Spanish press asking questions about cost , the Canadian press wondering at this year 's unusual glut of Canucks – finally , the mainstream press was taking notice .
I found myself taking part in a debate on the BBC World Service .
I knew something had changed when Kate Adie spoke passionately of her concerns about the armed secrecy of Bilderberg .
This secrecy in action is quite a sight .
For four whole days , a normally tranquil hotel on the Spanish coast was transformed into the Pentagon : riot police , police helicopters , military divers moored offshore , and hundreds of plain clothes officers – a mammoth € 10 m campaign of press exclusion for a " private meeting " , all paid for by the already hard - pressed Spanish taxpayer .
Spain was an odd choice of location for Bilderberg 2010 .
One of the organisers , who sits alongside Kenneth Clarke on the core steering committee ( which should be considered the " real " Bilderberg ) , is Henry Kissinger – still wanted for questioning in Spain over war crimes .
Seems the police were pointing their machine guns in the wrong direction .
Still , never mind the guns : this year all the furious secrecy and bonkers policing did n't stop the story breaking .
The bizarre atmosphere of confusion , paranoia and misapprehension – a direct result of Bilderberg 's half - century history of press suppression , of delegates crouching on limo floors , or lying to their parliaments that they 've attended ( I 'm talking to you , Tony Blair ) – is finally lifting .
On the Bilderberg website , they 've just changed one of their tabs from " meeting " to " press release " .
It 's hilarious .
Less hilarious is the damage - control strategy that is kicking into place .
No longer able to deny its existence , Bilderberg has shifted gear : the story they 're putting out now is that " nothing goes on " , " just some old chaps having a chinwag " – old , insignificant chaps like José Zapatero ( the Spanish PM ) , Peter Voser ( CEO of Royal Dutch Shell ) , Paul Volcker ( chairman of Obama 's economic advisory board ) , Richard Holbrooke ( Obama 's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan ) , Josef Ackermann ( CEO of Deutsche Bank ) .
Have a look online at our Bilderberg 2010 " Power Gallery " for more " golfing buddies " .
Have a look at the piece by Bush speechwriter and Bilderberg attendee David Frum , on the website of the National Post – a Canadian newspaper , set up by Conrad Black ( pre-incarceration Bilderberg attendee ) .
Just read it , and see what you think .
This all looks like Bilderberg trying to " manage the story " .
It 's a bit clunky , because they 're not very good at it ; they 've not had much practice yet .
I 'm sure we 'll see more examples of this " hang - out for has - beens " story in the media .
But I 'm also hopeful that this disinformation will melt away under scrutiny , just as the world 's ignorance of Bilderberg 's very existence has finally withered and died .

It referred to the Bush speechwriter and Bilderberg attendee Robert Frum .

I had the amazing chance to enter a Boeing B - 52 Stratofortress and see it from inside .
This very plane was built in 1961 and is still on active duty , at least till 2020 .
It seems like nothing was modernized since then as you can see on the photos below .
Climbing through the cramped inside and sitting in the cockpit was quite a surreal experience .
Big thanks to the crew !

You know how some things haunt your dreams , how they rattle around your brain - parts without rhyme or reason , how they scratch scars of hideous terror into your soul without you having the simple comfort of ever knowing why ?
For instance :
My mom is petrified of snakes , to the point that she once made an usher tell her when to leave during Last Crusade .
I have a buddy with an irrational fear of ketchup — like , you can chase him around the room with it and he ’ll squeal and start sweating .
It ’s probably the best party trick ever .
I , of course , can make fun of these people because I ’m merely terrified of “ Gene Wilder in a kids ’ movie .
But I would argue that , unlike my equally potent problems with clowns and the Incredible Hulk , this is not some shapeless misty fear that I cannot place or control ; rather , I attribute it directly to the original version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory , which science has proven is the third - oddest brain - scrambling creepshow masquerading as a childrens ’ movie ever , right behind A Left Behind Thanksgiving and those 1980s TV movies that starred the Ewoks and Wilford Brimley , and were , until The Phantom Menace , the worst Star Wars productions ever .
Thanks to R. Kelly , the original Wonka is only the second - creepiest thing to bear the title Chocolate Factory now , but still , that this film and its rather lax approach to child welfare was ever filed in a family section is a shocking failure of oversight on the part of parents , Hollywood , the federal government and BP , somehow , I ’m pretty sure .
Try describing the plot of Wonka to anyone and not sound like you ’re revving up to say the words “ human centipede ” : “ So there ’s this out - of - control boat ride through an acid - trip tunnel of hideous terror .
There ’s the beheading of a chicken , televised on a giant screen .
One kid nearly drowns in chocolate , before he ’s expunged through a massive candy cannon and never seen again , and another child is going to be disfigured into a spherical blueberry shape .
And this will all be the work of a tremblingly giggly reclusive man-child who is completely unprepared for life with other humans , who issues magical candy from his windowless castle walls and who has granted himself Christ - like empowerment in the ability to deliver Dante - esque divine punishment to youthful sinners .
Also he runs a sweatshop with orange people .
Who wants apple juice ? ”
Short version :
It is basically Seven , with a good deal more caramel .
As the owner of a 6 - year - old who acts as though his circulatory system will fully shut down unless it ’s fed regular viewings of old Tom and Jerry episodes , I am certainly aware that kids ’ movies and TV shows are , and have always have been , deeply , deeply weird , fraught with terrible things like patricide and missing parents and forest - house torture and clowns and the gerbils from G - Force who sing Black Eyed Peas songs .
And yet , having scared the bejeezus out of me at age 6 , Wonka remains the only that is fully off - limits in my house , where we stick to things that are funny and safe , like ducks and rabbits , who hilariously blast each other in the face , with shotguns .

On his radio show today , Glenn Beck came up with a solution to the Gulf oil spill .
He thinks that Sarah Palin should use her oil industry expertise hold an oil spill summit where she and her team would come up with ideas fix the leak .
Beck said that Palin has , “ the connections and the knowledge to put a team together and say Mr. President , this is what we do . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Beck said , “ If I were Sarah Palin , and I ’m not …I would be down in the Gulf and I would be meeting with the heads of Shell and the heads of Exxon .
I would be meeting with all of them , and I would be meeting with all of the engineers .
I would be having my own summit down there , and I would develop policy , and say this is what we need to do .
Sarah has the weight behind her .
She understands the oil industry .
She can get these people together , and she can get the engineers together , because her husband is an oil rigger .
They have the connections and the knowledge to put a team together and say Mr. President , this is what we do . ”
Beck ’s claim is based on the myth that Sarah Palin is a well connected oil expert , but as she has proven time and time again , she knows nothing about the oil industry .
Recently , when she was on Fox News ’
The O’Reilly Factor , Bill O’Reilly asked her for a solution , and she said we should call the Dutch , because they are good at fixing leaks .
In the same interview she stressed her believe that oil drilled for in the US could be outsourced .
Palin ’s oil expertise also led her to tell Gulf residents to pray for a solution .
Sarah Palin has two areas of expertise as it relates to the oil industry .
The first is the ability to impose socialistic taxes , like her windfall tax when she was governor , in order to redistribute wealth , and send the oil companies fleeing out of Alaska .
The second area is her uncanny ability to take the oil industry ’s money .
Speaking of Todd Palin , he was so much more than a rigger for BP .
Released emails reveal that while an employee of BP , he was , “ involved in a judicial appointment , monitored contract negotiations with public employee unions , received background checks on a corporate CEO , added his approval or disapproval to state board appointments and passed financial information marked “ confidential ” from his oil company employer to a state attorney . ”
It would appear that from the information released , Todd Palin was eyeballs deep in a conflict of interest , “ The 243 still - secret e-mails between Todd Palin and senior officials reach into countless areas of state government and politics : potential board appointees , constituent complaints , use of the state jet , oil and gas production , marine regulation , gas pipeline bids , postsecondary education , wildfires , native Alaskan issues , the state effort to save the Matanuska Maid dairy , budget planning , potential budget vetoes , oil shale leasing … ”
Why is that Hillary Clinton was criticized in 2008 when she claimed that she had executive branch experience because she was First Lady , but Sarah Palin gets called an oil expert by the Right because her husband worked for BP ?
To answer Beck ’s question , Sarah Palin wo n’t hold an oil spill summit , because she has no expertise or solutions to offer .
Her expertise is a political myth that was designed by the McCain campaign to sell Palin as his running mate in 2008 .
Outside of her media fame Palin has no real power , because former half term governors do n’t have the sway needed in order to operate as a shadow president , as Beck suggests .
Most importantly , unless the oil summit was going to pay her to show up , Sarah Palin will have no interest , as she has shown time again that her true and sole motivation is the almighty dollar .

BATAVIA , Illinois - Scientists of the MINOS experiment at the Department of Energy ’s Fermi National Accelerator laboratory today ( June 14 ) announced the world ’s most precise measurement to date of the parameters that govern antineutrino oscillations , the back - and - forth transformations of antineutrinos from one type to another .
This result provides information about the difference in mass between different antineutrino types .
The measurement showed an unexpected variance in the values for neutrinos and antineutrinos .
This mass difference parameter , called Δm2 ( “ delta m squared ” ) , is smaller by approximately 40 percent for neutrinos than for antineutrinos .
However , there is a still a five percent probability that Δm2 is actually the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos .
With such a level of uncertainty , MINOS physicists need more data and analysis to know for certain if the variance is real .
Neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently in many respects , but the MINOS results , presented today at the Neutrino 2010 conference in Athens , Greece , and in a seminar at Fermilab , are the first observation of a potential fundamental difference that established physical theory could not explain .
“ Everything we know up to now about neutrinos would tell you that our measured mass difference parameters should be very similar for neutrinos and antineutrinos , ” said MINOS co-spokesperson Rob Plunkett .
“ If this result holds up , it would signal a fundamentally new property of the neutrino - antineutrino system .
The implications of this difference for the physics of the universe would be profound . ”
The NUMI beam is capable of producing intense beams of either antineutrinos or neutrinos .
This capability allowed the experimenters to measure the unexpected mass difference parameters .
The measurement also relies on the unique characteristics of the MINOS detector , particularly its magnetic field , which allows the detector to separate the positively and negatively charged muons resulting from interactions of antineutrinos and neutrinos , respectively .
MINOS scientists have also updated their measurement of the standard oscillation parameters for muon neutrinos , providing an extremely precise value of Δm2 .
Muon antineutrinos are produced in a beam originating in Fermilab ’s Main Injector .
The antineutrinos ’ extremely rare interactions with matter allow most of them to pass through the Earth unperturbed .
A small number , however , interact in the MINOS detector , located 735 km away from Fermilab in Soudan , Minnesota .
During their journey , which lasts 2.5 milliseconds , the particles oscillate in a process governed by a difference between their mass states .
“ We do know that a difference of this size in the behavior of neutrinos and antineutrinos could not be explained by current theory , ” said MINOS co-spokesperson Jenny Thomas .
“ While the neutrinos and antineutrinos do behave differently on their journey through the Earth , the Standard Model predicts the effect is immeasurably small in the MINOS experiment .
Clearly , more antineutrino running is essential to clarify whether this effect is just due to a statistical fluctuation . ”
The MINOS experiment involves more than 140 scientists , engineers , technical specialists and students from 30 institutions , including universities and national laboratories , in five countries : Brazil , Greece , Poland , the United Kingdom and the United States .
Funding comes from : the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation in the U.S. , the Science and Technology Facilities Council in the U.K ; the University of Minnesota in the U.S. ; the University of Athens in Greece ; and Brazil ’s Foundation for Research Support of the State of São Paulo ( FAPESP ) and National Council of Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) .
Fermilab is a national laboratory funded by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy , operated under contract by Fermi Research Alliance , LLC .
A US cruise missile armed with cluster ammunition was used in an attack in Yemen in December which resulted in the deaths of 52 people , over half of them women and children , according to a human rights watchdog .
The Yemeni government insisted their forces alone carried out the strike on an al - Qa'ida training camp in the Abyan region .
US authorities backed the claim that insurgents had been attacked but officially denied direct involvement in the attack .
However , Amnesty International has now released photographs of missile parts from the attack which appear to show that it was a BGM - 109D Tomahawk cruise missile designed to be launched from a warship or submarine .
Further images reveal BLU 97 A/B cluster munitions which spray steel fragments for 150 meters along with burning zirconium for igniting buildings .
The Yemeni government does not possess cruise missiles , which are part of the arsenal of US Navy vessels patrolling off the Horn of Africa and in the Arabian Sea .
The Convention on Cluster Munitions has been signed by 106 states and ratified by 35 .
However , neither the US or Yemen are signatories .
Weapons analysts point out that bomblets have maimed and killed civilians who have found them .
Yemen has become a battleground between the international jihad and the West .
Special forces and intelligence officials from several Nato countries , including the UK and US , have beent in the country .
The Americans are hunting , in particular , Anwar al - Awlaki , a radical cleric who is said to have been a mentor to the " underpants bomber " , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , who tried to blow up a transatlantic airliner and Major Nidal Malik Hasan , of the US Army who shot dead 13 people at Fort Hood in Texas .
A Yemeni parliamentary committee investigating the raid at al - Ma'jalah concluded that 41 of the dead were civilians , 21 of them children and 14 women .
Survivors denied any links with insurgents .
The parliamentary committee asked the Yemeni government to open a judicial inquiry into the killings .
Six months on , there is no sign of that happening although the authorities in Sanaa declared that at least 14 of the dead were members of al - Qa'ida plotting to carry out terrorist attacks .
One of the al - Qa'ida dead , it was claimed , was its supposed leader in Yemen , Qaaim al - Raymi .
However , US officials said later that he appeared to have escaped the missile strikes .
Amnesty International says it obtained the photographs from a confidential source in March and delayed their release to check the contents with independent experts and " provide the US government with time to respond to the evidence " .
The organisation 's Middle East and North Africa deputy director , Phil Luther , said : " A military strike of this kind against alleged militants without an attempt to detain them is at the very least unlawful .
" Based on the evidence provided by these photographs , the US government must disclose what role it played in the al - Ma'jalah attack , and all governments involved must show what steps they took to prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries . "
The US secret war
While running for the White House , Barack Obama deplored the excesses of George W Bush 's " war on terror " and he and his administration have even stopped using that term since coming into office .
However , the secret war being waged by the US against insurgents has actually vastly increased in both scope and in size under the new President , with special operations forces now operating in more than 75 countries around the world from Colombia to the Philippines .
There has been a marked increase in the number of drone attacks against al - Qa'ida and Taliban targets inside Pakistan and special forces operations in Somalia and the Yemen .
In all three countries authorities have claimed that major figures involved in the international jihad have been eliminated .
The US recently changed its laws to allow the assassination of US citizens who are terrorist suspects abroad .
It was aimed specifically at future attempts to target Anwar al - Awlaki , a fundamentalist preacher and fugitive who supposedly mentored the " underpants bomber " Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and US Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan , a psychiatrist , who killed 13 people at Fort Hood in Texas .
He is believed to be hiding in Yemen .
Behind the softly spoken words about reaching out to international adversaries and healing wounds , the Obama administration has proved to be as ruthless at hunting down America 's enemies as any of its predecessors .

Medusaceratops © Luis Rey
Michael J. Ryan , Ph.D. , a scientist at The Cleveland Museum of Natural History , has announced the discovery of a new horned dinosaur , Medusaceratops lokii .
Approximately 20 feet long and weighing more than 2 tons , the newly identified plant - eating dinosaur lived nearly 78 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Montana .
Its identification marks the discovery of a new genus of horned dinosaur .
Ryan , curator and head of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Museum , published his findings on the new genus in the book , " New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs : The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium , " available from Indiana University Press .
Ryan was the book 's lead editor .
Medusaceratops belongs to the Chasmosaurinae subfamily of the horned dinosaur family Ceratopsidae .
The other subfamily is Centrosaurinae .
The specimen is the first Campanian - aged chasmosaurine ceratopsid found in Montana .
It is also the oldest known Chasmosaurine ceratopsid .
The new dinosaur was discovered in a bonebed on private land located along the Milk River in North Central Montana .
Fossilized bones from the site were acquired by Canada Fossil , Inc. , of Calgary , Alberta , in the mid-1990s .
The company consulted with Ryan and his colleagues to identify material from the site .
At first , the scientists could not make a positive identification .
Medusaceratops had giant brow bones more than 3 feet long over each eye , and a large , shield - like frill off the back of its skull adorned with large curling hooks .
Medusaceratops lokii means " Loki 's horned - faced Medusa , " referring to the thickened , fossilized , snake - like hooks on the side of the frill .
It was named after Loki , the Norse god of mischief , because the new dinosaur initially caused scientists some confusion .

" At first we could n't figure out what we had , " said Ryan .
" Some of the material looked as if it came from a form related to Centrosaurus , a centrosaurine noted for having short brow horns .
The rest of the pieces had giant brow horns similar to Triceratops , a chasmosaurine .
That 's one of the problems with bonebeds — even though you can collect a large amount of material , much of it is broken and all of it is disarticulated , so the story is rarely clear cut . "
Eventually Ryan found a complete articulated skull of a centrosaur with long brow horns in southern Alberta of what appeared to be the new animal from Montana , and named it Albertaceratops in 2007 .
At that time , he assumed he was looking at a stray that had literally crossed the international border millions of years ago .
After reexamining the Montanan material more recently , Ryan realized that at least some of the material in the Montana bonebed was not Albertaceratops .
Some of the elements were much larger than any other horned dinosaur from the same time period , including Albertaceratops .
And even though Albertaceratops and Medusaceratops are superficially very similar , the shape and number of the hooks and ornaments along the edge of the frill actually puts them in separate horned dinosaur groups , with Medusaceratops being a chasmosaur .
" Although the ornamentation on the frill is pretty spectacular , it probably was not used for defense against predators ; rather it was more likely prehistoric " bling " used to attract a mate , " said co-author Anthony Russell , Ph.D. , professor of biological sciences at the University of Calgary in Alberta .
" Medusaceratops is the oldest member of the Chasmosaurinae in North America and shows that the group , like its most famous member , Triceratops , had long brow horns and were fairly large when they first evolved , " said Ryan .
" But later chasmosaurs that are just a bit younger than Medusaceratops tend to have much shorter horns and have much smaller , lighter bodies .
" Here we have something almost the size of Triceratops , but 10 million years before it lived , " Ryan said .
" T. rex was not around yet , so what was Medusaceratops squaring off against ?
That 's one of the things we 're now looking for in Alberta . "

Sometimes he gets a helping hand from his comrade Ahmed Hassan , who is 15 .
Ahmed said he was sent to Uganda more than two years ago for army training , when he was 12 , though his claim could not be independently verified .
American military advisers have been helping oversee the training of Somali government soldiers in Uganda .
“ One of the things I learned , ” Ahmed explained eagerly , “ is how to kill with a knife . ”
Children do not have many options in Somalia .
After the government collapsed in 1991 , an entire generation was let loose on the streets .
Most children have never sat in a classroom or played in a park .
Their bones have been stunted by conflict - induced famines , their psyches damaged by all the killings they have witnessed .
“ What do I enjoy ? ” Awil asked .
“ I enjoy the gun . ”
Like many other children here , the war has left him hard beyond his years .
He loves cigarettes and is addicted to qat , a bitter leaf that , for the few hours he chews it each day , makes grim reality fade away .
He was abandoned by parents who fled to Yemen , he said , and joined a militia when he was about 7 .
He now lives with other government soldiers in a dive of a house littered with cigarette boxes and smelly clothes .
Awil does not know exactly how old he is .
His commander says he is around 12 , but birth certificates are rare .
Awil gobbles down greasy rice with unwashed hands because he does not know where his next meal is coming from .
He is paid about $ 1.50 a day , but only every now and then , like most soldiers .
His bed is a fly - covered mattress that he shares with two other child soldiers , Ali Deeq , 10 , and Abdulaziz , 13 .
“ He should be in school , ” said Awil ’s commander , Abdisalam Abdillahi .
“ But there is no school . ”
Ali Sheikh Yassin , vice - chairman of Elman Peace and Human Rights Center in Mogadishu , said that about 20 percent of government troops ( thought to number 5,000 to 10,000 ) were children and that about 80 percent of the rebels were .
The leading insurgent group , which has drawn increasingly close to Al Qaeda , is called the Shabab , which means youth in Arabic .
“ These kids can be so easily brainwashed , ” Mr. Ali said .
“ They do n’t even have to be paid . ”
One of the myriad dangers Awil faces is constant gunfire between his squad and another group of government soldiers from a different clan .
The Somali government is racked by divisions from the prime minister ’s office down to the street .
BP cleanup workers are being ‘ discouraged ’ from using equipment like respirators because it makes for bad - looking pictures , R.F.K. Center President Kerry Kennedy tells F.N.C. ( 3:15 ) :
Kerry Kennedy , president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights , was on the FOX News Channel ( F.N.C. ) morning show “ Fox & Friends ” after having interviewed workers cleaning up the ‘ Gulf oil spill ’ .
She “ found that BP was trying to repress the use of safety equipment , ” David Edwards wrote this morning at The Raw Story , under the lede :
BP ’s logic seems to be that if the oil cleanup does n’t look dangerous then it must not be .
The oil company has told workers not to wear respirators because it ’s bad for public relations , according to one human rights group .
He quoted the F.N.C. interview :
“ In all three states that I ’ve visited , fishermen said when they went out to work on the cleanup , that if they tried to bring respirators they were told it was unnecessary equipment and would only spread hysteria , ” Kennedy told Fox News Friday .
“ When I went out with eleven people , we had respirators on and within half an hour , all of our eyes were burning and our throats were closing and we all had headaches , ” she explained .
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) , a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that provides scientific consultation to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , has sent a couple of teams to the Gulf .
“ As that work begins , BP has released limited test results aimed at tamping down public worries about the number of cleanup workers already reporting adverse symptoms , ” Elana Schor reported today at The New York Times .
Mr. Edwards continued :
Kennedy was also concerned that BP was refusing to release information about the contents of the dispersant being used . [… ]
“ One of the things that we were told is that BP would not allow county health officials on to their campus .
They finally allowed one nurse .
They told workers that if they became sick , the nurse could only give them a Band - Aid or an aspirin .
If they really felt sick they had to go to the BP doctors .
So BP has completely control over the health care of those workers and what ’s happening , ” Kennedy told Fox host Eric Bolling .
Ms. Kennedy found there is county - provided healthcare available , but — and this sums up the whole BP policy of forcing workers to sacrifice their health for the corporation to attempt minimizing its plummeting public approval :
“ The workers are concerned that this is the only job in town and if the go outside what BP tells them to do they might lose the only job they could get , ” she said .
A lot of the cleanup workers are people , like fishermen , who are out of work as a result of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and BP ’s oil gushing millions of gallons a day into the Gulf of Mexico .
Commercial fishermen are allowed by BP to make claims , but are required to show their W - 2 forms .
The industry being a largely agorist cash business , the workers are unable to do so , Ms. Kennedy added .
BP is using government regulations to publicly defend itself without actually addressing the health risks to the workers .
“ ‘ All results to date are within safe exposure limits ’ set by OSHA , the spokesman added , ” Ms. Schor reported .
She adds that experts find high risks under these “ limits ” , partially because they ’re miscalculated :
BP ’s tests also show some workers have been exposed to the carcinogen benzene , which came as an unwelcome surprise to an occupational health expert and veteran of the 1989 Exxon Valdez cleanup who agreed to speak candidly on the condition of anonymity .
“ They ’re trying to say it ’s not that bad , but I ’m looking at it and saying , wow — that would be enough for me to say there ’s [ notable ] exposure , ” this source said , adding that the number of air samples BP has taken is “ shockingly low … you would expect a lot more sampling data , but it can be difficult to take a lot of these samples . ”
NIOSH sets significantly lower exposure limits than OSHA for several chemicals being monitored in spill cleanup workers , including benzene and 2 - butoxyethanol , an ingredient in a dispersant that is no longer used in the Gulf .
In addition , several sources noted that OSHA exposure limits are calculated based on an eight - hour day , even though many responders near the leaking well are working much longer shifts .
Hunter College toxicology professor Franklin Mirer said that using OSHA limits to assess chemical exposure in the Gulf “ is less than helpful for understanding the health effects being reported ” by the workers who have already sought medical treatment .
“ If the message here is that OSHA standards are being complied with and large numbers of people are getting sick , that ’s a lesson about the value of OSHA standards and about the protective measures that ought to be employed , ” Mirer added , likening the occupational health risks of the oil disaster to those at the World Trade Center after Sept. 11 .
Government regulations that leave such risks add a very dangerous element to the equation ; they skirt BP ’s liability for cleanup workers ’ long - and short - term health deterioration , even when BP prevents the workers from voluntary protecting themselves from the risks to which they remain exposed when BP is safeguarded by OSHA .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) on Thursday twice ripped Senate Republicans for blocking legislation containing extended unemployment benefits .
“ What did middle - class families ever do to Republicans in the Senate that they would snuff out every opportunity for job creation that has been sent to them ? ”
Pelosi chided at an afternoon press conference with Democratic women to drum up support for her remaining jobs agenda .

Much of the agenda is either unmovable in the Senate or subject to stalemate in the House .
“ Why ca n’t they develop any ideas of their own to create jobs ?
Why ca n’t they give a glimmer of hope to America ’s working families — to some who have jobs but fear losing them , to some who want better jobs , to some who are concerned about their children or their neighbors or other family members being able to get a job ? ” the Speaker said .
Later , at her weekly press conference , Pelosi said that “ Republican senators seem to have a tin ear when it comes to the appeals of the American people for job creation . ”
Pelosi ’s frustration has been on the rise lately .
She was forced to scale back a package of unemployment insurance extensions , aid to states and extended COBRA health insurance benefits in part because her vulnerable members did not want to vote to add to the deficit without an assurance that the Senate would follow suit .

The principle Democrats are defending is that they will not pass a bill unless it adds to the debt . ”
And the Speaker ’s ire did not seem reserved exclusively for Senate Republicans .
Without mentioning Reid or any Senate Democrat by name , Pelosi did not hide her disgust with the Senate ’s passage of a standalone temporary “ doc fix . ”
“ When they sent this very , very slim reed of a piece of legislation over to us , which was n’t even really that well - written — this was , I think , the Republican initiative , and they just did it without objection , or whatever the term of art is on the Senate side ... this was totally inadequate , ” Pelosi said .
“ Members said , ‘ No , we have to send something back that is bigger , but let ’s see what they can do on unemployment . ’
" Well , it is clear they are not able to do anything this week anyway . ”
Pelosi said the House " might " take up the doc -fix bill before finishing its work for the week on Thursday evening .
The House on Thursday did pass legislation to temporarily reverse a steep pay cut for Medicare doctors that took hold this month .

The plan touts its increased funding for drug prevention and treatment , but there 's a lot of troubling things in the enforcement section , aside from the predictable enhance the border and spend more money in Africa projects .
Like supporting a zero tolerance proposal for DUID ( driving under the influence of drugs ) :
Fifteen states have passed laws clarifying that the presence of any illegal drug in a driver ’s body is per se evidence of impaired driving .
ONDCP will work with states to expand the use of this standard to other states and explore other ways to increase the enforcement of existing DUID laws . ( emphasis supplied . )
Indoor marijuana grows will face increased busts :
The use of indoor grow operations and other technological advances have enabled traffickers to increase the potency of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis plants .
In 2008 , DEA and partner agencies seized in excess of 4,100 indoor grow operations ....
DEA , in coordination with state , and local agencies , must aggressively deploy resources as efficiently as possible in close partnership with state agencies to eradicate the marijuana and dismantle organizations that produce it .
Watch out for your cash , increased emphasis will be placed on seizing it .
The plan calls for treating bulk cash the same as drugs .
And , they will ramp up prosecutions of those found with cash , to convert them into snitches and help them with controlled buys of drugs .

Despite many controversial decisions from referees in international competitions , football 's governing body Fifa is reluctant to adopt goal - line gadgets .
Other sports such as cricket and tennis have adopted hawkeye technology which uses cameras to track the ball and helps umpires make the correct call .
Sports writer James Mason said Fifa 's reliance on referees rather than devices aims to preserve the sport 's traditions .

Obeying is Low Status , So How Do We Convince People to Obey ?
A.J. Ayer says political philosophers claim to be interested in answering one question :
What is the moral authority that makes political obligation binding ?
But while philosophers pay lip service to this high ideal of moral inquiry , Ayer concludes they ’re really just ad men , advocating their preferred form of government .
He offers a handy summary of the answers given by the “ greats ” :
You ought to obey because you are forced to .
Hobbes .
You ought to obey because you have promised to .
Hobbes , Locke , Rousseau and other believers in the Social Contract .
You ought to obey because it is in your interest .
Plato , Hobbes , Bentham .
You ought to obey because it is in the general interest .
Locke , Rousseau , Mill , Green .
You ought to obey because it is you who are giving the orders .
Hobbes , Rousseau , Bosanquet and other believers in the General Will .
You ought to obey because God wants you to .
Mediaeval writers .
You ought to obey because the Sovereign is God ’s anointed .
Absolute Monarchists .
You ought to obey because the Sovereign is descended from someone who had the right to be obeyed .
Legitimists .
You ought to obey because your government exemplifies the highest point yet reached in the spiritual development of man .
Hegel .
This can hardly be true of all governments .
You ought to obey because your government has history on its side .
Marx .
Again , this may not be true of all governments .
You ought to obey because you ought to obey .
Some English moralists .
You have no obligation to obey .
Anarchists .
Since obeying is by nature low status , and giving commands is high , most contemporary answers to this question will devise clever frames to cajole adherents into believing obeying is not low status .
For example , I would say that 9 is ascendant today , where “ the spiritual development of man ” is understood as man ’s ability to reason and argue , in a vogue word , to express “ voice ” and participate in democracy .
Here obedience is portrayed in the grand fashion , full of high status pomp and dignity .
In reality , it ’s nothing but a honey trap .
Deliberative democrats go one step further and combine 9 and 5 in their marketing pamphlets , in the hopes of raising their own status by convincing you of the illusion that you are raising your own .
Notice that many of these answers dissolve if we think in terms of competitive government and the power of exit .
To get a feel , add “ stay ” to every answer .
Answer 1 becomes “ You ought to stay and obey because you are forced to . ”
Ummm , no thanks .
Answer 9 : “ You ought to stay and obey because your government exemplifies the highest point yet reached in the spiritual development of man . ”
Yawn .
No thank you , guvnah !
They have better accommodations down the way .
A screencast demonstrating the structured RTE bundled with the Trice CMS
In my previous post I mentioned that I 'm building a Linked Data CMS .
One of its components is a rich - text editor that allows the creation ( and embedding ) of structured markup .
An earlier version supported limited Microdata annotations , but now I 've switched the mechanism and use an intermediate , but even simpler approach based on HTML5 's handy data -* attributes .
This lets you build almost arbitrary markup with the editor , including Microformats , Microdata , or RDFa .
I do n't know yet when the CMS will be publicly available ( 3 sites are under development right now ) , but as mentioned , I 'd be happy about another pilot project or two .
Below is a video demonstrating the editor and its easy customization options .
PORT - AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) - Haiti ’s parliament has approved the creation of a commission that will allow foreign donors to participate in deciding how to rebuild the poor Caribbean nation after its devastating January 12 earthquake .

The bill approving the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission , which was set up by an international donors conference on March 31 , was passed by the Haitian Senate late on Thursday after the national assembly ’s lower house had also endorsed it .
The assembly also extended a post - quake state of emergency for 18 months , corresponding to the commission ’s tenure .
The joint commission , to be co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton , the U.N. special envoy for Haiti , and by Haitian Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive , will determine which reconstruction projects will receive backing from multibillion - dollar funding pledged by foreign donors .
President Rene Preval is due to sign the bill into law and the president will have final veto over rebuilding projects .
Even before the catastrophic quake , which shattered the fragile and impoverished Haitian economy and killed more than 300,000 people , Haiti had a reputation for high levels of government corruption .
Donors had called for guarantees of oversight and accountability in the rebuilding process .
Sitting on the commission , under the joint chair , will be an equal number of Haitian and non-Haitian representatives .
The latter include officials of international organizations , multilateral lenders and major donors .
The body will operate for 18 months before handing over to a government redevelopment authority .
Thirteen senators voted for the bill , one voted against , and two abstained , but in preceding debates , Preval ’s administration had to overcome arguments from some lawmakers who said the quake - hit nation was ceding sovereignty by agreeing to a foreign donor role in decision - making .
“ I could not vote this law because it is against the country ’s constitution and it violates our sovereignty , ” said Senator Youri Latortue , who refused to back the bill .
Rejecting these fears , Preval told Haitians the operation of the commission would facilitate the release of massive reconstruction financing that will be administered through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund , to be supervised by the World Bank .
“ Do we lose our sovereignty because of the creation of this commission ?
I think the answer is no , ” Preval said recently .
MANY HAITIANS MISTRUST GOVERNMENT
At the March 31 donors ’ conference in New York , foreign governments , multilateral institutions and non-governmental organizations from around the world pledged a total of $ 9.9 billion for Haiti ’s reconstruction , $ 5.3 billion for the next two years alone .
The emergency measures accompanying the creation of the recovery commission authorize the Haitian government to use funds and take other measures needed for reconstruction without prior approval by parliament , and also allow it to avoid some legal and constitutional constraints .
Many Haitians have criticized what they say was the Preval government ’s slow and ineffective response to the natural disaster .
A poll funded last month by the international charity Oxfam showed that only 6.6 percent of Haitians believed their government alone should be left to rebuild the country .
But government supporters said the commission would help to get the reconstruction underway quicker .
“ We want this law to take effect as soon as possible so the population may see the concrete results of commitments made by the government and the international community , ” Senator Joseph Lambert said .
International aid workers are striving to care for more than 1 million homeless Haitian quake survivors who are camped out in makeshift tent and shelter communities sprawled across the wrecked capital and in other damaged towns .
Aid workers say that unless safer , more secure shelter is found for the hundreds of thousands of homeless quake victims , the imminent rains , and the hurricane season starting on June 1 , could cause another humanitarian catastrophe .

TRENTON
-- Senate President Steve Sweeney picked up his phone Monday morning and listened as Gov. Chris Christie dropped a political bomb onto this lap .
Supreme Court Justice John Wallace , a close ally of Sweeney , had to go .
The governor was removing him , the first time a sitting justice has been removed from the bench since the Constitution was drafted after World War II .
Sweeney was shocked .
Wallace is a close ally of his , the Court ’s only African - American , and Sweeney had made it clear over and over that protecting Wallace was a top personal priority .
This was a major dis .
Previous coverage :
• Gov. Christie 's nominee for N.J. Supreme Court has donated $ 23,680 to Republicans in past 17 years
• N.J. Supreme Court chief justice criticizes Gov. Chris Christie for not reappointing Justice Wallace
• Gov. Chris Christie nominates lawyer Anne M. Patterson to N.J. Supreme Court
• Gov. Christie close to making a decision on lifetime tenure for N.J. Justice John Wallace
Star - Ledger opinion and editorial coverage :
• Christie 's tied in knots over the Wallace pick
• N.J. Supreme Court on its way to a liberal activist majority for the foreseeable future
• Black bar association back Justice John Wallace
• Removing Supreme Court Justice John E. Wallace Jr. would be a mistake for New Jersey
“ I ca n’t believe you ’re doing this governor , ” Sweeney said .
Indeed , the governor ’s decision on Wallace is a strange one from any angle .
Begin with the politics .
The governor said Monday he wants to reshape the court by replacing Wallace with a Republican product liability lawyer from Morris County , Anne Patterson .
But that ’s not likely to happen .
Because infuriated Democrats intend to retaliate by refusing to confirm her .
They vow that they will not even hold confirmation hearings .
And the governor has no power to force their hand .
He ’s picked a fight he is almost certain to lose , never a smart move in politics .
It ’s a strange call on the substance as well .
Because Wallace is no liberal extremist .
At his press conference on Monday , the governor was unable to name a single decision Wallace has made that he found objectionable .
Yet here he was ending the career of an even - tempered jurist with unquestioned integrity and intellect .
For the record , Wallace is a mainstream justice .
He voted against forcing the Legislature to embrace gay marriage , siding with the more restrained majority that accepted civil unions as a substitute .
He voted with the majority to reshape the Abbott school funding decisions so that more money could go to the suburbs , as conservatives have always wanted .
He was not even on the court when it made the affordable housing rulings that the governor finds objectionable .
“ This is really the ultimate arrogance , ” Sweeney said .
“ To have the nerve to stand up in front of people and make the statement that he is an activist judge . ”
But leave Wallace aside for a moment .
Leave aside the governor ’s habit of treating the Legislature as an afterthought .
Leave aside even the fury among African - Americans who now have no voice on the court .
The biggest problem with this move is that it injects partisan politics into the judicial system .
Judges face reappointment after seven years , and up to now they have been denied only for misconduct , incompetence , or a failure to show judicial temperament .
By rejecting Wallace , Chrisite is bringing ideology into this .
Judges will now have to wonder if voicing their honest convictions might cost them their jobs .
Even Christie ’s close political friends are worried about that .
Gov. Tom Kean , a mentor of Christie ’s , reappointed Democratic judges with whom he fervently disagreed because he felt it was the independence of the judiciary was critical .
Christie on Monday said he spoke to Kean about this , and rejected his advice .
Monday , the notoriously reserved Chief Justice Stuart Rabner , a confident of Christie ’s who served under him in the U.S. Attorney ’’s office , issuing a seering rebuke of this decision on Wallace .
“ I am disappointed , ” Rabner wrote .
" Citizens who turn to the courts for relief are entitled to have their cases resolved by impartial judges who focus only on the even - handed pursuit of justice ; litigants should never have to worry that a judge may be more concerned about how a decision could affect his or her reappointment . "
Christie ignored all that .
And he provoked a big fight with the Legislature just as he needs cooperation on reforms and the state budget .
“ He still thinks he ’s the prosecutor and can do whatever he wants , ” said Sen. Loretta Weinberg , a Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee .
This decision ends an era in Trenton , an era when governors in both parties showed restraint on behalf of a cause they all embraced , judicial independence .
That ’s over now .
Watch for this process to become far more bitter and partisan , for Trenton to become a little more like Washington , where ugly brawls over judicial appointments are common .
Maybe it was inevitable , given the times .
At his press conference Monday , Christie appealed to Democrats to take this blow , and move on .
“ All I ’m asking of the state Senate is for them to consider Anne Patterson ’s credentials on their merits , ” he said .
“ That ’s what she deserves . ”
He did n’t seem to see the irony .
Because that is precisely what Democrats wanted for Wallace .

WEST VALLEY CITY --
A woman who police say stole two cars and led them on a chase all while she was naked is now in jail .
West Valley City officers stopped her with a Taser .
The 31 - year - old woman from Kearns was booked Tuesday evening after getting a mental evaluation .
This was certainly an unusual call for West Valley City officers .
They say it 's laughable now , but mostly , they 're just happy no one was seriously injured .
Five o'clock in the morning is not usually a busy time on Highway 111 in West Jordan .
But Tuesday morning was different .
Sylvina Beagley
As West Valley City police Capt .
Tom McLachlan said , " This was an episode that is out of the normal . "
And that 's an understatement .
A man was pulled over , posting business signs on the side of the road .
Sylvina Beagley pulled up next to him and got out of her car .
" Unique thing about that was that , uh she was not wearing any clothes , " McLachlan said .
Then she decided to steal his car , driving north toward West Valley City .
The man jumped into her abandoned car and followed Beagley , while dialing 911 .
At 5300 South , she crashed into a gate on ATK property and ran .
Officers eventually caught up with Beagley , but they could n't quite physically catch her .
" She did have blood on her body from the initial crash .
She was hot and sweaty , dirty , and very slippery .
She managed to escape the grasp of the two officers , " McLachlan said .
And she was off again !
This time she got into a squad car and drove away , only to crash into another gate , hit a burm and soar 50 feet in the air .
Beagley did n't stop there either .
She ran from the totaled car and scaled a barbed wire fence .
Officers realized a Taser was necessary to stop her , and so it ended .
" It 's an unusual story .
It 'll pique the interest of a lot of people , " McLachlan said .
West Valley City officers say the man who had his car stolen initially is a concealed carrier and the gun was in his car .
Luckily , Beagley never used it .
She 's being held on two counts of stolen vehicles , felony fleeing and lewdness .

Image caption Mr Putin held talks with President Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will freeze the sale of surface - to - air missiles to Iran , according to French officials .
Mr Putin made the comments in talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris , the officials said .
In an apparent change of direction by Moscow , Russia 's foreign minister said President Dmitry Medvedev will decree which weapons cannot be sold to Iran .
Sergey Lavrov earlier said the missiles were not subject to fresh UN sanctions .
Russia agreed to supply Iran with S - 300 systems several years ago but has not delivered them .
Mr Lavrov said on Thursday that a fourth round of sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council this week would not affect Russia 's contract to supply Iran with the missiles .
But on Friday he said : " According to our practice , the UN Security Council resolution is implemented through decrees issued by the Russian president .
A decree to this effect will be prepared . "
Correspondents say a flurry of statements by officials on Friday suggest Moscow is changing tack on the missile deal .
Iran ' unhappy '
President Sarkozy 's office said on Friday Mr Putin had confirmed Russia would shelve the delivery .
A spokesman for Mr Sarkozy quoted the Russian leader as saying Iran was " very unhappy " and wanted to impose penalties on Moscow .
Mr Sarkozy praised the Russian leadership for supporting the sanctions during a meeting with Mr Putin at the Elysee place .
" It is an extremely courageous measure that will cost Russia a lot , " he told Mr Putin , according to the spokesman .
Military experts say the S - 300 systems could enhance Iran 's defence of its nuclear facilities against attack from the air .
The White House acknowledged on Thursday that the latest sanctions did not explicitly ban the S - 300 sale to Iran , but it welcomed Russia 's " restraint " in not delivering them .
" Russia has exercised responsibility , restraint and has not delivered those missiles to Iran , " state department spokesman Philip Crowley said .
Iran insists its nuclear enrichment programme is for peaceful purposes , but a number of Western countries suspect it of trying to build nuclear weapons .
The UN Security Council voted by 12 votes to two in favour of fresh sanctions on Wednesday .
Brazil and Turkey voted against , while Lebanon abstained .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has denounced the new UN resolutions saying they were like a " used handkerchief which should be thrown in the dustbin .
They are not capable of hurting Iranians " .
Mr Lavrov said on Thursday that Moscow is discussing building nuclear reactors in Iran in addition to the Bushehr site , due to open in August after years of delay .
With wide shoulders and an even wider caboose , Dustin Byfuglien looks as if he could be playing for the Chicago Bears instead of lacing up his skates with the Blackhawks .
But when it comes to exactly how much the 6 - foot - 4 forward weighs , Byfuglien is n’t saying .
He just smiles when asked if he is anywhere close to his listed 257 pounds .
“ It ’s around there , ” he said cryptically .
“ It ’s always fun to hear the numbers that people guess . ”
Whatever the scale says , Byfuglien ( pronounced BUFF - lin ) is coming up very big against the Sharks in the Western Conference finals .
The Blackhawks hold a 2 - 0 series lead thanks in , well , large part to Byfuglien .
He got the winner in the series opener , added another goal with a nifty deflection in Chicago ’s 4 - 2 victory Tuesday and created mayhem in front of Sharks goalie Evgeni Nabokov that contributed to yet another score .
In fact , his promotion to the Blackhawks ’ top line with stars Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane in the second - round series against Vancouver has produced the NHL ’s hottest line .
Byfuglien is the havoc - causing thunder in the crease that meshes perfectly with the smooth - skating lightning of Toews and Kane .
“ Buff is playing awesome , ” said Kane , who has 18 points in the postseason .
“ He seems to be causing havoc every game , tipping pucks in . “…
The biggest thing he ’s doing is creating room for us .
When he’s on the ice , they have to think about him instead of just myself and Toews . ”
Byfuglien , who has six goals and two assists in the playoffs , is fast emerging as a force .
But several Sharks have known all about him for years .
San Jose assistant Trent Yawney was the Blackhawks ’ coach when Byfuglien first got called up .
“ You could see that he had talent coming out the wazoo , but he just needed to learn how to be a pro , ” Yawney said .
Sharks forward Devin Setoguchi knew that even earlier .
He had played against Byfuglien , who came up as a defenseman , in junior hockey .
And he remembers it being an intimidating experience .
“ He was even bigger back then , maybe about 280 , ” Setoguchi said .
“ He was a man among boys , playing against 16 - year - old kids who were about 160 pounds soaking wet .
But even though he was n’t in shape , he was the only defenseman in juniors that I saw who could come down and score a hat trick . ”
With a physique seemingly better suited for a linebacker or tight end , it seems strange that Byfuglien eluded football coaches .
His stepfather , Dale Smedsmo , played briefly in the NHL , but Byfuglien already was on the hockey path when Smedsmo entered his life at age 13 .
“ Growing up in Minnesota , there ’s not much football going on there , ” said Byfuglien , 25 .
“ I was always playing hockey . ”
Once the Blackhawks focused him on slimming down , he began playing excellent hockey .
With a soft touch and quick stick , he is versatile enough to play both defense and forward .
That ’s rather remarkable when you consider that he ’s bigger than Sharks bruiser Douglas Murray .
Byfuglien tortured Vancouver goalie Roberto Luongo in the second round .
Promoted from the blue line to the top forward line in Game 3 , Byfuglien planted himself in the crease and recorded a hat trick as the series turned in Chicago ’s favor .
But after successfully dealing with Detroit ’s immovable object Tomas Holmstrom in their second - round series , the Sharks were confident they could keep Byfuglien out of Nabokov ’s way .
They did that in Game 1 , but Byfuglien still beat the Sharks ’ goalie with a wicked laser in the 2 - 1 victory .
“ He ’s got such a heavy shot , ” said Toews , the Blackhawks ’ captain who leads the NHL with 23 playoff points .
“ Sometimes he just needs to tee it up . ”
Then in Game 2 , he tormented Nabokov by doing a good imitation of a door .
He scored Chicago ’s second goal by redirecting Kane ’s shot in front of the net .
Then Toews got the Blackhawks ’ next goal , deflecting Duncan Keith ’s shot as he and Byfuglien were screening Nabokov .
It was a command performance by Byfuglien that now has the Sharks scrambling for a countermeasure entering Friday ’s Game 3 in Chicago .
“ You ’re not going to move that man , ” Sharks coach Todd McLellan said .
“ He ’s that big , that strong .
He establishes himself . “…
Maybe we ’ll need to enhance what we do with him , because he made a huge impact on the game . ”
Huge is a good way to describe Byfuglien .
Even if he is n’t saying just how huge .

Look , I ’m all in favor of verifying studies and claims .
However , when I do this sort of exercise , I try to carefully quote whatever it is that I ’m analyzing and to replicate their analysis as best as I can as part of the commentary .
I quote extensively and carefully from the original study .
In contrast , Arthur Smith makes strong and untrue allegations against Climate Audit here without providing any citations from Climate Audit to support his allegations .
Smith :
What ’s definitely not legitimate is presenting a graph that is specifically stated to be showing one thing , but actually showing another .
That might happen just by accident if somebody messed up in creating the graph .
But the ClimateAudit discussion and Mosher / Fuller book appeared to claim that in one figure in the 3rd IPCC report ( TAR WG1 figure 2.21 , 2001 ) and in one figure in the 4th report ( AR4 figure 6.10 b , 2007 ) there was a real instance where “ the scientists had actually substituted or replaced the tree ring proxy data with instrument data ” deliberately , for the purpose of “ hiding the decline ” .
Smith does not bother to link to the ClimateAudit discussion , but , from the context , it appears to me my same - day commentary of March 31 , 2010 on the Parliamentary Committee report .
Like Brian Angliss , Arthur Smith has gotten a little punch drunk from different versions of tricks from the Team and has incorrectly presumed that I have been wrongfooted by the Team .
I do n’t , for a minute , wish to suggest that it ’s easy not to be wrongfooted by the Team .
They ’ve wrongfooted me on a number of occasions .
However , in this particular case , I ’ve had a pretty good idea what to look for and am confident that I have n’t fallen prey to any of the errors alleged by Arthur Smith .
Smith would have saved people considerable effort if he had bothered considering the analysis in my Heartland presentation , which I reported here as my most systematic exposition of the Trick so far .
But let ’s help Smith ( and Angliss ) along a little by showing the versions of the Trick side by side , showing the different versions currently being discussed .
On the far right is a plot of the Briffa reconstruction in the style of AR4 using the data from the October 1999 Climategate Letters ( up to 1960 , it matches AR4 data archived here at CRU . )
Second from the right is re-plot of the actual AR4 smoothed data ( using CRU versions ) colored to more or less synchronize with TAR colors ; second from the left is Angliss ’ version of the TAR diagram zoom ( a zoom first shown in May 2005 at Climate Audit ) ; on the left is the WMO 1999 diagram re-scaled to match the others .
Figure 1 . Trick Versions .
Left – Jones ’ WMO 1999 discussed in the trick email ; second – Mann ’s version in IPCC TAR ( 2001 ) ; third – Briffa ’s version in AR4 ( 2007 ) ; right – Climategate version ( 1999 ) , smoothed as in AR4 .
Going from right to left , the Trick becomes increasingly layered .
However , in each Team version , actual data is replaced by something else .
Using non-truncated data ( as preserved in the Climategate emails ) , the 1980 value of the Briffa reconstruction is - 0.41 ( anomaly deg C ) , obviously not very close to the actual temperature .
The data used for AR4 is identical to Climategate data except for the deletion of post - 1960 values .
Having deleted actual data , to effect the smooth shown in AR4 , Briffa padded values from 1960 - 1975 with the 1945 - 1960 mean and smoothed using a gaussian smooth ; then he truncated back to 1960 .
Had he used actual 1960 - 1975 values , the truncated curve would have ended in 1960 at - 0.22 deg C.
By padding with 1945 - 1960 values instead of actual values , the closing endpoint in 1960 was raised somewhat to - 0.15 deg C. ( Inconvenient post - 1960 values were , as is now well known , not shown . )
The first two drafts of AR4 did not report the deletion of post - 1960 values ; no climate scientists objected to this .
However , I had rather vehemently objected and Briffa grudgingly mentioned it , a reference that they are now rather glad to have . )
If you look at the TAR ( Mann ) and AR4 ( Briffa ) versions of the same Briffa reconstruction , you can see that Mann ’s done something different .
Post - 1960 data have been deleted , but Mann ’s done something else as well .
In TAR , the 1960 value of the smoothed Briffa reconstruction is about - 0.03 deg C or so , as opposed to the - 0.15 deg C in AR4 .
Mann used a different filter ( 40 - year hamming rather than gaussian ) , but this , in itself , is not enough to account for the difference .
TAR itself does n’t even disclose the deletion of the data , so it is little help in reverse engineering what Mann actually did .
A couple of different alternatives have been experimented with by Jean S , UC and myself , each of which involves padding 20 years of something else from 1960 - 1980 instead of actual data .
Jean S and UC have got pretty good replications using variations of ( a ) actual instrumental data ; ( b ) average instrumental data 1961 - 1990 ( zero by definition of the reference period ) .
After replacing / substituting actual Briffa data with something else , Mann then smoothed and truncated back to 1960 .
Whatever Mann substituted , it resulted in higher closing values in 1960 than Briffa ’s gaussian smooth with mean padding used in AR4 .
Jones ’ WMO 1999 on the left ( discussed in the Trick email , which in turn is discussed in the UEA submission to the Parliamentary Committee ) is a more extreme version and does something that Mann said had never been done by any climate scientist – Jones deleted post - 1960 reconstruction data , replaced it with instrumental data and smoothed them both , leaving a rhetorical impression that all the reconstructions did a pretty good job .
In my various descriptions of the Trick , I ’ve adhered closely to the above understanding .
Obviously , I have n’t re-capped the analysis in every post , especially in posts that are commentaries on contemporary events , such as the Parliamentary Committee report .
With this in mind , let ’s turn to spitballs from the confused Arthur Smith .
Smith :
The first discussion point in Angliss ’ review of the claims and in the ClimateAudit back and forth is the meaning of the “ trick ” to “ hide the decline ” phrase found in the stolen emails .
This has been adversely interpreted in a couple of different ways but the actual meaning has been clearly identified as the process of creating graphs that do include tree - ring - based temperature “ proxy ” data only up to 1960 , or 1980 , a point where they start to diverge from temperatures measured by instrumental thermometers .
There is nothing scientifically nefarious or “ wrong ” about this – the “ divergence problem ” has been extensively discussed in the scientific literature including in the text of the most recent IPCC report .
If you have reason to believe a particular collection of tree ring data is a good measure of temperature before 1960 but for some still uncertain reason not after that point , then it ’s perfectly legitimate to create a graph using the data you think is reliable , particularly if these choices are all clearly explained in the surrounding text or caption .
Smith provides no authority for the doctrine that it ’s OK to delete data that does n’t do what you expect .
It is not a statistical procedure that is recognized in legitimate science .
Even the Oxburgh inquiry said that it was “ regrettable ” .
However , Team supporters , having now acquiesced in this vice , now are unoffended by it .
Alexander Pope ’s words apply to the Trick :
“ Vice is a monster of so frightful mien ,
As to be hated needs but to be seen ;
Yet seen too oft , familiar with her face ,
we first endure , then pity , then embrace ”
However , the fact that Team supporters are unoffended does not show that any actual Climate Audit statement was unfounded .
And by the way , the truncation of the Briffa data was NOT “ clearly explained in the surrounding text or caption ” in TAR .
Quite the contrary .
It was n’t even mentioned .
Nor was it mentioned in the TAR citation .
It took careful parsing back and forth of the diagrams in 2005 to figure out that the data had been deleted .
Next let ’s parse Smith ’s paragraph quoted above .
What ’s definitely not legitimate is presenting a graph that is specifically stated to be showing one thing , but actually showing another .
I agree with that but obviously do not agree that Smith has presented any examples or evidence of this occurring at Climate Audit .
Smith continues :
That might happen just by accident if somebody messed up in creating the graph .
But the ClimateAudit discussion and Mosher / Fuller book appeared to claim that in one figure in the 3rd IPCC report ( TAR WG1 figure 2.21 , 2001 ) and in one figure in the 4th report ( AR4 figure 6.10 b , 2007 ) there was a real instance where “ the scientists had actually substituted or replaced the tree ring proxy data with instrument data ” deliberately , for the purpose of “ hiding the decline ” .
Contrary to Smith ’s allegation , to the best of my knowledge , I have never asserted that AR4 figure 6.10 b , 2007 involved the replacement of actual data with instrumental data .
My criticism of the AR4 graphic was based on the truncation of data .
Smith provided no citation or reference supporting this allegation .
( If someone can find evidence otherwise , I will defer to such evidence . )
As to the TAR diagram , as noted above , the mere fact that it differs from the AR4 diagram shows that something else has been substituted .
Based on Jean S and UC ’s reverse engineering , I am convinced that instrumental data ( either annual or reference period mean ) for 1960 - 1980 was used instead of actual data for the TAR smooth and have reported this on various occasions .
However , to be clear , this is based on reverse engineering ; the actual methodology has never been disclosed , but clearly differs somehow from the AR4 padding .
It would have been nice if one of the inquiries had actually inquired into the trick and taken this unknown off the table .
Smith continued :
As Angliss cited , McIntyre definitely uses the word “ substitution ” , and Fuller highlighted a portion of the Mosher / Fuller book using the word “ replaced ” .
McIntyre later clarified that his claim was not related to these IPCC figures but rather something else .
Once again , Smith is confused and presumes that I share his confusion .
In the post in question , I was commenting on a statement by the UEA which was about the trick email , which in turn was about the WMO 1999 diagram , in which instrumental data was clearly spliced with proxy data .
While it is my strong belief ( as noted above ) that the TAR diagram involves the substitution of 1960 - 80 instrument data ( either annual or reference period mean ) for actual proxy data , this substitution is only a rhetorical tweak , with the main effect deriving from the deletion of data – a point made on many occasions at CA .
Angliss did n’t understand that the UEA submission referred to the WMO 1999 diagram ( though this was well known to CA readers ) and somewhat acknowledged his error relatively promptly .
But only somewhat .
Angliss had originally stated :
If the scientists had actually substituted or replaced the tree ring proxy data with instrument data , then McIntyre and Fuller would have a valid claim of fraudulent behavior by Phil Jones et al .
However , nothing was substituted or replaced .
Confronted with unequivocal evidence that Jones had “ actually substituted or replaced the tree ring proxy data with instrument data ” , Angliss deleted the above paragraph .
( As noted on many occasions , I do n’t use words like “ fraud ” . )
In my opinion , Smith was correct in one observation – that , in comment # 7 on Angliss ’ article at June 8 , 2010 at 12:34 pm , Mosher slightly mis-described the padding method in AR4 - Mosher said that this diagram also used instrument padding , rather than 1940 - 1960 proxy mean padding .
( To my knowledge , this point did not arise in CRUTape Letters – I did n’t see any mention of this detail in a quick peruse this morning . )
Here is part of Mosher ’s comment # 7 :
The TAR is the third Report .
We are talking about the FAR .
figure 6.10 .
But I can make the same point with the TAR was with the FAR .
You clearly do n’t know how the trick works .
Let me explain .
The tree ring data POST 1960 is truncated .
That is step 1 .
That step is covered in the text of chapter 6 ( more on that later )
The next step is to SMOOTH the data for the graphical presentation .
The smoothing algorithm is a 30 year smooth .
and later :
So still , after all this time people do not understand the trick because they have not attended to the math .
1 . the series is truncated at 1960 .
2. a smoothing filter ( typically 30 years ) is applied .
3 . To compute the final years of the smooth ( half the filter width ) the temperature series is used .
That procedure is the trick .
in a nutshell .
If you want directions read Jones ’ mail .
Mosher ’s comment here is not correct for all versions of the trick .
As noted above , the AR4 version of the trick pads with 1945 - 1960 mean values rather than instrumental values and thus differs somewhat from what Mosher described above .
Mosher can perhaps clarify this for himself .
All Smith has shown here is that a Climate Audit reader somewhat mis-described one of the versions of the Trick in a comment at another blog .
He demonstrated precisely nothing about statements made by me at Climate Audit .
Smith ’s insinuation that Climate Audit had somehow been associated with “ presenting a graph that is specifically stated to be showing one thing , but actually showing another ” is totally unjustified .
JudicialWatch.org has some important material on Elena Kagan .
Judicial Watch President Thomas Fitton notes the “ most disturbing ” parts of her senior thesis at Princeton are the following :
Through its own internal feuding , then , the SP [ Socialist Party ] exhausted itself forever and further reduced labor radicalism …to the position of marginality and insignificance from which it has never recovered .
The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who , more than half a century after socialism ’s decline , still wish to change America .
… if the history of Local New York shows anything , it is that American radicals cannot afford to become their own worst enemies .
In unity lies their only hope .
As Fitton says , “ Do we really need a Supreme Court Justice who once lamented the lack of unity on the part of the Socialist Party ? ”
Judicial Watch had a link to Kagan ’s thesis but it does n’t work as of today .
Her senior thesis is consistent with other historical studies in showing that the Socialist Party in New York in the early 20th century was a Jewish phenomenon .
She notes that Jews were the backbone of the Socialist Party and that other ethnic groups , such as the Irish and Italians , could not be motivated to join even though they were in a similar economic situation .
Not only were Jews the backbone of the Socialist Party , socialism was very mainstream within the Jewish community .
Her account parallels those of other historians who describe the Jewish community from 1890 to 1920 as “ one big radical debating society ” ( see here , p. 71ff ) .
From [ 1886 ] on Jewish districts in New York and elsewhere were famous for their radical voting habits .
The Lower East Side repeatedly picked as its congressman Meyer London , the only New York Socialist ever to be elected to Congress .
And many Socialists went to the State Assembly in Albany from Jewish districts .
In the 1917 mayoralty campaign in New York City , the Socialist and anti-war candidacy of Morris Hillquit was supported by the most authoritative voices of the Jewish Lower East Side : The United Hebrew Trades , the International Ladies ’ Garment Workers ’ Union , and most importantly , the very popular Yiddish Daily Forward .
This was the period in which extreme radicals — like Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman — were giants in the Jewish community , and when almost all the Jewish giants — among them Abraham Cahan , Morris Hillquit , and the young Morris R. Cohen — were radicals .
Even Samuel Gompers , when speaking before Jewish audiences , felt it necessary to use radical phrases .
The result was a radical mainstream Jewish culture that persisted in New York and elsewhere into the 1960s and beyond .
With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution , many Jews opted out of the Socialist Party , resulting in a Jewish Communist subculture that was also entirely mainstream within the Jewish community .
Kagan ’s comments in her thesis suggest a sympathy with this radical Jewish culture — even a desire to carry it to fruition .
Everything we know about her indicates that she continues to be immersed in a Jewish culture whose attitudes are well to the left of the American mainstream–a subculture that was hostile to the traditional people and culture of the US and has now become a hostile elite .
This fits well with Kagan ’s childhood in New York ’s Upper West Side — described by Dan Freedman as “ as conservative ’s worst nightmare . ”
During her college years she wrote , “ Where I grew up _ on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side _ nobody ever admitted to voting for Republicans . ”
Elena Kagan and many of this culture ’s children emerged from the Upper West Side political cauldron as committed to making the world a better place for all , mindful that everyday people can affect change as teachers , doctors , lawyers _ and , yes , even journalists _ and make government work for the common good .
There is no indication that Kagan has changed her views , and there ’s not much doubt that indeed she will be a judicial activist on the left .
Fitton quotes from her Oxford thesis :
As men and as participants in American life , judges will have opinions , prejudices , values .
Perhaps most important , judges will have goals .
And because this is so , judges will often try to mold and steer the law in order to promote certain ethical values and achieve certain social ends .
Such activity is not necessarily wrong or invalid .
Well , at least we know what we can expect when Kagan gets on the court .

Obama fired General Stanley McChrystal today and replaced him with the globalist General David Petraeus .
Obama said McChrystal ’s actions undermined civilian control of the military and asked the Senate to confirm Petraeus immediately .
In announcing Petraeus ’ nomination , Obama said institutions are stronger than individuals .
One wonders what Thomas Jefferson would have to say about that statist assertion .
The new overseer of the opium fields in Afghanistan attended the Bildberger confab held in Spain this year and also attended the secretive meeting in Greece last year .
Since Petraeus is a seasoned establishment insider , his appointment is a natural .
He is a member of the one - world CFR .
The CIA ’s favorite newspaper , the Washington Post , listed Petraeus as number eight on its list of “ Top 100 Global Thinkers . ”
In April Petraeus ’ name was floated as a possible presidential candidate .
“ Neocon warmongers love Petraeus .
The American Enterprise Institute — one of a handful of neocon think tanks behind the push to invade Iraq and kill a million plus Iraqis — bestowed its 2010 Irving Kristol Award on Petraeus .
The late Kristol is considered to be the godfather of the neocon movement , ” we wrote at the time .
“ He ’s a serious guy , ” declared the “ hawk ” ( neocon ) Rep. Pete King in October .
“ He ’s about the only one out there who could really challenge Obama , who is n’t as strong as he was a few months ago …
I think he ’s an independent , and I have n’t talked to him about this , but I ’d encourage him …
I ’d be open to it . ”
Democrat Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations has compared Petraeus to Eisenhower , the last general president ( who incidentally warned about the influence of the military - industrial complex ) .
The GOP , argues Beinart , will “ need someone with enough personal appeal to avoid the culture war food - fights that obsess the Republican base , someone who exudes moral traditionalism and fiscal prudence without appearing fanatical or intolerant . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
In other words , somebody who is not associated with the Tea Party and other political threats to the establishment .
Petraeus ’ party affiliation is a mystery but he has been courted by both parties as a modern - day Eisenhower , the San Francisco Chronicle claims .
Both Republicans and Democrats love the General .
Not that party matters — when it comes to forever war both sides of globalist one party system agree it is imperative the Pentagon attack small countries and slaughter grade school children , grandmothers , and wedding party members .
Afghanistan ’s opium is a prize that must be retained and controlled .
Petraeus ’ presidential aspiration was put into serious jeopardy after he “ fainted ” during a Senate hearing on the war on Afghanistan a few days ago .
It is speculated that he actually had a seizure .
Petraeus was instrumental in the illegal invasion of Iraq .
He assumed command of USCENTCOM and was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries from Egypt to Pakistan , including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom .
He has thrown his support behind Obama ’s “ Afghanistan strategy , ” that is to say endless war against an enemy created by the CIA and an ever - increasing body count of innocent civilians .
In short , he is perfect for the forever war in Afghanistan .
No sooner was Petraeus selected than John McCain said he will pressure him to abandon Obama ’s “ arbitrary ” July 2011 withdrawal date and instead base troop drawdown on the current conditions in Afghanistan .

Nestful : A Simple Ruby HTTP / REST
Client Library
By Peter Cooper
Nestful is a simple HTTP / REST client library for Ruby , developed by Alex MacCaw ( of Juggernaut ) fame .
Nestful allows you to consume basic
Web services easily , usually in a single line of code .
It can deal with JSON , buffered downloads , and callbacks out of the box .
HTTParty is the current , de - facto simple HTTP / REST client library used by most Rubyists ( when net / http wo n't do or when Typhoeus is too overkill ) but Nestful differs enough from HTTParty to live alongside it .
While HTTParty encourages you to build up some structure and separate the types of resources you 're accessing into classes ( that HTTParty then extends ) , Nestful offers a simpler , " just call a method from anywhere " approach .
Some basic Nestful examples :
Nestful.get ' http://example.com' # => " body " Nestful.post ' http://example.com', : format => : form # => " body " Nestful.get ' http://example.com', : params => {: nestled => {: params => 1}} Nestful.get ' http://example.com', : format => : json #=> {:json_hash =>
1} Nestful :: Resource.new ( ' http://example.com')['assets'][1].get(:format => :xml ) # => {:xml_hash =>
1}
Nestful 's features include :
Geeks , as a general rule , are pretty easy - going .
We like to think things through , so passionate confrontations are n't commonplace for us .
When we get well and properly provoked , though , watch out !
We wo n't stop talking until every last point that we can think of has been made at least twice .
So , what do you say to provoke a geek ?
Glad you asked !
20 . " No real programmer would ever use PHP . " -
This wo n't work for every geek , of course , but for those it works on , it should work really well .
19 . " Comic books are just for kids ! " - I 'm sure you 've heard this one before — I know I certainly heard it often enough in high school , and even though it 's even less true now than it was then , I 'm sure comic book afficionados still hear it today .
18 . " Role - playing games are just for people who can't deal with real life . " -
There are , sadly , still a lot of people who think anyone who plays D&D must live in his parents ' basement and bathe once a month .
Such people must be put straight , and immediately !
17 . " The Pirates of the Caribbean movies are so realistic ! " - I doubt many people actually believe this , but there are an awful lot of misconceptions about pirates out there , so you never know .
16 . " Yeah , I got an Xbox 360 so my daughter could play Hello Kitty games .
Is it really good for anything else ? " -
We 've hit the ones that are hard for me even to type , now ...
OKM
15 . " Mac , Windows , or Linux ?
Does it really make a difference ? " -
An argument so old its original form was probably first written down in hieroglyphs , I know , but I do n't know a single geek it would n't work on — myself included .
__14 . " The Ewoks were the best thing about the original Star Wars trilogy . " / " Greedo shot first ! " __- I could n't decide between the two .
If one does n't work , I 'll bet the other one would .
13 . " Tolkien ?
Ehhh , I prefer Terry Brooks ! " - I almost feel like I should argue with myself just for writing that .
I 'm going to let the top two stand for themselves .
12 . " Joss Whedon is a hack ! "
11 . " I do n't see what 's so bad about DRM ! "
10 . " Internet Explorer is much better than Firefox__ — why else would it be the most popular browser ? "
__
9 . " Jar - Jar Binks was so funny , I wish he'd been in the original trilogy , too ! "
8 . " Homeopathy works , no matter what ' science ' has to say about it . "
__7 . " If open - source software was really that great , they 'd charge for it . "
__-
I 've actually had people say this to me a few times over the years .
As a software engineer who 's used lots of open - source projects , I 'm particularly sensitive to this one .
6 . " The best Star Trek film was number five , no question . "
__5 . " Dreamworks kicks Pixar 's animated butt ! " __-
I like a lot of Dreamworks films , do n't get me wrong .
But there 's really just no contest .
4. " Jim Henson was nothing more than a glorified puppeteer . " -
Anyone who would actually say this ought to be strung up by his thumbnails , of course .
3 . " Batman is so boring — he does n't even have any super powers ! "
2 . " Geeks are all like those guys in Revenge of the Nerds , right ? "
1 . " Who needs Gmail ?
I 've got AOL ! "
Any other good ones come to mind for you ?

Water is essential for life on Earth , and it is a resource we all take for granted .
Yet it has many surprising properties that have baffled scientists for centuries .
Seemingly simple ideas such as how water freezes are not understood because of water 's unique properties .
Now scientists are utilising increased computer power and novel algorithms to accurately simulate the properties of water on the nanoscale , allowing complex structures of hundreds or thousands of molecules to be seen and understood .
" Using state - of - the - art computer simulation techniques we can now explain some of the mysterious properties of water such as how ice crystals grow , the structure of ice under high pressure or the behaviour of water in outer space .
Understanding these particular processes of water has great relevance to important contemporary issues such as cloud formation and climate change , cryo-preservation of cells , and even the search for extra-terrestrial life ! " says Professor Angelos Michaelides , London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Chemistry , University College London .
Normal ice has an underlying hexagonal structure , as the shape of a snowflake reveals .
The hexagonal lattice is quite simple , but there are certain rules about how the water molecules pack inside the crystal that make ice much more complicated and interesting than we might expect .
A water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom .
The oxygen atom has two remaining pairs of electrons .
These lone electron pairs and the hydrogen atoms are as far apart as possible , creating a tetrahedral arrangement .
The oxygen lies at the centre of a tetrahedron ( a three - dimensional shape made up of four identical equal - sided triangles ) with the hydrogen atoms and the lone electron pairs in the direction of each of the corners .
Water molecules in an ice crystal cannot fit together in any old way , because of their tetrahedral shape and the particular way they are held together .
Using a branch of mathematics called combinatorics we can work out how many possible arrangements there are .
There are six ways of choosing two out of the four corners of the tetrahedron for the two hydrogen atoms .
So there are a total of six possible orientations of a water molecule sitting within a larger ice crystal .
But not every potential arrangement of tetrahedra is possible , as each hydrogen atom of the water molecules must bond with a lone electron pair of an adjacent molecule .
In fact , when the constraints of hydrogen - bonding are taken into account , the number of possible orientations for a given molecule is no longer six , but 3 / 2 .
Therefore , for a crystal of ice with N molecules there are ( 3/2 ) N possible ways to arrange the water molecules .
The ice cube in your drink has a volume of about 2cm3 , containing about 6 × 1022 molecules .
Our maths tells us that there are about ( 3/2 ) 6 × 1022 ways that the water molecules could be arranged in that ice cube .
That is more possibilities than the number of ways you could have drawn the lotto numbers every week since the Big Bang !
Therefore , every single ice cube ever created will probably have a different arrangement of water molecules within it .
This article is based on the Maths Inside project , a collaboration of Plus and Mathematics Promotion Unit ( run by the London Mathematical Society and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications ) , in conjunction with the A molecule 's eye view of water exhibit and the Royal Society .
The Maths Inside project reveals the maths behind four specially chosen exhibits at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition .

Daniel Radcliffe is attached to star in the remake of the Oscar winning ‘ All Quiet on the Western Front ’ .
He will play Paul , the lead in the film .
The role will be challenging for Radcliffe , but he does have the chops .
The original was released in 1930 , and won Best Picture .
Radcliffe should begin working on this soon , as the final Harry Potter has wrapped .
Charlie Sheen has been contacted to reprise his role as Ricky ‘ Wild Thing ’ Vaughn in ‘ Major League 3 ’ .
The story from writer / director David Ward – “ It ’s 20 years later , and Wild Thing comes out of retirement to work with this 19 - year - old player .
We ’ve actually got three new characters in the new film .
And if the new film is popular , they could carry the franchise on . ”
Ward also stated that he hopes to get Tom Berenger , Corbin Bernsen , and even Wesley Snipes back .
Although , so far Sheen has been the only one he has talked to .
Director Guy Ritchie has said that he wants Daniel Day Lewis to play villain Professor Moriarty in the sequel to ‘ Sherlock Holmes ’ .
The film is scheduled for a December 16 , 2011 release and filming should begin soon .
If Day - Lewis passes on the project , Sean Penn , Javier Bardem , and Gary Oldman will also be considered .
Freida Pinto and John Lithgow have signed to join ‘ Rise of the Apes ’ , the prequel to ‘ Planet of the Apes ’ .
They join James Franco in the film to be released summer 2011 .
Lithgow will reportedly play Franco ’s character ’s father ( who suffers from Alzheimer ’s ) while Pinto , the female lead , plays a primatologist who also works in the lab .
An image of Nickelodeon cartoon Dora the Explorer created late last year by Debbie Groben of Sarasota , Florida , for a contest for the fake news site FreakingNews.com .
The image , and others like it that question or make fun of the Latina cartoon character 's immigration status and country of origin , have been in wide circulation since Arizona passed a controversial immigration law .
Groben , who is against the immigration law , said she just created it for fun and did n't know it would enter the immigration debate

Slayer endorses International Day of Slayer ( June 6 , 2010 )
Today , Slayer 's official mailing list contained this update about the International Day of Slayer .
We 're very thankful for their support , and want the shirts , now that they 've shown up in our inboxes .
It 's worth signing up to their mailing list because sometimes they send out coupons for merch or shows , and clipping coupons is actually kind of occult .

It 's advertised as the " pure essence of masculinity " , a fragrance with a musky , sensual aroma that , by implication , women are bound to find irresistible .
But what 's not mentioned in the marketing is that Calvin Klein 's Obsession for Men has also proved a hit with jaguars in the Guatemalan jungle .
Scientists are using the cologne to lure the elusive big cats to hidden cameras in the Maya biosphere reserve , a protected tropical rainforest spanning 8,100 sq miles , to help them record , monitor and protect the animals .
The jaguars have been filmed rubbing , sniffing and pawing objects sprayed with the scent , a reaction which perhaps Calvin Klein 's perfumers had not anticipated .
The discovery was made by the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Bronx zoo in New York .
In an attempt to draw cheetahs to camera traps , it experimented with 23 different scents .
Estée Lauder 's Beautiful detained the cats for two seconds on average , Revlon 's Charlie lasted 15.5 seconds while Nina Ricci's L'Air du Temps managed 10.4 minutes .
Obsession for Men 's musky scent scored best : 11.1 minutes .
News spread to field researchers , including those in Guatemala .
They sprayed it on a rag staked close to heat and motion - sensitive cameras in the hope jaguars would linger long enough for proper images .
The cologne did better than that .
It prompted " cheek - rubbing behaviour " which yielded hair and DNA samples .
Male and female jaguars seemed equally keen .
The project has also captured seldom - seen jaguar mating rituals .
" We 're just starting to get an idea of how jaguars behave in their habitat , " Roan Balas McNab , WSC's Guatemala programme director , told the Wall Street Journal .
" Before we used Obsession for Men we were n't able to get these images at all . "
Ann Gottlieb , who helped create the scent , told the paper : " It 's a combination of this lickable vanilla heart married to this fresh green top note – it creates tension . "
The cologne also had synthetic " animal " notes like civet , a musky substance secreted by the cat of the same name , giving it particular sex appeal .
" It sparks curiosity with humans and , apparently , animals . "
Adverts for Obsession for Men , one of the world 's top 10 best - selling men's scents , tend to feature models wearing little except glistening baby oil .
Researchers plan to expand the use of the cologne to wilderness areas in Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Peru and Ecuador .
Some buy the £ 41 bottles at duty - free shops en route to forests , others rely on donations .

Plus , Tea Partiers in Utah at a Republican Party convention denied the Senate nomination to three term incumbent Bob Bennett , despite the fact that Bennett is popular with Republicans in Utah .
By doing this , Tea Partiers are creating a situation where Democrats can gain this seat in the general election , despite the fact that Utah is a very conservative state .
Sarah Palin is toxic
Commentators keep telling us how influential Sarah Palin 's endorsements are , and even if the whole " mama grizzly " meme is clearly overstated , there 's no quibbling with the fact that Palin has pull among GOP primary voters .
But the more interesting point to be made about Palin is how toxic she 's become among the broader electorate .
In fact , buried in the internals of the new NBC / Wall Street Journal poll is an amusing number : A majority see a Palin endorsement as a clear negative .
The poll asked people how they 'd respond if a Congressional candidate had various hypothetical attributes .
Asked how they 'd feel if a candidate were " endorsed by Sarah Palin , " the response was ....
Enthusiastic about this attribute 8 Comfortable with this attribute 17 Have some reservations about this attribute 15 Very uncomfortable with this attribute 37
So a majority , 52 % , reacted negatively .
And an astonishing 37 percent would be " very uncomfortable " about a Palin endorsement , more than four times the eight percent who would be " enthusiastic " about it .
Even better , there were only two attributes a candidate might have that were seen as worse than a Palin endorsement : Supporting Bush 's economic policies ; and supporting the elimination of various Federal agencies and / or Social Security .
Obviously those pointing to Palin 's influence are only concerned with her impact among GOP primary voters .
But the above finding is another mark of just how toxic Palin has become to the rest of the world -- and how out of sync with public opinion the media obsession with Palin 's influence really is .
Regular readers of the Motherlode comments may have noticed the contributions of William McCloskey , who shows up here almost daily , usually to disagree with me .
His style is , to use his word , “ curmudgeonly , ” honed during 40 years as a journalist , first covering “ homicides , armed robberies , suicides , fires , traffic fatalities . . . the ‘ good ’ stuff , ” and then making “ buckets of money managing publications for a software venture ” ( again , his words ) .
He did most of this as a single father .
His son , Pete , is now 36 , and Bill thinks that I do n’t spend nearly enough time writing about fathers in general or single fathers in particular .
Last week he e-mailed to say , “ I think it ’s time you changed the blog ’s subtitle to ‘ Adventures in Mothering ’ and dropped any pretense of being aware of or interested in men ’s positive roles in parenting . ”
I wrote back with what I thought was a better idea — why does n’t he write periodic guest posts from a single - dad ’s perspective ?
Today is the first .
Welcome Bill .
ADVENTURES IN ( SINGLE MALE ) PARENTING
By William McCloskey
Let ’s hope you do n’t navigate the critical passages of your life according to stereotypes and generalizations , but most people do .
There — I just engaged in a whopper myself .
But I think you know what I mean .
For instance , say “ single mom ” and many of us flash on the cultural stereotype of a noble , attractive , impoverished , underemployed and harried young woman left in the lurch with three adorable little kids after some no - good oaf ( a ) went to prison , ( b ) ran off with a floozy , or ( c ) died early from drink , drugs or crime after years of beating her .
Why this perception ?
Without doubt — tragically — the stereotype is the fact for thousands of women in these very situations .
But are they truly “ typical ? ”
Perhaps the stereotype is so hearty because so many book , magazine , blog and newspaper writers ( as well as their TV - talker counterparts ) wallow in this stuff .
It sells .
Now say “ single dad ” and it ’s likely you ’ll conjure some lummox in an apron spooning scorched macaroni - and - cheese into a soup bowl for an ill - dressed tot with a bad haircut while the school bus beeps at the curb .
Why is that ?
Well , you could ask the producers of “ Mr. Mom ” and “ Kramer vs. Kramer . ”
What sells and what ’s real are rarely so conflated as the facts about single parenthood .
For instance , I had the challenge — and the absolute gift and privilege — of being a real - deal single dad .
Cooking , cleaning , laundry , food and clothes shopping , applying Band - Aids , helping with homework , teacher relations and all the dozens of things erstwhile parents do for their children .
Fortunately , my son survived and is thriving .
But in the early days I felt like a freak — shuffling to the back of the room on parents ’ night at his school , shying away from the gaggle of young mothers when I took my boy to the playground , feeling myself an object of curiosity and pity for the moms who were fully engaged and seemingly very skilled and collaborative in their role .
That ’s because I did n’t have a peer group .
In my world , men did n’t raise their children by themselves .
But wait , the facts tell a much different story .
You would n’t know this from the popular media , but — you heard it here first — there are 2.3 million American fathers raising their children solo .
The U.S. Census Bureau says that among single parents living with their children , 18 percent are men .
Among these fathers , 11 percent are raising three or more of their own children under 18 years of age .
According to Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support : 2007 , issued by the census bureau last November , there are about 13.7 million single parents in the United States today , and those parents are responsible for raising 21.8 million children .
About 84 percent of custodial parents are mothers and 16 percent are fathers .
In other words , more than one in six single parents is a man .
The government report is n’t complicated by social and political issues concerning parents ’ circumstances .
Irrelevant considerations like “ teen mother ” and “ children out of wedlock ” do n’t enter into it .
Neither do distinctions about the expanding varieties of parenthood — adoption and surrogacy are treated no differently than straight old hetero conception and birth .
Nor does the analysis address the quality of these child - parent arrangements .
That ’s beyond the scope of the census and not something you can count or easily quantify anyway .
And there ’s not much in it about extortionate child support , “ visitation blackmail , ” remarriage and step - parents and so many other dark interparent issues that complicate and uglify some custody situations .
This focus on the here - and - now is important , in my opinion , because our concern should be the welfare and success of the children , however they were called into existence and however ( and by whomever ) they are being raised .
Indulge me in another two stereotypes .
Many men believe that when something breaks in the home , a guy is likely to grab a tool box .
A woman is likely to grab the Yellow Pages .
When a man wants to get in shape , he ’s likely to dig out his big brother ’s weight bench from of the basement .
A woman is likely to take something called “ a class ” in yoga , Pilates , boot camp or some other strengthening discipline with several other women not - too - very - unlike herself .
In my experience , such gender - defined tendencies hold for parenting styles , too .
Eventually — very eventually — I muddled into an informal single - father peer group just by noticing the same guys hanging around the same playgrounds with the same little kids .
After a few exploratory nods , the inevitable “ how about those Steelers ? ” queries , and other preliminaries , we began to talk about our situations and experiences .
We all had different explanations of what “ had happened ” to our children ’s mothers , but found that we were mostly in the same boat — differences in employment , housing and income notwithstanding .
What amused me was that we fathers sort of grunted cordially at one another in the early phases of acquaintance while — right under our noses , but unnoticed — our children were happily learning one another ’s names and sibling connections and creating silly nicknames for their new playground pals .
But we fathers generally agreed that we and our little ones were doing O.K .
We felt we did n’t need or welcome gratuitous and pitying advice from meddlesome mommies who presumed to instruct us , as if from some divinely appointed pinnacle of wisdom .
We were n’t looking to be mothers , after all .
We were fathers .
We understood the difference .
We found that women had entire industries and cultural phenomena devoted to inculcating and nourishing expertise in motherhood and its subset , single motherhood .
If you could conjure any single mother ’s circumstances , any circumstances whatever , you could find a dozen books offering her advice and guidance .
For single fathers , not so much — and for good reason .
I do n’t know even one man who would consider buying a book about parenting and I do n’t know a single father who would take a parenting class .
But I absolutely would seek informal advice from my mother and my two sisters who each had three children , as well as from a few other women with children I knew from work and from those playgrounds .
Why ?
I carefully chose the word “ muddled ” a few sentences above because that ’s what I did .
Took expert advice on medical and legal matters , but otherwise trusted my instincts and energy and ad - libbed the whole thing .
Tried to figure out what was good for my boy and set about making it happen for him as well as I could .
I wanted results , not elegance .
I wanted to know how I was doing , not how I felt about how I was doing .
Are men and women different ?
You betcha .
But so what ?
When these discussions arise , they should never , ever be about the parents .
They must always be about the little ones who give us their trust that we ’ll behave like adults , and so , bring grace into our lives .
That terrible sound you 'll be hearing over the next few weeks is the vuvuzela , which Dash described last year as " South Africa 's answer to the Thunderstick . "
His story is below .

If you 've watched the Confederations Cup , you have no doubt been annoyed by the mysterious buzzing sound that drowns out even the TV announcers .
Well , get used to it , because that sound will haunt you throughout next year 's World Cup .
The sound is from the vuvuzela , South Africa 's answer to the Thunderstick .
By itself , it 's just a small plastic trumpet that probably cost less than a dollar to make and creates no known musical notes .
But when thousands of people toot them simultaneously , you get a loud , incessant hum that makes the entire stadium sound like it 's being attacked by angry bees .
It 's a staple at any South African soccer match and ... surprise !
Everyone hates it !
FIFA president Sepp Blatter revealed this week that broadcasters want the instrument banned at next year 's World Cup .
But to his eternal credit , the Fifa chief also sprang to the defence of the humble trumpet , saying people must accept that it is part and parcel of football in South Africa .
" That is what African and South Africa football is all about - noise , excitement , dancing , shouting and enjoyment , " said the most powerful man in world football .

European fans , both at the tournament and at home , have been complaining about the non -stop trumpeting from the riff raff in the upper deck .
Even some of the players would like to see a ban on the plastic toys that stadiums give out for free .
( They can't concentrate ! )
Fortunately , there 's very little racial or political tension between the Dark Continent and its former European oppressors , so I 'm sure that when millions of Northern Hemisphere - type folks flood the country next summer for the biggest sporting event in history they will be totally tolerant of this charming , yet insanely annoying , local custom .
Why ca n't South Africans enjoy soccer like normal folks — with racist songs and flare guns !

Our economy would become the world ’s most innovative , our elites assured us , if we gave our rich enough incentives to innovate .
We kept to our end of the bargain .
So where ’s the innovation ?
By Sam Pizzigati
The pollsters at Gallup have never asked Americans to name the world ’s most technologically advanced nation .
Neither , apparently , have any other pollsters .
But we do n’t need a pollster to know how Americans would answer that question .
Most Americans , without a moment ’s hesitation , would almost certainly name the United States as the global techno tops .
No other nation , after all , can lay claim to the iPhone or Microsoft or Google .
We must be number one .
Only in our dreams .
The latest stats show the United States lagging far behind on the high - tech benchmarks that matter most in our daily lives .
On broadband speed , for instance , the United States ranks 15th globally in one international comparison , 29th in another .
Indeed , earlier this month , Bloomberg News noted that the federal government ’s current “ national broadband plan , ” if successfully completed , would give most American homes a decade from now “ the same connection speeds available today in Portugal and Japan . ”
Singapore , news reports last week indicated , will have by 2013 a broadband infrastructure fast enough to let the nation ’s every home download a DVD in just a few seconds , at speeds hundreds of times faster than the current U.S. average .
Other nations are also jumping to the global high - tech forefront .
Belgium leads the way in smart IDs , the Netherlands in health tech , South Korea in the “ telematic ” application of info technology to transportation .
The United States has become , in effect , a technological also - ran in one area after another .
How could we not know that ?
What explains the breathtakingly wide gap between technological reality and how Americans perceive it ?
Our gullibility may be the culprit .
Our rich have spent the last 30 years promising us the best of all possible worlds — if in them we put our trust — and we put our faith in that promise .
We let our lawmakers lavish tax breaks and other incentives on rich people because we believed the rich when they told us these incentives would encourage badly needed investments in innovation .
We let corporate CEOs rake in unspeakable fortunes because we believed these execs when they told us they needed rewards bountiful enough to get their entrepreneurial juices flowing .
In the end , our movers and shakers guaranteed , everyone would benefit from all these incentives and rewards .
Investors and executives would become richer , and the rest of us would enjoy the privilege of life in a sublimely innovative economic powerhouse that delivers endless prosperity and great gadgets .
We average Americans , over the past three decades , have done our best to move this storyline along .
And things have worked out fairly well — for investors and executives .
They have most definitely prospered — and continue to prosper , even in troubled times .
The latest evidence : the just - released executive pay data from Silicon Valley .
Eight execs from Northern California ’s high - tech heartland took home over $ 10 million last year .
Silicon Valley ’s top 155 CEOs , the San Jose Mercury News reported last week , together pulled in $ 579 million .
The rest of Silicon Valley ought to be doing quite well , too , at least according to our still reigning rich people - first ideology .
But helping rich people become richer has n’t exactly turned Silicon Valley into an Information Age paradise .
The past decade , observes Mercury News columnist Mike Cassidy , “ has been unkind to those of us who answer to those in the corporate suite , rather than sit in it . ”
Just under a quarter - million Silicon Valley jobs have disappeared over the last 10 years .
Between 2000 and 2008 , the typical Valley household income dropped 6 percent .
The Valley ’s per capita income dropped another 3.5 percent last year .
Housing in Silicon Valley , even after a burst housing bubble , remains ridiculously expensive .
In 2009 , just under half the families looking to buy their first house could n’t afford the price of a typical Silicon Valley family home .
The ostensible good news ?
Analysts have found a “ steep decline ” in Silicon Valley ’s rate of child abuse .
The not - so - good - news behind this heartening stat : Reported cases of child abuse are declining , notes the Silicon Valley Network , because social worker layoffs have meant that “ fewer reports of child abuse and neglect are investigated and more abused children are left without help . ”
Amid this carnage , two former Silicon Valley CEOs , eBay ’s Meg Whitman and Hewlett - Packard ’s Carly Fiorina , will be sitting on California ’s statewide ballot this November , as the GOP candidates for governor and U.S. Senate .
Both candidates are touting their can - do , high - tech CEO experience as ample reason they deserve high office .
Americans , Whitman and Fiorina must figure , have been trusting in rich people for three decades .
To win this November , they only need that trust to continue for five more months .

I once again participated in the ICFP programming contest .
This year I ranked 25th , which is one of my better performances .
One of the first tasks was dealing with a two trit input / two trit output logic gate where a trit is like a bit , but can be one of three values : 0 , 1 , or 2 .
There was a server where you could upload circuits designs built from these gates .
Each output lead could be only hooked to exactly one input lead .
There was one input lead for the circuit and out output lead which you could read values .
There were also " backward " links in the circuit that would delay the signal by one clock cycle .
The problem was to figure out what the gate does .
After uploading your circuit you can see the output , of some unknown input stream .
To figure this out I first uploaded a circuit with one gate and observed its output .
Then I hooked another gate up to that gate .
This allowed be to observe the output of a known input and start deducing the logic table for the gate .
Eventually enough testing of this sort reveals the entire logic table for the gate ( especially by ( correctly ) assuming the initial value of the backward links are 0 ) .
There are only 18 unknowns to fill out .
Apparently the circuit outputs ( L - R,2 - L*R ) where L and R are the input values ( all computations are modulo 3 ) , but I did n’t realize this at the time .
The next step was to build a circuit that outputs a given key string .
To begin I built three basic circuits .
The +0 , or identity circuit which passes the input to its output , the +1 circuit which adds 1 ( mod 3 ) to its input , and the +2 circuit which , you guessed it , adds 2 ( mod 3 ) to its output .
At first I defined the +2 circuit as two successive +1 circuits , but because more points will be scored later with smaller circuits I eventually made a specialized + 2 circuit .
To output the key string I backchained a series of these basic circuits together .
Each backwards link delays the output by one , so with enough back links I can delay the meaningless input long enough to output by key string ( or any string at all ) .
At the beginning of my back chain I put the + n 0 circuit where n 0 is the first digit I want to output .
The input of the backlink to this first circuit is 0 , so I first output n 0 .
The second circuit in my chain is +( n 1 - n 0 ) .
On the first clock pulse the backlink input to this circuit is 0 , so it outputs n 1 - n 0 which is feed back to the first circuit , but delayed by one cycle .
On the second clock plus the first circuit takes this input and outputs n 1 as desired .
The successive circuits in my back chain are defined in a similar way .
This ( plus some other small omitted tasks ) took me about 10 or 12 hours to do .
I believe I was the third person to submit a solution that generates the key string .
The next task was to decode a specification for a car engine that was encoded in some unknown trinary self - delimiting code .
We are told that the code can encode arbitrary natural numbers , and tuples , and tuples of tuples , etc .
We know a car engine consists of a series of chambers and each chamber consists of two pipes , and each pipe consists of a series of segments , and each segment is connected to one of up to 6 fuel tanks .
Each chamber is either a main chamber or an auxiliary chamber .
To crack this code you can submit your own attempts at encoding cars as trinary strings and read the error messages .
First up was to understand the code for natural numbers .
After a few trials I eventually got error messages about large numbered fuel tanks being not properly connected .
Things like " … tank number 74 … " .
This means somewhere I have a 74 encoded in my string .
By fiddling with the trits , I eventually gained some control over this tank number .
For example , I saw that the substring " 2210010 " encoded the number 16 , while " 2210011 " encoded the number 17 .
In fact , here the last three digits are part of a standard ( ish ) trinary number system , so " 2210222 " is the number 39 .
Eventually I found to get one more than this the prefix needs to change .
The string " 22110000 " represents the number 40 , and here the last 4 digits follow a standard trinary encoding .
With more fiddling I found the smaller numbers are represented without a " 22 " prefix .
" 0 " represents 0 , " 10 " represents 1 , " 11 " represents 2 , and " 12 " represents 3 . Finally we get the " 22 " prefix with the number 4 , which is represented by " 22000 "
Here the last 2 digits follow a standard trinary encoding .
I noticed that the after the " 22 " there was an code that represented the number of trinary digits that would follow .
So " 22 " followed by " 0 " is followed by 2 trinary digits .
" 22 " followed by " 10 " is followed by 3 trinary digits .
" 22 " followed by " 11 " is followed by 4 trinary digits .
And , not surprisingly , I found that " 22 " followed by " 12 " is followed by 5 trinary digits .
The big break through is that " 22 " followed by " 22000 " is followed by 6 trinary digits !
So the string following the " 22 " is a encoding of a number that represents the number of digits less 2 .
With numbers out of the way , it was time to tackle tuples .
They were encoded in a similar way " 2210 " is followed by a tuple of 3 things ( such as numbers ) .
" 220 " is followed by a tuple of 2 things .
" 1 " is followed by a singleton and " 0 " is the empty tuple .
Surprisingly I never make the connection between numbers and tuples that was pointed out to me after the contest .
The numbers are encoded as tuples of digits !
I had the encoding figured out by about 14 hours into the contest or so , and I went to bed .
The final part of contest was to build cars and fuel cars .
To fuel a car required building a matrix for each tank ( of dimension of one ’s choosing ) .
A pipe multiplies together all the matrices from the fuel tanks it is hooked up to .
A chamber runs when the top pipe ’s matrix output is greater than to the bottom pipes output at every coefficient .
Main chambers also require the top - left matrix entry of the top pipe ’s output to be strictly greater than the bottom pipe ’s corresponding entry .
I never got around to building my own cars since I could n’t decide on a good way to design cars that were hard to fuel .
This left me with the task of fueling cars , which I found very difficult .
Eventually I designed a very simple program that checked if there was a subset of tanks that always occurred in greater numbers in the top pipes then in the bottom pipes .
In this case there was a simple solution of assigning the matrix [ [ 2 ] ] to these tanks and [ [ 1 ] ] to the other tanks .
This solved a disturbingly large number of the user submitted cars .
The other trivial solution I had was to try all 2×2 matrices of 0s and 1s .
( for technical reasons that I glossed over , the top - left entry of a matrix always had to be at least 1 , which simplifies this search ) .
I also tried all 3×3 matrices for cars with no more than 3 tanks .
This was slow , but did solve a number of cars as well .
I solved a few other cars by hand , but that is all the innovation I had .
The real challenge was keeping up with the sumbitted cars !
Each team could submit up to 72 cars , and soon the submissions where getting out of hand .
Uploading by hand because tedious .
I lost track of which cars I had solved and which cars I had n’t .
I needed to bring some order and automation to this process .
One problem was that I could only download car specifications while logged in .
So now was finally the time to learn to use HTTP 4000 ’s cookie support .
Actually , it was so easy to use , there is n’t really anything to say about it .
I would log in by hand and copy my cookie into my program that downloaded all cars .
To ease uploading I learned to use xclip .
My solver would automatically put the solution into my copy / paste buffer , making pasting into the web form a snap .
This did n’t last too long , as it was still too tedious .
Soon I switched to using HTTP 4000 ’s form support .
The form support is experimental , undocumented , but is pretty trivial and does work .
Now my solver could upload solutions directly to the server .
I really enjoyed the contest , but that is probably because I did so well .
The ICFP contests are often more like puzzle contests that involve programming than programming contests .
But I really like these sorts of puzzle contests , so I hope they keep this sort of style .
Hockey ’s longest shutout streak has ended .
Women are finally being welcomed into the game ’s ultimate old boys ’ club — the Hockey Hall of Fame .
In an historic breakthrough , two female players — including Toronto ’s Angela James — will be inducted into the shinny shrine at a ceremony this November , the Hall announced on Tuesday .
James , a four - time gold medallist for Canada at the first women ’s world championships in the 1990s , will be joined by American star Cammi Granato .
Once fierce rivals , they are now linked as pioneers , entering the hockey Hall that has been venerating men since 1945 .
“ This is a day I never really thought would ever happen , ” said James , who now lives in Richmond Hill .
“ I look at this as being a great day for female hockey . ”
The Hall added just one man , Sarnia ’s Dino Ciccarelli .
He became the 245th male player honoured .
The Illinois - born Granato , who once played university hockey in Canada for the Concordia Stingers , called it “ a dream ” for female players to finally be inducted into the Hall .
“ It ’s almost unfathomable for a woman , ” she said .
While some critics might believe more than the ice has frozen over with women now embraced by the hallowed institution , the downtown Toronto Hall actually changed its selection procedure this year to be more female friendly .
While women have always been eligible , they previously had to compete with men for the four spots open to athletes each year .
Now two women can be inducted annually , their accomplishments judged on their own merit .
The induction of James and Granato , selected by an 18 - member , all - male committee , wo n’t be just a one - off , token gesture , said Bill Hay , chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame ’s board of directors .
“ It ’s time for females to be in , ” he said .
“ Changing the voting regulations . . . really fits with our long - range plan .
In addition to her heroics on the international stage , James was a medallist at 12 national championships , earning MVP honours at eight of them .
" I am very proud of what Pat has been able to accomplish , " said head coach Mike Singletary .
" He is the epitome of what a 49er is all about .
Pat has had to overcome a lot in his life and has maintained the ability to stay focused on his goals .
Before it is all said and done , he may go down as one of the best to play the position .
I am thankful that our organization has realized Pat is one of the core pieces to this puzzle , and I am excited for our community , fans , coaches and players , that we will have Pat here for a very long time . "
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday is scheduled to consider — and appears likely to approve — an exception to the city 's Arizona boycott allowing a 10 - month extension of a multimillion - dollar agreement with red- light camera operator American Traffic Solutions , which is based Scottsdale .
The firm operates cameras at 32 city intersections that catch tens of thousands of red light violators each year .
The council 's Public Safety Committee says the exception is justified because red light cameras provide a " significant benefit to public safety . "
The boycott exemption request comes as a new financial analysis of Los Angeles ' red light camera program has found it is costing the city about $ 300,000 a year .
Last month , a lopsided majority of the council and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa suspended most travel and contracting with Arizona in protest of a new state law requiring police officers to determine the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and also suspect are in the country illegally .
The law encourages racial profiling and violates constitutional rights , according to Los Angeles officials , a charge Arizona 's governor and other backers of the law deny .
HERE we go again .
For the second time in a year , a childless , unmarried woman in her 50s has been nominated to be a justice on the Supreme Court and the critics have come out swinging .
This time Elena Kagan , the former dean of Harvard ’s law school , who is now solicitor general , has been described as having sacrificed a home and personal life in her quest for a brilliant legal career .
It all sounds eerily like when Sonia Sotomayor , who is 55 and single after a brief marriage when she was younger , was appointed to the Supreme Court last August and had to deflect suggestions that she treated colleagues and close friends like an extended family because she had no children of her own .
Deborah Rhode , director of the Center on the Legal Profession at Stanford Law School , said such stereotypes are unfair but common given society ’s double standard when it comes to single women and work .
She said she got a phone call last week from a reporter questioning whether Ms. Kagan was equipped to rule on workplace issues considering that she had never had children .
“ I did n’t think you needed to actually be a mother to appreciate the challenges facing working mothers , ” Ms. Rhode said she told the reporter .
“ I do think it is a step back if we start to penalize women for not making the conventional choice . ”
Besides , Ms. Rhode added : “ I resist the notion that the only way to be happy in the world is you have to be married .
We want a world where people can make a variety of choices and be happy . ”
Gigaba met with the Justice Alliance of South Africa ( Jasa ) this week to discuss its draft legislation on the matter .
The was part of his ongoing work in “ providing stewardship ” to the Films and Publication Board ( FPB ) , Gigaba said .
Jasa director John Smyth presented the draft bill and the legal opinion on the constitutional issues related to the bill .
Jasa ’s draft internet and cellphone pornography bill proposed that pornography be filtered out at the tier one service providers to avoid it entering the country .
The bill was aimed at the total ban of pornography on the internet and mobile phones .
Gigaba said it was noted that unlike in the physical world where a reasonable effort could be made for pornography to be kept away from children , in the online world , pornographic sites were often “ parked deliberately next door ” to educational sites , often with names almost identical .
Current legislation , particularly the Film and Publication Act , provided for a ban on child pornography , whereas the proposed bill provided for a total ban on pornography on these electronic channels using the wider definition of pornography already available in the Sexual Offences Act .
“ Cars are already provided with brakes and seatbelts ; it is not an extra that consumers have to pay for .
“ There is no reason why the internet should be provided without the necessary restrictive mechanisms built into it , ” Gigaba said .
He had asked the Law Reform Commission ( LRC ) to provide advice on the possibility of legislating against pornography on the internet , television and mobile phones .
The LRC was currently researching the matter , Gigaba said .

<< Comments and views
Bug 35516 was reported as a memory leak but if memory leaks you would n't notice because you run out of memory first .
Rather than telling you to go read the bug , I can summarize it quickly :
XSLT is part of the web XSLT allows scientific notation for input numbers XSLT allows roman numerals for stringifying numbers ( why ?
it 's likely useful when numbering an ordered list of items , for example )
You can helpfully combine the above by making a document containing the following , as the bug reporter did :
< xsl:number value = " 1e100 " format= " i " / >
and with that you 'll discover that libxml 's XSLT support consumes all available memory in computing the resulting string .
On the one hand , this is just an amusing anecdote ; there are plenty of other ways you can make a page consume all available memory .
( " Doctor , it hurts when I write out 1e100 in unary . " )
On the other hand , every one of these sorts of bugs leads to a full browser crash in single - process browsers .
Mozilla quickly fixed the equivalent bug , but now that I look it seems they 're cherry - picking it onto branches just recently ; who knows how / whether other browser vendors are affected .
My security friends tell me that OOMs are common in browsers so this is n't much of an emergency ; it 's not like there 's any shortage of ways to crash IE .
What this anecdote most goes to show is this : there is a ton of API exposed to the web , more than you would ever expect .
As I like to say to people , sandboxing WebKit is not because we did n't think WebKit was n't a well - written piece of software — its popularity proves it is quite good — but rather that there is just too much code there to be confident it is all safe and correct .

Kidder sifts through sediment of flooded Chinese village to get 2,000 - year - old snapshot of daily life
An anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis is helping to reveal for the first time a snapshot of rural life in China during the Han Dynasty .
The rural farming village of Sanyangzhuang was flooded by silt - heavy water from the Yellow River around 2,000 years ago .
Working with Chinese colleagues , T.R. Kidder , PhD , professor and chair of anthropology in Arts & Sciences , is working to excavate the site , which offers a exceptionally well - preserved view of daily life in Western China more than 2,000 years ago .
The research was presented at the Society for American Archeology meeting in St. Louis in April and highlighted this month in Science , the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
“ It ’s an amazing find , ” Kidder says of the site , which was discovered in 2003 .
“ We are literally sitting on a gold mine of archeology that is untapped . ”
What researchers find fascinating and surprising , says Kidder , is that the town , though located in a remote section of the Han Dynasty kingdom , appears quite well off .
Exploration has revealed tiled roofs , compounds with brick foundations , eight - meter deep wells lined with bricks , toilets , cart and human foot tracks , roads and trees .
An abundance of metal tools , including plow shares , have been found , as well as grinding stones and coins .
Also found are fossilized impressions of mulberry leaves , which researchers see as a sign of silk cultivation .
“ One could make the argument that this is where the Silk Road began , ” Kidder says .
Kidder believes the site could be substantially larger than currently is known .
The flood of sediment that buried the town also covered an area of more than 1,800 square kilometers .
Excavation has revealed two more buried communities beneath Sanyangzhuang .
“ This sedimentary archive goes to all the way back to the Pleistocene Era , ” says Kidder , who has experience digging in silt - laden sites near the Mississippi River .
“ We have a text written in dirt of environmental change through time that ’s associated with the flooding of the Yellow River and its environmental relationships .
We have an opportunity to examine an entire landscape dating from the Han and periods before , ” he says .
Excavated remains of a wall near the site could reveal a walled town , which still is buried in the silt .
Today 's world , as we all know , is faced with multiple threats .
From whichever angle I look at this menace , I always come to the conclusion that salvation can only come through a profound awakening of man to his own personal responsibility , which is at the same time a global responsibility .
If we ran a video game company , maybe , just maybe , those of us who play video games would be like John Riccitiello .
We really could be a boss .
We could believe we 're the good guy .
And we would know things about video games .
Advertisement
We would possess in our core the knowledge absorbed by holding a controller for many minutes of our life .
We would be able to tell anyone what is ( obviously ) good about being able to have brick walls break in a first - person shooter .
We could tell everyone what was ( not so obviously ) wrong with Mirror 's Edge .
Advertisement
We would know these things , because we play video games .
But would knowing things about games make us a better gaming CEO ?
That 's the John Riccitiello question , the question of what happens when a guy who " gets " games , a guy who can hold his own talking about them , is in charge of one of the biggest gaming companies in the world .
It 's not that John Riccitiello is some gamer who got lucky .
He 's a former executive from Pepsi and Sara Lee on his second tour at Electronic Arts .
That would be EA , the company that before Riccitiello 's return was considered an evil empire , an assembly line for games that could be simultaneously shiny and dull , the company that overworked its employees and never even made the second - best game of the year .
That company , gamer John Riccitiello believes , is capable of making the best games in the world .
What The Boss Plays
This is the funny thing :
The boss of one of the biggest video game companies on Earth plays video games .
The driver of the Electronic Arts behemoth that bellows a new Madden , a Need For Speed and dozens of other games into the gaming market each year is a gamer .
Maybe you would find it funny that it is funny .
I have interviewed top gaming executives at Sony , Nintendo , Microsoft and Sega during my nine years covering games — many of them smart , insightful men and women — and I can confidently say that few betrayed more symptoms of having played lots of good video games and having thought deeply about them than EA 's John Riccitiello .
Advertisement
When we spoke earlier this month , Riccitiello told me that being a gamer was n't the only thing that matters when proving one 's qualifications as a gaming CEO .
A boss in his field could maybe even do without it .
But , he added , " Could you imagine , say running a book publisher if you did n't read ?
Or running a movie studio if you do n't watch TV or go to the movies ? "
These are not the words that come from the mouth of Riccitiello 's successful chief competitor , Activision boss Bobby Kotick , who had to explain to Kotaku in June that he did n't mean it when he told a crowd of game creators in February that he does n't play video games .
Advertisement
" I do n't consider myself a hardcore gamer , " Riccitiello told me during the same interview , threatening to shatter the thesis I had formed from the several lengthy of conversations we have had over the past few years , all conducted during his second and current stint at EA where he serves as CEO .
" But I play a lot of products . "
Riccitiello used to talk about playing BioShock — about having finished it , but maybe he was just studying it on the eve of trying to buy the company that made it .
He has finished Portal , if watching the ending on YouTube counts as finishing the game ( It does n't ; but cheating is a gamer tradition ) .
He is a self - professed lapsed Madden player , which means he used to , at least , be there .
Advertisement
Here 's some proof of the concentration of video games in his veins .
It 's the thing he said to me last December when — without warning — I asked him whether EA would make a sequel to the experimental and admired , though critically and commercially shaky , first - person action game Mirror 's Edge :
Advertisement
" I think Mirror 's Edge was a fascinatingly original world .
Fascinatingly original art direction .
Music and sound design was great .
I think the gameplay mechanic was a blast , but was intermittent and the levels did n't work .
You found yourself scratching at walls at times , looking for what to do .
Sometimes you had a roll going , downhill , slide , jump , slide , jump and then you just got stopped .
It sort of got in the way of the fun…
It was like we could n't quite decide if we were building Portal or a runner . "
That sounded to me like someone who is comfortable playing games or at least capable of understanding the gaming experiences of others .

The Impact Of A Player
Riccitiello plays enough to talk the talk and to make a convincing display that he is one of us , a person who just might know where the X button is without looking .
That puts a different spin on the truth that , as a gaming CEO , he is determined to please his stockholders by getting the gamers of the world to part with more money .
Advertisement
Gamers can hope that this gaming CEO understands what it 's like to play .
They can hope he remembers how it feels wielding a controller in a moment when nothing else seems to matter .
He seems to .
And that appears to infuse him with a restless dissatisfaction with today 's video games understood by only the most passionate of gamers — the ones who are hooked but want better - tasting bait .
" When I played games a decade ago or 15 years ago , I was a lot more forgiving , " he told me during our interview this month .
" Part of it was , if you could sort of simulate [ something ] in software , almost anything , it was the first time you saw it .
If you could just pull off the technology and engineering , you did n't necessarily need the same artful insight , and you certainly did n't need the polish .
A lot of it , if you remember games going back to like GoldenEye on the N64 , is that we remember them as a lot better than they are . "
Advertisement
He sees in his customers , the gamers , some of the same gaming habits he sees in himself .
We treat games differently these days , he says : " I think consumers are consuming them differently and I am too .
I 'm probably playing fewer titles , but spending more time with them — they have to earn my respect to get that time . "
Was it something other than his gamer instincts that instilled this idea in Riccitiello ?
It could be sales trends that inspired Riccitiello to re-engineer the EA factory in the last year or so to make fewer , better games .
They 've halved the output and will only (! ) release 36 games this year that were made in - house .
With that they 've also shut down studios and laid off many developers , it should be noted , some of the cuts are ascribed to rising cost of doing business in certain regions .
Advertisement
Why make fewer but better games ?
It could be that it seems less important to make your 37th game of the year after the beating Activision 's Modern Warfare 2 and Nintendo's New Super Mario Bros .
Wii gave most other games last November .
Advertisement
But there 's something else to this EA effort for fewer , better games , something articulated by Riccitiello the gamer when he talks about what he wants in a new video game : " I myself realize that ... I have a much higher standard .
[ A game ] needs to be both exceptionally well executed and very artful .
If graphics are relevant to the game in a meaningful way , it 's gotta be somewhere near the leading edge of what people are able to display on that particular system ... or it feels to me that I 'm just accepting something put together too lazily . "
The old quality standards do n't cut it , he says .
Surely , gamers nod with him .
The reader of a Riccitiello profile may cry out that every aspect of the EA CEO 's quoted gaming habits just so happens to be the expression of an appetite EA 's business plan is designed to feed .
Skepticism aside , try out his praise for the smaller , portable games EA makes — specifically , Boggle on the iPad during a flight from Vancouver to California — and see if it does n't resonate with your gaming life or that of someone you know : " I 've got room in my life for five - minute games too , when they 're well executed .
Most of the time I do n't like the cheesy easy stuff but if it's well executed it 's fine and I 'm having a blast with it . "

Maybe he does know what a gamer wants .
The Player 's Money
John Riccitiello sometimes buys his games in real stores , the way you or I would .
That does not keep him in touch with Joe Gamer .
" To be fair , I probably have more economic resources than most gamers , " he says .
" So even if I were buying them at retail — and I do — I do n't know that that would accomplish anything . "
Advertisement
Money is the breaking point .
Money is the matter about which the CEO gamer 's experience might most differ from the regular gamer 's experience .
A $ 60 credit card charge has n't stung the CEO in a long time .
Should we the gamer be in charge , we would like to think we would remember .
And we would be loathe to raise the price of a game higher .
Yes ?
We would remember how it felt to be the little guy , would n't we ?
As CEO and gamer , Riccitiello is at the forefront of finding new ways for gamers to pay more .
He has not advocated higher game prices .
But he has pushed for gamers to spend more on the games they buy .
He stresses value .
Why encourage the player not to pirate ?
Because , if they pay , they 'll get more , he says .
Why encourage the player to buy a game new instead of used ?
Because they 'll get more for buying new .
Advertisement
It 's all about a transformation Riccitiello has mentioned in most of the interviews I have done with him in the past three years , the transition from selling games ( in CEO - speak , he says " packaged goods " ) to selling services .
Riccitiello , a lover of metaphors , has n't found one that quite works to explain this transition yet .
This month he tried on me the notion that " We do n't sell toasters anymore we sell toast . "
Not quite .
True , EA does n't want to sell you just one thing that you do n't replace for a long time , you know , like a toaster .
They would rather keep providing you with new slices of content after you buy a loaf .
But , well , no , this metaphor crumbles to a crisp .
Advertisement
( More successful is Riccitiello 's go - to metaphor about the console wars — " They make the war .
We make the bullets .
We 'll sell to any of them . " )
Forget toast metaphors .
What feels more correct is Riccitiello 's expression of how gamers play in 2010 and how EA is changing its workflow to accommodate them .
" I used to buy a whole bunch of titles and play them for three weeks and move on and never look at them again , " he said , before switching from what he does to what you or I might do — " Today , firstly everyone goes online " — and then settling on what his developers do — " five years ago , the standard at every game company was when the game goes gold [ and is sent to manufacturing ] , the 60 people on the title or 160 people , depending on the title , all of them [ would be done working on that game ] except maybe one or two guys who were gonna take a phone call , when you find out there 's a video card from some Taiwanese hardware manufacturer you did n't have ideal compatibility with .
...
For the most part today , for most games , the entire team remains intact post - ship [ ping of the game ] for a combination of free and paid [ downloadable content ] , services , server management , code patches , figuring out exactly where people are dying and bunching up in the map , fixing that and improving the experience . "
Advertisement
All of that post - release work the developer do after they are " done " with the game provides gamers the new slices of that toast Riccitiello was talking about .
That is the new product EA is selling , the thing that would keep a gamer satisfied longer with a game and for which , Riccitiello hopes , they'd be willing in some way to pay .
This initiative used to be called Project $ 10 and some gamers have complained its a rip - off for things the basic price of a game should give them .
Riccitiello , proud already of the breadth of post - release content offered for free and for charge across games such as Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age , believes he is selling more value .
Advertisement
What Riccitiello seems to want to do with gamers ' money is give them more for it , as sound a pitch as ever there was one .
Skepticism again put aside , let 's engage in some CEO - dreamed specifics of what a big game company like EA could get you to pay for .
" I wo n't be surprised , " he said , " if five years from now we 're going to say to somebody , ' Hey look you 're a Madden user ' — at that point you might have a PS3 and a Wii and a PC and an iPhone and an iPad and a Facebook , and , you know , maybe two other game services , and we say ' Hey , give us this X amount of money , and we 'll give you [ Madden on ] all of these things for a year ...
" Right now I make [ a ] FIFA [ game ] on Facebook .
I 've got FIFA on iPad , FIFA on iPhone , three consoles , PC , I 've got an online games service , and I do n't think many people are going to buy every instance of that game .
First off , it just adds up to a boatload of money .
But I bet you 've got most of that hardware , right ?
So why would n't I license you at some advantageous price all of what I 'm making ?
Advertisement
" The point I 'm making is n't that we 're going to do that tomorrow , that 's not the point I 'm making .
The point I 'm making is the fact that the business model needs to evolve and recognize a little bit that there 's a big service component . "
That 's one possible Riccitiello future to a present that just had his EA introduce Online Pass , a service paid for either with the purchase of a new game or as an extra charge with the purchase of a used game .
The Online Pass system is designed to transition gamers into a service relationship with the EA sports games they buy and to finance that service .
Adds Riccitiello , " The model is going to keep evolving in ways that I 'm hopeful most gamers are going to find it positive . "
Advertisement
Not a radical enough future ?
How about this possible use of a gamer 's money : " Think about the fact that at our company , I spend a billion dollars a year creating content and most consumers get the benefit of 1/20th of that .
Now over time I 've got a lot more to offer you than you 're getting and I 'd like you to get more of it .
I 've got an opportunity to give you more value for money .
As we wind our way through all the changes that are being made in our marketplace I do n't know whether we 're going to get to a Rhapsody model where it's all - you - can - eat for 10 bucks a month .
I do n't know that I know the answer to that . "
Clearly , that would be a good deal on toast .
The EA CEO does n't see himself only making subscription - based games in the future .
He is n't turning his company into a factory of World of Warcraft - wannabes , each and every game something you pay for each and every month .
That , any gamer knows , would be ridiculous .
But we would pay differently because we now play differently , because , in part , he knows we do since he plays differently too .

The Coke Commercial Revolution
There are times when Riccitiello has snapped at me during interviews , such as when I asked him a couple of years ago about the seemingly low sales of an EA Steven Spielberg game for the Wii called Boom Blox .
Referring to my previous employer for whom I was interviewing the EA boss , he said " last time I checked MTV was n't a financial network . "
Advertisement
There are times when he 's been aggravated by a fusillade of skeptical questions regarding whether his comments about quality games fueling EA to success would be proven true or discredited as wishful thinking .
( He would point at the strong acclaim and sales of Mass Effect 2 , Dragon Age and Battlefield : Bad Company 2 as realization of his vision . )
There was only one time , however , when Riccitiello heard me out and then said I had just asked " the best question I 've had from a journalist in the better part of three years . "
Let 's assume it was not the phrasing that won this praise but the topic , one about the repercussions of the divides among gamers who hate or are threatened by what other gamers play .
The Xbox fans have anxiety about the Wii players , who , the worst snobs say , are n't playing real games .
The Wii players sigh at the Facebook FarmVille players who , well ... are they even playing a video game ?
What effect does this have ?
Advertisement
To answer , Riccitiello recalled his first stint at EA and the purchase of a casual games company called Pogo that made simple puzzle and mystery games designed to be played on computers by moms and kids .
" I was involved in the team that bought Pogo in 2001 , " he said .
" For about five years , I swear to God , if they had had leprosy I do n't think they could have been a more disdained organization [ within EA ] because they made cheesy little toy crap from the perspective of people that worked out of Madden or another games title .
That prejudice existed up until I 'd say a few years ago . "
Riccitiello did n't see the snobbery about Pogo hurting gamers but he saw it damaging game development .
It made developers look down on each other .
Advertisement
Today at EA , those groups are mixing .
Some teams from the recently - EA - purchased Playfish , which makes games for Facebook , and teams that have made big - budget EA games are being forced to make some games together .
" You take a team of people that 's used to making the equivalent of a Hollywood blockbuster , " Riccitiello says , " and now they 're told to report to the guy that makes videos for YouTube .
That 's the way they think about it and it seems like a step backwards .
And what I 'm watching here is really fascinating .
One thing is that the guy that 's making videos from YouTube is saying , ' Hey I can get way better production values if I do this , ' because they keep hearing that from the guys who are building it which is how you get a product like [ EA Playfish 's Facebook game ] FIFA Superstars to look so cool .
It does look pretty cool .
The second thing you get is that the people who are building these [ big ] products live through one and two year dev cycles and the primary orientation in life is you sort of master it and it 's done ...
Look at a [ Playfish ] team that publishes and republishes content every single week .
And they use the telemetry to tweak and adjust and improve and they think that what they 're doing is a service ...
What Playfish does is every title , every Tuesday gets republished based on the telemetry data from two weeks ago , a week to fix it , a week to publish it , and you do it again . "
Advertisement
The cultures clash .
And the cultures learn from each other .
The big - budget game developers discover the power of updating a game constantly .
The Facebook developers discover the power of making better - looking games .
To cap his answer , Riccitiello tried a new metaphor .
" What 's happening inside of EA for the first time ever feels like the ' I want to teach the world to sing '
Coke commercials where people that build mobile games and people that do telemetry and people that are game designers on core games and people that are building MMOs finally — and for the first time — feel like peers .
I think maybe we 're a little ahead of the game industry consumer relative to that . "
Advertisement
Would we as gamers - turned - CEOs be able to get over our snobbery ?
Would we pair the Wii guy with the PS3 lady ?
The Facebook expert with the cut - scene crafter ?
Would we try to teach the gaming world — or at least the game - making world — to sing in perfect harmony ?
I do n't know .
But I do know that we the gamers and John Riccitiello , the CEO who plays a game or two , would at least probably both say we had the same general goals for our video game behemoth .
I think you 'd say the kind of thing that any gaming CEO would probably say , of course , because when they offer their grand vision they say appealing things .
But if you were a gamer , maybe it would mean a little something extra .
Advertisement
Out of Riccitiello 's mouth , the goals sound like this : " I 'm a gamer .
I 'm deeply engaged in the process of making sure we make the world 's best games .
That 's that thing that 's most important to me :
Making the world 's best games and services , stuff I want to be proud of , stuff I want to believe 10 years from now people will still be thinking about , stuff that changes the way the industry perceives what a game can be , new intellectual property , sequels that matter , that are n't just simply the next notch in an annual series of iterations .
You do n't get it right every single time , but basically we 're trying to do great things . "

Part two in a series of one - on - one interviews with the most powerful people in gaming .
Nine - year - old Grace Arnold took home the first place trophy for the Junior Division at the 2010 Southeast Regional Pokémon Video Game Championships .
Her 13 - year - old brother David won the Senior Division .
Their father came in second .

If just one of the Arnolds place in the Nationals , it would mean the family 's third trip to the World Championships .
A 44 - year - old vice president of operations at a financial company , father Glen Arnold first heard about the Pokémon Video Game Championships from a Kotaku post two years ago .
At that first event , young Grace won a spot in the World Championships in Orlando , Florida .

Grace actually qualified for the Nationals at the Seattle event earlier this year , but her brothers wanted another shot , and their parents were willing to make the trip .
The competition at the Gwinnett Center in Duluth , Georgia , was fierce .
The Junior Division saw 278 entrants ; the Senior Division had 651 .
The Southeast Regional Championship was the second - largest event in the 2010 circuit , and the odds of winning were slim .

And now two members of the family bring brand - new Nintendo DSi systems to the Nationals in Indianapolis at the end of this month .

How does one family get so good ?
According to father Glen , it 's all about practice , as long as it is n't on school days .
" We practice on weekends during the school year , " Glen said .
" Though that does n't stop me from staying up late every night , coming up with new teams for the kids to battle . "

So far the kids have triumphed over every team their father has thrown against them .
According to David , he and his champion sister are evenly matched , though he usually beats his dad .
And that was exactly what happened during the final round of the Southwestern Regionals , when father went up against son for the top spot in the Senior Division .
Glen put up a good fight , but David came out on top .

Mother Linda was a regular presence at the exit point of the tournament floor .
She plays the game as well , but does n't compete , explaining that " Someone has to be there for them when they come off the floor . "
I asked her why the family spent so much time traveling across the country in order to compete in a video game competition .
Advertisement
" The kids enjoy it .
They get to travel and go places , meeting new people .
And it 's a bonding experience , " she told me .

During some downtime between rounds , I observed the Arnolds gathered in one of the convention center 's hallways , sitting on the floor together , consoling son Ryan , the only competing member of the tribe who did n't walk away a winner on Saturday .
It was a touching moment that what a strong , supportive , and close family this team of Pokémon champions really is .
I would n't worry about Ryan .
With a family like that behind him , it 's only a matter of time before he takes home a championship trophy .
All he needs to do is follow the advice of his brother , David .

" Train hard , and if you mess up very badly , just make sure you practice enough and have fun . "
Microsoft has decided to kill off the Kin , two Microsoft - branded phones targeted at teenager users , we have confirmed .
The Kin , formerly known as " Project Pink , " was revealed in April and launched on the Verizon network in May .
However , ominous signs emerged for the phone 's demise after Microsoft cut the price of the Kin in half .
However , it does n't look like it was enough — the Kin will be folded into the Windows Phone 7 team after abysmal sales and millions of dollars lost in R&D and marketing .
Here is Microsoft 's official statement on the Kin :
“ Microsoft has made the decision to focus on the Windows Phone 7 launch and will not ship KIN in Europe this fall as planned .
Additionally , we are integrating our KIN team with the Windows Phone 7 team , incorporating valuable ideas and technologies from KIN into future Windows Phone releases .
We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell current KIN phones . ”
While the Kin is n't going away completely , it 's clear that it has not met expectations and Microsoft is shifting resources elsewhere .
Mozilla open source evangelist Chris Blizzard has unloaded on both Apple and Google for abusing the HTML5 moniker , confusing netizens everywhere , and undermining the slow march towards truly open web standards .
Blizzard is so peeved at Apple and Google that he even goes so far as to lavish praise on Microsoft for its belated embrace of open standards .
Like so many others among the browserati , Blizzard is fuming over Apple 's new " HTML Showcase " site .
The site purports to demonstrate Apple 's love for web standards , but in the end , it does much the opposite .
" These web standards are open , reliable , highly secure , and efficient , " the site says .
" The demos below show how the latest version of Apple ’s Safari web browser , new Macs , and new Apple mobile devices all support the capabilities of HTML5 , CSS3 , and JavaScript . "
But then it gives the impression that Apple is the only browser maker backing such standards .
The site goes on to say that " not all browsers offer this support . "
Which is true .
But today 's Chrome , Firefox , and Opera do offer extensive support for the same standards , and Apple has barred these — and all other non-Apple browsers — from accessing the demos :
Apple pretends other browsers do n't like HTML5
Echoing Opera 's Haavard Moen , Blizzard rips Steve Jobs and cult for its double - dealing , accusing the company of giving the false impression that only Safari has embraced open standards .
" That ’s right , " Blizzard writes , in describing the screenshot above .
" If you ’re not on Safari , then Fuck You .
Aside from the incendiary language I ’ve used to help you understand how it feels the real underlying message here is that if you do n’t have access to Safari then you must not have access to HTML5 .
Wait , only Safari supports HTML5 ??
" Nope , lots of browsers do .
A huge percentage of the world does have access to standards like HTML5 . "
And he points to a site that details HTML5 support built into Firefox , Chrome , and Safari .
Blizzard accuses Apple of commandeering HTML5 to suit its own agenda .
" Basically they are saying internally 'omg , no one thinks we support html5 , we need to prove them otherwise !
We ’ll put up tests !
Demos !
The world will then know and we can go back to being perceived as actually leading the WebKit project which is also made of puppies and rainbows ! ' " he writes .
" So you end up with sites like this .
Sites that entirely miss the point of the web , interoperability , standards and html5 .
The demos that they put up are just filled with stuff that Apple made up , are n’t part of HTML5 and are only now getting to the standards process . "
Part of the problem , Blizzard says , is that so many others have already applied the HTML5 moniker to so much more than HTML5 .
Apple 's simply following the trend , shoving things like CSS under the HTML5 umbrella .
And here , Blizzard lays much of the blame on Google , who first took hold of the HTML5 name at its annual developer conference in the spring of last year .
" The big problem is that html5 has come to mean a lot of things , mostly thanks to Google .
They ’ve basically been riding that and flogging it and making it their own .
( That and performance — simple , great marketing messaging .
I appreciate it , even if the dishonesty of it makes my blood boil ) , " Blizzard says , referring to Google 's constantly claiming that Chrome is the fastest thing on the planet .
Google , it seems , is the real villain of his piece .
" It ’s a shame that the main victim here turns out to be Apple , given that the king of these tactics is Google , but hey , Apple managed to come out with something that was so brash and misleading it deserves a good tear - down , " Blizzard writes .
In an aside , he claims that at this year 's Google I/O developer conference , Mountain View " managed to take Native Client and the Chrome Store and make it all sound like it was part of html5 . "
And he has a point .
This spring , at Google I/O , the company certainly nudged the open web forward in open sourcing its VP8 video codec under a royalty - free license .
But it also dropped Native Client and the just announced Chrome App Store — two technologies tied to Google 's Chrome browser — into its sweeping discussion of HTML5 as the future of the web .
With Native Client , Google is actually bypassing the standard web stack , encouraging developers to build native code applications that run in a plug - in currently offered only by Chrome .
And the Chrome App Store takes web applications into Apple iPhone store territory .
The day of Google 's announcement , Mozilla 's Jay Sullivan called for the net to embrace an Open Web App Store .
" Web developers are expressing interest in an app store model for the Web that would enable them to get paid for their efforts without having to abandon Web development in exchange for proprietary silos , each with their own programming language and SDK , variable and sometimes opaque review processes , and limited reach , " Sullivan said in a blog post .
" Supporting the needs of Web developers in their efforts to develop websites and apps that are n’t bound to a specific browser and work across the Web is core to Mozilla ’s public benefit mission . "
But even when it comes to the open standards , Blizzard says , Apple and Google are missing the point .
It 's telling that of all the browser - makers out there , Blizzard reserves his praise for , um , Microsoft .
" The most important aspect of HTML5 is n’t the new stuff like video and canvas ( which Safari and Firefox have both been shipping for years ) .
It ’s actually the honest - to - god promise of interoperability , " he writes .
" Even stodgy old Microsoft , who has been doing their best to hold back the web for nearly a decade , understands this and you ’ll see it throughout their marketing for IE9 .
( Their marketing phrase is ' same markup ' – watch for it and you ’ll see it everywhere in their messaging ) .
The idea that the same markup , even with mistakes , will be rendered exactly the same .
HTML5 represents the chance for browsers to work together and find common ground . "
Apple is actually working against this mission .
And in its own way , Blizzard says , Google is too . ®
Update : EA has said that the Facebook was a fake .
Original story : Respawn Entertainment is set to announce some big news at the Electronic Entertainment Expo next week .
That 's according to the Facebook page of Vince Zampella and Jason West , the chaps who set up Respawn after getting the boot from Infinity Ward .
" Big time announcement at E3 next week , " reads their latest status update .
" Stay tuned , kiddies ! "
So what are West and Zampella up to , exactly ?
Why not mine our recent interview with the pair for clues ?
As I discussed here last week , Jeff Sharlet , guest - posting on Warren Throckmorton ’s blog , reported from Uganda on how supporters of the Anti-Homosexuality bill there understood American evangelist Lou Engle ’s statements there as supportive of their efforts to get the bill passed .
The role Engle might have played in offering American support for the bill is of intense interest , given that Engle has become an increasingly visible figure in the religious right — among other things , hosting a rally on the National Mall that included former presidential candidate and now Fox News host Mike Huckabee and the Family Research Council ’s Tony Perkins ; appearing in a “ prayercast ” against health care reform with Republican members of Congress ; and playing a prominent role in the recent Freedom Federation Summit held at Liberty University in Lynchburg , Virginia .
Engle ’s anti-gay rhetoric is no secret , and in an interview with me on Friday , he supported criminalizing homosexuality , although he insists that he did not support the Ugandan bill because he believes the penalties are too harsh .
But , as Michael Wilkerson reported for RD last month , at his Kampala The Call rally Engle did not contest the support for the bill of the speaker who preceded him , self - styled Apostle Julius Oyet .
What ’s more , Engle stated at The Call , “ We know that Uganda has been under tremendous pressure — the church .
We felt that same pressure .
But I felt like The Call was to come and join with the church of Uganda to encourage you that in the nation who are showing courage to take a stand for righteousness in the earth . ”
Engle now is splitting hairs and claiming that this statement was n’t supportive of the bill , but rather of the bill ’s promoters ’ efforts to prevent the “ homosexual agenda ” from taking over the country .
Oyet and David Bahati , the parliamentarian who authored the bill , met with Engle before the rally and were , according to Sharlet , “ ecstatic at what they perceived as Engle ’s strong support of the bill .
They felt his rally and his statements would be a turning point for the bill , reassuring their Ugandan allies that they had support abroad . ”
As Wilkerson reported , Engle ’s speech at The Call was followed by James Nsaba Buturo , Uganda ’s Minister for Ethics and Integrity , and a well - known supporter of the bill , who unequivocally supported it at Engle ’s rally ( something Engle claims he has apologized for ) .
Engle insisted to me — as he has in his public statements posted on his website — that he did not support the bill ’s penalties .
He also maintained that he did not know who the speakers at The Call were going to be , because the arrangements were handled by a Ugandan ministry ( although he admitted meeting with Buturo beforehand ) .
But he also made absolutely clear that he supports the criminalization of homosexuality , believes there could be a biblical basis for a death penalty , that the United Nations has promoted the “ homosexual agenda ” to Uganda ’s detriment , and he lauded the bill ’s promoters ’ efforts to take a “ principled stand ” against that .
It ’s no wonder , then , that Bahati and Oyet interpreted his statements as supportive of their ambitions .
Engle claimed to not specifically remember meeting with Bahati and Oyet while in Kampala , telling me :
I do n’t even remember their names , I guess who they were .
I met with the leader of the — with the bishop of the Assemblies of God of the nation .
I understood as one of his key guys , one of his key leaders .
I did not support the bill .
I talked to them , whoever these two guys were about the lessening of the penalties , we even challenged them to make provisions so that the church would not have to report anything of homosexuality being exposed .
But we appreciated the two guys whose hearts were to bring forth a principled bill .
[ emphasis mine ]
Engle told me he did n’t know who Bahati was , but when I told him he was the author of the bill , Engle added :
David Bahati may have been in a meeting that I had with the minister of ethics [ Buturo ] .
But in that , I did not come out and support that bill .
It was a meeting of about 25 people , and really was a prayer meeting and I was there to mobilize The Call and to pray with them .
I pressed Engle to explain what he meant by a “ principled stand ” and a “ principled bill . ”
I asked him whether he supported a law that dealt with homosexuality in some way , and he stated that there needs to be “ some kind of restraint from the homosexual agenda : ”
Most definitely .
For instance , the court case Lawrence v. Texas , is the court case that basically decriminalized homosexuality in the U.S. Everybody knew that when that bill passed , or when that court case shifted , then it opened the door for the legalization , for the definition , or the legalization of same - sex marriage , which is now rolling into America .
We knew that .
So I ’ve always had — yes , there needs to be a principled stand .
There needs to be some kind of restraint from the homosexual agenda being able to roll over this , a nation that does not want it .
Reiterating his U.N. - brought - the -homosexual - agenda - to - Uganda theme , Engle added :
[ B]ecause UNICEF and UN were promoting their agenda in the place and there were cases taking place but there was no law , there was no laws , so there could be no restraint and no punishment for that .
Because of that , as I understood it , was one of the reasons they wanted to bring forth this — a bill so that they could bring an answer to that kind of offense .
Engle repeatedly insisted that he did n’t support the death penalty in the bill .
But he did indicate that he believed there could be a biblical basis for the death penalty in the bill for transmitting the virus that causes AIDS to a minor :
I understand why biblically because biblically speaking you can find grounds in Romans 13 and other places , if innocent human life is taken , then the governmental leaders of a nation have obligation or a duty to bring forth justice .
It actually says in Romans 13 the government does not bear the sword in vain .
In other words , you do n’t spank with a sword , you bring justice .
So it ’s the same argument in America .
Should a person have a death penalty ?
The same question .
People differ on that question .
I pressed him about which penalties in the bill he did n’t support — and he did say that although he could see someone supporting the death penalty , he did not , and he did not support “ hard labor ” as punishment or the requirement that churches report LGBT people to the authorities .
But when I asked him if he would support a bill with less harsh penalties , he added :
My main thing is to keep — is to not allow it to be legalized , so to speak , so then it just spreads through the legal system of the nation .
So I ’m not —
I ’m not making a statement as to what I think the penalties should be .
It ’s not my job to do that .
I do think , I do think that these leaders are trying to make at least some kind of statement that you ’re not just going to spread the agenda without some kind of restraint , a legal restraint and punishment .
And I do n’t know what the line is on those , but I ca n’t go that far as I understand that bill already said .
[ emphasis mine ]
Engle admitted that his praise for the bill ’s supporters ’ “ principled stand ” might have led them to believe that he supported the bill .
Although he insisted he did not support the bill as written , “ I did support the principle of a nation saying , restraining it from coming into their nation . ”
He then went on to maintain that because homosexuality has n’t been “ restrained ” in the United States , “ I do n’t think it ’s going to be good for the nation , it sweeps into the education system , and the church is going to end up losing its privilege to have its own voice .
Gender rights , will trump religious rights .
I think it ’s wrong , it ’s not good for society .
Those are the statements I came with , so frankly I was quite surprised to be thrown into this huge controversy . ”
It speaks volumes that Engle was surprised that calling homosexuality “ wrong , ” saying it can “ sweep ” into an educational system , can cause the church to “ lose its privilege , ” and will “ trump religious rights ” would be controversial .
But that ’s where the religious right is in the United States — and he thinks that ’s a completely uncontroversial position .
Since Engle brought up “ the homosexual lobbyists ” and “ worldwide kind of bullying of Uganda ” over the bill , I asked him how the U.N. and other “ lobbyists ” were promoting homosexuality in Uganda ; not surprisingly , he did n’t have an answer .
He claimed that the pastors there told him “ a story about how it swept into — the agenda promotion , of the agenda , and now the actual proliferation of the homosexual activity sweeping into the boarding schools of that nation .
I do n’t know much of the details so I ca n’t take responsibility for what I was being communicated . ”
Yet Engle thinks it ’s completely justifiable for the Ugandans to try to “ protect ” the country from homosexuality , telling me , “ These leaders , Sarah , are actually simply trying to protect their society , their people , from an agenda that ’s just not welcome , ” and that they “ were just wanting to do the right thing for their church and their nation . ”

Interesting research : “ What You See is What They Get : Protecting users from unwanted use of microphones , cameras , and other sensors , ” by Jon Howell and Stuart Schechter .
Abstract : Sensors such as cameras and microphones collect privacy - sensitive data streams without the user ’s explicit action .
Conventional sensor access policies either hassle users to grant applications access to sensors or grant with no approval at all .
Once access is granted , an application may collect sensor data even after the application ’s interface suggests that the sensor is no longer being accessed .
We introduce the sensor - access widget , a graphical user interface element that resides within an application ’s display .
The widget provides an animated representation of the personal data being collected by its corresponding sensor , calling attention to the application ’s attempt to collect the data .
The widget indicates whether the sensor data is currently allowed to flow to the application .
The widget also acts as a control point through which the user can configure the sensor and grant or deny the application access .
By building perpetual disclosure of sensor data collection into the platform , sensor - access widgets enable new access - control policies that relax the tension between the user ’s privacy needs and applications ’ ease of access .
Taking a page from the Australian broadband playbook , New Zealand has decided not to sit around while incumbent DSL operators milk the withered dugs of their cash cow until it keels over from old age .
Instead , the Kiwis have established a government - owned corporation to invest NZ $ 1.5 billion for open - access fiber to the home .
By 2020 , 75 percent of residents should have , at a bare minimum , 100 M bps down / 50 Mbps up with a choice of providers .
Crown Fibre Holdings
Limited is the company , and it's wholly owned by the government — for now — and the company 's mission could n't be any clearer .
Two of its six guiding principles include " focusing on building new infrastructure , and not unduly preserving the ' legacy assets ' of the past " and " avoiding ' lining the pockets ' of existing broadband network providers . "
The New Zealand government set up the company late last year , but the government wo n't install and own the network by itself .
Instead , Crown Fibre will partner with local companies across New Zealand to roll out fiber .
Those companies will have to invest their own money as well , but in return they become part of the national dark fiber open - access system envisioned by Crown Fibre .
Here 's how it works : every fiber builder who takes government money needs to lay basic , unmanaged dark fiber that any ISP can light in order to offer service to a particular home or business .
The fiber companies can also run some particular Layer 2 services , but they can't offer full - blown Internet access directly .
Instead , they are allowed to sell Internet access to their own retail unit so long as it operates like a separate business , and all other ISPs must be offered access at the same rate .
This keeps the government from simply " setting the price " and undercutting the market , but it also means that anyone can use the fiber infrastructure without competitive disadvantage .
Once the ten - year buildout ends , Crown Fibre will convert to a " successful , profit driven business " that oversees the complete network , shares in its revenues , and ensures national interoperability .
( For the complete business arrangements , see appendix 2 of the government 's Invitation to Participate [ PDF ] ) .
The government 's 2010 budget , announced a few weeks ago , includes more cash for Crown Fibre 's work .
" This funding will enable Crown Fibre Holdings to start making substantial contract commitments with the private sector to start rolling out the new fibre network , " said Deputy Prime Minister Bill English .
Providing credits to taxpayers who invest in energy property has proven to be an effective way of encouraging energy property development .
Allowing taxpayers to claim Treasury grants in lieu of these credits streamlines the process , further encouraging investments .
Awarding credits for property financed by subsidized energy financing , however , amounts to a double - dip in federal funds and should not be allowed in an era during which the national debt increases every month .
In addition to reintroducing the section 48 limitation , Congress should pass a tax on carbon emissions .
Rather than increasing taxation of income or other positive contributions to the economy , the government should shift its attention to environmentally harmful activities , and , with the recent passing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , the timing may be right for a persuasive appeal to Congress .
Political alliances and party promises will remain significant hurdles to gaining public support for a carbon tax .
The bottom line , however , is clear : other countries have become savvy to the need for increased environmental taxation in energy policy , and it is time for the United States to follow suit .
Despite the fact that it was announced over two years ago , we have n’t really seen much when it comes to Square Enix ’s The 3rd Birthday , the next iteration of the Parasite Eve series .
There have been a few teaser trailers , but most have just been CG movie clips to promote the game .
All that ’s shown about the game are the new enemies , known as the Twisted , and the fact that the game will be an over - the - shoulder third - person shooter .
However , it seems that despite what little showings of the game Square Enix has offered , they ’ve been hard at work , especially after the unveiling of a gameplay trailer for The 3rd Birthday .
More on the game after the break .
The trailer released showcases the game ’s third person action gameplay as well as the new Overdrive system , which allows series protagonist Aya Brea to transfer her consciousness to other people during combat .
It seems like an interesting system , allowing the player to essentially teleport to a different location to get the drop on an enemy .
Story - wise , the game takes place in Manhattan .
After mysterious creatures known as the Twisted appear , a new investigatory task force known as CTI is formed and the Overdrive system is developed .
Given her past and her unique abilities , Aya is the only viable candidate for the project .
The game is slated for release on the Sony PSP .
However , no set date has been given .
There are many interesting auto logo stories , including Cadillac ’s recent discarding of its heraldic ducks in favor of a new version of its shield and crest .
And BMW recently cleared up the history of its logo , saying that it ’s based on the Bavarian flag , not a spinning propeller .
But perhaps the most intriguing story is that of the Ford logo designed by the heavyweight champion of logo designers , Paul Rand , who did those of IBM , ABC , Westinghouse , UPS , Next Computer — and Enron .
In 1966 , Rand was hired by Henry Ford II to rethink and modernize the familiar scripted oval Ford logo .
But Henry Ford II decided not to change the logo .
“ According to Rand , it was too radical a switch , ” said Steve Heller , graphic design historian and the author of the book “ Paul Rand . ”
According to Allen Hurlburt , a graphic designer writing in Communication Arts , “ After extensive research and considerable design exploration , a new style was worked out , and a handsome printed and bound presentation was prepared in a limited edition for the eventual review by Henry Ford II .
After some deliberation , Mr. Ford finally decided that , when it came to the family name , what was good enough for his grandfather was good enough for him . ”
In 1966 , the script and oval was far less established than it is now .
It was not used on a Ford car until the Model A in 1928 , although the radiator of the Model T was accented with the classic Ford script .
A similar script was first used in advertising at Ford around the time the company was established in 1903 .
Legend says it was the creation of Childe Harold Wills , an engineer and one of Ford ’s first executives , who borrowed the script from his own business cards .
It is rendered in Spencerian script , also used in the Coca - Cola logo .
Spencerian was a form of handwriting devised by Platt Rogers Spencer around 1840 as a modern , quickly written , clear script for business .
It was widely taught in schools until being edged out by the faster Palmer method .
By 1906 , a revised form of the Ford name was introduced with wings or tails on the F and D . The Ford script in both forms appeared on some parts of cars and on company letterhead .
The Ford historian , Bob Kreipke , says that the first use of an oval — actually a shape more like a football — came in 1907 without the script .
Around 1910 - 12 , Ford employed a winged triangle logo with the script and the slogan “ The universal car ” in its signs and advertising , rendered sometimes in blue and sometimes in orange .
In the 1950s , a shield - and - crown logo was seen on some Ford automobiles .
It resembled the Cadillac logo , which also had a shield and crown .
( At the recent Detroit auto show , the Ford designer , Freeman Thomas , sported one of the shield - and - crown logos in his lapel . )
The blue oval then disappeared for a while , turning up again on cars in 1976 .
For the company ’s centennial in 2003 , the logo was redesigned with a more rounded , shaded look .
Ford ’s blue oval with script was also among the assets pledged as collateral in the 2006 deal that gave the company its multibillion - dollar line of credit .
So Henry Ford II may have been right not to change what has become one of the most recognized logos in the world .
( Newser ) – The bodies of hundreds of people believed to be ethnic Albanian victims of atrocities in the late '90s have been found buried under a parking lot in Serbia .
The site near the Kosovan border is believed to contain the bodies of 250 Kosovo Albanians , according to Serbian authorities .
The bodies — buried at a site belonging to a state - owned road company — were found after a tip - off to war crimes investigators , the Guardian reports .
Serb forces slaughtered up to 10,000 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1998 and 1999 .
The bodies were moved from mass graves near Albanian villages to sites in Serbia when it became clear that NATO was going to intervene .
Serbia 's willingness to publicize this latest find — the sixth such mass grave unearthed in Serbia — highlights the country 's shift to facing up to the crimes of Slobodan Milosevic 's regime , the BBC notes .

When laws forbid people from transporting something from one place to another , there will be those who try to do it anyway .
Smuggled drugs , guns , cash , stolen goods , and immigrants are seized every day .
However , some things that people try to sneak through security make you scratch your head in wonder .

Officials at the Soekarno - Hatta International Airport in Jakarta , Indonesia saw shipping containers labeled " fresh fruit " bound for Hong Kong this past February .
What they found inside were two tons of live reptiles !
They seized 25 bags of Chinese rat snakes and 3,492 pig - nosed turtles .
Export of these species from Indonesia is not illegal , but is regulated and the exporter apparently wanted to bypass quarantine laws .
The snakes and turtles would most likely have been used to make soup and sex - enhancing drugs at their destination , according to officials .
A man traveling from Bulgaria arrived at the Dublin airport after changing planes in Madrid .
He looked nervous , so inspectors in Ireland selected him for a spot check .
When they x-rayed his hand luggage , the image of a dog showed up .
Screeners thought it must be a toy or statue , as the dog was standing up .
But when they opened the bag , they found a live chihuahua !
The dog had been in a small cage inside the bag throughout the trip .
The traveler had planned to give the chihuahua to a friend in Ireland as a gift , but intended to bypass quarantine laws .
The dog was seized and placed in quarantine .
The Asian arowana , commonly called the dragon fish , is considered lucky in many Asian cultures .
However , the species is on the endangered list and is illegal to sell or import .
Some people will pay a thousand dollars for a small specimen , or up to $ 20,000 for a large adult , which can grow up to two feet long .
A 2005 sting operation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service led to the arrest of Andree Gunawan on charges of smuggling and selling endangered wildlife from Indonesia .
Gunawan and six other people were also recently indicted in connection with the case .
In April of last year , a man named Sony Dong was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for bringing in live songbirds from Vietnam .
Dong had been under investigation for a year after airport official found an abandoned bag containing 18 birds , five of which had died .
This time , customs official were waiting for him to arrive on a flight from Vietnam .
Observing that Dong had bird droppings on his shoes , they found he had swaddled 14 Vietnamese songbirds in cloth and attached them to his lower legs under his pants .
All the birds survived the trip .
Dong pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months and ordered to pay $ 4,000 for the care of the birds .
An unnamed man traveling from Lima , Peru to New York City was questioned about the marmoset he had with him .
Passengers on his final flight from Florida to New York noticed a monkey had crawled out from under the man 's hat !
Officials questioned the man on arrival and seized the monkey .
It is not known how the marmoset had escaped detection at the airports in Peru and Florida .
In another case , 28 - year - old Gypsy Lawson was caught smuggling a rhesus macaque monkey from Thailand into the United States in 2007 by hiding the sedated monkey in her dress and pretending she was pregnant !
Lawson and her mother , Fran Ogren , were convicted of violating the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws .

" I have monkeys in my pants , " Cusack told the agents .
The people with bushmeat had the largest amounts :
One passenger had 112 pounds ( 51 kilos ) of bushmeat -- and no other luggage .
Most of the bushmeat was smoked and arrived as dried carcasses .
Some animals were identifiable , though scientists boiled the remains of others and reassembled the skeletons to determine the species .
Experts found 11 types of bushmeat including monkeys , large rats , crocodiles , small antelopes and pangolins , or anteaters .
Almost 40 percent were listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species .
Smuggled live animals bring lots of money , but even dead species can be profitable if they are endangered and illegal to transport .
For many years , Hisayoshi Kojima was king of the smuggled insect business , in which he shipped both live and dead insects both in and out of the US .
Unscrupulous butterfly collectors would spend thousands of dollars for a specimen of the rare Queen Alexandra 's birdwing from Papua New Guinea , which can have a wingspan of up to a foot .
It is illegal to catch , kill , or import them .
But Kojima found a way .
It was a deal on the Queen Alexandra butterfly that ended a two - year undercover investigation into Kojima 's illegal insect trade in 2006 .
He was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined $ 38,731 .
In animal smuggling , the case of Robert Cusack stands head and shoulder above the rest .
In 2002 , Cusack was arrested as he landed in Los Angeles after a flight from Thailand .
Customs Agents were suspicious after a bird of paradise flew out of his luggage .
Three more birds were found in the suitcase .
They asked Cusack if he had anything else to declare Cusack was found to have two pygmy slow lorises in his underwear .
A further search found 50 rare orchids in his luggage .
Cusack 's companion on the flight , Chris Edward Mulloy , was later charged with smuggling two Asian leopard cat cubs in his luggage - four years later , for some reason .
Cusack told authorities that the animals had originated in Indonesia , and he was taking them to a wildlife refuge in Costa Rica .
Cusack later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 57 days in jail Warren Maynard was arrested in 2008 as he crossed the US - Candian border in Lewiston , New York near Niagara Falls with a hundred bottles of a clear liquid found by drug - sniffing dogs .
The 50 - year - old man declared to customs officials that the bottles contained holy water , which he had bought in Canada along with other religious items .
However , tests on the liquid found the animal tranquilizer ketamine , a hallucinogenic drug often used in date rape , in 42 of the bottles .
Other bottles tested positive for " general narcotics " .
Maynard , who lived in Brooklyn at the time , was a citizen of Barbados with permanent residency status in the United States .
He was turned over to immigration officials after his arrest .
A report published this month says that the global trade in illegal bushmeat , or meat from exotic wildlife , is stronger than ever .
An estimated five tons of it passes through the main Paris airport every week .
In June of 2008 , researchers observed while travelers were searched after 29 different flights from Africa .
Of 134 people searched , 83 were found with livestock or fish , and nine were found carrying bushmeat
The exotic species can be found on menus in Paris restaurants , if you know where to look and who to ask .
Scientists warn that illegally imported meat may be spoiled or can spread disease .
Gitta Jarant and her daughter Anke Anusic were taken into custody in April of this year after they tried to take the deceased body of Jarant 's husband , 91 - year - old Kurt Willi Jarant on a plane to Berlin .
They brought the elderly man to the John Lennon Airport in Liverpool in a wheelchair .
The women denied that he was dead and said he was just sleeping , although a post - mortem found he had been dead for around twelve hours .
The women are suspected of trying to bypass laws governing the shipping of human bodies in order to take the man back to his home in Germany .
Jarant and Anusic are free while awaiting trial for failure to report a death .

Albany , NY --
The state Senate voted unanimously Tuesday to ban using embalming fluid as a recreational drug .
By a 61 - 0 vote , senators voted to make it a misdemeanor to possess embalming with the intent to inhale it , ingest it or sell it to someone to do so .
“ The increased use of embalming fluid with other drugs has become a public safety issue in Central New York , ” said state Sen .
David Valesky , D - Oneida , who sponsored the bill .
Embalming fluid is combined with the hallucinogen phencyclidine , also known as PCP , and used to coat marijuana cigarettes , according to experts .
Marijuana cigarettes soaked in embalming fluid have been linked to several crimes in Central New York in recent years , including a hit - and - run crash in which a driver high on drugs ran over two people in Syracuse and a home invasion in 2005 in Oswego County in which an entire family , including a 5 - year - old child , was held at gunpoint .
“ We are seeing a spike in violence in our community due to embalming fluid , ” said Syracuse Police Chief Frank Fowler in a release .
“ By making it illegal , we are empowering law enforcement to take a proactive approach to getting the drug off our streets , ” he said .
The Senate vote is only the first step to making the bill a law .
The Assembly would need to pass the same bill and the governor would need to sign it .
Assemblyman William Magnarelli , D - Syracuse , is the sponsor of an identical bill in the Assembly .
It is currently in the Codes Committee , Magnarelli said Tuesday afternoon .
“ I think the prospects are pretty good , ” he said .
“ I ’m very hopeful . ”
While embalming - fluid - soaked cigarettes are an issue locally , a spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association said it has not been an issue nationally .
Funeral directors buy their embalming fluid , which is used to preserve bodies after death , directly from manufacturers , she said .

Raw video captured by a McBride , B.C. , filmmaker of a close encounter with a pair of grizzly bears .
Leon Lorenz fired a single gunshot into the air , scaring the grizzly bears away as they charged towards him .
( CBC ) A B.C. filmmaker says he 's lucky to be alive after narrowly avoiding a grizzly attack while filming in the Robson Valley , southeast of Prince George .
Leon Lorenz , who lives in Dunster , B.C. , was filming grizzly bears in a nearby valley last Monday evening when he spotted a bear and her cub .
Lorenz said he took cover behind a spruce tree so he could film the bears without disturbing them , but the mother bear picked up his scent .
She turned suddenly , he said , and looked him right in the eyes .
Then , roaring , she charged through the trees right at Lorenz .
He recalls thinking , " This is for real .
This is … no bluff charge .
" Lorenz set the camera down on a tripod , capturing everything on film , and grabbed his handgun with the hopes of firing a warning shot to scare the grizzly off .
Crouched behind the tree , he aimed his gun high and pulled the trigger — just as the grizzly burst through the branches of the tree , a few feet from where he was hiding .
Lorenz said the shot spooked the bear , which he estimates weighed between 400 and 500 pounds , and she ran off with her cub .
" I knew if I would have run , I would n't be here , " he said .
"
If I did n't have my handgun , even if I would have fired a shot a quarter of a second later , the blast would have been too late .
She would have been on me . " ' I just thank God that I 'm still here ' Lorenz said it 's an experience he 'll never forget .
"
It 's something that will stay with me for life . …
It was really something that I never expected and I think I 've grown from it , " he said .
" I think even if I would have hit her , even a very fatal shot … she would have had enough life left in her to do me in .
" He believes it would have been nearly impossible to survive an attack at such a close range .
" They were both so fast .
It 's unbelievable — the speed — and I just thank God that I 'm still here .
" Lorenz said he 's grateful both he and the grizzly survived the encounter .
"
The timing could n't have been more perfect , " he said .
" The outcome could n't have been more perfect as far as , you know , I was n't touched , she was n't wounded , she was n't killed , her baby 's OK … and I was able to capture the whole thing [ on film ] .
" Lorenz said he has had about a dozen grizzly encounters , but a bear had never charged at him before .
" It just really shows … that their personalities are all different , just like people , " he said .
" But also , it shows that they 're unpredictable because they can be one way one day and totally different another day and … you just have to be as careful as you can . "
Six hundred light - years from Earth , a huge exoplanet circling close to its home star is slowly , inexorably being devoured .
WASP 12B orbits just 2 million miles from its star , which means the surface of the planet reaches temperatures over 2,800 Fahrenheit .
The sun 's gravitational pull is stronger on the front surface of the planet than on the back , so the planet has been pulled into a football shape .
If you were floating on the gaseous planet , and looking heavenward , the sun would take up nearly the entire sky .
And in the next 10 million years , the star that so dominates the planet will destroy it , according to a paper published in May in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
It 's not exactly the kind of solar system that human beings anticipated finding in the great beyond .
" All sorts of things that we would never expected to find we 're finding , " said Carole Haswell , an astronomer at The Open University in Great Britain who is heading up the work .
" Our preconceptions about what planetary systems might look like were shaped by what our own solar system looked like , particularly Star Trek , " she joked .
She and her team used the Hubble Space Telescope 's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph to investigate the planet by looking in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum .
" The near ultraviolet is a very sensitive probe to the presence of stuff and that allows you to deduce an effective radius for the planet , " she said .
WASP 12B has a puffed up atmosphere that its star is siphoning off .
That observation happily matches theoretical predictions made just a few months ago by astronomer Shu-lin Li at Peking University , Beijing .
The confirmation shows yet again that exoplanetology , particularly the study of other solar systems not just individual planets , is advancing at a breakneck pace .
" It is a really nice example of theorists predicting something and we 'd already observed something close to what they predicted , " Haswell said .
To date , 455 exoplanets have been discovered .

Image caption Some fans headed straight to their hotels after the disappointing draw
No England fans were arrested after Friday 's match with Algeria , despite the 25,000 - strong following being left furious at their team 's showing .
UK police in the country praised their reaction to the 0 - 0 draw in Cape Town , describing them as " extremely well behaved " , even when drinking .
Many fans booed England from the pitch , prompting an angry response from star Wayne Rooney - who later apologised .
And one fan managed to breach security to get into the players ' dressing room .
He was escorted out after exchanging " a few verbals " and the Football Association has since complained about the breach .
But the atmosphere outside the stadium , which had seen England fans singing and dancing with rival fans in the build - up to the game , remained cordial afterwards .
Ch Supt Dave Lewis said it was " refreshing " to see some England supporters congratulating the Algerians , many of whom were celebrating the surprise draw .
It 's a different set of supporters than we would normally see Ch Supt Dave Lewis Rooney says sorry to England fans
" Considering the number of supporters that were there I think they have been extremely well behaved , " he said .
" The fact that nothing happened , nobody was arrested , and given the amount of ale that was drunk , it was extremely pleasing . "
David Beckham , who is among the team 's backroom staff , played down the dressing room incident involving the fan .
" There was no scuffle , there was no aggression at all , " he said .
Prince William , who had visited the dressing room with Prince Harry shortly after the game , joked that the Royal brothers were at fault for " leaving the door open " .
Supporters in South Africa have been warned they will face swift justice in South Africa if they misbehave .
Large numbers of police were in Cape Town on Friday , many at the Waterfront as well as the stadium .
After the match , many fans headed straight back to their hotels in disappointment but others continued partying , while South African officers kept watch .
Supporters , including a large number of expatriates , have paid thousands of pounds for flights , accommodation and tickets .
' Well - heeled '
Ch Supt Lewis said many of the supporters were " well - heeled " and " not your normal England followers " .
He said : " It 's a different set of supporters than we would normally see . "
A contingent of 12 UK police officers is in South Africa , liaising with local authorities and patrolling on and around England match days in case of trouble .
Ch Supt Lewis led a team of six on the ground in Cape Town , including men in uniform and plainclothes " spotters " looking out for potential troublemakers .
The carnival atmosphere had given way to a sombre mood on Saturday , where England flags which had hung from railings and balconies at the Waterfront had been taken down .
Rolls - Royce worker Mark Webster , 51 , from Derby , summed up the feelings of many : " It was a disappointing performance .
We ran out of ideas . "
However , business consultant Mike Corry , 59 , from Durham , said he would still be cheering the team on in the next game .
" The passion from fans will still be there but the fans need to be rewarded by the players now , " he said .

Until President Obama 's first ever Oval Office address - to - the - nation the other night BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward was winning the booby prize as " America 's most clueless man " for his gaffe - prone TV interviews .
But Obama is gaining fast .
His self - exonerating speech , full of sparkling generalities and with no hint of frank accountability for his administration 's culpability in the nation 's worst environmental disaster , was like the man himself , bloodless and emotionally detached from the human costs of an oil invasion that 's now spreading from Louisiana to Texas , Florida and as far north as the Carolinas .
Instead , to cover his impotence to cope with the seemingly unstoppable 60,000 barrel a day spillage , and his deference to BP he 's appointing – what else ?
– one of those tired old wheezes , a " tsar " to oversee the Gulf spill effort and a " commission " to investigate its causes which by now are well known by everyone except the clueless White House .
Do n't they listen to their own scientific advisers ?
Tony Hayward must feel a little relief that the spotlight on him as a 24 - karat fool shifted momentarily on Tuesday night to our do - nothing - except - make - war president .
But the dogs are waking up and barking in the night .
Until BP 's blowout in the Gulf eight weeks ago the American left ( what there is of it ) trailed poodle - like after Barack Obama , refusing to criticise , let alone , attack " our guy in the White House " .
We had worked our butts off for his election , and now we were punched out or perhaps felt we had nowhere else to go – and is n't it nice for a change to have a president who can parse a complicated sentence ?
Any lingering doubts we had were stifled after one scary look at Obama 's yowling enemies – racist and crazy about Palin – which was enough to send us whimpering back to our kennels .
But like tiny buds of spring little fragile flowers of dissent are springing up all over the place , sometimes unexpectedly .
I live in West Los Angeles , an incubator for the Obama - voting intelligentsia .
A few days ago I drove past an ultra-liberal private academy in Santa Monica for the children of affluent Obama -ites , and the lawn sign in big letters proclaimed a snide reference to Obama 's dismal failure get a handle on BP 's environmental crime .
Garry Trudeau 's daily cartoon Doonesbury , which bashed Bush for years , now satirises the Obama presidency for its incomprehensible torpor in the national emergency .
" The White House grows more passive every day , " a Doonesbury character says in a dig at No Drama Obama 's habit of lofty detachment .
Once faithful Obama retainers like syndicated columnists Maureen Dowd and Frank Rich are turning on the president for his crushing indifference to the simple human predicament of the disaster 's victims .
Even TV's Keith Olberman , until now virtually an Obama PR man , complains that the Oval Office speech " was great … if you were on another planet for the past 67 days " .
And Rachel Maddow , until now a fervent Obama cheerleader , has criticised his way - off - the - mark speech .
George W Bush gave the ( false ) impression , fostered by his flacks , of actually liking ordinary people .
Obama prefers photo ops to human contact , such as the ridiculous posed pictures of him earnestly examining " tar balls " washed ashore in LaFourche Parish and promising Gulf residents , " I 'm here to tell you that you are not alone .
You will not be abandoned , and you will not be left behind " – only to promptly leave for a Chicago vacation .
He 's not only tone deaf but also growing hostile to public criticism .
Indeed , Obama goes after whistleblowers with more punishing venom than ever did George W Bush who whined about leaks but did not indict .
In Obama 's 17 months in office he has outdone all his Oval Office predecessors in going after anyone in government who dares spill the beans to the media .
For example , instead of ordering court - martials for the army helicopter gunmen who murdered unarmed Baghdad civilians – a video shown worldwide by Wikileaks – the young GI leaker , 22 - year old Bradley Manning , has been arrested , and the Pentagon cops are frantically trying to smoke out , and shut down , Wikileak 's Pimpernel - like founder , Julian Assange .
I did not think it possible , but our President Obama has an even thinner skin than Bush .
With each passing day , as crises pile up , from out - of - control unemployment to the Gulf to Gaza to the failed Afghanistan adventure , the underlying liberal authoritarianism of the Obama White House becomes clearer .
We , Obama 's " liberal base " , of which I 'm a charter member , were in numb denial that our former community organiser , who elicited such an outpouring of love from his vast network of volunteers , is actually just another Illinois pol – but with a better vocabulary .
But the dogs of dissent are waking up and starting to howl .
Updated 2:20 pm Pacific , June 21
The sustainable agriculture world is abuzz today with news of the Supreme Court ’s ruling regarding an earlier lawsuit , brought by alfalfa farmers , that sought to stop any planting of Monsanto ’s genetically engineered Roundup Ready alfalfa seed .
While the press coverage heralds the ruling as a decisive victory for Monsanto , a close reading shows that , in fact , it ’s a fairly significant win for opponents of biotech crops .
Hay dudes , not so fast
The background :
As the fourth most - planted U.S. crop behind corn , soybeans , and wheat , alfalfa is worth $ 9 billion a year — the dairy industry is the biggest consumer — with annual seed sales valued at $ 63 million , according to a USDA study .
Monsanto ’s Roundup Ready alfalfa seed has been genetically engineered to be tolerant of glyphosate , the active ingredient of Monsanto ’s herbicide Roundup .
Earlier this year , the U.S. District Court in San Francisco found that the USDA had illegally approved Roundup Ready alfalfa for planting — which the agency refers to as “ deregulating ” — by allowing Monsanto to sell and farmers to plant the seeds without the USDA completing a required full Environmental Impact Statement .
( A preliminary one was under way . )
In response to a lawsuit filed by GMO - opposed alfalfa farmers along with the Center for Food Safety on behalf of consumers , the District Court halted all planting of Roundup Ready alfalfa until the USDA completes the EIS , which could take years .
It also issued two injunctions : one that prevented the USDA from performing a so - called “ partial deregulation ” of Roundup Ready alfalfa , i.e. allowing restricted and otherwise limited planting , while it prepared the final environmental statement ; the other stopping farmers from planting any Roundup Ready alfalfa starting with the 2010 crop year .
( For a deeper look into the lead - up to the case , read Matt Jenkins ’ excellent 2007 feature “ Brave New Hay ” from High Country News . )
Today , in a 7 - 1 opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito , the Supreme Court reversed both District Court injunctions , saying that the Court had overreached itself procedurally in halting the plantings .
( Both Justices Steven Breyer and Clarence Thomas had conflicts of interest in the case — Breyer ’s brother was the District Court judge on the case , while Thomas was corporate counsel for Monsanto earlier in his career , but only Breyer saw fit to recuse himself . )
Despite the news reports claiming victory for Monsanto , the Supreme Court did not overturn the central tenet of the case : that the USDA prematurely approved Roundup Ready alfalfa .
The District Court , in effect , made it once again illegal to plant Roundup Ready alfalfa — and the Supreme Court endorsed that ruling .
While the Justices did declare that the USDA , if it wants to , has the right to give the seed a preliminary approval ( i.e. for limited , restricted planting ) , the Supreme Court decision does not by itself give Roundup Ready alfalfa the green light .
And it ’s important to note that the USDA has not yet formally announced any intention to re-authorize the restricted plantings , which would come in the form of a rule for “ partial deregulation ” of Roundup Ready alfalfa .
In fact , the agency and Monsanto hed preciously submitted such a plan to the District Court in hopes that it would be incorporated into the final ruling , and instead , they received an injunction .
To some , that move appeared to be an attempt at an end run around the official rulemaking process .
It ’s not clear if the USDA will move forward with anything other than the “ final ” environmental review .
[ Update : ]
The USDA office that oversees biotech crops , the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) , just released a brief statement via email in response to the Supreme Court ’s ruling .
In it , the agency leaves the door open to some sort of preliminary approval for the alfalfa seed , without indicating its intention one way or the other : “ APHIS is carefully reviewing the Supreme Court ruling before making decisions about its next regulatory actions related to the deregulation of Roundup Ready alfalfa . ”
It also announced its intention to complete the full environmental impact statement “ in time for the spring planting of alfalfa crops in 2011 . ”
That start date presumes they get through the process without any more lawsuits or injunctions — not a safe bet , at all .
No mo ’ gene flow ?
More importantly , the Supreme Court has also now ruled for the very first time that “ environmental harm ” includes economic effects such as reduced agricultural yield or loss of market due to genetic contamination , as well as the concept of what biologists refer to as “ gene flow ” ( in practice , the idea that genetically engineered material may get into conventional plants through cross-pollination ) .
The Supreme Court now accepts that this phenomenon in and of itself is harmful and illegal under current environment protections .
“ That ’s a huge win for our side … That ’s gigantic ! ” Michael Hansen , senior staff scientist of Consumers Union , told me .
Future lawsuits can now confidently use the gene - flow argument against approval and use of genetically engineered crops .
Others share his glee .
The Center for Food Safety called the ruling “ a victory for the Center for Food Safety and the farmers and consumers it represents . ”
For its part , Monsanto is spinning the ruling positively .
In a statement posted on its website , the company said :
This is exceptionally good news received in time for the next planting season .
Farmers have been waiting to hear this for quite some time .
We have Roundup Ready alfalfa seed ready to deliver and await USDA guidance on its release .
Our goal is to have everything in place for growers to plant in fall 2010 .
Well , from all appearances Monsanto has this flat wrong .
Farmers can’t plant Roundup Ready alfalfa just yet .
And even if the USDA tries for that preliminary approval , the Supreme Court made very clear that today ’s ruling does not presume that any preliminary approval is ( or is n’t ) legal .
Indeed , the legal issues at the heart of the ruling are n’t over the rights of corporations or the science behind genetically engineered seed , but about the separation of powers between co-equal branches of government .
The Supreme Court today stopped a District Court from telling a federal agency that it could n’t make regulatory rules .
For the judiciary to stop the government from doing its job requires meeting a very rigorous set of standards .
After the Supreme Court decided to make this point the crux of its ruling , all the other issues fell by the wayside .
Another way of looking at it is that the supposed “ overreach ” by the District Court was against the USDA , not Monsanto .
The Supreme Court has also made the point very clearly that outside groups have the ability to file lawsuits in order to stop any poorly conceived or improperly executed rule that a federal agency passes .
And surprisingly enough , the Court — with its expansion of the definition of “ environmental harm ” to include things like gene flow — just gave consumer groups a whole new set of legal weapons to wield against the same companies currently crowing over the implications of today ’s events .

Thanks to the Teajad that the Paliban wing of the Texas Board of Education has declared against history , truth , and anything that is n't evangelical Christianity , Texas schoolchildren will now be trained to be good little soldiers for Jeebus .
Because according to them , facts have a decided liberal bias .
( If Stephen Colbert did n't exist , we would have to invent him for occasions like this . )
Yesterday , before voting , high - profile Board member Cynthia Dunbar did the invocation " Likes to believe " ?
Texas schoolchildren are going to be taught revisionist history because this nutball " likes to believe " narcissistic sociopathic delusions ?
The first charter of Virginia , a document written by King James I to the Virginia company , DID assign land rights for the purpose of spreading Christianity .
However , it dates back to 1606 and last I looked , King James I ( yes , THAT King James I , son of Mary , Queen of Scots and great - nephew of Henry VIII ) was not recognized as one of the Founding Fathers of this country ( though perhaps in the new Christian curriculum of Texas , he will be ) .
By Dunbar 's logic , the Virginia Charter , not the Constitution , is one of the founding documents of this country and so I suppose that a fifth of any gold , silver , or copper found in Virginia should be shipped back to Queen Elizabeth and that she be declared the rightful head of state .
It also explicitly states that Virginia is part of the realm of England , but Dunbar and her Christofascist Zombies conveniently forget that part .
As for the charter of New England , this one dates from 1620 -- also prior to the Revolution and the founding of the United States .
This is another dictate from our friend James I -- a long rant that includes
So yes , we can say that King Jimmy did intend for Virginia and New England to be dens of proseletyzer / warriors .
What makes this hilarious , for anyone who has even passed by Masterpiece Theatre over the years , is that Dunbar 's adoption of King James I as a Founding Father , supplanting the hemp - smokers and libertines who actual DID set forth the documents that most of us who are actually SANE regard as the founding documents of this country , means that the laws of this land descend from a guy whose great - grand - uncle established himself as head of the Church in England so he could get rid of a wife and marry a younger , presumably more fertile chickie , then cut that one 's head off when she failed to produce a son , had the one who DID give him a son die in childbirth , got rid of another one who was at least smart enough to go quietly , and cut off the head of another one .
All of which I guess puts Henry VIII , whose sister Margaret married James IV of Scotland and produced James V , who in turn married Marie de Guise and produced Mary , Queen of Scots , mother of James VI of Scotland , who became heir to the throne of England when Elizabeth I died childless , as a fitting spiritual and behavioral ancestor to the Christopath psychotics who run the Republican Party today ( see also : Sanford , Mark ; Gingrich , Newt ; Souder , Mark , etc. ) as well as the Texas Board of Education .

Edward L. Glaeser is an economics professor at Harvard .
Last week , I began an examination of the remarkable health of New York City by discussing the two - centuries - old fight against urban disease .
The vast urban investment in clean water and street cleaning may explain why New York City became a lot healthier , but it does n’t explain why life expectancy is now 1.5 years higher in New York than in the nation as a whole .
Perhaps it is n’t surprising that New York is no sicker than the rest of the country , but why should it be healthier ?
Over the past century , the mortality gaps between New York and the nation have converged , widened and converged again .
The life expectancy for a boy born in 1901 was about seven years less in New York than elsewhere in the United States , but by the end of the Great Depression , New York had achieved health parity with the nation .
In 1940 , life expectancy at birth was 62.5 years for a white male in New York and 62.1 years for a white man in the country as a whole .
The gap for white women between city and country was even smaller .
The increasing health of New Yorkers over this period came from a massive reduction in deaths from respiratory tuberculosis , nephritis and influenza and pneumonia .
Then between 1940 and 1990 , the health gap between New York and the nation widened again .
By 1990 , life expectancy at birth was 75.4 years in the United States but only 72.4 years in New York .
The AIDS epidemic and rising homicides are two particularly visible explanations for the city ’s deteriorating health , but the difference in death rates also reflected higher death rates from heart disease in New York .
These gaps may reflect unhealthy urban lifestyles or the stress of New York City during those years .
But since 1990 , the life expectancy gaps first narrowed , and by the end of the 1990s , New York managed to have a higher life expectancy than the United States did as a whole .
Wealthier and better - educated people tend to be healthier , but these factors ca n’t explain the health of New York City .
The average household in New York City , as opposed to the average person working in Manhattan , earns less than the national average .
Yes , there are more college graduates in New York per 100,000 residents than anywhere else in the country , but there are also more high school dropouts .
These factors ca n’t explain the gap .
It is easiest to understand why New York is less deadly for younger adults .
About 81 of every 100,000 New Yorkers aged 25 to 34 died in 2006 , as opposed 106 out of every 100,000 in the nation .
Accidents and suicides are the two leading causes of death for these younger people .
The suicide rate in New York City among this younger group is substantially less than the rate in the nation as a whole .
Ten years ago , David Cutler , Karen Norberg and I studied youth suicides .
We noted the tendency of suicide rates to be highest in low - density areas , which may be explained by the strong relationship between suicide and gun ownership , as measured by hunting licenses per capita .
The gap in accidents between city and country is even larger .
New Yorkers between 25 and 34 are more than 75 percent less likely to die in a motor vehicle accident than their counterparts nationwide .
Driving drunk is far more deadly than taking the bus while tipsy .
But the bulk of the mortality difference between New York and the nation occurs among older cohorts , and here the situation is far murkier .
The death rates in the nation are 5.5 percent higher for 55 - to - 64 - year - olds than in New York , 17 percent higher for 65 - to - 74 - year - olds and more than 24 percent higher for 75 - to - 84 - year - olds .
There is no single smoking gun for these groups .
Deaths from cancer are lower for these groups , but deaths from heart disease are not .
Perhaps Mayor Bloomberg ’s anti-smoking policies play a role , but New York became healthier than the nation during the Giuliani years .
Perhaps walking around a city makes New Yorkers healthier , but then why is n’t heart disease rarer in New York ?
I ’d like to think that the robust nature of life in a big city is keeping people alive , but I suspect that selection may play a role .
If really sick people are more likely to leave the city , this could then create an illusory appearance of Big Apple healthiness .
The health of New York City ’s older cohorts remains something of a mystery , but there is no doubt that the city is no longer a place marked by death and disease .
Not only are big cities places of remarkable economic productivity and cultural vitality , but they are also healthy places to live .
President Barack Obama finally might be digging in his executive heels over the Gulf oil blowout .
The White House has announced the president will address the nation Tuesday night about the spill and is expected to outline a plan that would force BP to create a multibillion - dollar escrow account to compensate those affected .
–JCL
The New York Times :
President Obama for the first time will address the nation about the ongoing oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday night and outline his plans to legally force BP executives to create an escrow account reserving billions of dollars to compensate businesses and individuals if the company does not do so on its own , a senior administration official said on Sunday .
“ The president will use his legal authority to compel them , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman .
Mr. Gibbs did not elaborate on the legal basis for such a move but said that White House lawyers have been researching the matter for days .
The president is seizing the initiative after reports on Friday from London that BP would voluntarily establish an escrow account — either for compensating victims or for delaying a planned dividend for BP shareholders — turned out to be less certain than the White House initially thought .
The escrow account that the White House envisions would be roughly modeled after the fund established for victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and it would be administered by a third party to provide greater independence and transparency and to guard against the company too narrowly defining who is entitled to payments and how much .

Sometimes life hands you a 1989 Volvo 745T Wagon , and you are forced to turn lemons into lemonade .
Douglas Strickler knows how to do this , and his proof is in his Volvette .
I just stumbled onto it recently , and it may be old news to everytbody else in the world , but I saw the car and fell in love .
It started life as typical family truckster , and now has a fire breathing LS1 twin turbo , backed with a 6 - speed manual transmission .
It has 500 + horsepower and could likely get you to soccer practice at the speed of light .
It ’s got bigger brakes , 18 inch wheels , and wagon loads of custom parts .
I ca n’t even imagine how fun this car must be to drive .
Only two words come to mind .
Do Want .

Xrefresh is a simple X program that causes all or part of your screen to be repainted .
This is useful when system messages have messed up your screen .
Xrefresh maps a window on top of the desired area of the screen and then immediately unmaps it , causing refresh events to be sent to all applications .
By default , a window with no background is used , causing all applications to repaint “ smoothly . ”
However , the various options can be used to indicate that a solid background ( of any color ) or the root window background should be used instead .
- white Use a white background .
The screen just appears to flash quickly , and then repaint .
- black Use a black background ( in effect , turning off all of the electron guns to the tube ) .
This can be somewhat disorienting as everything goes black for a moment .
- solid color Use a solid background of the specified color .
Try green .
- root Use the root window background .
- none
This is the default .
All of the windows simply repaint .
- geometry WxH+X+Y
Specifies the portion of the screen to be repainted ; see X ( 7 ) .
- display display
This argument allows you to specify the server and screen to refresh ; see X ( 7 ) .
Black ,
White , Solid , None , Root Determines what sort of window background to use .
Geometry Determines the area to refresh .
Not very useful .
DISPLAY - To get default host and display number .
It should have just one default type for the background .

Eğlence mekanına alınmayınca havaya ateş açan polise gözalt ı
Showing a policeman the door turned out -- inadvertently -- to be a good business decision for the
in Southeast Portland .
The vegan establishment was deluged with customers in the two days after
, then kicked him out .
" We had a couple of really busy days over the weekend , " said John Langley , the co-owner who served Officer James Crooker and asked him to leave .
" We had two $ 1,100 days , which is maybe double a typical day . "
The story sparked a fiery response , with national coverage and about 600 comments posted on
.
Along with a boost in customers , the cafe has received five threats of arson and other violence .
Many people also expressed outrage at Langley 's treatment of Crooker , who 's received an outpouring of support on the streets .
All that after buying a quick coffee on May 18 .
Crooker was walking out of the cafe when he was approached by a customer , Cornelia Seigneur , who said she appreciated the work of Portland police .
Langley , who was watching , said seeing a uniformed officer in the cafe made him uncomfortable .
So he went up and asked Crooker to leave , which he did .
And that was that ,
, and the story went viral .
Langley said that most of the criticism has come from people threatening never to eat at the cafe .
" I think most of those folks are people who had never or would never come to the restaurant , " he said .
The cafe has n't suffered any vandalism or any other attacks , and Langley does n't expect any , either .
" It would be highly ironic if there were because the folks who are the most upset about this are presumably those who are in support of the police , " he said , " so it would be weird for them to commit crimes . "
Although business has picked up , some customers voiced support for police .
" I would n't even think twice about it if a police officer came in here for a bite , maybe to make sure things are running OK , " said Stacey Tran , who lives in the neighborhood and was at the cafe Monday .
" That 's part of their job .
It 's what our tax dollars go toward . "
Online commenters have asked what the cafe 's seven co-owners would do if they were attacked .
Call the police ?
" I do n't think we are trying to be purists about it , " Langley said .
" We would prefer that there be some practical alternative to police like community forums for restorative justice , for example . "
At a news conference Monday , Langley rejected criticism that he had discriminated against the officer .
" In no way does this compare to racial profiling or racism , " he said .
" A person can choose to be a police officer but a person of color cannot . "
Langley said earlier that many of the customers in the cafe , which draws vegans and environmental and animal rights activists , have been victims of harsh police tactics and were worried about
.
A member of
, a police monitoring group , backed up that sentiment at the news conference , saying in a statement that Portland police are focused on arresting people " to maintain a status quo that is built along race , class and gender lines . "
Still , Langley said police officers are welcome in the cafe out of uniform .
" It 's not personal , " he said .
Nor did Crooker take the incident to heart .
In fact , the reaction has been heartening , he said .
He 's received calls from police officers from New York and Washington state offering to buy him , even the entire bureau , coffee .
Portlanders have approached him on the street offering to treat him to coffee as well .
" Every single police officer in the area has been receiving the same love from the citizens and that 's heartwarming , " Crooker said .
None of his colleagues is angry about the incident , he said .
" I do n't know of any police officers who have any ill will towards the cafe owner or anyone who 's involved in this , " Crooker said .
" Hopefully everyone walks away from this graciously with the lessons that life has taught us and nobody has any bad feelings about anything . "

MONTREAL -- The Montreal Canadiens ' improbable playoff run has reached a decisive seventh game for a second series in a row .
Michael Cammalleri scored his second goal of the game midway through the second period and Jaroslav Spacek netted the go - ahead tally 2:30 later for the Canadiens , who forced a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 4 - 3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Monday night .
Maxim Lapierre also scored 11:03 into the third to give Montreal a 4 - 2 lead .
Bill Guerin deflected Sergei Gonchar 's slap shot from the right point past Jaroslav Halak with 1:24 remaining to draw Pittsburgh within one .
But the Canadiens held on to set up Game 7 in Pittsburgh on Wednesday .
" For us , it 's the reality , " Cammalleri said .
" If you pinch yourself , you 're beat .
I remember when you first come in the league if you start sitting around staring in awe and catching flies you 'll be out pretty quick .
Now we belong .
We 're having fun .
For us , hey , we 've got an opportunity to knock these guys off in Game 7 .
Let 's go enjoy it and I 'll say the same thing I 've said every game : ' Let 's see if we can't go and play a great game . "
Halak stopped 34 shots for the eighth - seeded Canadiens , who came back to beat Washington in the first round after falling into a 3 - 1 series hole against the Presidents '
Trophy - winning Capitals .
They now have an opportunity to end the reigning Stanley Cup champions ' run of five straight playoff series wins .
" We know it 's going to be a great challenge for us , " Lapierre said .
" We know what to expect from them , from their fans , and we just need a good start in Pittsburgh . "
Penguins captain Sidney Crosby scored his first goal in seven games in the first period .
Crosby earned an assist for his 19th point in 12 games when Kris Letang scored for a second game in a row early in the second .
That made it 2 - 1 for Pittsburgh , which had closed out each of its five previous playoff series with a road win .
Cammalleri , who opened the scoring 1:13 in , drew the Canadiens even 10:45 into the middle period when he put a backhand past goalie Marc - Andre Fleury from the slot for his second of the game .
He has 11 goals in 13 games .
Spacek , who returned to the lineup after missing nine games with a virus , drove a slap shot from the point past Fleury at 13:15 to touch off a thunderous ovation from the crowd .
Fleury made 21 saves .
" They were facing elimination , " Penguins left wing Pascal Dupuis said .
" They were a desperate hockey team .
They came hard .
They have some guys who are putting the puck in the net right now .
Cammalleri's playing really well for them right now and at the same time they 're in their building , they played well and we 've just got to go back home and win at home . "
Game 7 could prove to be the final game at Mellon Arena , the Penguins ' longtime home .
The defending champions , who have n't lost a playoff series since falling to Detroit in six games in the 2008 Stanley Cup finals , will move into the new Consol Energy Center next season .
Shutdown defenseman Hal Gill was unable to play for Montreal after he was forced to leave Saturday night 's game .
Gill , who skated in pregame warmups , was cut on the back of his left leg by former teammate Chris Kunitz 's skate in the Canadiens ' 2 - 1 loss in Pittsburgh in Game 5 .
Cammalleri opened the scoring when he took Tomas Plekanec 's return pass and fired a shot past Fleury from the right circle .
Crosby , who had n't scored since extending his first - round streak to four games in Game 5 against Ottawa , tied it at 7:22 when he batted a puck out of the air past Halak .
Letang gave the Penguins a 2 - 1 lead on a power play 5:21 into the second when his shot from the slot trickled through Halak for his fifth goal .

80 - Ray LaMontagne - Beg Steal or Borrow
We re going to be talking a lot about pop music today .
It s the New Year and you should be reminded that Top - 40 stations in this still infantile decade are mostly doing a public service :
They are Americas splash of ice water after forcing yourself to listen to talk radio for more than ten minutes .
God bless you , Beyonce .
Youve saved us all .
In so many ways .
Anyways , Ray LaMontagne finagled his way onto some Top - 40 stations this year .
Not sure how it happened .
He probably convinced a Viacom rep that he was James Taylor , but that he had a Cat Stevens - like conversion and became a Mennonite .
In a utopian future , I feel like this is the new elevator music .
It s what theyll play at CVS while you buy gold - encrusted future shampoo and flying car polish and try to talk yourself out of spending three dollars on the bag of Riesens that s been sitting there since 1997 .
79 - Fresh & Onlys - Waterfall
 You and I know from the radio that the radio never lies / and the radio said that the TVs dead ... but the TV said you cant believe everything you hear . 
I just read that Boston Herald sports columnist Steve Buckley came out of the closet .
It s very , very early as I m typing this , so pardon me if this reaction is too visceral or too sweeping .
But , damn , I m proud of this guy .
I dont want to extrapolate too long - windedly here , but I spent a lot of time being a very bad reporter at Red Sox games for the Globe last year .
I was horrendous , just bumbling from place to place for hours on end .
Im pretty sure John Smoltz thought I was a lost puppy .
This would explain so many things .
I do a lot of pro sports reporting , still , but theres really no place like a Red Sox press room .
And I mean that in every pejorative , shady way you read it .
Maybe it ages very well and you develop a palette for it , like foie gras or something .
I doubt it .
But , if it does , Steve Buckley is in that place .
He makes that area work .
He is a gem of an adult in a Boston sports media sphere that is filled to the brim with six - year - olds with hurt feelings and giant heads .
Again , this is probably the hour , but I m spending actual , human minutes that were given to me to be on this Earth to go through the Heralds comments section tonight .
( I know .
Email me and Ill give you the address where you can send me my medal . )
The response is overwhelmingly positive .
How couldnt it be ?
This is a heartfelt , emotional story coming from a guy who generally knows how to craft such things .
Heres a paragraph that shouldnt have to be written , but he does it with remarkable grace .
But during this same period , I have read sobering stories about people who came undone , killing themselves after being outed .
These tragic events helped guide me to the belief that if more people are able to be honest about who they are , ultimately fewer people will feel such devastating pressure .
There are those commenters , however , that worry for the sake of the players in the locker room .
These poor players !
How can this now outed gay man ever conduct himself properly around these semi-naked , mostly - fat , mostly rude baseball players ?
This has been planted in their heads by the same bigoted talking heads that harbored the same anachronistic thought process that wouldve kept women out of the locker room 20 years ago .
Then we wouldnt have had , say , Jackie MacMullan , who is one of the best sportswriters this city has ever had .
Im sure those millionaires will grow to be fine with it .
If not , theyll eventually grow up , but they probably wont be as brave as Buck was when he hit send on his story .
78 - Menomena - Tithe
This song is capable of giving me the chills .
77 - Uffie - Neuneu
Lets talk about Ke$ha .
Please , dont recoil in horror immediately .
This is nt the unedited script of The Last Airbender .
You re okay .
And you re with Ke$ha , remember .
You just have to hate her out loud .
It s weird to admit that , but you are .
From all that Ive read about Ke$ha , she completely sucks as a person .
I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt , but Ive read too many interviews at this point , and every interviewer secretly wants to shove her in a bag and sell her to the Chinese .
It burns through the page like holy water in a Dan Brown novel .
Features in Complex ( this month ) and Rolling Stone ( over the summer ) include some variation of this sentence :
 She very clearly slept her way to the top , as evidenced by this oft - repeated story about her vomiting in Paris Hiltons closet ( really ) , and dont tell her I said this she smells like a BLT , but shes really smart .
Fifteen - hundred on the SAT !
So I tried to like her .
I failed .
It happens .
She might be good for music anyway .
Look ,  Tik Tok did some interesting things for a pop song .
It starts off with an 8 - bit synthesizer .
It eventually uses it like a sample , but doesnt just repeat it over and over again like an Usher song .
It has a dynamic bridge .
It does things musically , on purpose .
It s going to make it so people can find out about artists who have been doing this for a while but focus more on the music - making than the closet - vomiting .
Uffie , for example , exists in this capacity .
76 - Love in Stockholm - The Tally
Call me dumb , maybe a little soft , or slightly weakly willed , but I dont truly understand the appeal of local music .
In fact , let s back up : Just call me cotton ball brains .
That seems to encompass all of those things .
Call me that .
That sounds like a cool nickname .
Sorry .
We were talking about local music .
What I m trying to say is that its bad .
Almost always objectively bad .
Sure , I could go to the converted basement of a guy named Dan and hear some 19 - year - old sing about why his dad doesnt love him while a bunch of girls with headbands on nod in agreement and drink Poland Springs vodka .
This how I could spend my Saturdays .
Or !
Or I could punch all of my teeth out one - by - one with a bandsaw .
These two things , stacked right there next to each other , are both valid options .
So local music is a usually infuriating , always trying , and a sometimes physically painful waste of time .
Until you see Love in Stockholm .
Someone willed me to see them with some Ask Not What Your Country Can Do For You - level Kennedian rhetoric on Halloween night this year .
She should receive an award .
 They sound like Maroon 5 if they had any edge or character whatsoever ,  she said .
Deep down , is nt that what everyone secretly wants out of a band ?
For them to sound like Maroon 5 , if Maroon 5 liked dirty guitar solos and if anyone in Maroon 5 ever had a real problem that needed to be dealt with and possibly couldnt be fixed ?
The answer is yes .
That s all you want .
They played Sgt. Peppers in its entirety that night because they were dressed like the Beatles , so why not ?
Also , they completely destroyed it .
Listen to Ol Cotton Ball Brains on this one .
This is Bostons best right now .
75 - I guess I should put something by the Black Keys here
Why did this album , of all Black Keys albums , wind up being the one that blew up ?
I like it and all .
I sound like I 'm in a Tennessee garage taping a show for the Discovery channel .
I know that 's what they were going for .
This band wrote " Grown So Ugly " previously , which is almost perfect .
Why now ?
Is it the album cover ?
If it 's the album cover , I totally understand .
74 - The Script - Breakeven
Hey , I told you there was a lot of pop music today .
The best summer melody in a very long time .
Plus , how many Top - 40 songs do you know that start with a lyric like this ?
 Im still alive , but I m barely breathing / I m just praying to a God that I dont believe in .
This is coming in a year wherein a top - 10 hit had these lyrics in the chorus :
 Baby got some boobies like wow - wow - wow . 
He also lifted the entire chorus from Homer Simpson and wont admit to it .
It s impossible to see where music is going .
Because its not going in one direction .
73 - Ryan Adams - Happy Birthday
It is increasingly hard to write about Ryan Adams without sounding like Ryan Adams .
I guess thats what happens when you listen to this much Ryan Adams .
If I had my way , this song would be ranked somewhere much higher , maybe in the teens .
But that would be unfair to you .
You might think I m weird , today , having no experience with Ryans work .
I would understand that .
So hes here , dawdling in the back amongst Uffie and a one - hit wonder , where hell be until everybody else figures out what hes been trying to say for the last ten years .
What hes been trying to say is , hey , everybody , I m completely brilliant and I m not just saying that .
Ryan Adams has become the greatest connector amongst friends , a conduit for consistent relationship upkeep , the stickum powder that is lifes Danny Woodhead hands .
Ive gone months without talking to specific people and then it happens hell come out with a new album or a song or project and well reconvene .
Well all dissect and dissect .
It seems like sort of stupid behavior to just pick apart one person like this with great admiration .
The closest comparison that makes even the slightest sense is a less hairy Bruce Springsteen or Elvis Costello without all of the nice hats .
Hundreds rally behind these people and I mostly dont understand it .
But even that s unfair .
No one rallies behind Ryan Adams because hes the most energetic entertainer in the world .
We rally behind him because hes the most transparent person in the world .
We all want to see whats going to go on in our lives next .
We all discover little bits and pieces at our own pace .
There s just too much material .
Sometimes months will go by and nothing , then we find something and it makes a little sense of everything at the time .
A friend will figure out Gold as I start to get what hes saying in Destroyer .
It makes us all feel very smart , very official .
We re all wearing very nice suits as we talk about this over the phone .
This must be , we all say , how the profoundly dumb feel about Jimmy Buffett .
We get very attached to a part in an album that rings particularly true or funny or singular and it reveals a little about ourselves .
This happened to me with  You Will Always Be The Same right before III / IV came out in December .
Then III / IV had  Happy Birthday . 
It contains these lyrics .
I think they re brilliant .
Other friends think they re a little insane .
Theyll come around eventually and call me about it .
 I told everybody I was late , but I was hiding in the back .
Hiding in the back , my hands would shake .
Happy birthday , I m your birthday cake and I m lit . 
But they re still listening to it .
Because Ryan Adams writes hooks by mistake .

“ It makes it sound like it could n’t happen here because we are the good immigrants : hard - working , close - knit , educated , ” said Junaid Rana , an assistant professor of Asian - American studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and an American - born son of Pakistani immigrants .
“ But we are talking about a cult mind - set , how a cult does its brainwashing . ”

Yet one major difference between the United States and Britain , some say , is the United States ’ historical ideal of being a melting - pot meritocracy .
“ You can keep the flavor of your ethnicity , but you are expected to become an American , ” said Omer Mozaffar , 34 , a Pakistani - American raised here who is working toward a doctorate in Islamic studies at the University of Chicago .
Britain remains far more rigid .
In the United States , for example , Pakistani physicians are more likely to lead departments at hospitals or universities than they are in Britain , said Dr. Tariq H. Butt , a 52 - year - old family physician who arrived in the United States 25 years ago for his residency .
Nationwide , Pakistanis appear to be prospering .
The census calculated that mean household income in the United States in 2002 was $ 57,852 annually , while that for Asian households , which includes Pakistanis , was $ 70,047 .
By contrast , about one - fifth of young British - born Muslims are jobless , and many subsist on welfare .
Hard numbers on how many people of Pakistani descent live in the United States do not exist , but a forthcoming book from Harvard University Press on charitable donations among Pakistani - Americans , “ Portrait of a Giving Community , ” puts the number around 500,000 , with some 35 percent or more of them in the New York metropolitan area .
Chicago has fewer than 100,000 , while other significant clusters exist in California , Texas and Washington , D.C .
Pakistani immigration to the United States surged after laws in the 1960 ’s made it easier for Asians to enter the country .
Most were drawn by jobs in academia , medicine and engineering .
It was only in the late 1980 ’s and 90’s that Pakistanis arrived to work blue - collar jobs as taxi drivers or shopkeepers , said Adil Najam , the author of the book on donations and an international relations professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University .
