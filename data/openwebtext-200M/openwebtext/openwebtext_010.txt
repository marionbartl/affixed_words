Today I am releasing a Photoshop brush pack .
As you can see from the preview the main theme of the pack is lightnings .
Of course you can use them in other ways such as roots , or whatever else you might think .
Most of them are at +1700 px , a decent resolution for a lot of different [… ]
They liked us .
In fact , they liked us so much that they would sometimes invite people on to their ships , take them for rides around the universe , tell them all about their alien technology and culture , then insert large probes into their bottoms for reasons that are probably none of our business .
These guests were not selected at random and typically had several crucial features in common : they were always from the country ; they had very few friends ; they were never in possession of any sort of camera ; and they never remembered anything until they were either under deep hypnosis or on television , preferably both .
But it has been a very long time since we 've had a decent UFO sighting .
Indeed , it 's been so long that many people have forgotten what UFOs look like .
This has had a deleterious effect on UFO sighting statistics , which have fallen with alarming alarmingness over the past few decades .
It 's no doubt happened that people have seen large , perfectly smooth metallic saucers hovering in their back paddock , surgically removing the stomach lining from cattle , and not realised that it was , in fact , a bona fide UFO and not a reminder to finally say no to cold pizza just before bed .
The reasons for the drop - off in UFO sightings are many and complex .
Extensive studies by the Institute for Making Up Statistical Trends have established a distinct inverse correlation between alien visitation and the development of human photographic technology .
That is , the better we got at taking sharp , high - resolution pictures of things , the fewer aliens spaceships we saw .
Support for this is a matter of record .
Back in prehistoric times when all people could do was paint pictures into cave walls and chisel images into stone slabs , the Earth was positively teeming with aliens .
They helped us build pyramids and temples , and also formed some of civilisation 's earliest executive management teams , with much of their unintelligible language still very much in evidence today .
Once cameras were invented , however , the aliens seemed less willing to show themselves .
As cameras became cheaper and more plentiful , the aliens seemed even more reluctant to drop in , and now that digital cameras are about as common as teenagers with severe eardrum damage , visits from our alien friends appear to have dropped off altogether , if not totally .
The key question we now face at this point in our ongoing investigation into alien culture is : what does this teach us about the aliens ?
Here are several important notes : ( 1 ) Despite their advanced intelligence , the aliens are extraordinarily shy and self - conscious about their appearance .
This supports the long - held theory that their visits to Earth are on the urging from a more self - confident and attractive alien civilisation who just want them to get out and meet people , otherwise they 're going to end up as the unmarried alien civilisation who lives all alone on the corner in the large house with all the cats .
(2) That human civilisation was a science project by some alien students whose report has been assessed with a passing mark , so there 's no need for them to return .
( 3 ) That the last person the aliens abducted had just been to an all - you - can - eat Mexican restaurant , and there 's no way they 're going to travel 50 billion light years to put themselves through that again . ( 4 ) It 's just God messing with our heads again .
Infinitely more disturbing is a fifth theory .
This holds how the aliens have not stopped visiting us at all .
The Government may want us to think they have , but it 's far more likely that the aliens walk among us posing as normal Earthlings , trying hard to understand our culture , our society and why we keep buying gym memberships when we almost never go .
What is their plan ?
Do they come in peace ?
And should they bring a plate ?
Will they want to take over our beloved planet , or just rent ?
All we can do is wait , watch and make absolutely sure that should one of their gleaming spaceships appear before us , to take a nice , sharp photo of it with our phone before passing out .

What the Terrorists Want
On August 16 , two men were escorted off a plane headed for Manchester , England , because some passengers thought they looked either Asian or Middle Eastern , might have been talking Arabic , wore leather jackets , and looked at their watches — and the passengers refused to fly with them on board .
The men were questioned for several hours and then released .
On August 15 , an entire airport terminal was evacuated because someone ’s cosmetics triggered a false positive for explosives .
The same day , a Muslim man was removed from an airplane in Denver for reciting prayers .
The Transportation Security Administration decided that the flight crew overreacted , but he still had to spend the night in Denver before flying home the next day .
The next day , a Port of Seattle terminal was evacuated because a couple of dogs gave a false alarm for explosives .
On August 19 , a plane made an emergency landing in Tampa , Florida , after the crew became suspicious because two of the lavatory doors were locked .
The plane was searched , but nothing was found .
Meanwhile , a man who tampered with a bathroom smoke detector on a flight to San Antonio was cleared of terrorism , but only after having his house searched .
On August 16 , a woman suffered a panic attack and became violent on a flight from London to Washington , so the plane was escorted to the Boston airport by fighter jets .
“ The woman was carrying hand cream and matches but was not a terrorist threat , ” said the TSA spokesman after the incident .
And on August 18 , a plane flying from London to Egypt made an emergency landing in Italy when someone found a bomb threat scrawled on an air sickness bag .
Nothing was found on the plane , and no one knows how long the note was on board .
I ’d like everyone to take a deep breath and listen for a minute .
The point of terrorism is to cause terror , sometimes to further a political goal and sometimes out of sheer hatred .
The people terrorists kill are not the targets ; they are collateral damage .
And blowing up planes , trains , markets , or buses is not the goal ; those are just tactics .
The real targets of terrorism are the rest of us : the billions of us who are not killed but are terrorized because of the killing .
The real point of terrorism is not the act itself , but our reaction to the act .
And we ’re doing exactly what the terrorists want .
We ’re all a little jumpy after the recent arrest of 23 terror suspects in Great Britain .
The men were reportedly plotting a liquid - explosive attack on airplanes , and both the press and politicians have been trumpeting the story ever since .
In truth , it ’s doubtful that their plan would have succeeded ; chemists have been debunking the idea since it became public .
Certainly the suspects were a long way off from trying :
None had bought airline tickets , and some did n’t even have passports .
Regardless of the threat , from the would - be bombers ’ perspective , the explosives and planes were merely tactics .
Their goal was to cause terror , and in that they ’ve succeeded .
Imagine for a moment what would have happened if they had blown up ten planes .
There would be canceled flights , chaos at airports , bans on carry - on luggage , world leaders talking tough new security measures , political posturing and all sorts of false alarms as jittery people panicked .
To a lesser degree , that ’s basically what ’s happening right now .
Our politicians help the terrorists every time they use fear as a campaign tactic .
The press helps every time it writes scare stories about the plot and the threat .
And if we ’re terrified , and we share that fear , we help .
All of these actions intensify and repeat the terrorists ’ actions , and increase the effects of their terror .
( I am not saying that the politicians and press are terrorists , or that they share any of the blame for terrorist attacks .
I ’m not that stupid .
But the subject of terrorism is more complex than it appears , and understanding its various causes and effects are vital for understanding how to best deal with it . )
The implausible plots and false alarms actually hurt us in two ways .
Not only do they increase the level of fear , but they also waste time and resources that could be better spent fighting the real threats and increasing actual security .
I ’ll bet the terrorists are laughing at us .
Another thought experiment : Imagine for a moment that the British government arrested the 23 suspects without fanfare .
Imagine that the TSA and its European counterparts did n’t engage in pointless airline security measures like banning liquids .
And imagine that the press did n’t write about it endlessly , and that the politicians did n’t use the event to remind us all how scared we should be .
If we ’d reacted that way , then the terrorists would have truly failed .
It ’s time we calm down and fight terror with anti-terror .
This does not mean that we simply roll over and accept terrorism .
There are things our government can and should do to fight terrorism , most of them involving intelligence and investigation — and not focusing on specific plots .
But our job is to remain steadfast in the face of terror , to refuse to be terrorized .
Our job is to not panic every time two Muslims stand together checking their watches .
There are approximately 1 billion Muslims in the world , a large percentage of them not Arab , and about 320 million Arabs in the Middle East , the overwhelming majority of them not terrorists .
Our job is to think critically and rationally , and to ignore the cacophony of other interests trying to use terrorism to advance political careers or increase a television show ’s viewership .
The surest defense against terrorism is to refuse to be terrorized .
Our job is to recognize that terrorism is just one of the risks we face , and not a particularly common one at that .
And our job is to fight those politicians who use fear as an excuse to take away our liberties and promote security theater that wastes money and does n’t make us any safer .

This essay originally appeared in Wired :

Details on the British Terrorist Arrest
Details are emerging :
* There was some serious cash flow from someone , presumably someone abroad .
* There was no imminent threat .
* However , the threat was real .
And it seems pretty clear that it would have bypassed all existing airport security systems .
* The conspirators were radicalized by the war in Iraq , although it is impossible to say whether they would have been otherwise radicalized without it .
* They were caught through police work , not through any broad surveillance , and were under surveillance for more than a year .
What pisses me off most is the second item .
By arresting the conspirators early , the police squandered the chance to learn more about the network and arrest more of them — and to present a less flimsy case .
There have been many news reports detailing how the U.S. pressured the UK government to make the arrests sooner , possibly out of political motivations .
( And then Scotland Yard got annoyed at the U.S. leaking plot details to the press , hampering their case . )
I still think that all of the new airline security measures are an overreaction .
As I said on a radio interview a couple of weeks ago : “ We ban guns and knives , and the terrorists use box cutters .
We ban box cutters and corkscrews , and they hide explosives in their shoes .
We screen shoes , and the terrorists use liquids .
We ban liquids , and the terrorist will use something else .
It ’s not a fair game , because the terrorists get to see our security measures before they plan their attack . ”
And it ’s not a game we can win .
So let ’s stop playing , and play a game we actually can win .
The real lesson of the London arrests is that investigation and intelligence work .

My initial comments on the arrests :
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/…
More Than 10 Ways to Avoid the Next 9/11
On 10 September 2006 , the New York Times published a feature called “ Ten Ways to Avoid the Next 9/11 ” : “ The Op - Ed page asked 10 people with experience in security and counterterrorism to answer the following question :
What is one major reason the United States has not suffered a major attack since 2001 , and what is the one thing you would recommend the nation do in order to avoid attacks in the future ? ”
Actually , they asked more than 10 , myself included .
But some of us were cut because they did n’t have enough space .
This was my essay :
Despite what you see in the movies and on television , it ’s actually very difficult to execute a major terrorist act .
It ’s hard to organize , plan , and execute an attack , and it ’s all too easy to slip up and get caught .
Combine that with our intelligence work tracking terrorist cells and interdicting terrorist funding , and you have a climate where major attacks are rare .
In many ways , the success of 9/11 was an anomaly ; there were many points where it could have failed .
The main reason we have n’t seen another 9/11 is that it is n’t as easy as it looks .
Much of our counterterrorist efforts are nothing more than security theater : ineffectual measures that look good .
Forget the war on terror ; the difficulty is n’t killing or arresting the terrorists , it ’s finding them .
Terrorism is a law enforcement problem , and needs to be treated as such .
For example , none of our post - 9/11 airline security measures would have stopped the London shampoo bombers .
The lesson of London is that our best defense is intelligence and investigation .
Rather than spending money on airline security , or sports stadium security — measures that require us to guess the plot correctly in order to be effective — we ’re better off spending money on measures that are effective regardless of the plot .
Intelligence and investigation have kept us safe from terrorism in the past , and will continue to do so in the future .
If the CIA and FBI had done a better job of coordinating and sharing data in 2001 , 9/11 would have been another failed attempt .
Coordination has gotten better , and those agencies are better funded — but it ’s still not enough .
Whenever you read about the billions being spent on national ID cards or massive data mining programs or new airport security measures , think about the number of intelligence agents that the same money could buy .
That ’s where we ’re going to see the greatest return on our security investment .

Educating Users
I ’ve met users , and they ’re not fluent in security .
They might be fluent in spreadsheets , eBay , or sending jokes over e-mail , but they ’re not technologists , let alone security people .
Of course they ’re making all sorts of security mistakes .
I too have tried educating users , and I agree that it ’s largely futile .
Part of the problem is generational .
We ’ve seen this with all sorts of technologies : electricity , telephones , microwave ovens , VCRs , video games .
Older generations approach newfangled technologies with trepidation , distrust , and confusion , while the children who grew up with them understand them intuitively .
But while the don’t - get - it generation will die off eventually , we wo n’t suddenly enter an era of unprecedented computer security .
Technology moves too fast these days ; there ’s no time for any generation to become fluent in anything .
Earlier this year , researchers ran an experiment in London ’s financial district .
Someone stood on a street corner and handed out CDs , saying they were a “ special Valentine ’s Day promotion . ”
Many people , some working at sensitive bank workstations , ran the program on the CDs on their work computers .
The program was benign — all it did was alert some computer on the Internet that it was running — but it could just have easily been malicious .
The researchers concluded that users do n’t care about security .
That ’s simply not true .
Users care about security — they just do n’t understand it .
I do n’t see a failure of education ; I see a failure of technology .
It should n’t have been possible for those users to run that CD , or for a random program stuffed into a banking computer to “ phone home ” across the Internet .
The real problem is that computers do n’t work well .
The industry has convinced everyone that people need a computer to survive , and at the same time it ’s made computers so complicated that only an expert can maintain them .
If I try to repair my home heating system , I ’m likely to break all sorts of safety rules .
I have no experience in that sort of thing , and honestly , there ’s no point in trying to educate me .
But the heating system works fine without my having to learn anything about it .
I know how to set my thermostat and to call a professional if anything goes wrong .
Punishment is n’t something you do instead of education ; it ’s a form of education — a very primal form of education best suited to children and animals ( and experts are n’t so sure about children ) .
I say we stop punishing people for failures of technology , and demand that computer companies market secure hardware and software .
This originally appeared in the April 2006 issue of “ Information Security Magazine , ” as the second part of a point / counterpoint with Marcus Ranum .
You can read Marcus ’s essay here :

Human / Bear Security Trade - Off
I like this example from SlashDot : “ Back in the 1980s , Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem with bears :
They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage bins .
This put both bears and people at risk .
So the Park Service started installing armored garbage cans that were tricky to open — you had to swing a latch , align two bits of handle , that sort of thing .
But it turns out it ’s actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans just right .
Make it * too* complex and people ca n’t get them open to put away their garbage in the first place .
Said one park ranger , ‘ There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists . ' ”
It ’s a tough balance to strike .
People are smart , but they ’re impatient and unwilling to spend a lot of time solving the problem .
Bears are dumb , but they ’re tenacious and are willing to spend hours solving the problem .
Given those two constraints , creating a trash can that can both work for people and not work for bears is not easy .

Land Title Fraud
There seems to be a small epidemic of land title fraud in Ontario , Canada .
What happens is someone impersonates the homeowner , and then sells the house out from under him .
The former owner is still liable for the mortgage , but ca n’t get in his former house .
Cleaning up the problem takes a lot of time and energy .
The problem is one of economic incentives .
If banks were held liable for fraudulent mortgages , then the problem would go away really quickly .
But as long as they ’re not , they have no incentive to ensure that this fraud does n’t occur .
( They have some incentive , because the fraud costs them money , but as long as the few fraud cases cost less than ensuring the validity of * every * mortgage , they ’ll just ignore the problem and eat the losses when fraud occurs . )

“ The fugitive former CEO may have been convinced that using Skype made him safe from tracking , but he — and everyone else that believes VoIP is inherently more secure than a landline — was wrong .
Tracking anonymous peer - to - peer VoIP traffic over the Internet is possible .
In fact , it can be done even if the parties have taken some steps to disguise the traffic . ”

Seems like Sudanese customs officials are seizing laptops from people entering the country and checking the data on their hard drives .
While the stated reason is pornography , anyone bringing a computer into the country should be concerned about personal information , writing that might be deemed political by the Sudanese authorities , confidential business information , and so on .

This should be a concern regardless of the border you cross .
Your privacy rights when trying to enter a country are minimal , and this kind of thing could happen anywhere .
( I have heard anecdotal stories about Israel doing this , but do n’t have confirmation . )
If you ’re bringing a laptop across an international border , you should clean off all unnecessary files and encrypt the rest .

Ed Felten and his team at Princeton have analyzed a Diebold AccuVote - TS machine , and they have discovered all sorts of vulnerabilities .
They ’re able to introduce a virus that flips votes , and automatically spreads from machine to machine .
Amazing stuff .
Diebold , of course , is pretending that there ’s no problem .

Is There Strategic Software ?
If you define “ critical infrastructure ” as “ things essential for the functioning of a society and economy , ” then software is critical infrastructure .
For many companies and individuals , if their computers stop working , they stop working .
It ’s a situation that snuck up on us .
Everyone knew that the software that flies 747s or targets cruise missiles was critical , but who thought of the airlines ’ weight and balance computers , or the operating system running the databases and spreadsheets that determine which cruise missiles get shipped where ?
And over the years , common , off - the - shelf , personal - and business - grade software has been used for more and more critical applications .
Today we find ourselves in a situation where a well - positioned flaw in Windows , Cisco routers or Apache could seriously affect the economy .
It ’s perfectly rational to assume that some programmers — a tiny minority I ’m sure — are deliberately adding vulnerabilities and back doors into the code they write .
I ’m actually kind of amazed that back doors secretly added by the CIA / NSA , MI5 , the Chinese , Mossad and others do n’t conflict with each other .
Even if these groups are n’t infiltrating software companies with back doors , you can be sure they ’re scouring products for vulnerabilities they can exploit , if necessary .
On the other hand , we ’re already living in a world where dozens of new flaws are discovered in common software products weekly , and the economy is humming along .
But we ’re not talking about this month ’s worm from Asia or new phishing software from the Russian mafia — we ’re talking national intelligence organizations .
“ Infowar ” is an overhyped term , but the next war will have a cyberspace component , and these organizations would n’t be doing their jobs if they were n’t preparing for it .
Marcus is 100 percent correct when he says it ’s simply too late to do anything about it .
The software industry is international , and no country can start demanding domestic - only software and expect to get anywhere .
Nor would that actually solve the problem , which is more about the allegiance of millions of individual programmers than which country they happen to inhabit .
So , what to do ?
The key here is to remember the real problem : current commercial software practices are not secure enough to reliably detect and delete deliberately inserted malicious code .
Once you understand this , you ’ll drop the red herring arguments that led to CheckPoint not being able to buy Sourcefire and concentrate on the real solution : defense in depth .
In theory , security software is an after - the - fact kludge because the underlying OS and apps are riddled with vulnerabilities .
If your software were written properly , you would n’t need a firewall — right ?
If we were to get serious about critical infrastructure , we ’d recognize it ’s all critical and start building security software to protect it .
We ’d build our security based on the principles of safe failure ; we ’d assume security would fail and make sure it ’s OK when it does .
We ’d use defense in depth and compartmentalization to minimize the effects of failure .
Basically , we ’d do everything we ’re supposed to do now to secure our networks .
It ’d be expensive , probably prohibitively so .
Maybe it would be easier to continue to ignore the problem , or at least manage geopolitics so that no national military wants to take us down .
This is the second half of a point / counterpoint I did with Marcus Ranum the September 2006 issue of “ Information Security Magazine . ”
Here ’s his half :
http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/…
Media Sanitization and Encryption
Last week NIST released Special Publication 800 - 88 , “ Guidelines for Media Sanitization . ”
There is a new paragraph in this document ( page 7 ) that was not in the draft version : “ Encryption is not a generally accepted means of sanitization .
The increasing power of computers decreases the time needed to crack cipher text and therefore the inability to recover the encrypted data can not be assured . ”
I have to admit that this does n’t make any sense to me .
If the encryption is done properly , and if the key is properly chosen , then erasing the key — and all copies — is equivalent to erasing the files .
And if you ’re using full - disk encryption , then erasing the key is equivalent to sanitizing the drive .
For that not to be true means that the encryption program is n’t secure .
I think NIST is just confused .

What is a Hacker ?
A hacker is someone who thinks outside the box .
It ’s someone who discards conventional wisdom , and does something else instead .
It ’s someone who looks at the edge and wonders what ’s beyond .
It ’s someone who sees a set of rules and wonders what happens if you do n’t follow them .
A hacker is someone who experiments with the limitations of systems for intellectual curiosity .
I wrote that last sentence in the year 2000 , in my book “ Beyond Fear . ”
And I ’m sticking to that definition .
This is what else I wrote in “ Beyond Fear ” :
“ Hackers are as old as curiosity , although the term itself is modern .
Galileo was a hacker .
Mme .
Curie was one , too .
Aristotle was n’t .
( Aristotle had some theoretical proof that women had fewer teeth than men .
A hacker would have simply counted his wife ’s teeth .
A good hacker would have counted his wife ’s teeth without her knowing about it , while she was asleep .
A good bad hacker might remove some of them , just to prove a point . )
“ When I was in college , I knew a group similar to hackers : the key freaks .
They wanted access , and their goal was to have a key to every lock on campus .
They would study lockpicking and learn new techniques , trade maps of the steam tunnels and where they led , and exchange copies of keys with each other .
A locked door was a challenge , a personal affront to their ability .
These people were n’t out to do damage — stealing stuff was n’t their objective — although they certainly could have .
Their hobby was the power to go anywhere they wanted to .
“ Remember the phone phreaks of yesteryear , the ones who could whistle into payphones and make free phone calls .
Sure , they stole phone service .
But it was n’t like they needed to make eight - hour calls to Manila or McMurdo .
And their real work was secret knowledge :
The phone network was a vast maze of information .
They wanted to know the system better than the designers , and they wanted the ability to modify it to their will .
Understanding how the phone system worked — that was the true prize .
Other early hackers were ham - radio hobbyists and model - train enthusiasts .
“ Richard Feynman was a hacker ; read any of his books .
“ Computer hackers follow these evolutionary lines .
Or , they are the same genus operating on a new system .
Computers , and networks in particular , are the new landscape to be explored .
Networks provide the ultimate maze of steam tunnels , where a new hacking technique becomes a key that can open computer after computer .
And inside is knowledge , understanding .
Access .
How things work .
Why things work .
It ’s all out there , waiting to be discovered . ”
Computers are the perfect playground for hackers .
Computers , and computer networks , are vast treasure troves of secret knowledge .
The Internet is an immense landscape of undiscovered information .
The more you know , the more you can do .
And it should be no surprise that many hackers have focused their skills on computer security .
Not only is it often the obstacle between the hacker and knowledge , and therefore something to be defeated , but also the very mindset necessary to be good at security is exactly the same mindset that hackers have : thinking outside the box , breaking the rules , exploring the limitations of a system .
The easiest way to break a security system is to figure out what the system ’s designers had n’t thought of : that ’s security hacking .
Hackers cheat .
And breaking security regularly involves cheating .
It ’s figuring out a smart card ’s RSA key by looking at the power fluctuations , because the designers of the card never realized anyone could do that .
It ’s self - signing a piece of code , because the signature - verification system did n’t think someone might try that .
It ’s using a piece of a protocol to break a completely different protocol , because all previous security analysis only looked at protocols individually and not in pairs .
That ’s security hacking : breaking a system by thinking differently .
It all sounds criminal : recovering encrypted text , fooling signature algorithms , breaking protocols .
But honestly , that ’s just the way we security people talk .
Hacking is n’t criminal .
All the examples two paragraphs above were performed by respected security professionals , and all were presented at security conferences .
I remember one conversation I had at a Crypto conference , early in my career .
It was outside amongst the jumbo shrimp , chocolate - covered strawberries , and other delectables .
A bunch of us were talking about some cryptographic system , including Brian Snow of the NSA .
Someone described an unconventional attack , one that did n’t follow the normal rules of cryptanalysis .
I do n’t remember any of the details , but I remember my response after hearing the description of the attack .
“ That ’s cheating , ” I said .
Because it was .
I also remember Brian turning to look at me .
He did n’t say anything , but his look conveyed everything .
“ There ’s no such thing as cheating in this business . ”
Because there is n’t .
Hacking is cheating , and it ’s how we get better at security .
It ’s only after someone invents a new attack that the rest of us can figure out how to defend against it .
For years I have refused to play the semantic “ hacker ” vs. “ cracker ” game .
There are good hackers and bad hackers , just as there are good electricians and bad electricians .
“ Hacker ” is a mindset and a skill set ; what you do with it is a different issue .
And I believe the best computer security experts have the hacker mindset .
When I look to hire people , I look for someone who ca n’t walk into a store without figuring out how to shoplift .
I look for someone who ca n’t test a computer security program without trying to get around it .
I look for someone who , when told that things work in a particular way , immediately asks how things stop working if you do something else .
We need these people in security , and we need them on our side .
Criminals are always trying to figure out how to break security systems .
Field a new system — an ATM , an online banking system , a gambling machine — and criminals will try to make an illegal profit off it .
They ’ll figure it out eventually , because some hackers are also criminals .
But if we have hackers working for us , they ’ll figure it out first — and then we can defend ourselves .
It ’s our only hope for security in this fast - moving technological world of ours .

Bruce Schneier Facts :
http://geekz.co.uk/schneierfacts/
Some of these are pretty funny .
And no , I had nothing to do with it .
TrackMeNot
In the wake of AOL ’s publication of search data , and the “ New York Times ” article demonstrating how easy it is to figure out who did the searching , we have TrackMeNot :
“ TrackMeNot runs in Firefox as a low - priority background process that periodically issues randomized search - queries to popular search engines , e.g. , AOL , Yahoo ! , Google , and MSN .
It hides users ’ actual search trails in a cloud of indistinguishable ‘ ghost ’ queries , making it difficult , if not impossible , to aggregate such data into accurate or identifying user profiles .
TrackMeNot integrates into the Firefox ‘ Tools ’ menu and includes a variety of user - configurable options . ”
Let ’s count the ways this does n’t work .
One , it does n’t hide your searches .
If the government wants to know who ’s been searching on “ al Qaeda recruitment centers , ” it wo n’t matter that you ’ve made ten thousand other searches as well — you ’ll be targeted .
Two , it ’s too easy to spot .
There are only 1,673 search terms in the program ’s dictionary .
Here , as a random example , are the program ’s “ G ” words : gag , gagged , gagging , gags , gas , gaseous , gases , gassed , gasses , gassing , gen , generate , generated , generates , generating , gens , gig , gigs , gillion , gillions , glass , glasses , glitch , glitched , glitches , glitching , glob , globed , globing , globs , glue , glues , gnarlier , gnarliest , gnarly , gobble , gobbled , gobbles , gobbling , golden , goldener , goldenest , gonk , gonked , gonking , gonks , gonzo , gopher , gophers , gorp , gorps , gotcha , gotchas , gribble , gribbles , grind , grinding , grinds , grok , grokked , grokking , groks , ground , grovel , groveled , groveling , grovelled , grovelling , grovels , grue , grues , grunge , grunges , gun , gunned , gunning , guns , guru , gurus
The program ’s authors claim that this list is temporary , and that there will eventually be a TrackMeNot server with an ever - changing word list .
Of course , that list can be monitored by any analysis program — as could any queries to that server .
In any case , every twelve seconds — exactly — the program picks a random pair of words and sends it to either AOL , Yahoo , MSN , or Google .
My guess is that your searches contain more than two words , you do n’t send them out in precise twelve - second intervals , and you favor one search engine over the others .
Three , some of the program ’s searches are worse than yours .
The dictionary includes : HIV , atomic , bomb , bible , bibles , bombing , bombs , boxes , choke , choked , chokes , choking , chain , crackers , empire , evil , erotics , erotices , fingers , knobs , kicking , harier , hamster , hairs , legal , letterbomb , letterbombs , mailbomb , mailbombing , mailbombs , rapes , raping , rape , raper , rapist , virgin , warez , warezes , whack , whacked , whacker , whacking , whackers , whacks , pistols
Does anyone really think that searches on “ erotic rape , ” “ mailbombing bibles , ” and “ choking virgins ” will make their legitimate searches less noteworthy ?
And four , it wastes a whole lot of bandwidth .
A query every twelve seconds translates into 2,400 queries a day , assuming an eight - hour workday .
A typical Google response is about 25 K , so we ’re talking 60 megabytes of additional traffic daily .
Imagine if everyone in the company used it .
I suppose this kind of thing would stop someone who has a paper printout of your searches and is looking through them manually , but it ’s not going to hamper computer analysis very much .
Or anyone who is n’t lazy .
But it would n’t be hard for a computer profiling program to ignore these searches .
As one commentator put it : “ Imagine a cop pulls you over for speeding .
As he approaches , you realize you left your wallet at home .
Without your driver ’s license , you could be in a lot of trouble .
When he approaches , you roll down your window and shout .
“ Hello Officer !
I do n’t have insurance on this vehicle !
This car is stolen !
I have weed in my glovebox !
I do n’t have my driver ’s license !
I just hit an old lady minutes ago !
I ’ve been running stop lights all morning !
I have a dead body in my trunk !
This car does n’t pass the emissions tests !
I ’m not allowed to drive because I am under house arrest !
My gas tank runs on the blood of children ! ”
You stop to catch a breath , confident you have supplied so much information to the cop that you ca n’t possibly be caught for not having your license now . ”
Yes , data mining is a signal - to - noise problem .
But artificial noise like this is n’t going to help much .
If I were going to improve on this idea , I would make the plugin watch the user ’s search patterns .
I would make it send queries only to the search engines the user does , only when he is actually online doing things .
I would randomize the timing .
( There ’s a comment to that effect in the code , so presumably this will be fixed in a later version of the program . )
And I would make it monitor the web pages the user looks at , and send queries based on keywords it finds on those pages .
And I would make it send queries in the form the user tends to use , whether it be single words , pairs of words , or whatever .
But honestly , I do n’t know that I would use it even then .
The way serious people protect their web - searching privacy is through anonymization .
Use Tor for serious web anonymization .
Or Black Box Search for simple anonymous searching ( there ’s a Greasemonkey extension that does that automatically ) .
And set your browser to delete search engine cookies regularly .

USBDumper
USBDumper is a cute little utility that silently copies the contents of an inserted USB drive onto the PC .
The idea is that you install this piece of software on your computer , or on a public PC , and then you collect the files — some of them personal and confidential — from anyone who plugs his USB drive into that computer .
( There ’s a similar program that downloads a disk image , allowing someone to recover deleted files as well . )
No big deal to anyone who worries about computer security for a living , but probably a rude shock to salespeople , conference presenters , file sharers , and many others who regularly plug their USB drives into strange PCs .

Microsoft and FairUse4WM
If you really want to see Microsoft scramble to patch a hole in its software , do n’t look to vulnerabilities that impact countless Internet Explorer users or give intruders control of thousands of Windows machines .
Just crack Redmond ’s DRM .
Security patches used to be rare .
Software vendors were happy to pretend that vulnerabilities in their products were illusory — and then quietly fix the problem in the next software release .
That changed with the full disclosure movement .
Independent security researchers started going public with the holes they found , making vulnerabilities impossible for vendors to ignore .
Then worms became more common ; patching — and patching quickly — became the norm .
But even now , no software vendor likes to issue patches .
Every patch is a public admission that the company made a mistake .
Moreover , the process diverts engineering resources from new development .
Patches annoy users by making them update their software , and piss them off even more if the update does n’t work properly .
For the vendor , there ’s an economic balancing act : how much more will your users be annoyed by unpatched software than they will be by the patch , and is that reduction in annoyance worth the cost of patching ?
Since 2003 , Microsoft ’s strategy to balance these costs and benefits has been to batch patches : instead of issuing them one at a time , it ’s been issuing them all together on the second Tuesday of each month .
This decreases Microsoft ’s development costs and increases the reliability of its patches .
The user pays for this strategy by remaining open to known vulnerabilities for up to a month .
On the other hand , users benefit from a predictable schedule : Microsoft can test all the patches that are going out at the same time , which means that patches are more reliable and users are able to install them faster with more confidence .
In the absence of regulation , software liability , or some other mechanism to make unpatched software costly for the vendor , Patch Tuesday is the best users are likely to get .
Why ?
Because it makes near - term financial sense to Microsoft .
The company is not a public charity , and if the Internet suffers , or if computers are compromised * en masse* , the economic impact on Microsoft is still minimal .
Microsoft is in the business of making money , and keeping users secure by patching its software is only incidental to that goal .
There ’s no better example of this of this principle in action than Microsoft ’s behavior around the vulnerability in its digital rights management software PlaysForSure .
In August , a hacker developed an application called FairUse4WM that strips the copy protection from Windows Media DRM 10 and 11 files .
Now , this is n’t a “ vulnerability ” in the normal sense of the word : digital rights management is not a feature that users want .
Being able to remove copy protection is a good thing for some users , and completely irrelevant for everyone else .
No user is ever going to say : “ Oh no .
I can now play the music I bought for my computer in my car .
I must install a patch so I ca n’t do that anymore . ”
But to Microsoft , this vulnerability is a big deal .
It affects the company ’s relationship with major record labels .
It affects the company ’s product offerings .
It affects the company ’s bottom line .
Fixing this “ vulnerability ” is in the company ’s best interest ; never mind the customer .
So Microsoft wasted no time ; it issued a patch three days after learning about the hack .
There ’s no month - long wait for copyright holders who rely on Microsoft ’s DRM .
This clearly demonstrates that economics is a much more powerful motivator than security .
It should surprise no one that the system did n’t stay patched for long .
FairUse4WM
1.2 gets around Microsoft ’s patch , and also circumvents the copy protection in Windows Media DRM 9 and 11 bet a2 files .
And four days later , Microsoft issued another patch .
That ’s where things stand now .
Any guess on how long it will take the FairUse4WM people to update their software ?
And then how long before Microsoft to patch once again ?
Certainly much less time than it will take Microsoft and the recording industry to realize they ’re playing a losing game , and that trying to make digital files uncopyable is like trying to make water not wet .
If Microsoft abandoned this Sisyphean effort and put the same development effort into building a fast and reliable patching system , the entire Internet would benefit .
But simple economics says it probably never will .

Talk about a miracle diet – Katie Couric has become the Incredible Shrinking Anchorwoman .
Thanks to a computer “ slight ” of hand , the Tiffany network has made the new face of “ CBS Evening News ” instantly drop about 20 pounds .
In a picture widely distributed to the media last month , a normal - looking Couric wore a frumpy light gray suit and her trademark smile .
But thanks to Photoshop , the popular editing software , the same photo , printed in a CBS magazine , shows her looking much , much thinner – and her suit has become a few shades darker .
Couric , who was made aware of the picture ’s alteration yesterday , joked that she liked the original better .
“ There ’s more of me to love , ” she quipped .
The picture was taken in May when Couric , 49 , appeared at the CBS “ Upfront ” presentation at Carnegie Hall .
It was later widely distributed by CBS as an official photo of its new $ 15 million - a- year anchor- woman .
Then the computer generated version appeared in the latest quarterly edition of Watch !
It ’s produced and edited by the CBS press department and distributed to network employees , news - media outlets , affiliates , network gift shops and Paramount - owned theme parks .
Network officials say the magazine has a circulation of around 400,000 .
“ The picture was retouched without the knowledge of Ms. Couric or CBS News management , ” a CBS spokesman said .
As far as the magazine goes , an insider insisted the publication was just following normal industry practice when it shrunk Couric .
He claimed that just about all magazines tinker with photos – even though some top photographers and photo editors at news organizations have lost their jobs in recent times for doing just that .
Most media experts say that whenever a photo is altered in any way , the public should be alerted , although it ’s more of a problem if it occurs at newsmagazines rather than a magazine a company publishes about itself .
A top health expert joked that if Couric dropped the weight as rapidly as she appeared to , it would have cost her an arm or a leg – literally .
“ Besides Photoshop , the only other way to lose 20 pounds in a matter of seconds would be to hack off a limb , ” joked Samantha Heller , the senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Medical Center .
“ I mean , liposuction is pretty fast – but that takes longer since you have to prep for surgery and everything . ”
On a more serious note , she said , “ Of course the healthy way to do it would n’t be fast .
“ If you lose weight too quickly it scares your body – the body is not designed to lose weight quickly .
[ Instead ] , cut back on the junk , pretty standard stuff .
Katie could eat more vegetables , cut down on carbs and increase her exercise , ” said Heller .
“ I know she has a trainer because she talked about it [ when she was on ‘ Today ’ ] so she could have the trainer pump up her exercise a bit . ”
The fine folks at Ritual Roasters , a independent , geek - friendly coffee house in San Francisco ’s Mission District , were dressed up as zombie Starbucks employees today .

If you talk to employees at one of the US Governments nuclear facilities long enough , you ’re likely to hear a lot of interesting stories about the early days of dealing with nuclear materials .
One , apparently originating in Oak Ridge , TN , involves an underground tank and a tree .
Apparently during a regular check of the site some radioactive contamination was found in the ground near one of the storage tanks .
The area was promptly cleaned up , the soil carted away and replaced , but the people assigned to figure out how the ground became contaminated in the first place were stumped .
They found no leaks , no spills , nothing that could have caused the radioactive material to escape .
They checked over the spot for several months to see if the contamination recurred , which it did not , then finally shrugged and called it a mystery .
But a year later the contamination was back .
The second time was much like the first .
The clean - up went smoothly , the investigation did not .
It was not until the third time the same contamination recurred in the same place that the investigators found the culprit – an oak tree .
The tree had sunk its roots into the tank , and was pulling up contaminated material .
While one would expect the whole tree to become radioactive , that was n’t the case .
Instead the oak preferentially shunted the contaminants to its leaves .
Every fall a new crop of radioactive leaves would hit the ground to mystify the workers at Oak Ridge , and every winter while they were investigating , there would be no sign of anything amiss with the tree .
It ’s an amusing story , but the ability of that tree has become a major weapon in the efforts to clean up contaminated soil .
You see , trees are n’t the only plants that can pull contaminants from the ground .
There are a slew of others that can do it too , and they are becoming more and more valuable in places where the ground has become polluted or contaminated .
The process is called phytoextraction , and it ’s one of a number of ways ecologists are beginning to use plants in bioremediation – the treatment of environmental problems .
There are plants that can pull lead , uranium , arsenic , and any number of other contaminants out of the soil .
They can then be harvested , a new crop planted , and the process repeated until the soil is sufficiently recovered .
The process has already been used with great success .
At Chernobyl , genetically altered sunflowers have been used to clean up two ponds heavily contaminated with both cesium and strontium , while hemp plants are being used to clean up the soil .
Various companies and institutions are beginning to jump on the bandwagon .
Dr. Ilya Raskin of Rutger ’s University , one of the field ’s pioneers , has been working with members of the Brassica family ( mustards ) , which tests have shown effective at removing a number of heavy metals .
Dupont has found corn useful for lead , while Phytokinetics , a company in Ohio , is using trees to clean up deeper soil contamination .
All in all , the field of phytoextraction seems to be one of the most promising in the efforts to clean up the hundreds of thousands of sites worldwide ( 30,000 in the US alone , according to the EPA ) , that require hazardous waste treatment .
Even if only modestly successful , the use of plants as contaminant removers could reduce cleanup costs considerably .
Even more promising , phytoextraction is only one aspect of the whole field of phytoremediation , in which plants are being used not only to remove toxins , but sometimes to break them down ( phytotransformation ) , enhance microbial activity ( phytostimulation ) , or prevent leaching of contaminants in the first place ( phytostabalization ) .
Perhaps if they had known where it would lead , the site workers at Oak Ridge might have been less frustrated when they finally found their answer .
August 11 , 2006 at 12:09 Tags Programming
I firmly believe that a programmer must know several programming languages well in order to be top - notch .
And the less similar these languages are , the better .
The reason for this is that different languages often present different programming philosophies - different approaches for solution of problems .
Being acquainted with several techniques to solve a single problem makes it easier to solve the problem in an optimal way .
Additionally , my philosophy in programming is that no single language / methodology is good for everything .
Some languages are better than others to solve specific problems , and an experienced developer must know when to use " the best tool for the job " .
I am programming computers non -stop since late 1998 .
Below is a description of my current programming language " arsenal " .
Namely , the languages I am most familiar with .
C / C++
C was the language I began programming in , and is still the language I know the best .
The reason for this is C's simplicity .
It 's a small , easy language to learn and to master .
For the vast majority of applications , however , C is too simple .
C's focus is on performance , and hence it lacks modern abstraction mechanisms , which makes C programming much more wordly and tedious than contemporary " high level " languages like Perl and Ruby .
C++ is its older brother and a much more complex and sophisticated language .
C++ is a very difficult nut to crack , mostly because it combines complex abstraction mechanisms with terrific performance ( if C is the measurement criterion set at 1.0 , C++ has performance that 's rarely worse than 1.1 ) .
I know C++ quite well , but far from the total knowledge I have of C , for instance .
In fact , I know only a handful of people who really know C++ perfectly .
If you think you 're one of these people , try reading Alexandrescu's " Modern C++ " for a harsh return to reality .
These days I rarely use C / C++ for " desktop " coding .
I still use C heavily for programming embedded devices , where it really is the only real option .
But on PC's ( where code runs on top of full operating systems like MS Windows or Linux ) , C / C++ is simply inferior to other languages in terms of programmer productivity , which is a very important factor these days .
Whatever I can write in C++ in a day I can write in Perl in a couple of hours .
The only occasions I turn to C++ are when top performance or a low - level interface to the operating system or a third - party library are required .
But even in these cases , the C++ part is usually encapsulated as a small library with the main Perl code controlling it using one of the many interfaces available .
I had both linked C code to Perl for performance , and used a stand - alone C++ program connected to the main Perl script via a socket for accessing operating systems internals .
Perl
Perl is my main tool at the moment .
Criticisms of Perl are numerous , and many of them are true , but whatever they say , Perl is a productive language .
I know I can write good and useful code in Perl that accomplishes the tasks I have satisfactorily .
Perl enjoys an enormous collection of ready libraries for any purpose - the CPAN , a very mature base of documentation and literature , and the best programmer community ( by a mile ) one can find ( Perlmonks ) .
However , Perl is getting old and some of the most advanced programming idioms take some teeth screeching to implement .
OO in Perl 5 is a known fiasco ( no matter how many Class : :* modules they throw at you ) and functional paradigms lose some of their charm because of the clunky syntax .
While there is currently no language better than Perl to solve specific problems " at hand " , superior languages exist when it comes to writing big systems .
Ruby
Ruby is the best candidate to replace Perl as my " main tool " in the future .
I just discovered it this year , and so far I 'm charmed - and I try to write all my new " toy project " code in it .
Ruby is everything Perl is and more .
Language - wise , Ruby allows the same level of productivity and ease of programming as Perl , and adds a lot on top of it .
Much cleaner syntax , an excellent OO system and even better tools for writing functional code .
If there is a potential Perl - killer in the world , Ruby is it .
Even Perl 6 wo n't help here , because although it cleans
Perl up and fixes some of its gravest deficiencies , I can't fail noticing that it still looks inferior to Ruby 1.8 in many aspects , and Ruby 2.0 will be even better ( and will arrive earlier than Perl 6 ) .
The best thing about Perl 6 is , IMHO , Parrot - from which Ruby will also benefit .
Ruby is not without problems , however , which is mostly why I still use Perl for most of my serious coding .
The documentation is far worse , the community is much smaller and much less powerful , the libraries are incomplete and immature ( and many have only Japanese docs and home - pages ) .
The threads implementation is very weak and the GUI bindings are nowhere as polished out ( Perl TK maybe is n't the prettiest and the simplest library in the world , but you can create complex and useful GUIs with it , right out - of - the - box ) .
Ruby is also slow .
Though compared with C++ ,
Perl is n't exactly the king of speed ( it is on average an order of magnitude slower ) , Ruby is much slower than even Perl ( x5 or so , according the the Shootout benchmarks and other sources ) .
This is n't a very big problem , because critical sections can still be written in C++ ( for which Ruby has good bindings ) , but still I wish it could be faster , at least as fast as Perl , say .
Lisp
Lastly , I must mention Lisp , which is probably the most controversial language out there ( it seems that people either love or hate it , without much in the middle ) .
Although I do n't use Lisp for any real coding and unlikely to do so in the future , Lisp has taught me a lot .
I feel that learning Lisp made me a much better programmer , and for that I will be forever grateful .
As Eric Raymond famously noted :
LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it .
That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days , even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot .
What Lisp " teaches " is the functional programming style , which is IMHO the cleanest and the most elegant way to program .
Conclusion
Do n't stick to just one programming language , even if you like it a lot .
Besides looking bad on a resume , knowing only one language will lock you in a very narrow point of view on the world of programming .
Learning and knowing well at least 2 - 3 different languages is essential to become a much better developer .
The scene is all too familiar to the modern moviegoer :
The theater is pin-drop quiet as Ben and Jen are about to declare undying love for each other .
Suddenly , the latest ring tone from Coldplay or 50 Cent blares from a teenager 's purse , filling the darkened movie house .
Not only is the moment lost , but so is the next , and the one after that , as patrons shush the naughty teen while she giggles her way through a phone chat with a friend .
" I 'm at a movie ... a movie !
Right , where do you want to meet ?
Oh , it 's really good , I 'll tell you all about it .
Later ! "
This could all change .
This past week the National Association of Theater Owners ( NATO ) pondered blocking cellphone signals as a way to improve the cinema experience .
The idea was a hot topic in the nation 's gambling capital this past week when theater owners from coast to coast met to preview the summer lineups from movie studios and trade tips on combating falling movie theater attendance .
The 6,000 - strong membership of NATO voted to authorize its board to look into changing federal laws that currently prevent them from using cellphone - jamming equipment in theaters .
" We have an issue with rude patron behavior , " says John Fithian , president of NATO .
" Cellphones going off in theaters is the most pronounced problem , " he says , adding that a recent NATO survey of theatergoers showed that nearly 80 percent favored some form of cellphone jamming .
" The overwhelming majority of our own members support the idea as well . "
For the moment , cellphone - jamming equipment is illegal in the US , even for agencies such as local police or fire departments .
However , other countries are beginning to crack down on rude cellphone users .
France recently changed its laws to allow movie theaters to use the jamming technology .
A number of Catholic churches in Mexico use Israeli military jamming gear to stop parishioners from interrupting services with their wireless chatting ( presumably with mere mortals ) .
Not surprisingly , the cellular industry 's national trade group , CTIA - The Wireless Association , is against the idea .
" We 're vehemently opposed for the simple reason that it 's no one 's right or prerogative to deny emergency communications to go through , " says John Walls , CTIA vice president of public affairs .
" That 's why jamming is illegal .
These are the public airwaves - they are for everyone , and everyone has a right to use them . "
Companies that manufacture jamming equipment are also opposed , on similar grounds .
" Jamming equipment should only be used by the government , such as the police and the bomb squads , not the general public , " says Howard Melamed of CellAntenna , one such company .
" Jamming is a weapon that should only be used against illegal activities . "
Mr. Melamed and others point out that there are less severe measures theater owners could take , such as paint that blocks signals and a new technology his own company will be offering by summertime , which he dubs " cell calming " technology .
It allows emergency calls to go through while stopping general - purpose calls without jamming the full spectrum of cell calls .
( Melamed is tight - lipped about the technology , saying only that it has a " patent pending . " )
However , others such as Bay Area moviegoer Peter Brown says the issue is one of basic manners .
Mr. Brown , a marketing consultant , says he and " a good friend " have found that a lightweight water pistol will work wonders with chatty cellphone users .
Though he does not recommend this technique to others , he notes with some satisfaction that they 've never been caught .
If the guilty party looks back to see who has nipped his neck with water , " we simply practice the quick whip - around and affronted look that insinuates that you , too , have been hit . "
Mr Bush warned of the terrorists ' ever - changing tactics
Linking their actions with insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan , he said they all wanted to " establish safe havens from which to attack free nations " .
Mr Bush said the UK terror plot was a " reminder that terrorists are still plotting attacks to kill our people " .
He made the comments in his weekly radio address to the American people .
' Worst attacks yet '
" The terrorists attempt to bring down airplanes full of innocent men , women , and children , " Mr Bush said .
" They kill civilians and American servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan , and they deliberately hide behind civilians in Lebanon .
They are seeking to spread their totalitarian ideology . "
Mr Bush said that the alleged terror plot , which UK intelligence services claim involved a plan to destroy US - bound passenger planes using liquid explosives smuggled in drinks bottles , was " further evidence that the terrorists we face are sophisticated , and constantly changing their tactics " .
US officials say that if the plan had not been foiled , the subsequent attacks would have been the worst since those on Washington and New York on 11 September 2001 .
Since the 2001 attacks , Mr Bush has said that the US is engaged in a global war on terror .
He says that as well as intelligence efforts to foil terror plots against US civilians , the ongoing military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq are part of that same battle , as is Israel 's conflict with Lebanon .
Bernie Ebbers leaves the Manhattan court after sentencing
Mr Ebbers was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in March , following revelations of an $ 11bn ( £ 6.2 bn ) accounting fraud at Worldcom in 2002 .
The 63 - year - old was also guilty of seven counts of filing false documents .
Mr Ebbers will begin serving his sentence at a federal prison in Yazoo City , Mississippi , close to his home .
The sentence was handed down by federal judge Barbara Jones , who earlier this week rejected his request for a new trial .
The sentence was the toughest yet in a string of corporate scandals in the US .
Mr Ebbers did not address the court .
Instead , he wiped his eyes with a white tissue .
Meanwhile , Kristie Ebbers , his wife , cried quietly .
The jail term effectively satisfies pleas from prosecutors for a life sentence to be imposed on Mr Ebbers .
' Leader ' in crime
Defence lawyer Reid Weingarten had called for a more lenient sentence , given Mr Ebbers ' heart condition and his involvement in charitable works .
However , Judge Barbara Jones said she did not believe his heart condition was sufficiently serious to warrant a reduced sentence .
A sentence of anything less would not reflect the seriousness of the crime
Barbara Jones , Federal Judge
She also rejected his lawyers ' contention that the government overstated the losses that investors suffered in the fraud .
And she rejected their contention that Mr Ebbers was not a mastermind of the accounting wrongdoing .
Mr Ebbers " was clearly a leader of criminal activity in this case , " the judge said .
" A sentence of anything less would not reflect the seriousness of the crime . "
Biggest bankruptcy
Worldcom 's collapse was the biggest bankruptcy in US corporate history .
Some 20,000 workers lost their jobs , while shareholders lost about $ 180bn , when the company filed for bankruptcy protection .
Kristie and Bernie Ebbers leaving the court on Wednesday
A former Worldcom salesman , Henry J Bruin Jr , told the hearing in Manhattan that the company 's collapse had caused him " untold human carnage " and that he had suffered " sheer hell " .
Mr Ebbers is the first of six former Worldcom executives and accountants facing sentencing this summer .
The remaining five have already pleaded guilty and agreed to co-operate in the case against their former boss .
On Monday , a judge backed a multi-million dollar settlement under which Mr Ebbers must surrender most of his personal assets , including $ 5 m in cash , to resolve a shareholder lawsuit .
The settlement leaves Mr Ebbers ' wife with about $ 50,000 of her husband 's fortune , and a modest home in Jackson , Mississippi .
Rise and fall
Born in Edmonton , Canada on 27 August , 1941 , Bernard Ebbers worked as a basketball coach , teacher and warehouse manager before running a chain of motels from which he launched his stellar telecoms career .
I believe God has a plan for people 's lives , and I believe he had a plan for me
Bernie Ebbers
Profile : Bernie Ebbers
He snapped up rivals and took advantage of the end of AT&T 's monopoly which enabled him to offer phone deals at bargain prices .
With his fortune rapidly growing , in 1995 he paid £ 1.2 bn for WilTel Network Services and changed its name to WorldCom .
By mid-1999 WorldCom shares reached an all - time high and Mr Ebbers became the darling of Wall Street .
" I believe God has a plan for people 's lives , and I believe he had a plan for me , " Mr Ebbers once said .
President Bill Clinton once called him " the symbol of 21st Century America " and said Mr Ebbers was " the embodiment of what I want for the future " .
But in 2001 , his attempts to buy larger rival Sprint were thwarted by regulators and worries about WorldCom 's mounting debt began to emerge .
Mr Ebbers quit the firm in 2002 after admitting borrowing money from WorldCom to cover losses he incurred in buying its shares .
In the same year WorldCom went bankrupt .
It emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 , renaming itself MCI .
We have covered this type of story before : a man finds an open wireless access point , parks in front of the home or business containing the WAP , surfs away on his laptop , and the police are called .
The story has played itself out once again , this time in Vancouver , WA , where 20 - year - old Alexander Eric Smith was arrested after a three - month stretch where he periodically parked in front of a coffee shop off - and - on with a laptop and used its WAP .
The kicker ?
He never bought so much as a small latte .
Brewed Awakenings manager Emily Pranger finally tired of his presence and called 911 .
Police came and told Smith to surf elsewhere .
After returning , he was taken into custody and charged with theft of services .
Note that unlike other cases , he was not charged with unauthorized use of a computer network .
Instead , the premise for his arrest is that he used Brewed Awakenings ' free WiFi network without buying anything from them .
Open WAPs are tempting in certain situations .
When camping , I 've driven into town in search of an open WAP to check e-mail or get my Lounge fix .
However , law enforcement types seem to be paying more attention to WiFi leeching these days .
An Illinois man was fined US $ 250 earlier this year after pleading guilty to remotely accessing another computer system without the owner 's approval .
That followed the conviction of a Florida man for felony unauthorized access to computer network in 2005 .
Fears over what people might be doing over wireless networks appear to be driving the concern over wardriving .
It turns out that Smith is a convicted sex offender .
It therefore follows that he was using the coffee shop 's WiFi to look a porn or something equally nefarious </ sarcasm > .
What I find fascinating is that when newspapers and TV stations report on occurrences such as this , they generally magnify the scope of the problem and put an alarmist spin on it .
On a random neighborhood street in Vancouver , a KATU News laptop detected 11 networks , five of which were unsecured , meaning anyone could log on to them for free .
A computer expert told KATU News there is no way to know if someone is using your wireless connection without permission .
Actually , there is .
In addition , it is so trivial to turn on security for a home ( or business ) WAP , that there is no reason anyone should leave a WiFi network unprotected unless he or she really wants it to be open to all comers .
Perhaps the sensationalized reporting that usually follows cases like this arises out of the fact that most people ( media included ) do n't really understand how computers in general and wireless networking in particular work .
Until people are better educated , those tempted by open access points are better off carefully considering whether or not to open up the laptop and start surfing .
Finally , he called and we spent about an hour and a half on the phone .
There was very little small talk - no chit chat , jokes , or laughter ( sorry Don ) .
We got right down to business .
I took a lot of notes , and I will try to reproduce the conversation .
He encouraged me to report on what we talked about , and even offered to assist me in reproducing the details .
He told me some things in confidence , and I think I have my notes flagged in each case so I do n't reveal something he does n't want revealed .
I will attempt to report this as objectively as I can , and I will send him the link so he can let me know if I got any of the details wrong .
In my recent essay Vinod Khosla Debunked , I challenged Mr. Khosla to a written debate on his recent ethanol claims .
Mr. Khosla e-mailed me shortly after that essay appeared , and offered to discuss the matter by phone .
I wanted to first make sure he understood my objections , so we exchanged several e-mails in which I spelled them out .
At my disposal , I had his presentation Biofuels : Think Outside the Barrel ( 10 meg PPT warning ) , a marked up version of his paper Is Ethanol Controversial ? , and a list of talking points I had prepared so I would n't forget to cover any major areas .
Here are the talking points I had prepared beforehand .
These were merely to help my thought process as we talked , and I did n't necessarily cover them in this order .
1. Motivation ?
Is your top priority making money ?
Or helping society ?
2 . Energy balance for ethanol not better than gasoline
Think of energy consumed versus energy returned
versus energy returned Petroleum input is not consumed
Corn inputs are not counted
Comparing refinery efficiency versus an energy ratio 3 .
If the solution fails , what is the cost ?
The white paper asked , but never answered this question
Wasted time and resources - Peak Oil looms
Public loss of credibility
Public disillusionment with alternative fuels
Lost opportunity - public was not encouraged to conserve
Status quo 10 years from now 4 .
Cost of ethanol versus gasoline
If ethanol is cheaper , why has rack price been higher for 25 years ?
If ethanol is cheaper , margins are better , and so it should be able to grow quickly without legislation
Why do you accuse oil companies of gouging when ethanol has better margins ?
5 . Environmental issues with ethanol
Topsoil depletion ; ramping up corn ethanol encourages this
Aquifer depletion
Corn growing pushed to marginal lands
Herbicide and pesticide runoff ; ramping up ethanol will make this worse
How is this different than pollution caused by gasoline ?
6 . Over-promising technology
Nitrogen fixation - Holy Grail of crop science , but very complex problem
Cellulosic economics , yields , etc .
Ca n't bank on these breakthroughs ; but should fund research 7 .
Subsidies
If ethanol is so cheap to make , it does n't need subsidies
Many so - called oil subsidies do n't benefit the oil companies at all ; they benefit consumers 8 .
Food versus fuel
This is already driving up grain prices
Grain stocks being drawn down to record low levels
Exports will be reduced to produce ethanol 9 .
Potentially better solutions
Carbon tax
Solar
Wind
Biodiesel ( esp. algal )
Butanol
Biomass to electricity
Storage system technologies allowing renewable electricity
Electric cars ( Tesla Roadster as example of feasibility ? )
Electric rail ( Alan 's proposal )
General move to electric transportation
Emphasize TOD thread
I did n't expect to be able to go through the entire list , as that would have taken quite a while .
But surprisingly , I did get through most of the list .
I mentioned TOD several times , and I called his attention to the Vinod Khosla - Give Him Your Ideas thread .
I told him he would find a lot of ideas for addressing our energy problems , from people who have put a lot of thought into this very issue .
I told him some of the ideas were very good .
He said that he does not have a large staff , but he would look through the thread ( I also e-mailed him the link ) .
He said he is looking for ideas that are pragmatic .
The Conversation
Mr. Khosla dominated the early part of the conversation .
He approached it in the style of his presentations , in which he argues that this is the right path to take , and that it is feasible .
In the early part of the conversation , he said he does not favor biodiesel .
We did n't get into the reasons , but my guess is that he does n't think it is scalable , nor an ideal solution for the cars Americans are accustomed to driving ( this was a consistent theme ) .
We did n't discuss algal biodiesel , but from his tenor I believe he would have said it is worth funding , but still more of a research project compared to the current status of cellulosic ethanol .
The first thing I asked him was about his motivation : Money , helping society , or some combination ?
He said his primary motivation is to help society .
He said he is very concerned about Global Warming , and thinks our dependence on foreign oil is great cause for concern .
I told him that we are approaching this problem from different perspectives : I am approaching this from a Peak Oil perspective and that the clock is ticking .
I do n't believe we can afford to spend time and resources pursuing pie - in - the - sky solutions .
I said that I wanted to address some specific claims from his presentations .
I started off on the energy balance of ethanol versus gasoline .
We went back and forth on efficiency versus EROI , but he finally preempted my entire argument by saying he does n't even care if the EROI is less than 1 , because corn ethanol is merely priming the pump for cellulosic ethanol or butanol ( which he favors ) .
In fact , he acknowledged some of my arguments against corn ethanol , but said that corn ethanol is just a transitory solution .
I told him that I disagreed with this ; that corn ethanol would be around as long as the subsidies were there .
He went on to say that the ethanol plants he is building ( I did n't clarify whether these were Pacific Ethanol 's plants ) would be similar to the E3 Biofuels closed - loop system .
He said the capital costs are 2.5 times as high ( because I specifically asked about that ) but that the operating costs would be much lower .
I told him that I agreed that this should be the model for building grain ethanol plants , but that we would have to see some in operation before we know if they live up to the claims .
I challenged the claim he made that Brazil displaced 40 % of their petroleum with ethanol .
He said he got that number from another presentation , and would be glad to change it if I can show him the data .
He said he wants to be sure he has his facts correct .
( I will be sending him the raw numbers on Brazil 's energy supply ) .
I challenged him on the oil company bashing .
I said that I work for an oil company , yet I care a great deal about the environment and sustainability .
I said that when he bashes oil companies , he is bashing a lot of good people with the same broad brush .
He said " On this , we will have to disagree . "
He went on to defend the bashing by saying it was political .
He said he is trying to get the California Clean Alternative Energy Initiative passed , and Big Oil is spending a lot of money to fight him on it .
So , he is bashing them in order to get support .
Of course , I already knew all of this .
I can live with a bashing , as long as it is factual .
I told him that it is ludicrous to suggest that Big Oil is gouging when the profit margins on ethanol are even higher .
He again said that it was just politics .
I just do n't agree that stirring up hatred toward a particular group is acceptable politics .
I brought up the " food versus fuel " issue , and he said he rejects that argument .
He said that someone from Shell had come out and retracted an argument they made on this topic .
I had n't heard anything about this , and could n't comment .
But I did indicate that as we continue to ramp up corn ethanol , our corn exports will fall and people in 3rd world countries will go hungry .
I told him the stories are already appearing in the media .
He said that there is plenty of food in the world , and the problem is often ability to pay .
I did n't gain any ground at all in this argument .
He said that he has come out against the ethanol subsidies currently in place , and would like to see those subsidies shifted to biomass subsidies .
I told him that would be a tough political sell , and he agreed .
He said he has spoken out on the tariff that is slapped on Brazilian ethanol .
He thinks eliminating this tariff would lower ethanol prices in the U.S.
He also said that he has heard that Brazil is considering taking this issue to the WTO .
I spoke of my concern that he is over - promising on cellulosic ethanol .
I told him that my fear is that by making these rosy projections , the public will be lulled into complacency , and we do n't have time for that .
After all , they think we are going to transition right into cellulosic ethanol after hearing his projections .
I told him that I do n't believe his projections are realistic .
He countered that they are realistic , and that he has seen a lot of research behind the scenes that is not yet publicly available .
He said he has several cellulosic projects under way , and that he is in the business of making judgment calls .
He also said there are about 50 projects ( maybe it was proposals ? ) on cellulosic ethanol that are underway .
Several times he compared his investments in cellulosic ethanol to his early investments in the Internet or other technologies that paid off despite the scoffers .
One of his consistent themes was that the solution has to be practical , and it had to fit today 's engines or the auto makers would n't buy in .
I told him that I considered this a problem ; that the internal combustion engine was very inefficient .
He agreed , but said a transition to electric would take time .
He said it starts with hybrids , and then you improve the battery technology until the hybrid becomes more and more electric .
He said he is investing in battery technology , and thinks this area has even more potential than ethanol .
On this , I certainly agree .
Then we came to a matter of great disagreement .
He said he believes cellulosic ethanol can displace petroleum because petroleum is expensive .
But he did n't give renewable electricity much chance of displacing coal , because coal is too cheap .
He said that solar is 3 times the cost of coal - generated electricity , and that we have " an infinite supply of coal . "
He said he is more interested in a liquid fuel replacement for petroleum .
I , on the other hand , am more interested in moving our means of transport to renewable electric sources .
We discussed a carbon tax , and we were in agreement that this should be implemented .
However , he feels like it will never be politically palatable .
I just can't understand this , and told him so .
I think this could be sold to the public .
You explain the reason for the tax :
That it is designed to reduce demand and prepare us for a future of declining petroleum supplies .
You can avoid it being a regressive tax by lowering tax rates or increasing the deductions for low - income taxpayers .
There is a way to work this .
He replied that it would break down when everyone tried to get the best deal for their own constituents .
I just think this is too important an idea not to aggressively pursue it .
A carbon tax would begin paying immediate dividends .
I told him that we should have done this long ago , and we should have encouraged adoption of diesels like they did in Europe .
He replied " What we should have done , or should do , is less important than what we can do . "
Areas of Agreement and Disagreement
We agreed on the following issues :
Current energy policy needs a dramatic facelift
A carbon tax is a good idea
Brazil is much more efficient at making ethanol than the U.S. , and the ethanol tariffs should be lifted
Butanol may be a superior choice to ethanol
Grain ethanol subsidies should be eliminated
There is great potential in researching energy storage devices ( e.g. batteries )
We disagreed on the following issues :
The issues surrounding corn ethanol are n't significant since it will be a transitory solution
The solution must fit in today 's engines
Bashing oil companies is acceptable to achieve a political goal
Renewable electricity can't compete with coal
Cellulosic is scalable within the next 5 years
The consequences of failure to deliver can be very high
Food versus fuel will be a serious issue going forward
Conclusions
I already had a pretty good understanding of where he was coming from , but I have tried to accurately relay his position so that others may understand .
This is the least I owe him after he spent that much time talking with me .
However , we still have some fundamental areas of disagreement , and my impression is that he is concerned about Peak Oil , but not in the way I am concerned .
My worry is that over - promising on cellulosic ethanol will prevent us from getting very serious about taking the steps we need to take as a society toward powering down while we still have some choices .
I think we need to fund cellulosic ethanol , but until there are a few pilot plants operating , we just do n't know if it will be feasible on a commercial scale .
I did have difficulty convincing him that corn ethanol is a bad thing , because his position is that it is merely a jumping off point to something much bigger .
He said he would n't be investing in cellulosic if we were n't producing several billion gallons of corn ethanol .
He said that corn ethanol is " priming the pump " , and has shown the feasibility of ethanol as fuel in the U.S .
I obviously have not captured the entire conversation , so if you have specific questions about a particular topic I will answer them .
It was a worthwhile conversation from my point of view , because I think he understands that there are legitimate concerns from people other than special interests .
We agreed to keep in touch as developments unfold .
Over 10 years ago , my wife and I decided to out TV from our lives .
We are not television snobs , far from teetotalers , and believe that many aspects of life can be enjoyed in moderation .
But television had become something of a negative for us , and we wondered what our lives would be like if we tried giving it up for a short period and then see what happened .
We did , choosing the period of Lent in 1995 , and that short period continues to this day .
I rank our disposing of the national pacifier among our most important joint decisions , right up there with deciding to get married or where to raise our children .
Our problems with television would be familiar for many .
Watching the tube was time consuming , taking us away from other activities .
We knew we ’d receive much more long - term benefit , in terms of living a fuller life , from reading books , being engaged with others socially , and bonding with our kids .
Also , we found it quite controlling .
We ’d catch ourselves being interested in television characters who in real life we would consider morons .
While there was often programming we found worthwhile — movies on American Movie Classics and the occasional Letterman monologue , for instance — such programming was rare .
But we ’d still watch .
I remembered an incident when I lived in an apartment complex in San Antonio .
Walking from the parking lot to our apartment involved passing over 20 identical living rooms , and one evening , after taking out the garbage during one of Clinton ’s televised addresses , I noticed that every one of these living rooms had the president ’s happy mug on a television screen .
Every one .
Having read Orwell in a high school English class — something that was common before the federalization of public education — I found this development appalling .
Was this Texas or Oceana ?
Also , our decision to out TV came from wanting to make a conscious choice not to live out lives watching other people live .
Life is vicarious enough .
Why add to it ?
So I called our cable company and asked to have our service disconnected .
The cable lady thought I was joking .
She then reacted as though we were on life support and asking to have the oxygen tube removed .
" Darlin ’ , " she said , " you ca n’t live life without TV . "
Nonetheless , we sold our 19 - inch television and put the proceeds toward a 13 - inch combination TV / VCR that we kept in a closet .
( This has since been replaced with a similar TV / DVD player combo . )
While we watch occasional movies and other offerings available on DVDs , we often watch television when staying in hotel rooms or relatives ’ houses , events that occur two or three times a year .
Nonetheless , over the last decade , we have been oblivious to several popular ( or notorious ) shows that have since come and gone .
I have never seen a reality show ( because these came about after we quit television ) , and only recently figured out what Bill O’Reilly looked like .
My son was 6 years old when he realized that television had uses that did n’t involve removable media .
This arrangement allows us to use television on our terms .
We use it .
It does n’t use us .
But that cable lady had a point .
She knew that we were consigning ourselves to a life of not getting the conversation at many dinner parties or of cutting away from a common bond that connects many people in society .
She was also right given the pervasiveness of television in the public square .
They are in bathrooms , restaurants , cars , sporting events , waiting rooms , airplanes , barber shops , and even Wal - Marts .
I do n’t know if they are in some churches , but I would n’t be surprised , given how many modern churches have taken on the appearance of television studios .
No one escapes television completely .
And she was right in terms of public discussion .
The small talk at most social gatherings center on what people are currently watching .
( Hint :
If you ever want some bore to leave you alone at a party , simply tell him you do n’t watch TV . )
My college students often support classroom arguments by referencing something they saw on CNN or the History Channel .
This is a particular area in which television ’s costs are great .
Becoming informed takes some work .
This traditionally involved reading books , newspapers , and magazines to develop opinions about what you believed ( or did n’t ) .
Unfortunately , some of the most uninformed people I meet each day receive their news solely from television , which reduces complex social problems into emotional , highly manipulative one - or two - minute segments .
And these people vote .
The Framers of the Constitution created a decentralized republic , and explicitly not a democracy , because they knew that the latter tended toward centralization and tyranny .
Even Jefferson believed that the small role actual voting would play in the new country would only be tolerable with an educated electorate .
Not only would he hate television , he ’d despair over a culture that promotes democracy and television as goods that must be universally available .
What does it mean for freedom when so many voters are only informed to the extent possible through CNN and Fox News ?
To take one example , consider some recent poll data .
Forty - seven per cent of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein helped plan 9/11 and 44 per cent believed that the hijackers were Iraqi ; 61 per cent thought that Saddam had been a serious threat to the U.S. , and 76 per cent said the Iraqis are now better off .
None of this is true , but it is understandable when so many in the electorate depend on television to be informed .
Do n’t think that the political class does not appreciate this development , because voters — whom the political class ostensibly serves — are much easier to manipulate when they develop opinions from what they see on TV .
No wonder the federal government plans to spend billions of dollars subsidizing the transfer from analog transmissions to digital ones .
Digital television has become the latest civil right , and a convenient one for holders of political power .
We chuckle when we hear friends rail against typical television fare , because we used to do that .
The same people often complain about there not being enough hours in the day to accomplish all that they want .
We chuckle at that too .
But when we suggest dropping the one or two hours each day spent in front of the tube , we ’re the ones to get chuckled at .
For many , going without television really is like going without oxygen .
My graceful wife gave up the tube easily .
Not me .
I remember doing things that my dad does when he gives up smoking .
( My dad quits smoking several times a year .
It ’s his hobby . )
I ’d become irritable and my mind would be on the corner of our house where that magnetic box used to be , sort of like how my dad thinks about the drawers where he stores his Terryton ’s .
Over time , however , that corner became smaller in my mind as the benefits that came from dropping television grew .
For me , the benefits are much greater than simply being more productive during the day , although that certainly is a plus .
On many weeknights , my 5 - year - old daughter and I play board games and go for walks .
After she goes to bed , my 9 - year - old son reads books while my wife and I sit down and engage in an activity called " talking . "
I think our family is closer than it would otherwise be , although I can never know for sure .
I am sure our kids are less aware of the material world than their television - watching peers — and they seem more innocent .
Surely this has something to do with the fact that they are not exposed , on a daily basis , to sex as a mere consumption good or to the sports - worshiping culture that pervades much television .

Some Princeton researchers made a demonstration video of how it 's possible to steal an election with a Diebold voting machine in under a minute .
Anyone with physical access to the machine can put in malicious software to steal votes — such as election workers who have unsupervised access to the machines before elections .
All they have to do is open up the machine with a key ( or pick the lock ) , remove the old memory card , stick in your own memory card , boot the machine , and it automatically installs any software that was on the memory card .
Advertisement
At the end of the demonstration election , the poll machine prints out the incorrect " stolen election " result .
The internal memory card also stores in the incorrect result .
Every piece of evidence of how the election actually went reflects the " wrong " result .
And , after the election is over , the vote stealing software can delete itself .
There 's no evidence left that the vote has been conducted incorrectly .
There 's even a flaw in Diebold machines that allow a virus to spread from machine to machine , infecting a memory card and using it to spread to other machines .

Science reveals secrets of invisibility Invisibility could one day be more than an optical illusion .
QUICKVOTE
Can you imagine invisibility technology ever catching on ?
Yes - one to watch for the future .
No - ca n't see it .
or View Results
Your comments YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Future Summit or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
Invisibility has long been a fantastical ability exclusively enjoyed by teenage wizards , super heroes and the ultra- advanced civilisations of science fiction .
But more pragmatic - minded scientists and engineers now believe that invisibility - enabling technology may be within reach of lesser mortals as well .
The key to that possibility is the development of increasingly complex metamaterials -- manmade composites engineered on a nano scale with properties entirely different to anything found in nature .
Doctor Ulf Leonhardt , a physicist at Scotland 's St. Andrews University who has recently published two papers on the theory behind invisibility technology , said the key was developing a transparent material capable of bending light around an object concealed behind it .
" What you want to do is to surround yourself with a transparent material that is not only transparent but bends the light around you , " Leonhardt told CNN .
Leonhardt said the underlying principle was inspired by natural phenomena when light is bent to create optical illusions such as the refraction of a spoon in water or a mirage in the desert or on hot tarmac .
" There are many examples of ways a transparent material like water glass or air can bend light , " said Leonhardt .
" The reason that is possible is because light will always take the shortest route , which is not always a straight line .
All you need is a transparent material that bends light around an object like water moving around a stone . "
Work on metamaterials that could ultimately make invisibility a reality is already underway at Duke University in the U.S. , where a team led by Professor David R. Smith is experimenting with the design of materials to shield objects from other electromagnetic waves such as microwaves .
Leonhardt said that once that technology had been developed it would merely need to be replicated on a smaller scale to work for light waves as well .
" The essential idea is that all you have to do is make things smaller .
Visible light has a significantly smaller wavelength than microwaves or radio waves but you could take the same building blocks and make them very small .
Thanks to nanotechnology there is a chance that can be done . "
One problem that engineers would face would be in creating a metamaterial covering the full range of the optical spectrum rather than a single color or light frequency .
Currently researchers are only working on developing materials with the ability to channel waves of a specific frequency .
But Leonhardt said he believed the issue was surmountable : " There will be advances on both the technological and theoretical sides which will make invisibility happen in the not too distant future .
This is not completely beyond the range of present technology and theoretical ideas . "
While there may ultimately be practical , ethical and security considerations to be considered for invisibility technology , initial applications are likely to focus on microwave shielding , protecting electrical devices from electromagnetic interference , and applications to enable more effective wireless communications , Leonhardt said .
" What these new ideas give you is a new set of tools to guide microwave radiation in a controlled and precisely adjusted way .
Generally anything connected with wireless technology would benefit from these new design ideas . "
Ironically , the method by which invisibility might be achieved is not dissimilar to the way in which one comic book hero already achieves her special powers .
The Invisible Woman , one of Marvel 's " Fantastic Four , " hides behind a forcefield which guides light around her .
" This really is the underlying principle of these devices .
You mimic with a material an effect that would occur with a field like a curved space , " said Leonhardt .
" That 's the closest example to what people could perhaps do with modern technology . "
But the Invisible Woman and Harry Potter , armed with his invisibility cloak , may still have an advantage over anything technology is capable of .
In the real world , anything or anyone concealed from view would also be trapped in darkness .
" You would see black , of course , " said Leonhardt .
" You are completely cut off from light as it is guided around you -- so you would n't see anything . "

If you could cram your favorite hobby horses into the Encyclopedia of the Future , would n't you be tempted ?
Well , refreshingly , many readers would n't - so let 's commend their integrity .
Wikipedia 's reputation gets another mauling in response to this story , so if you 're a member of what one reader calls the Emergent People - perhaps like Tomorrow 's People , but without the transporter belts - do n't read on .
" Good article .
Please do not let up on these people for a second , " writes Kevin Browne .
" If the Emergent People wish to present themselves as authorities without the credentials to back up the claim , they already begin at a disadvantage .
If they then lack the discipline and knowledge to write and present themselves correctly , should one have confidence in the knowledge they claim , or that they have the discipline to research it properly ? "
Citing the excitable young wiki - fiddler who claimed , ' It should come as no suprise a journalist and teacher ganged up on Wikipedia .
Both have much to loose .
Their claim ?
Authority . '
Kevin replies -
" Indeed .
Authority .
And training .
And experience .
And having received guidance from a predecessor who had those same advantages .
And the ability to fucking spell ! "
" Let 's assume the wiki - fiddlers are right and education is obsolete , which is what their argument amounts to .
They should demonstrate the courage of their convictions , quit their day jobs and impart their knowledge and wisdom to us , full - time , for nothing .
I might support them in such a course of action - not monetarily , of course , as I would hate to corrupt them - and I may even read what they have to say if they learn what a bloody apostrophe is for .
Some Bazaar
Reader Hari Balaramaran adds :
" I found the article very amusing and close to my experience .
Although originally interested in the idea of a ' bazaar ' of ideas , I found that there is a lot of submission by young , energetic , interested but unfortunately misinformed people ( their excess free time results in distortions in the ' bazaar ' equilibrium . )
The fact that they do n't know very much about their articles of interest seems to add to their energy and self - righteousness .
The idea is very democratic and egalitarian but if you want to spread egalitarianism , start a political party .
Do n't subvert an encyclopaedia .
Democracy may support egalitarianism but that has nothing to " truth " or " knowledge " ( yes , I know you 'll want to connect it all up for me but give it a rest )
It brings to mind a different project , Linux , which is " successful " rather than " emergent " on account of linus , who in addition to his kernel coding , probably does n't want to dealt with Emergent facts from uninformed heads . "
" Personally I 'm happy to accept their information on Klingons as being authoritative , " writes Andy Toone .
" However , the people who get overexcited about the social effects of Wiki / Blogs / Open Source seem to be far less reliable when it comes to the economics and practicalities of providing time , effort and information to such projects . "
Ouch .
Many readers pointed to this Slashdot discussion , where mistakes inserted into the online encyclopedia were n't picked up .
The project 's supporters said that this is because the entries were under obscure topics .
Er , just the sort of things that you might need an encyclopedia to answer .
Oh , dear .
But there 's more .
Reader Pascal Monnett gets close to the truth behind the evangelism .
" Wikipedia is a dreamer 's idea of knowledge , " he writes .
" The fact that everyone can input whatever they want may a great thing for equality , but any librarian will tell you its a lousy thing for classification and evaluation . "
" Wikipedia has nothing over a ' traditional ' library , especially when the ' Old World ' institution puts its catalog on line .
In the end , Wikipedia will not allow to search faster or find more , unless you 're looking for Star Trek trivia of course .
Having surfed on the ocean of ignorance that is the Web for the past ten years , I will prefer a library ( on - line or off ) whenever I want to find Knowledge ( the stuff written by scientists and men in possession of that Old World thing known as Wisdom ) . "
What 's ' meme ' in Klingon ?
" What did Wikipedia ever do to you to deserve this ? " asks Ikijtsch van Beijnum .
" I have found plenty of interesting stuff in there , and some of it even unrelated to Star Trek or computers . "
Well , so have we all , but it's when the fiddlers get to obscure or contentious subjects , that the trouble really starts .
Trust is built on how hugely contentious subjects are presented , and Wikipedia with its Klingon belief in " neutral point of view " - rather than context - is where it starts to fall down .
Other philosophical issues , like the idea that you can vote on the truth , might be more problematic .
A most bizarre claim comes from Aakash Mehendale , who at least admits that as a first port of call and as a free resource it is n't too bad .
He did n't accept our library comparison , because , he argues :
" You * pay * for access to those , making a comparison to Wikipedia , free to anyone with web access , not really valid ( online access to databases at sfpl.org is only available with a library card ; these are free to California residents [ who pay state taxes , I am assuming ] , but visitors require a $ 10 ' non- refundable deposit ' and a temporary San Francisco address ) "
But you can also look at it from another direction .
Libraries are an incredibly effective way of amortizing the cost of getting expensive , good - quality information out to people .
And almost everyone in the developed world already pays for some kind of library .
Now remember that the database owners do n't hoard this information because they 're evil or mean , but because it's how they make money , and they have to eat .
They do n't care how they get it , and they'd be happy to receive more from the libraries , so long as Wikipedians were n't copying it out .
So this could be a worthwhile project : only it 's a social , rather than technical challange .
It 's hard to imagine anyone other than a Wikipedian arguing the wider availability of high quality information collections - at which point , you begin to realize it 's a religious issue .
Which brings us full circle , back to those hobby horses .
Rather bizarrely , Aakash defends the odd weighting given to many entries by arguing ,
" Maybe ' the entry on " memes " is almost as long as the entry for Immanuel Kant ' [ or the KLF - ed ] because there already exists a wealth of resources on Kant , " he says , " so the appropriate entry is a guide to and links to those ; whereas you can cover memes pretty much completely in a single article .
Of approximately the same length as the hyperlink - packed entry on Kant . "
He adds , " In the extreme case where there already exists an online resource that says everything about topic T , why do any more than link to that resource ?
This is hypertext , not a paper encyclopaedia : we do n't have to copy out all the work that 's already been done . "
So there you go .
Your reporter is tempted to start a supermarket where if something is n't available , the punters are simply redirected to another store where it is .
We 'll call this Emergent - Mart .
How well do you suppose it will do , dear readers ?
Wikipedia has a dilemma here .
I 'm sure many readers have been approached by people in the street claiming to have a big book that tells all the answers - people in various states of hygiene , insisting that their book is more trusted than others .
But historically , the ones we end up trusting more than others usually do n't make psychobabble their main selling point .
Other factors are usually decisive - like whether it 's authoritative , or just plain right or wrong .
So Wikipedia can go two ways : it can grown into becoming a reasonable encyclopedia , or it can hide behind the psychobabble , and claim special pleading - like religious projects do .
Expect a change in how the project is marketed fairly shortly . ®

Adeyoola was found guilty of murdering 84 - year Anne Mendel , who was found by her husband in March last year lying in a pool of blood at the bottom of the staircase in her home .
She had been stabbed 14 times .
The DNA of the 18 - year - old , who had formerly been a neighbour , was found on Mrs Mendel 's hand , a fact Adeyoola explained away by saying she had , by chance , helped the elderly woman across the road earlier that day .
Adeyoola pleaded not guilty , but the prosecution argued successfully that she had carried out the murder herself , possibly as a " dry run " for the slaughter of a wealthy woman who would make a more lucrative " job " .
It was a killing the teenager had meticulously planned in a murder manual written a few months earlier when she was in juvenile custody .
Staff at the Bullwood Hall juvenile offenders ' institution , where Adeyoola was serving a sentence for shoplifting , found the blueprint in October 2004 , during an inspection of her cell .
On being confronted the teenager claimed the whole thing was fiction .
But within the space of a few months the fiction turned into reality .
The handwritten notes , entitled " Prison and After : Making life count " , began innocently , with plans to " lose two stones from 11 stone eight to nine and a half stone " , and " locate two - bed apartment " .
Adeyoola , herself the daughter of a millionaire property developer , went on to outline how she would obtain bank accounts , " make £ 2,000 " to furnish her apartment , buy a Mercedes and clothes and DVDs .
Despite having been privately educated Adeyoola left school with no qualifications , and wanted to obtain fake GCSE and A - Level qualifications over the internet , and mock up a CV stating she had attended the Chelmsford School for Girls .
But " the main changes for [ a ] happy future " depended on Adeyoola getting " a minimum of £ 3m " , according to the journal .
For this she would need to rob and murder an elderly woman , and frame the woman 's husband for the killing .
Such a feat would require equipment : petrol canisters , plastic bags , cling film , semi-automatic guns , Taser stun guns and a bullet - proof vest were all duly listed .
So were various disguises - wigs , dark glasses , and bizarrely , a " full body fat suit , approximately 18 stone woman " .
She sketched out her ideal victim : " She must be wealthy , quite elderly and defenceless .
Find a candidate and watch her .
Their routine must be closely observed .
Follow her .
She will probably be married .
See if they get any visitors .
Create a survey questionnaire and visit them disguised as an A - level student .
Tell them it 's field work .
Ask them : ' Do you have guns to protect yourself ? ' "
The attack was imagined in emotionless detail : lie in wait for the victim , creep up on her , and cover her mouth with a gloved hand .
Once in the house , threaten the victim with a knife , extract bank account details and the code to her safe , get her to write a fake ' I 'm leaving ' note , and then despatch her .
" With your butcher 's knife remove her head .
Wrap it in film to contain bleeding , detach limbs one by one , " she wrote .
" When you have completed the task , put head , body pieces in black bag . "
The " job " was to be done by February 2005 .
Throughout her trial Adeyoola insisted the document was a work of fiction , notes for a crime thriller she was writing in the style of a James Patterson book .
Following the discovery of the papers in her cell she was interviewed by a senior staff member and psychologist , whom she told : " I want them back .
It 's a story . "
In court she dismissed the manual as " the scribblings of a 16 - year - old girl " .
She said she was fascinated by writers such as Martina Cole and James Patterson , and wanted to emulate them .
" I had always considered writing a book .
I 'd like to be an author .
When I was in Bullwood Hall I thought it would be a good place to start , " she told the court .
In her evidence the teenager also told how she had set up house with another girl in Belsize Park , north London , and worked as an escort to pay the rent .
" All we had to do was go out on a date and we could make £ 500 a night .
We could make up to £ 5,000 a week , " she said .
" It was safe because we shadowed each other and it was easy . "
A police source described finding a cache of sex toys when Adeyoola 's flat was raided after she was arrested .
" There were several vibrators , nipple clamps , lesbian pornographic magazines , edible underwear made of candy , revealing outfits , handcuffs - all sorts of equipment , " the source said .
Police also discovered piles of stolen designer clothes and a book entitled Great Crimes .
Adeyoola also told the court she had begun stealing from shops at age 15 , something she described as a " skill " .
She earned a string of convictions for theft , which culminated in her serving three months in a young offenders ' institution , where she hatched her murder plans .
The young woman was also charged with two counts of peverting the course of justice , after she was taped setting up a bogus alibi for the murder with a 16 - year - old accomplice .
She and the 16 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , were convicted on one of those counts .
Speaking after the verdict , Detective Inspector Steve Morris of the Metropolitan police described the case as " a wicked , premeditated murder committed by a callous , devious young woman and her cold , calculated use of extreme violence beggars belief " .
Her father , Bola Adeyoola , who runs a successful property management company , said : " What she did was evil . "
Presiding Judge Richard Hone QC suggested she may have even committed the murder to amass " material " for her future literary endeavours .
Adeyoola was remanded in custody to await sentencing next month .
A life of privilege
Kemi Adeyoola is the daughter of Bola Adeyoola , a property manager and former boxer who is worth an estimated £ 10 m .
He said yesterday that his daughter was a spoilt , cunning girl who had been obsessed with money from an early age .
He lost contact with her when she was 11 .
After that , he said , he passed money and messages to her through her grandparents .
Following her release from Bullwood Hall prison he set her up in a flat but they fell out when he advised her to " go straight " .
According to Mr Adeyoola , she responded by vandalising his office .
Despite the discovery of the " blueprint for murder " , psychologists at Bullwood Hall had held high hopes for Adeyoola on her release , describing her as an articulate , " intelligent and sophisticated " girl .

東大教官が選んだ新入生向けのブックリストとして、新書「東大教官が新入生すすめる本」と、紀伊國屋書店のサイト[参照]がある。全部で1600冊程と膨大なので、まとめた。まとめるだけでは面白くないので、100冊に絞ってランキングした。
■東大教官の観 点
以下の3つの観点から選書している。
1 ) 私の読書から――印象に残っている本
2 ) これだけは読んでおこう――研究者の立場から
3 ) 私がすすめる東京大学出版会の 本
1 ) は、読書経験の貧富がハッキリ見える。めったな本を勧めるわけにはいかない。ほとんどが厳めしい古典、大御所を占める。ところが、ウケ狙いか、小松左京や村上龍、コミック「棒がいっぽん」などを推す教官がいて面白い。
2 ) の意味を拡大解釈する教官多し。何十巻もある「○○全集」を指定してくる人もいる。ゼミ生になったら生き字引代わりにでもしようとするつもりかしらん。オマエも全読してねぇだろ！と無音でツッコむ。
3 ) は東大出版会の宣伝とみなしている。「教科書」なんだし、胴元だから許されるんだね。ただし、東大出版会も" The Universe of English " や「知の技法」など、良本を出してることも心に留めてご紹介する。
■ 100 冊の選び 方

では、東大教官がすすめる本ベスト100のご紹介～
■ 第1位～第10 位
1. カラマーゾフの兄弟（フョードル・ミハイロヴィチ・ドストエフスキー）
2. 量子力学（レフ・ダヴィドヴィッチ・ランダウ）
3. 線型代数入門（斎藤正彦）
4. The Universe of English / The Expanding Universe of English（東京大学出版会 ）
5. オリエンタリズム（エドワード・Ｗ．サイード）
6. プロテスタンティズムの倫理と資本主義の精神（マックス・ヴェーバー）
7. 解析入門（セルジュ・ラング）
8. 邪宗門（高橋和巳）
9. 物と心（大森荘蔵）
10 . ゲーデル、エッシャー、バッハ（ダグラス・Ｒ．ホフスタッター）
「 カラ兄 」 堂堂1位なりイイィィィ さすが最強の小説！
教科書（東大出版）が混じるが、サイード「オリエンタリズム」とヴェーバー「プロ倫」と大御所を推すところはサスガ学問の最高府ですな。「邪宗門」が入っているのは団塊エリート世代の教科書だからだろう。
【 第1位】カラマーゾフの兄弟（ドストエフスキー ）
流石というかヤッパリというか、「カラ兄」がイチバン東大新入生にオススメされている小説。ハイ、もちろん一冊だけ選べというならば、わたしも「最高の小説」と強く推す。50回読むとウィトゲンシュタインになれるというのはウソかもしれないが、ウィトゲンシュタインは50回精読したのは本当らしい。特に「大審問官」はスゴい。生を生きなおすようなす経験を請けあおう。この blog で 「すごい本」を探している方へ→スゴい本は沢山あるけれど、頂点はこれ。徹夜小説、劇薬小説、夢中小説、最高小説、キング・オブ・スゴ本、あらゆる称号のトップはダントツこれ。未読の方は四の五の言わずに読め（命令形）。最強の読書体験を約束する。ただし、非常に強い酒のような小説なので読んでクラクラしないよう気をつけて。
【 第4 位 】The Universe of English（第2版）（東京大学教養学部英語部会）
Z会の教材で何篇か読んだ記憶が。駒場連中の「教科書」だから東大生なら見たくもないかもしれないケド、知的好奇心をソソられるネタもあるはず。パトリック・マグラアの「 O'Malley and Schwartz」なんて持ってくるのはセンスいい（露悪?）と思うゾ。2006年から第3版を使うらしい。
【 第5位】オリエンタリズム（エドワード・サイード）
大学時代にムリヤリ読まされた記憶が。歴史 ＝ 自らを正当化するためのラベリングの歴史 だと納得させられた 。Wikipedia の紹介が分かりよい → 「 オリエンタル（東洋、東洋的、東洋性）は、西洋によって作られたイメージであり、文学、歴史学、人類学等、広範な文化活動の中に見られる。それはしばしば優越感や傲慢さ、偏見とも結びついているばかりではなく、サイードによれば西洋の帝国主義の基盤ともなったとされる」…イヤイヤ読んだので良い思い出はないので、今度は自分の知的好奇心のために再読しよう。
【第6位】プロテスタンティズムの倫理と資本主義の精神（マックス・ヴェーバー）
これも有名どころですな。一文でまとめると「営利の追求を敵視するピューリタニズムの経済倫理が実は近代資本主義の生誕に大きく貢献したのだという歴史の逆説を究明した画期的な論考」とのこと（amazon紹介）。「プロ倫」の解説はさんざ読まされているので「読んだ気分」になってるが、未読だったりする。
【 第8位】邪宗門（高橋和巳）
戦後世代に衝撃をあたえた（らしい）作品。ありうべき世を求めて権力と相対峙した新興宗教団体の誕生から壊滅に至るまでの歴史を描いた壮大な叙事詩とのこと。実はコレ、高校時代に親にシツコク勧められた作品なのだが、未だ読んでない（←親不孝モノ）。ごめんよ。
【 第10位】ゲーデル、エッシャー、バッハ（ダグラス・ホフスタッター）
オススメ本について、結城浩さんに質問をする機会があって、結城さんの回答が「これまでにもっとも繰り返し読んだ本は『ゲーデル・エッシャー・バッハ』」とのこと[参照]。以来、図書館から借り出しては→挫折の繰り返し…レベル高ッ。reflexive（再帰）を論理と音楽とイメージの3点から攻めていることは分かるけれど、読んでいるというよりも、字面を「見て」いるだけでちっともアタマに沁みこんでこない。ひそかに購入を決心している一冊でもある（いかんせん大著なのだ、ボリュームもお値段も！）。
■ 第11位～第50 位

49 . 職業としての政治（マックス・ヴェーバー）
50 . 信頼の構造（山岸俊男）
文系理系ごちゃまぜなのが良いカンジ。「文系だから 」
「理系なのに」は枕詞としてよく使われるが、枕詞並に意味が無い。例えばホーキングやグールドは「理系」、丸山真男やヴェーバーは「文系」の本とされるが、読み手はそれを意識して手にするか?
否とよ。面白けりゃ読むだろうし、使えなけりゃ見向きもしないだけ。知的好奇心を自分で矯めてどうする。
認知論の本（ 「 理解と何か 」 「 知るということ 」 「認知とパフォーマンス」など）が多くあるが、東大出版会のいわゆる「教科書」。教科書として読むと苦痛だけど、ハマってみたかった分野。tagを貼っておきたいナリ。
【 第12位】ホーキング、宇宙を語る（スティーヴン・ホーキング）
ニュートン物理学→相対性理論までが前半で、後半が量子力学と相対論の統一を通した究極の説明：「なぜ宇宙が生まれ、現代のような形になったのか」。ええ、もちろんミーハーなので出た当時に読んだぞ→さっぱり理解できなかったケド。ただし、功利的な観点からニュートンを評するあたりで科学というものは一つの神話に過ぎないという事実を思い知らされたことはハッキリ覚えている。「説明」ができる間だけ信じられるのが「科学」であり、説明抜きに信じてもらえるのが宗教だったりする。続編はそのうち読むかも「ホーキング、宇宙のすべてを語る」。
【 第32位】理科系の作文技術（木下是雄）
「 理科系の」と銘打っているが、文理関係なかろう。調査報告、技術報告、計画申請書など、学生・社会人に関係なく、書かなければならないドキュメントは多い。書く際に最初に考えなければならないことが二つある
→「これを読むのは誰で、その人に何を伝えるのか」なり。その上で主題を決め、結論を決め、そいつを支える構成・展開・データを考える。目標を定めた書き方が身につく（とのこと）。実は未読なのだが、この紹介文書いてるうちに読みたくなってきたナリ。100位には入ってないが、「理系の女の生き方ガイド」は何やら痛そうで面白そう（未読）。

72 . 明治憲法体制の確立（坂野潤治）
73 . 論理哲学論考（ルードヴィヒ・ヴィトゲンシュタイン）
74 . 侏儒の言葉（芥川龍之介）
【 第59位】知的複眼思考法（苅谷剛彦）
ロジカルシンキングが専門語を一切使わず噛んで含めるように書いてある。読むだけで腑に落ちるスゴ本。レビューは[ここ]。これをゼミで実践している学生さんがうらやましすぎるぞ。社会人になって高額のトレーニングを受けたり、実践で時間をかけて培ったりする" エッセンス"をゼミで身に付けられるのだから。このリストも同様のことが言えるが、東大は勉強するには良い環境だとつくづく思う。
【 第69位】方法序説（デカルト）
恥ずかしながら未読。部分の和が全体（となるような分解）や、原因と結果の法則について書いてあるんだなーということは薄々知ってはいたけど…小林秀雄「考えるヒント2」の「常識について」によると、「方法序説」なんてお題が堅物らしい。むしろ「方法の話」とでも訳したほうがよいとのこと。何の方法かというと、生きてゆくうえで真実を見つけ出し、判断する方法。デカルトが、当時の学問語であるラテン語を捨てて、平易なフランス語で、しかも匿名で書いたそうな。大切なことは、見つけ出した「真実」や「判断」そのものではなく、そこへ至った方法だという。これは学問の多寡に関係しないし、誰にでもどんなことにでも応用が可能だから。正しく認識するための「原理」や、有効に行動するための「格率」が立てられる。身につけたら一生モノだな。
■ 第75位～第100位

99 . ファウンデーション（アイザク・アシモフ）
100 . 論理トレーニング１０１題（野矢茂樹）
第75位からは2票ばかりなので、わたしの独断で選本。既読のものは印象深いオススメ本だし、未読のものは強烈に読みたい本ばかり。
【 第77位】ご冗談でしょう、ファインマンさん（リチャード・ファインマン）
「 傑作だ→読め」と勧められているが、未読。「ファインマン」と聞けば、もちろん、量子力学でもマンハッタン計画でもノーベル賞でもなく、茶目っ気たっぷりの風貌と共に本書を思い浮かべるが、未読。学生のときに読み逃しておくとずっと（微かに）後悔するハメになる。読んでる人は東大教官が勧めなくても手に取っているハズだが…
【 第78 位 】 「 トムは真夜中の庭で 」
ネットで知って、もう何年も前から気になっている小説。正確にはわたしの知らないスゴい本を読んでる複数の人が絶賛する本。ネタバレしないように関連情報には極力目を伏せている。良い機会だ、ここで挙げたのをきっかけに読んでみよう（ただし、わたしの読むリストはFIFOなので、" いつか読む" にはかわりない）
【 第79位】はてしない物語と【第81位】モモ（ミヒャエル・エンデ）
こいつを大学新入生にオススメする教官も面白い。良い本は2種類ある。一つは、賢くする（あるいは賢くなった気分にする）本。もう一つは豊かにする（あるいは豊かになった気分になる）本。これは後者。しかも気分ではなく本当に豊かになる。どちらもとてもオモシロイので強力にオススメ。そして、ただオモシロイ面白いと興ずるうちに、なんだか薄ら寒い思いで後ろを振り返るはず。だから「小学校高学年から」なんて児童書扱いされてると激しく違うと言いたくなる。これは「オトナ向け」。余談だが、本書のリンクを作る際に知ったのだが、「はてしない物語」は文庫化されているではないかッ！しかも二分冊でッ！！これでは「いま、読み手が手にしている本」と「本の中の主人公が読んでる本」とのシンクロが楽しめないではないかバカモーン！
【 第82位】完全な真空（スタニスワフ・レム）
本書は、実在しない本について書かれた架空の書評集。でも実体は手元にあるじゃないか、と読むと非常に奇妙な感覚に囚われることを請合う。本書でレビューされる「架空の本」「架空の講演 」「架空の論文」の一つひとつがまたよく出来てて思わず知らずつりこまれる。非常に実験的な「作品」が多々あり、「とどのつまりは何も無し」と「我は僕（しもべ）ならずや」あたりを読んだときの妙な気持ちは、今でも強く覚えている。書評という形でしか存在しえない「本」ということが面白い。ただ、そんな実在しない本のレビューに没頭しているわたしは誰だ?
さらにそいつをオススメするわたしは?
などと一度ならずとも思うはず。
【 第84位】君たちはどう生きるか（吉野源三郎）
コペル君の話。何度も手にするクセに読みきれていないので、未読。人生をいかに生くべきかというテーマをティーン向けに説く。いつかわが子に渡すために、今わたしが読んでおかないとなぁ…
本書は広島大学総合科学部「大学新入生に薦める101冊」でも強力にオススメされているぞ。
【 第90位】星の王子さま（アントアーヌ・ド・サン・テグジュペリ）
これは 「たいせつな人」へオススメする本なりィッ
新入生に軽々しく「読め」などと言えぬ…それぐらい思い入れがある（だろ?
あなたも）。名台詞「たいせつなものは目に見えない」の破壊力は、そうだな…「もうゴールしてもいいよね?」級と言っておこう。この本をオススメしたい人が沢山いる、という人生が豊かなんだろうなー、などと思ったり。
【 第92位】大聖堂（ケン・フォレット）
大聖堂 ｷﾀ━━━ ━ ( ﾟ∀ﾟ ) ━━━━ｯ!!
こいつはスゴいぞ楽しいぞ、その名も超電磁ロボ…じゃなくて「大聖堂」は面白い小説の見本のようなもの。最近読んだ100冊本の中でおもしろさNo.1（たぶん）。中世ヨーロッパが舞台なのだが、時代を超えて人間の欲望が生み出す壮大なドラマと「大聖堂」を見上げることができる。欲望は様々な形を取る。権力欲、支配欲、愛欲、性欲、意欲、我欲、禁欲、強欲、財欲、色欲、食欲、邪欲、情欲、大欲、知識欲、貪欲、肉欲…ありとあらゆる「欲望」を具現化したドラマ。ハラハラドキドキ、ワクワクテカテカしながら読みふけれい。わたしのレビューは[ここ ] 。
【 第93位】誰のためのデザイン？（ドナルド・Ａ．ノーマン）
ありとあらゆ る 「 ユーザーインタフェース」の基底となる本（コンピュータのGUI に限らない）。モノの持つ属性（色や形）が、そのモノ自身をどう取り扱ったら良いかについてのメッセージをユーザに対して発している、いわゆる affordance の根っこが分かる。 「使いやすいとはどういうことか」が肌で分かる。ボタンの配置だとか見出しの色だとか、Webデザインネタが巷に数多にあるけれど、あくまで表層的なもの。もっと根源的な「どうしてそうだと分かるか」についてここまで実例を掘り下げて書いてあるのはめったにない。デザイン本をいくつも漁るよりも、デザイン本とは縁遠いようなコレをしっかりと読み込むほうが近道。ちなみに100位以内に入ってないが、「生きのびるためのデザイン」も推薦されてた。
【 第94位】不滅（ミラン・クンデラ）
クンデラの最高はコレ。けして「存在の耐えられない軽さ」ではない。魂の不滅、存在の不滅を語るため、時空を超えて小説論、文明批判、省察、伝記などを混ぜこぜにしたクンデラの長い長い独り言のような小説。ポリフォニックな小説といえばドストエフスキーだろうが、クンデラのこれも好きー。わたしのレビューは[ここ]（長いゾ）。
【 第95位】棒がいっぽん（高野文子）
「 黄色い本 」で知り 「るきさん」でファンになり、本書は次に読もうと思ってる。なんてことない起伏の少ないマンガなんだけどーーーうーん、なんかこう、毎日の生活の中でクッと背中のツボを押されるような気分にさせられる。手元にあるとつい何度でも読み返してしまう、不思議な魅力を持つ。しかし、コレを新入生に勧める東大教官って…orz
【 第96位】竜馬がゆく（司馬遼太郎）
いろんな意味で思い入れが激しい作品。3回読んだし、また手にするだろう。語り始めると止められなくなるので紹介はするまい。こいつはblogで気を吐くよりも、誰かとリアルで話をしたいですな。この作品を（酒でも入れて）語り合える友がいる人生が、アツい人生なんだろな。未読の方は読め（命令形）、と。読むと「外へ」出たくなる。体がアツくなる、吼えたくなる。若ければ若いほど効果大だゾ。
【 第98位】コインロッカー・ベイビーズ（村上龍）
村上龍のサイコウケッサク。読むとアタマガツンと一撃喰らう。あまりにスゴいので、彼の作品はコレで測ってる。曰く「コインロッカー・ベイビーズ」より面白いか否か」…おかげで彼の作品は一切読んでいない。amazon紹介を引用
→「コインロッカーを胎内としてこの世に生まれ出たキクとハシ。罪の子ふたりの心に渦まく愛と憎悪。廃墟と化した東京の上空に、華やかなステージに、そして南海の暗い海底に強烈な破壊のエネルギーがほとばしる」…うーん、こんなんだったっけ?
再読するか。そして毒に中（あた）るか。
【 第99位】ファウンデーション（アイザク・アシモフ）
長門有希さんご推挙の逸品 … wikipedia によると、一つのゆるやかなシリーズにまとめられる作品群を総称している（らしい）。「 ファウンデーション 」
「 ファウンデーション対帝国 」 「第二ファウンデーション 」 「ファウンデーションの彼方へ 」 「ファウンデーションと地球 」
「ファウンデーションへの序曲 」「ファウンデーションの誕生」とあるとのこと。んで、どれ読みゃいいんだ?
未読だと思っていたが、「鋼鉄都市」は読んだ記憶が…
読書指南役の嫁さんも読んでなさそうだし、ネタバレにならない程度の紹介を探してみよう。
【 第100位】論理トレーニング１０１題（野矢茂樹）
宣伝文句 「 解説書なんかいくら読んだって論理の力は鍛えられない」に引っ張られた一冊。途中で投げ出しているので未読。amazonの宣伝で手にとる気力が湧いてきたぞ
→「ひとり本書に向かって言葉と格闘し、煩悶（はんもん）し、その筋道をたどる作業が論理の力を鍛えてくれるはずだからだ。『頭の回転が速い』とか『知性的』というのは、こうした地道なトレーニングの積み重ねに負うところが大きいのだろう。通勤、通学時の1冊としてもおすすめ」…読もっと。未読本の紹介をしているうちに読みたくなるのは不思議だねー

未読既読をチェックするのもいいし、年ごとのオススメ傾向の推移を眺めても楽しいかも。東京大学出版会だけ抜けば教科書以外のオススメリストができあがる。「ソレを推すなら、コレ読んでるのかぁ」なんて意地悪になると大穴本に出会えるかも。「教官」ではなく、「教授」が選んだブックリストであれば、「教養のためのブックガイド」がオススメ。「教養とは」から真っ向勝負して、「教養の罠」を上手く回避した、良いガイドだと思う。そのうちレビューするのでお楽しみに。
東大ブランドをありがたがるつもりは毛頭ないが、このオススメ本のリストといい、ロジカルシンキングのゼミ[参照]といい、やっぱ違う。他の100冊リストと比べてみると面白いかも。

ST . LOUIS — Ancient humans from Asia may have entered the Americas following an ocean highway made of dense kelp .
The new finding lends strength to the " coastal migration theory , " whereby early maritime populations boated from one island to another , hunting the bountiful amounts of sea creatures that live in kelp forests .
This research was presented here Sunday at the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science by anthropologist Jon Erlandson of the University of Oregon .
Today , a nearly continuous " kelp highway " stretches from Japan , up along Siberia , across the Bering Strait to Alaska , and down again along the California coastline , Erlandson said .
Kelp forests are some of the world 's richest ecosystems .
They are homes to seals , sea otters , hundreds of species of fish , sea urchins and abalone , all of which would have been important food and material sources for maritime people .
Although the coastal migration theory has yet to be proven with hard evidence , it is known that seafaring peoples lived in the Ryukyu Islands near Japan during the height of the last glacial period , about 35,000 to 15,000 years ago .
These peoples may have traveled 90 or more miles at a time between islands .
Some scientists believe that maritime people boated from Japan to Alaska along the Aleutian and Kurile Islands around 16,000 years ago .
Before that , people may have island - hopped their way to Australia 50,000 to 60,000 years ago .
Scientists have discovered settlements 11,500 to 9,000 years old along the coasts of some of these Pacific islands , which also have ecologically - rich kelp forests nearby that Erlandson believes existed when people were island hopping .
The remains of kelp resources have been discovered in a settlement in Daisy Cave in the Channel Islands off southern California , dated to about 9,800 years ago .
" The fact that productive kelp forests are found adjacent to some of the earliest coastal archaeological sites in the Americas supports the idea that such forests may have facilitated human coastal migrations around the Pacific Rim near the end of the last glacial period , " Erlandson said .
" In essence , they may have acted as a sort of kelp highway . "
Kelp forests also provide a barrier between coastal settlements and the rough open seas and lessen the wave forces on beach - side settlements .
Sometimes the kelp washes up on land , where land animals , which humans could kill and eat , can munch on it .
Still , apart from its front - runner status , Google is also remarkable for its pace of innovation and for how broadly it seems to interpret its mission to " organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful . "
The company 's current lineup of offerings includes : software for searching personal computer files ; an e-mail service ; maps ; satellite images ; instant messaging ; blogging tools ; a service for posting and sharing digital photos ; and specialized searches for news , video , shopping and local information .
Google 's most controversial venture , Google Print , is a project to copy and catalog millions of books ; it faces lawsuits by some publishers and authors who say it violates copyright law .
Google , which tends to keep its plans secret , certainly has the wealth to fund ambitious ventures .
Its revenues are growing by nearly 100 percent a year , and its profits are rising even faster .
Its executives speak of the company 's outlook only in broad strokes , but they suggest all but unlimited horizons .
" We believe that search networks as industries remain in their nascent stages of growth with great forward potential , " Eric Schmidt , Google 's chief executive , told analysts last month .
Among the many projects being developed and debated inside Google is a real estate service , according to a person who has attended meetings on the proposal .
The concept , the person said , would be to improve the capabilities of its satellite imaging , maps and local search and combine them with property listings .
The service , this person said , could make house hunting far more efficient , requiring potential buyers to visit fewer real estate agents and houses .
If successful , it would be another magnet for the text ads that appear next to search results , the source of most of Google 's revenue .
In telecommunications , the company has made a number of moves that have grabbed the attention of industry executives .
It has been buying fiber - optic cable capacity in the United States and has invested in a company delivering high - speed Internet access over power lines .
And it is participating in an experiment to provide free wireless Internet access in San Francisco .
That has led to speculation that the company wants to build a national free GoogleNet , paid for mostly by advertising .
And Google executives seem to delight in dropping tantalizing , if vague , hints .
" We focus on access to the information as much as the search itself because you need both , " Mr. Schmidt said in an analysts ' conference call last month .

Mike Murray , a surprisingly hapless HR manager at Microsoft , made a number of goofs , but the doozie was introducing a “ Ship It ” award shortly after he started the job .
The idea was that you would get a big lucite tombstone the size of a dictionary when your product shipped .
This was somehow supposed to give you an incentive to work , you see , because if you did n’t do your job– no lucite for you !
Makes you wonder how Microsoft ever shipped software before the lucite slab .
The Ship
It program was announced with an incredible amount of internal fanfare and hoopla at a big company picnic .
For weeks before the event , teaser posters appeared all over the corporate campus with a picture of Bill Gates and the words “ Why is this man smiling ? ” I ’m not sure what that meant .
Was Bill smiling because he was happy that we now had an incentive to ship software ?
But at the company picnic , it became apparent that the employees felt like they were being treated like children .
There was a lot of booing .
The Excel programming team held up a huge sign that said “ Why is the Excel team yawning ? ” The Ship
It award was so despised that there is even a ( non-fiction ) episode in Douglas Coupland ’s classic Microserfs in which a group of programmers try to destroy one with a blow torch .
Treating your rocket scientist employees as if they were still in kindergarten is not an isolated phenomenon .
Almost every company has some kind of incentive program that is insulting and demeaning .
At two of the companies I ’ve worked for , the most stressful time of year was the twice - yearly performance review period .
For some reason , the Juno HR department and the Microsoft HR department must have copied their performance review system out of the same Dilbertesque management book , because both programs worked exactly the same way .
First , you gave “ anonymous ” upward reviews for your direct manager ( as if that could be done in an honest way ) .
Then , you filled out optional “ self - evaluation ” forms , which your manager “ took into account ” in preparing your performance review .
Finally , you got a numerical score , in lots of non-scalar categories like “ works well with others ” , from 1 - 5 , where the only possible scores were actually 3 or 4 .
Managers submitted bonus recommendations upwards , which were completely ignored and everybody received bonuses that were almost completely random .
The system never took into account the fact that people have different and unique talents , all of which are needed for a team to work well .
Performance reviews were stressful for a couple of reasons .
Many of my friends , especially the ones whose talents were very significant but did n’t show up on the traditional scales , tended to get lousy performance reviews .
For example , one friend of mine was a cheerful catalyst , a bouncy cruise director who motivated everyone else when the going got tough .
He was the glue that held his team together .
But he tended to get negative reviews , because his manager did n’t understand his contribution .
Another friend was incredibly insightful strategically ; his conversations with other people about how things should be done allowed everyone else to do much better work .
He tended to spend more time than average trying out new technologies ; in this area he was invaluable to the rest of the team .
But in terms of lines of code , he wrote less than average , and his manager was too stupid to notice all his other contributions , so he always got negative reviews , too .
Negative reviews , obviously , have a devastating effect on morale .
In fact , giving somebody a review that is positive , but not as positive as that person expected , also has a negative effect on morale .
The effect of reviews on morale is lopsided : while negative reviews hurt morale a lot , positive reviews have no effect on morale or productivity .
The people who get them are already working productively .
For them , a positive review makes them feel like they are doing good work in order to get the positive review … as if they were Pavlovian dogs working for a treat , instead of professionals who actually care about the quality of the work that they do .
And herein lies the rub .
Most people think that they do pretty good work ( even if they do n’t ) .
It ’s just a little trick our minds play on us to keep life bearable .
So if everybody thinks they do good work , and the reviews are merely correct ( which is not very easy to achieve ) , then most people will be disappointed by their reviews .
The cost of this in morale is hard to understate .
On teams where performance reviews are done honestly , they tend to result in a week or so of depressed morale , moping , and some resignations .
They tend to drive wedges between team members , often because the poorly - rated are jealous of the highly - rated , in a process that DeMarco and Lister call teamicide : the inadvertent destruction of jelled teams .
Alfie Kohn , in a now - classic Harvard Business Review article , wrote :
… at least two dozen studies over the last three decades have conclusively shown that people who expect to receive a reward for completing a task or for doing that task successfully simply do not perform as well as those who expect no reward at all .
[ HBR Sept / Oct 93 ]
He concludes that “ incentives ( or bribes ) simply can’t work in the workplace ” .
DeMarco and Lister go further , stating unequivocally that any kind of workplace competition , any scheme of rewards and punishments , and even the old fashion trick of “ catching people doing something right and rewarding them , ” all do more harm than good .
Giving somebody positive reinforcement ( such as stupid company ceremonies where people get plaques ) implies that they only did it for the lucite plaque ; it implies that they are not independent enough to work unless they are going to get a cookie ; and it ’s insulting and demeaning .
Most software managers have no choice but to go along with performance review systems that are already in place .
If you ’re in this position , the only way to prevent teamicide is to simply give everyone on your team a gushing review .
But if you do have any choice in the matter , I ’d recommend that you run fleeing from any kind of performance review , incentive bonus , or stupid corporate employee - of - the - month program .

MUTE protects your privacy by avoiding direct connections with your sharing partners in the network .
Most other file sharing programs use direct connections to download or upload , making your identity available to spies from the RIAA and other unscrupulous organizations .

Ants display collectively intelligent behavior when foraging for food or fighting off predators .
Each ant in the colony acts in a rather simple way , but together they end up doing something clever , like discovering the shortest path between their ant hill and a food source .
MUTE 's routing mechanism is inspired by ant behavior .

MUTE is based on research , and experiments show that it works quite well .
MUTE 's ant - inspired routing is light - weight , robust , and adaptive .
Results from experiments in real MUTE networks show that the collective behavior of MUTE nodes quickly finds the shortest ( or fastest ) routing path between two nodes on the network .

How File Sharing Reveals Your Identity Following the death of Napster , all of the file sharing networks that rose to main - stream popularity were decentralized .
The most popular networks include Gnutella ( which powers Limewire , BearShare , and Morpheus ) and FastTrack ( which powers KaZaA and Grokster ) .
The decentralization provides legal protection for the companies that distribute the software , since they do not have to run any component of the network themselves : once you get the software , you become part of the network , and the network could survive even if the parent company disappears .
All of these networks operate as a web or mesh of neighboring node connections .
Your node connects to a few other nodes in the network , and those nodes connect to a few other nodes , which in turn connect to a few other nodes , and so on .
This layout is similar to a real - life social network : you know people , and those people know other people , who in turn know other people , and so on .
A portion of one of these networks might look something like this :
When you search for files in the network , you send a search request to your neighbors , they send the request on to their neighbors , and so on .
Eventually , your request reaches many nodes in the network .
For example , you might send out a search for " metallica mp3 " .
Lots of nodes receive your request , but only a few of them are actually sharing any metallica music .
Those that do have matches send their results back to your node .
These results look something like this :
My Address :
128.223.12.122 My
File :
Metallica__Enter_Sandman.mp3
My Address :
128.223.12.122 My
File :
Metallica__Unforgiven.mp3
My Address :
128.223.12.122 My
File :
Metallica__Everywhere_I_Roam.mp3
Notice the " My Address " portion of these responses .
The address listed is the Internet address of the computer that has the file .
If you are unfamiliar with Internet addresses ( commonly called IP addresses ) , they are like a " phone number " for a computer on the Internet .
Computers use these addresses to make connections to each other over the Internet , and your node can use this address to make a connection to the node that is sharing the three Metallica files shown above .
Also like phone numbers , Internet addresses can be traced to find out who owns them --- we will cover this point in more detail in the next section .
Suppose that the blue node is the node at 128.223.12.122 that returned the three Metallica results :
To download a file from the blue node , your node makes a direct connection to it using the address 128.223.12.122 .
After your node connects to the blue node , the blue node knows your computer 's Internet address as well , say 113.18.92.15 ( going back to the phone analogy , this is like the blue node using caller ID ) .
The blue node sends the Metallica file to you over this connection , and then you close the connection .
This connection , which is separate from the other neighbor connections in the network , would look like this :
Just by performing a search , you got the Internet address of someone who is sharing Metallica .
When you downloaded a file from that person , they got your Internet address as well .
Well , it is only an Internet address , right ?
How the RIAA Finds People to Sue Your Internet Service Provider , or ISP , provides you with your Internet address , much in the same way that your phone company provides you with your phone number .
And , like a phone company , an ISP knows who is using each Internet address that it gives out .
In general , your ISP will keep your identity private .
So , though the person sharing Metallica might contact your ISP and ask , " Who is using 113.18.92.15 ? " , your ISP will likely keep its lips sealed .
Your ISP will keep its lips sealed unless it is scared , an nothing scares an ISP more than the RIAA ( except maybe the FBI and NSA , but so far , these organizations have yet to jump on the anti-file - sharing bandwagon ) .
Suppose that you are sharing a large collection of your favorite music , and assume that your collection contains more than 1000 songs .
Also , suppose that most of the songs in this collection are " owned " by record labels that are represented by the RIAA .
When someone searches for " mp3 " in your file sharing network , your node returns a lot of results .
Now suppose that one of the nodes in the network happens to be owned by the RIAA :
The RIAA performs a search in the network for songs that it cares about .
Since RIAA record labels " own " the vast majority of music that is published in throughout the world , we can simplify things by assuming that the RIAA cares about most songs .
Thus , the RIAA performs a search for " mp3 " , and your node returns over 1000 results , which look something like this :
My Address :
113.18.92.15 My
File :
Madonna__Holiday.mp3
My Address :
113.18.92.15 My
File :
Fleetwood_Mac__Dreams.mp3
My Address :
113.18.92.15 My
File :
Journey__Faithfully.mp3 .
.
. My Address :
113.18.92.15 My
File :
Bonnie_Raitt__Something_To_Talk_About.mp3
My Address :
113.18.92.15 My
File :
Poison__Unskinny_Bop.mp3
Though an average file sharing user would usually initiate a download in response to this gold mine of search results , the RIAA has all the information that it needs , so it stops right here .
With the list of 1000 + infringing songs in hand , it files a subpoena against your ISP ( " Who is using 113.18.92.15 ? " ) and demands that your ISP hand over your personal information .
You can look at an example subpoena , courtesy of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's online subpoena database .
Once the RIAA has your personal information , it is ready to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement .
The Key Privacy Weakness
With standard file sharing networks , the key weakness is that Internet addresses for everyone who is sharing files are readily available .
By sharing copyrighted files without permission , you may be breaking the law as it stands ( though the legality of copyrighted file sharing is still up for debate ) .
Returning to the phone analogy , using standard file sharing networks is much like making prank phone calls to someone who has caller ID --- it is risky and stupid .
With the wide use of caller ID , anyone who makes prank phone calls these days knows to dial " * 67 " before each call to hide his or her identity from the party being called ( a feature commonly called " caller ID blocking " ) .
The reason Internet addresses are available in standard file sharing networks is because they have to be : there is no way to make a direct connection to a node for a download without knowing that node 's Internet address .
Likewise , there is no way for a node to accept your download connection without also being able to determine your Internet address .
Data transmission on the Internet simply works this way , and there is nothing like " caller ID blocking " built into the Internet .
The only way to protect identities is to build something on top of the Internet to avoid direct connections between downloaders and uploaders , and thus avoid the necessity of sharing Internet addresses .
How MUTE Protects Your Privacy
The main way that MUTE protects your privacy is by avoiding direct connections between downloaders and uploaders .
Earlier , we described how search requests are sent around standard networks : you send a search to your neighbors , and they send it to their neighbors , who in turn send it to their neighbors , and so on .
By using the network to route search requests , these networks deliver a particular request to many nodes without making direct connections to any of them .
Of course , when it comes time to transfer a file , these networks use direct connections .
MUTE routes all messages , including search requests , search results , and file transfers , through the network of neighbor connections .
Thus , though you know the Internet addresses of your neighbors , you do not know the Internet address of the node you are downloading from .
A map of a MUTE network looks identical to the maps of standard networks shown earlier .
If you perform a search for " metallica mp3 " , you still might receive back three results , but these results look a little different :
My Address :
7213D...2DCA5 My File :
Metallica__Enter_Sandman.mp3
My Address :
7213D...2DCA5 My File :
Metallica__Unforgiven.mp3
My Address :
7213D...2DCA5 My File :
Metallica__Everywhere_I_Roam.mp3
Notice that the " My Address " portion of these responses no longer contains an Internet address .
The address shown , which is abbreviated with " ... " to fit in the table , is 7213D29781593840CF00CDD1E9A7A425AE16DCA5 .
This is a MUTE " virtual " address .
Each node in the MUTE network has a virtual address that it generates randomly each time it starts up .
Your neighbors in the network ( those nodes that actually do know your Internet address ) do not know what your virtual address is , so no one in the network can connect your virtual address to your Internet address , and thus no one can obtain your real - world identity .
MUTE uses virtual addresses to route messages through the network using an ant - inspired technique .
Thus , to download a metallica file , your node would send a download request through the network to 7213 D ... 2DCA5 , and your node would mark that request with your own virtual address , say D1E9A59380CD425AE16D40CF0CA57A7213D29781 .
The node sharing metallica would send the requested file back to you using your virtual address .
The entire transfer is routed through the network , which would look something like this :
Though the transfer is routed through a node owned by the RIAA , all the node sees are the virtual addresses of you and your file sharing partner .
The RIAA can send out a search for " mp3 " , and it will still get back 1000 results from you , but these results would look like this :
My Address :
D1E9A ...29781 My File :
Madonna__Holiday.mp3
My Address :
D1E9A ...29781 My File :
Fleetwood_Mac__Dreams.mp3
My Address :
D1E9A ...29781 My File :
Journey__Faithfully.mp3 .
.
. My Address :
D1E9A ...29781 My File :
Bonnie_Raitt__Something_To_Talk_About.mp3
My Address :
D1E9A ...29781 My File :
Poison__Unskinny_Bop.mp3
The RIAA can subpoena your ISP using your virtual address , but your ISP does not know who is using this address .
Thus , the RIAA 's standard tactic is useless in the MUTE network .
Another Possible Spy Tactic
Given that the standard search - and - subpoena tactic does not work in a MUTE network , the RIAA might try to target individual nodes with more intense monitoring .
For example , the RIAA might set up a computer on your local network that would listen to all of your Internet traffic ( this is similar to the FBI tapping your phone line ) .
If the RIAA listened to all of your traffic , they would see everything that you sent to each of your neighbors in the MUTE network , which would look something like this :
Notice that the RIAA now has you cornered : it can see that there are download requests coming out of your node , but no corresponding requests coming into your node .
In other words , you must be generating the requests and not simply passing on requests that you have received from your neighbors .
Using this tactic , the RIAA could determine the Internet address associated with your virtual address and then file a subpoena .
How does MUTE block this tactic ?
MUTE protects the contents of each neighbor connection in the network using military - grade encryption .
Though the RIAA might tap your network and see all of your Internet traffic , all MUTE messages would be unreadable .
Thus , the RIAA would not be able to corner you in the network or obtain an Internet address in connection with your virtual address .
Of course , your neighbors are able to decrypt the messages you send through them .
Thus , if the RIAA was able to hijack every single one of your neighbor nodes , it could again corner you and link your Internet address to your virtual address .
However , it is unlikely that the RIAA would be able to take over a large number of nodes in the network , and since you discover your neighbors in a somewhat randomized way , it is unlikely that every single one of your neighbors would be an RIAA node .
How easy is it to write an AJAX application in Haskell ?
Very easy indeed .
Here ’s a little example of an AJAX server that echoes JSON requests :
module Main where
import Data .
Maybe ( fromJust )
import JSON
import Network.NewCGI
jsonEcho :: CGI CGIResult
jsonEcho = do jsonString <- getInput " json "
setHeader " Content - type " " application/x-javascript "
output $ ( stringify .
fromJust . parse . fromJust ) jsonString
main = runCGI jsonEcho
To get this to compile you need the following haskell libraries : Fast Packed Strings ( needed by
haskell - cgi ) , XHTML combinators ) ( needed by haskell - cgi ) , haskell - cgi ) , and JSON.hs )
The resulting executable can be installed on any web server that supports cgi scripts .
For my tests I configured apache with cgi execution enabled in user directories .
You can download the little example app here .
The client code employs the json and prototype Javascript libraries .
The JSON.hs file included in this distribution is a slightly modified version of the one listed above which adds support for Ints .
THE recently reopened Louis Vuitton store on the Champs Elysées is a deliberate exercise in democratic luxury .
On its new , opulent art deco terraces , elegant French ladies of a certain age — the epitome of the traditional consumer of luxury fashion — rub padded shoulders with jeans - and - tee - shirt sporting younger women who could be their daughters , or , just as easily , rap singers or a gaggle of British working - class hen - weekenders .
What traditional buyers of luxury make of their nouveau co-consumers they are , of course , too civilised to say .
But it seems unlikely that they consider Louis Vuitton 's still - exquisite handbags , shoes and other indulgences to be quite as exclusive as before .
If they continue to shop there — and the store 's owner , LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton , thinks it can extend its brand to a broader market without losing its existing customers — it may no longer be because its products are a signal of exalted social status .
In this respect , LVMH 's goods are by no means unique .
Products and services that were once the preserve of a very wealthy few — from designer handbags to fast cars , bespoke tailoring and domestic servants — are increasingly becoming accessible , if not to everyone , then certainly to millions of people around the world .
This may appall killjoy economists such as Robert Frank , the author a few years ago of a book condemning “ Luxury Fever ” in this new “ era of excess ” .
But it is arguably even more upsetting to those super - rich folk who have long been able to afford luxury , and may in one crucial respect even regard it as a necessity .
As Thorstein Veblen noted over a century ago in “ The Theory of the Leisure Class ” — the book in which he coined the phrase “ conspicuous consumption ” — spending lavishly on expensive but essentially wasteful goods and services is “ evidence of wealth ” and the “ failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit . ”
But in the 21st century , “ being a conspicuous consumer is getting harder and harder ” , says James Lawson of Ledbury Research , a firm that advises luxury businesses on market trends .
What does a billionaire have to do to get noticed nowadays ?
Luxury for the people
A stone 's throw from the Louis Vuitton store , the classical grandeur of the five - star Four Seasons George V hotel was the perfect Old World venue for the World Luxury Congress in October .
But all the talk at the gathering was of the potentially lucrative opportunities presented by new consumers of luxury , in rich and emerging economies alike .
Being a millionaire , for instance , is becoming commonplace .
In 2004 there were 8.3 m households worldwide with assets of at least $ 1 m , up by 7 % on a year earlier , according to the latest annual survey by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini .
The newly wealthy are often desperate to affirm their status by conspicuously consuming the favoured brands of the already rich .
In developed countries this can be seen , in its extreme form , in the rise of “ Bling ” — jewellery , diamonds and other luxuries sported initially by rappers — and Britain 's unsophisticated Burberry - loving “ chavs ” .
( Burberry is considered unusually successful at tapping a broader market .
But even it now understands that not every new customer is desirable : in January it withdrew its distinctive checked baseball caps because of their popularity with chavs . )
The number of luxury buyers in the developed world is also being swelled by two other trends .
First , consumers are increasingly adopting a “ trading up , trading down ” shopping strategy .
Many traditional mid-market shoppers are abandoning middle - of - the - range products for a mix of lots of extremely cheap goods and a few genuine luxuries that they would once have thought out of their price league .
Alongside this “ selective extravagance ” is the growth of “ fractional ownership ” : time - shares in luxury goods and services formerly available only to those paying full price .
Fractional ownership first got noticed when firms such as NetJets started selling access to private jets .
It has since spread to luxury resorts , fast cars and much more .
In America , From Bags to Riches — “ better bags , better value ” — lets less - well - off people rent designer handbags .
In Britain , Damon Hill , a former racing driver , has launched P1 International .
A £ 2,500 ( $ 4,300 ) joining fee , plus annual membership of £ 13,750 , buys around 50 - 70 driving days a year in cars ranging from a Range Rover Sport to a Bentley or a Ferrari .
AIM
As a result , “ the price of entry for much of what traditionally was available to the top 0.001 % is now far lower ” , says Mr Lawson , who notes the sorry implications for a would - be conspicuous consumer : “ How do I know if the guy who drives past me in a Ferrari owns it or is just renting it for the weekend ? ”
Demand for luxury is also soaring from emerging economies such as Russia , India , Brazil and China .
Antoine Colonna , an analyst at Merrill Lynch , estimates that last year Chinese consumers already accounted for 11 % of the worldwide revenues of luxury - goods firms , with most of their buying done outside mainland China .
He forecasts that by 2014 , they will have overtaken both American and Japanese consumers , becoming the world 's leading luxury shoppers , yielding 24 % of global revenues .
These emerging consumers have a big appetite for the top luxury brands — and the owners of those brands are increasingly keen to oblige .
Russia is producing today 's most determinedly conspicuous consumers .
Roman Abramovich , the best - known oligarch not in jail , has conspicuously set new standards in buying mansions , ski resorts and soccer teams .
Veblen revisited
For the already rich , strategies such as splashing out on ever bigger houses , longer yachts or getting special treatment from luxury - goods firms does not contribute much marginal conspicuousness .
Meanwhile , the list of new ways to get noticed by the masses is shrinking fast .
Even space tourism — impressive in 2001 , when Dennis Tito paid Russia $ 20 m to visit the International Space Station — will soon be humdrum .
As it gets ever harder to consume conspicuously , are some traditional luxury consumers giving up trying ?
According to Virginia Postrel , author of “ The Substance of Style ” , conspicuous consumption is much more important when people are not far from being poor , as in today 's emerging economies .
In developed countries , in particular , “ status is always there , but the shift in the balance is towards enjoyment ” .
For instance , the first thing the newly super - rich tend to buy is a private plane .
But that , she says , is “ not so much about distinguishing themselves from the masses as not being stuck with them in a security line ” .
Rex
In his new book , “ Hypermodern Times ” , Gilles Lipovetsky , the favourite philosopher of LVMH 's boss , Bernard Arnaud , has coined the term “ hyperconsumption ” .
This is consumption which pervades ever more spheres of life and which encourages people to consume for their own pleasure rather than to enhance their social status .
H.L. Mencken made the same point more crisply in a critique of Veblen in 1919 : “ Do I prefer kissing a pretty girl to kissing a charwoman because even a janitor may kiss a charwoman — or because the pretty girl looks better , smells better and kisses better ? ”
Yet rather than abandoning status anxiety , the way the rich seek to display status may simply be getting more complex .
As inequality grows again in rich countries , some of the very rich worry about consumption that is so conspicuous to the masses that it provokes them to try to take their wealth away .
Some car - industry experts blame weak sales of the latest luxury limousines on this fear .
As well as traditional conspicuous consumption and “ self - treating ” , Ledbury Research identifies two other motives that are driving buying by the rich : connoisseurship and being an “ early adopter ” .
Both are arguably consumption that is conspicuous only to those you really want to impress .
Connoisseurs are people whom their friends respect for their deep knowledge of , say , fine wine or handmade Swiss watches .
Early adopters are those who are first with a new technology .
Silicon Valley millionaires currently impress their friends by buying an amphibian vehicle to avoid the commuter traffic on the Bay Bridge .
Several millionaires have already paid $ 50,000 a go to clone their pet cat .
In America , at least , says Marian Salzman , a leading trendspotter , the focus of conspicuous consumption is increasingly on getting your children into the best schools and universities .
Harvard may be today 's ultimate luxury good .
Getting into the right clubs is also as important a social statement as ever .
America 's young wealthy may currently be seen at the Core Club in New York : membership is by invitation only , with a joining fee of $ 55,000 plus annual dues of $ 12,000 .
But perhaps the true symbol of exalted status in the era of mass luxury is conspicuous non-consumption .
This is not just the growing tendency of the very rich to dress scruffily and drive beaten - up cars , as described by David Brooks in “ Bobos in Paradise ” .
It is showing that you have more money than you know how to spend .
So , for example , philanthropy is increasingly fashionable , and multi-billion - dollar endowments such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are certainly conspicuous .
However , since the new philanthropists are keen to demonstrate that their giving produces results , this does not quite meet Veblen 's threshold of being a complete waste of money .
So the laurels surely go to those who are so wealthy that they are willing to buy adverts encouraging the state to tax them .
Kudos , then , to those conspicuously non-consuming wealthy American opponents of recent efforts to abolish estate taxes : George Soros , Bill Gates senior ( the father of the world 's richest man ) and Warren Buffett .
DALLAS , Nov. 15 - Two kidney dialysis patients from Argentina have received the world 's first blood vessels grown in a laboratory dish from snippets of their own skin , a technique that doctors hope will someday offer a new source of arteries and veins for diabetics and other patients .
Scientists from Cytograft Tissue Engineering Inc. , a small biotechnology company in Novato , Calif. , reported the tissue - engineering advance on Tuesday at the annual conference of the American Heart Association here .
Dr. Elizabeth Nabel , director of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , which has spent $ 2.5 million to finance the company 's work , called the new method " extraordinarily promising . "
Because it uses the patient 's own tissue , the technique steers clears of the political and ethical debate surrounding embryonic stem cells .
Humans can threaten species with extinction in many ways , including overfishing , pollution and deforestation .
Now a pair of studies points to a new danger to the world 's biodiversity : humans may be blocking new species from evolving .
New species evolve when old species split apart .
Animals living on a peninsula might become cut off from the mainland by rising sea levels , for example .
They would adapt to life on the island and acquire mutations not shared by the rest of their species .
If the sea level should drop and the animals could mix together again , the mutations might make it less likely that the two populations could interbreed .
They would be on their way to becoming separate species .
A few places provide scientists with a good view of these forces at work .
In western Canada , many lakes formed when the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age 11,000 years ago .
When going to college many years ago , I decided to challenge myself by setting a goal to see if I could graduate in only three semesters , taking the same classes that people would normally take over a four - year period .
This article explains in detail all the time management techniques I used to successfully pull this off .
In order to accomplish this goal , I determined I ’d have to take 30 - 40 units per semester , when the average student took 12 - 15 units .
It became immediately obvious that I ’d have to manage my time extremely well if I wanted to pull this off .
I began reading everything I could find on time management and putting what I learned into practice .
I accomplished my goal by graduating with two Bachelor of Science degrees ( computer science and mathematics ) in just three semesters without attending summer school .
I slept seven to eight hours a night , took care of my routine chores ( shopping , cooking , etc ) , had a social life , and exercised for 30 minutes every morning .
In my final semester , I even held a full time job ( 40 hours a week ) as a game programmer and served as the Vice Chair of the local Association of Computing Machinery ( ACM ) chapter while taking 37 units of mostly senior - level computer science and math courses .
My classmates would add up all the hours they expected each task to take and concluded that my weeks must have consisted of about 250 hours .
I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and also received a special award given to the top computer science student each year .
One of my professors later told me that they had an easy time selecting the award recipient once it became clear to them what I was doing .
I was n’t considered a gifted child , and this was the first time I had ever done anything like this .
I did n’t have any personal mentors helping me , I did n’t know of anyone who ’d done anything like this before , and I ca n’t recall a single person encouraging me to do it .
In fact , most people were highly discouraging of the idea when I told them about it .
This was simply something I decided to do for myself .
If you want a better understanding of where I was at this time in my life and why I decided to attempt such a crazy thing , you might enjoy reading The Meaning of Life : Intro , which includes the full background story and more details about my motivation for doing this .
It took a lot of convincing to get the computer science department chair to approve my extra units every semester , and my classmates often assumed I was either cheating or that I had a twin or that I was just mentally unstable ( I get accused of that last one pretty much every week , so maybe there ’s some truth to it ) .
Most of the time I kept quiet about what I was doing , but if someone asked me how many units I was taking , I did n’t deny it .
I was perhaps the only student at the university with a two - page class schedule , so it was easy to prove I was telling the truth if anyone pressed me , but rarely did I ever do so .
I did n’t tell you this story to impress you but rather to make you curious as to how I did it .
I pulled this off by applying time management concepts that most people simply did n’t know but that were readily available in books and audio programs at the time ( 1992 -93 ) .
The time management habits I learned in college have served me very well in building my business , so I want to share them with you in the hopes that you ’ll find them equally valuable .
They allowed me to shave years off my schooling while also giving me about $ 30,000 to start my business ( all earned in my final semester as a game programmer , mostly from royalties ) .
Without further ado , here ’s the best of what I ’ve learned about mastering time management :
Clarity Is Key
The first step is to know exactly what you want .
In a Tae Kwon
Do studio where I used to train , there ’s a huge sign on the wall that says , “ Your goal is to become a black belt . ”
This helps remind each student why s/he is going through such difficult training .
When you work for yourself , it ’s easy to spend a whole day at your desk and accomplish nothing of value .
This almost always happens when you are n’t really clear about what it is you ’re trying to do .
In the moments when you regain your awareness , ask yourself , “ What exactly is it that I ’m trying to accomplish here ? ”
You must know your destination with as much clarity as possible .
Make your goals specific , and put them in writing .
Your goals must be so clear that it would be possible for a stranger to look at your situation objectively and give you an absolute “ yes ” or “ no ” response as to whether you ’ve accomplished each goal or not .
If you cannot define your destination precisely , how will you know when you ’ve arrived ?
The key period I ’ve found useful for defining and working on specific goals is ninety days , or the length of one season .
In that period of time , you can make dramatic and measurable changes if you set crystal clear goals .
Take a moment to stop and write down a snapshot description of how you want your life to be ninety days from now .
What will your monthly income be ?
How much will you weigh ?
Who will your friends be ?
Where will you be in your career ?
What will your relationship be like ?
What will your web site look like ?
Be specific .
Absolute clarity will give you the edge that will keep you on course .
Just as an airplane on autopilot must make constant corrections to stay on course , you must periodically retarget your goals .
Reconnect with your clear , written goals by re-reading them every morning .
Post them on your walls , especially your financial goals .
Years ago ( during the mid-90s ) , I went around my apartment putting up signs in every room that said “ $ 5,000 / month . ”
That was my monthly business income goal at the time .
Because I knew exactly what I wanted , I achieved that goal within a few weeks .
I continued setting specific income goals , even amidst occasional setbacks , and I found this process very effective .
It was n’t just that it helped me focus on what I wanted — perhaps even more important is that it made it easy for me to disregard those things that were n’t on the path to my goal .
For example , if you set a goal to earn $ 10,000 / month , this can help you stop doing those things that will only earn you $ 5000 / month .
If you are n’t yet at the point of clarity , then make that your first goal .
It ’s a big waste of time to go through life being unclear about what you want .
Most people wallow way too long in the state of “ I do n’t know what to do . ”
They wait for some external force to provide them with clarity , never realizing that clarity is self - created .
The universe is waiting on you , not the other way around , and it ’s going to keep waiting until you finally make up your mind .
Waiting for clarity is like being a sculptor staring at a piece of marble , waiting for the statue within to cast off the unneeded pieces .
Do not wait for clarity to spontaneously materialize — grab a chisel and get busy !
Be Flexible
There ’s a key difference between knowing your destination and knowing the path you will take to get there .
A typical commercial airplane is off course 90 % of the time , yet it almost always arrives at its destination because it knows exactly where it ’s going and makes constant corrections along the way .
You can not know the exact path to your goal in advance .
I believe that the real purpose of planning is simply so that you remain convinced that a possible path exists .
We ’ve all heard the statistic that 80 % of new businesses fail in their first five years , but a far more interesting statistic is that nearly all of the businesses that succeeded did not do so in the original way they had intended .
If you look at successful businesses that started with business plans , you will commonly find that their original plans failed miserably and that they only succeeded by trying something else .
It is said that no business plan survives contact with the marketplace .
I like to generalize this to say that no plan survives contact with the real world .
Renowned author and business consultant Stephen Covey often uses the expression , “ integrity in the moment of choice . ”
What that means is that you should not follow your plans blindly without conscious awareness of your goals .
For instance , let ’s say you ’re following your plans nicely — so far so good — and then an unforeseen opportunity arises .
Do you stick to your original plan , thereby missing the opportunity , or do you stop and go after the opportunity , thereby throwing yourself off schedule ?
This is where you have to stop and reconnect with your goals to decide which is the better course .
No plan should be followed blindly .
As soon as you gain new knowledge that could invalidate the plan , you must exercise integrity in the moment of choice .
Sometimes you can reach your goals faster by taking advantage of shortcuts that arise unexpectedly .
Other times you should stick to your original plans and avoid minor distractions that would take you further from your goals .
Be tight on your goals but flexible on your plans .
I believe that having a clear goal is far more important than having a clear plan .
In school I was very clear about my end goal — graduate college in only three semesters — but my plans were in a constant state of flux .
Every day I would be informed of new assignments , projects , or tests , and I had to adapt to this ever - changing sea of activity .
If I tried to make a long - term plan for each semester , it would have been rendered useless within 24 hours .
Use Single Handling
Instead of using some elaborate organizing system , I stuck with a very basic pen and paper to - do list .
My only organizing tool was a notepad where I wrote down all my assignments and their deadlines .
I did n’t worry about doing any advance scheduling or prioritizing .
I would simply scan the list to select the most pressing item which fit the time I had available .
Then I ’d complete it , and cross it off the list .
If I had a 10 - hour term paper to write , I would do the whole thing at once instead of breaking it into smaller tasks .
I ’d usually do large projects on weekends .
I ’d go to the library in the morning , do the necessary research , and then go back to my dorm room and continue working until the final text was rolling off my printer .
If I needed to take a break , I would take a break .
It did n’t matter how big the project was supposed to be or how many weeks the professor allowed for it .
Once I began an assignment , I would stay with it until it was 100 % complete and ready to be turned in .
This simple practice saved me a significant amount of time .
First , it allowed me to concentrate deeply on each assignment and to work very efficiently while I worked .
A lot of time is lost in task switching because you have to re-load the context for each new task .
Single handling minimizes time lost in task switching .
In fact , when possible I would batch up my assignments within a certain subject area and then do them all at once before switching subjects .
So I ’d do all my math homework in a row until it was all done .
Then I ’d do all my programming assignments .
Then I ’d do my general education homework .
In this manner I would put my brain into math - mode , programming - mode , writing - mode , or art - mode and remain in that single mode for as long as possible .
Secondly , I believe this habit helped me remain relaxed and unstressed because my mind was n’t cluttered with so many to - do items .
It was always just one thing at a time .
I could forget about anything that was outside the current context .
Failure Is Your Friend
Most people seem to have an innate fear of failure , but failure is really your best friend .
People who succeed also fail a great deal because they make a lot of attempts .
The great baseball player Babe Ruth held the homerun record and the strikeout record at the same time .
Those who have the most successes also have the most failures .
There is nothing wrong or shameful in failing .
The only regret lies in never making the attempt .
So do n’t be afraid to experiment in your attempts to increase productivity .
Sometimes the quickest way to find out if something will work is to jump right in and do it .
You can always make adjustments along the way .
It ’s the ready - fire - aim approach , and surprisingly , it works a lot better than the more common ready - aim - fire approach .
The reason is that after you ’ve “ fired ” once , you have some actual data with which to adjust your aim .
Too many people get bogged down in planning and thinking and never get to the point of action .
How many potentially great ideas have you passed up because you got stuck in the state of analysis paralysis ( i.e. ready - aim - aim - aim - aim - aim … ) ?
During college I tried a lot of crazy ideas that I thought might save me time .
I continued reading time management material and applying what I learned , but I also devised some original ideas .
Most of my own ideas were flops , but some of them worked .
I was willing to fail again and again for the off chance I might stumble upon something that gave me an extra boost .
Understand that failure is not the opposite of success .
Failure is an essential part of success .
Once you succeed , no one will remember your failures anyway .
Microsoft was n’t Bill Gates ’ and Paul Allen ’s first business venture .
Who remembers that their original Traf - o - Data business was a flop ?
The actor Jim Carey was booed off many a stage while a young comedian .
We have electric light bulbs because Thomas Edison refused to give up even after 10,000 failed experiments .
If the word “ failure ” is anathema to you , then reframe it :
You either succeed , or you have a learning experience .
Letting go of the fear of failure will serve you well .
If you ’re excited about achieving a particular goal , but you ’re afraid you might not be able to pull it off , jump on it and do it anyway .
Even if you fail in your attempt , you ’ll learn something valuable and can make a better attempt next time .
If you look at people who are successful in business today , you will commonly see that many of them had a string of dismal failures before finally hitting on something that worked , myself included .
And I think most of these people will agree that those early failure experiences were an essential contributing factor in their future successes .
My advice to anyone starting a new business is to begin pumping out products or devising services and do n’t worry much about whether they ’ll be hits .
They probably wo n’t be .
But you ’ll learn a lot more by doing than you ever will by thinking .
Do It Now !
W. Clement Stone , who built an insurance empire worth hundreds of millions dollars , would make all his employees recite the phrase , “ Do it now ! ” again and again at the start of each workday .
Whenever you feel the tendency towards laziness taking over and you remember something you should be doing , stop and say out loud , “ Do it now !
Do it now !
Do it now ! ” I often set this text as my screensaver .
There is a tremendous cost in putting things off because you will mentally revisit them again and again , which can add up to an enormous amount of wasted time .
Thinking and planning are important , but action is far more important .
You do n’t get paid for your thoughts and plans — you only get paid for your results .
When in doubt , act boldly , as if it were impossible to fail .
In essence , it is .
It is absolutely imperative that you develop the habit of making decisions as soon as possible .
I use a 60 - second rule for almost every decision I have to make , no matter how big or important .
Once I have all the data to make a decision , I start a timer and give myself only 60 seconds to make a firm decision .
I ’ll even flip a coin if I have to .
When I was in college , I could n’t afford to waste time thinking about assignments or worrying about when to do them .
I simply picked one and went to work on it .
And today when I need to decide which article to write next , I just pick a topic and begin writing .
I believe this is why I never experience writer ’s block .
Writer ’s block means you ’re stuck in the state of thinking about what to write instead of actually writing .
I do n’t waste time thinking about writing because I ’m too busy writing .
This is probably why I ’ve been able to write hundreds of original articles very easily .
Every article I write spawns ideas for at least two more , so my ideas list only increases over time .
I cannot imagine ever running out of original content .
Too often people delay making decisions when there is no advantage to be found in that delay .
Usually delaying a decision will only have negative consequences , so even if you ’re faced with ambiguity , just bite the bullet and make a decision .
If it turns out to be the wrong one , you ’ll know it soon enough .
Many people probably spend more than 60 seconds just deciding what they ’ll eat for dinner .
If I ca n’t decide what to eat , I just grab an apple or a couple bananas and start eating , and sometimes I ’m full of fruit before I figure out what I really would like to eat .
So my brain knows that if it wants something other than fruit , it had better decide quickly .
If you can speed up the pace of making decisions , you can spend the rest of your time on action .
One study showed that the best managers in the world tend to have an extremely high tolerance for ambiguity .
In other words , they are able to act boldly on partial and / or conflicting data .
Many industries today have accelerated to such a rapid pace that by the time you have perfect data with which to make any decision , the opportunity is probably long gone .
Where you have no data to fall back on , rely on your own personal experience and intuition .
If a decision can be made right away , make the decision as soon as it comes up .
If you ca n’t make a decision right away , set aside a time where you will consider the options and make the decision .
Pour the bulk of your time into action , not deciding .
The state of indecision is a major time waster .
Do n’t spend more than 60 seconds in that state if you can avoid it .
Make a firm , immediate decision , and move from uncertainty to certainty to action .
Let the world tell you when you ’re wrong , and you ’ll soon build enough experience to make accurate , intelligent decisions .
Triage Ruthlessly
Get rid of everything that wastes your time .
Use the trash can liberally .
Apply the rule , “ When in doubt , throw it out . ”
Cancel useless magazine subscriptions .
If you have a magazine that is more than two months old and you still have n’t read it , throw it away ; it ’s probably not worth reading .
Realize that nothing is free if it costs you time .
Before you sign up for any new free service or subscription , ask how much it will cost you in terms of time .
Every activity has an opportunity cost .
Ask , “ Is this activity worth what I am sacrificing for it ? ”
In college I was downright brutal when it came to triage .
I once told a professor that I decided not to do one of his assigned computer science projects because I felt it was n’t a good use of my time .
The project required about 10 - 20 hours of tedious gruntwork that was n’t going to teach me anything I did n’t already know .
Also , this project was only worth 10 % of my grade in that class , and since I was previously acing the class anyway , the only real negative consequence would be that I ’d end up with an A - in the course instead of an A .
I told the professor I felt that was a fair trade - off and that I would accept the A - .
I did n’t try to negotiate with him for special treatment .
So my official grade in the class was an A- , but I personally gave myself an A + for putting those 10 - 20 hours to much better use .
Ask yourself this question : “ Would I have ever gotten started with this project , relationship , career , etc. if I had to do it all over again , knowing what I now know ? ”
If your answer is no , then get out as soon as possible .
This is called zero - based thinking .
I know a lot of people that have a limiting belief that says , “ Always finish what you start . ”
They spend years climbing ladders only to realize when they reach the top that the ladder was leaning against the wrong building .
Remember that failure is your friend .
So if a certain decision you ’ve made in the past is no longer producing results that serve you , then be ruthless and dump it , so you can move onto something better .
There is no honor in dedicating your life to the pursuit of a goal which no longer inspires you .
This is another situation where you must practice integrity in the moment of choice .
You must constantly re-assess your present situation to accurately decide what to do next .
Whatever you ’ve decided in the past is largely irrelevant if you would not renew that decision today .
Identify and Recover Wasted Time
Instead of watching a one - hour TV show , tape it and watch it in 45 minutes by fast - forwarding through the commercials .
Do n’t spend a half hour typing a lengthy email when you could accomplish the same thing with a 10 - minute phone call .
Batch your errands together and do them all at once .
During the summer between my second and third semesters , I found an apartment across the street from campus that was slightly closer to the engineering building than my on - campus dorm room .
So I moved out of the dorms and into that apartment , which saved me some walking / biking time every day .
I was also moving from a two - bedroom dorm which I shared with two roommates into a smaller single - person studio apartment .
This new apartment was much more efficient .
For example , I could work on programming assignments while cooking dinner because my desk was only a few steps from the stove .
Trying to cut out time - wasting habits is a common starting point for people who desire to become more efficient , but I think this is a mistake .
Optimizing your personal habits should only come later .
Clarity of purpose must come first .
If you do n’t have clarity , then your attempts to install more efficient habits and to break inefficient habits will only fizzle .
You wo n’t have a strong enough reason to put your time to good use , so it will be easy to quit when things get tough .
You need a big , attractive goal to stay motivated .
The reason to shave 15 minutes off a task is that you ’re overflowing with motivation to put that 15 minutes to better use .
For example , you might have a career you sort of like , but most likely it ’s not so compelling that you ’ll care enough about saving an extra 15 minutes here and there , even if your total savings might amount to a few hours each day .
But if you ’ve taken the time to develop a sense of purpose that reaches deep into your soul , you ’ll be automatically motivated to put your time to better use .
If you get the highest level of your life in order ( purpose , meaning , spiritual beliefs ) , the lower levels will tend to self - optimize ( habits , practices , actions ) .
Apply the 80 - 20 Rule
Also known as the Pareto Principle , the 80 - 20 rule states that 20 % of a task ’s effort accounts for 80 % of the value of that task .
This also means that 80 % of a task only yields 20 % of the value of that task .
In college I was ruthless in my application of this principle .
Some weeks I ditched as many as 40 % of my classes because sitting through a lecture was often not the most effective way for me to learn .
And I already noted that I would simply refuse to do an assignment if I determined it was not worth my time .
There was one math class that I only showed up to twice because I could learn from the text book much more quickly than from the lectures .
I only showed up for the midterm and final .
I would pop my head in at the beginning of each class to drop off my homework and then again at the end of each class to write down the next assignment .
I actually got the highest grade in that class , but the teacher probably had no idea who I was .
The other students were playing by the rules , not realizing they were free to make their own rules .
Find out what parts of your life belong in the crucial 20 % , and focus your efforts there .
Be absolutely ruthless in refusing to spend time where it simply cannot give you optimal results .
Invest your time where it has the potential to pay off big .
Guard Thy Time
To work effectively you need uninterrupted blocks of time in which you can complete meaningful work .
When you know for certain that you wo n’t be interrupted , your productivity is much , much higher .
When you sit down to work on a particularly intense task , dedicate blocks of time to the task during which you will not do anything else .
I ’ve found that a minimum of 90 minutes is ideal for a single block .
You may need to negotiate with the other people in your life to create these uninterrupted blocks of time .
If necessary , warn others in advance not to interrupt you for a certain period of time .
Threaten them with acts of violence if you must .
In school I would lock my bedroom door when I needed to work , so my roommates would know not to disturb me .
While each individual bedroom in the two - bedroom dorm suites was designed for two people ( four people per suite ) , I paid a bit extra to have a bedroom all to myself .
This way I always had my own private room to work .
When I had time to be social , I ’d leave the door open , sometimes playing computer games with one of my roommates .
If you happen to work in a high interruption environment that ’s negatively affecting your productivity , change that environment at all costs .
Some people have told me that giving their boss a copy of this article helped convince him / her to take steps to reduce unnecessary interruptions .
While for some people it ’s helpful to block off a specific period of time for a task , I find that I work best with long , open - ended stretches of uninterrupted time .
I ’ll often allocate a starting time for a task but usually not a specific finishing time .
Whenever possible I just allow myself to stick with a task as long as I can , until I eventually succumb to hunger or other bodily needs .
I will frequently work 6 + hours straight on a project without taking a break .
While frequent breaks are often recommended to increase productivity , I feel that suggestion may be an artifact of industrial age research on poorly motivated workers and not as applicable to high - motivation , purpose - driven creative work .
I find it ’s best for me to maintain momentum until I can barely continue instead of chopping a task into smaller chunks where there ’s a risk of succumbing to distractions along the way .
The state of flow , where you are totally absorbed in a task and lose all sense of time , takes about 15 minutes to enter .
Every time you get interrupted , it can take you another 15 minutes to get back to that state .
Once you enter the state of flow , guard it with your life .
That is the state in which you will go through enormous amounts of work and experience total connection with the task .
When I ’m in this state , I have no sense of past or future .
I simply feel like I ’m one with my work .
While sometimes I suffer from the problem of the task expanding to fill the allotted time ( aka Parkinson ’s Law ) , I often find that it ’s worth the risk .
For example , when I do optimization work on my web site , I ’ll frequently think of new optimization ideas while I work , and I ’ll usually go ahead and implement those new ideas immediately .
I find it more efficient to act on those ideas at the moment of conception instead of scheduling them to be done at a later time .
Work All the Time You Work
During one of these sacred time blocks , do nothing but the activity that ’s right in front of you .
Do n’t check email or online forums or do web surfing .
If you have this temptation , then unplug your Internet connection while you work .
Turn off your phone , or simply refuse to answer it .
Go to the bathroom before you start , and make sure you wo n’t get hungry for a while .
Do n’t get out of your chair at all .
Do n’t talk to anyone during this time .
Decide what it is you should be doing , and then do nothing but that .
If you happen to manage others , periodically ask them what their # 1 task is , and make sure they ’re doing nothing but that .
If you see someone answering email , then it should be the most important thing for that person to be doing at that particular time .
If not , then relatively speaking , that person is just wasting time .
If you need a break , then take a real break and do nothing else .
Do n’t semi - work during a break if you feel you need rest and restoration .
Checking email or web surfing is not a break .
When you take a break , close your eyes and do some deep breathing , listen to relaxing music and zone out for a while , take a 20 - minute nap , or eat some fresh fruit .
Rest until you feel capable of doing productive work again .
When you need rest , rest .
When you should be working , work .
Work with either 100 % concentration , or do n’t work at all .
It ’s perfectly fine to take as much down time as you want .
Just do n’t allow your down time to creep into your work time .
Multitask
The amount of new knowledge in certain fields is increasing so rapidly that everything you know about your line of work is probably becoming obsolete .
The only solution is to keep absorbing new knowledge as rapidly as possible .
Many of the skills I use in my business today did n’t even exist five years ago .
The best way I know to keep up is to multitask whenever possible by reading and listening to audio programs .
When watching TV , read a computer magazine during commercials .
If you ’re a male , read while shaving .
I use an electric shaver and read during the 2 - 3 minutes it takes me to shave each day .
This allows me to get through about two extra articles a week — that ’s 100 extra articles a year .
This habit is really easy to start .
Just grab a couple magazines , or print out some articles you would n’t otherwise have time to read , and put them in your bathroom .
Whenever you go out , carry at least one folded up article with you .
If you ever have to wait in line , such as at the post office or the grocery store , pull out the article and read it .
You will be amazed at how much extra knowledge you can absorb just by reading during other non-mental activities .
Listen to educational audio programs whenever you can .
When you drive your car , always be listening to an audio program .
One of the best ways to save time is to learn directly from people who already have the skills you want to master .
Audio programs often contain more practical material than what you would learn by taking classes at a university .
Whereas people with degrees in marketing or business have been taught by college professors , you can learn about these subjects from millionaires and billionaires who ’ve learned what works in the real world .
Multitasking was perhaps the most important low - level skill that allowed me to go through college in three semesters .
My average weekday involved about seven or eight hours of classes .
But on Tuesdays during my final semester , I had classes back to back from 9 am until 10 pm .
Because I was taking about a dozen classes each semester , I would have several tests and projects due just about every week .
I had no time to study outside of class because most of that time was used for my job .
So I simply had to learn everything the first time it came up .
If a teacher wrote out something on the board , I would memorize it then and there ; I could n’t afford to learn things later and risk falling behind .
During my slower classes , I would do homework , work out algorithms for my programming job , or refine my schedule .
You can probably find numerous opportunities for multitasking .
Whenever you do something physical , such as driving , cooking , shopping , or walking , keep your mind going by listening to audio tapes or reading .
The idea of multitasking may seem to contradict the previous piece of advice to work all the time you work .
But whereas the previous tip refers to high intensity work where you must concentrate all your mental resources in order to do the best job you can , this tip addresses low intensity work where you have plenty of capacity to do other things at the same time , like standing in line , cooking dinner , flying on a plane , or walking from point A to point B . Multitasking should n’t be used where it will significantly degrade your performance on a crucial task , but it should be intelligently used to take advantage of excess capacity .
Take real breaks when you need them , but do n’t waste time in a state of partial effort .
It ’s more efficient to cycle between working flat out and then resting completely .
Multitasking allows you to take your productivity to a new level .
You might think it would be draining , but many people find it has the opposite effect .
For me it was tremendously energizing to be getting so much done .
The harder you work , the greater your capacity for work , and the more restorative your rest will be .
Experiment
Everyone is different , so what works for you may well be different than what works for everyone else .
You may work best in the morning or late at night .
Take advantage of your own strengths , and find ways to compensate for your weaknesses .
Experiment with listening to music while you work .
I find that classical and new age music , especially Mozart , is terrific for web development work .
But for most routine tasks , listening to fast - paced techno / trance music helps me work a lot faster .
I do n’t exactly know why , but I ’m twice as productive when listening to really fast music as compared to listening to no music .
On the other hand , music with vocals is detrimental to my productivity because it ’s too distracting .
And when I really need to focus deeply , I ’ll listen to no music at all .
Try a simple experiment for yourself , and see if certain forms of music can increase your productivity .
For me the difference was dramatic .
Whenever you come up with a wacky new idea for increasing your productivity , test it and see what effect it has .
Do n’t dismiss any idea unless you ’ve actually tried it .
Partial successes are more common than complete failures , so each new experiment will help you refine your time management practices .
Even the ongoing practice of conducting experiments will help condition you to be more productive .
Cultivate Your Enthusiasm
The word “ enthusiasm ” comes from the Greek entheos , which means literally , “ the god within . ” I really like that definition .
I doubt it ’s possible to master the art of time management if you are n’t gushingly enthusiastic about what you ’re going to do with your time .
Go after what really inspires you .
Do n’t chase money .
Chase your passion .
If you are n’t enthusiastic about your work , then you ’re wasting your life .
Switch to something else .
Consider a new career altogether .
Do n’t beat yourself up if your current career has become stale .
Remember that failure is your friend .
Listen to that god within you , and switch to something that excites you once again .
The worst waste of time is doing something that does n’t make you happy .
Your work should serve your life , not the other way around .
If you ’re like most people , you can get yourself motivated every once in a while , but then you get caught up and sink back down to a lower level of productivity , and you find it hard to continue with a project .
How easy is it to start a new project when your motivation level is high ?
And how difficult is it to continue once your enthusiasm fades ?
Since most people are negative to one degree or another , you ’ll naturally lose your positive charge over time unless you actively cultivate your enthusiasm as a resource .
I do n’t believe in pushing myself to do something I really do n’t want to do .
If I ’m not motivated , then getting myself to sit down and work productively is nearly impossible , and the work is almost painful .
When you ’re highly motivated though , work feels like play .
While in college I could not afford to let my enthusiasm fade , or I ’d be dead .
I quickly learned that I needed to make a conscious effort to reinforce my enthusiasm on a daily basis .
I always had my Walkman cassette player with me ( there were no portable MP3 players back then ) , and while walking from one class to the next , I would listen to time management and motivational tapes .
I also listened to them while jogging every morning .
I kept my motivation level high by reinforcing my enthusiasm almost hourly .
Even though I was being told by others that I would surely fail , these tapes were the stronger influence because I never went more than a few hours without plugging back in .
If your enthusiasm level is high , you can work so much more productively and even enjoy the normally tedious parts of your work .
I ’ve always found that whenever I want to take my business to a new level , I must take my thoughts to a new level first .
When your thinking changes , then your actions will change , and your results will follow .
Unless you ’re a naturally hyper person , your enthusiasm is going to need daily reinforcement .
I recommend either listening to motivational tapes or reading inspiring books or articles for at least fifteen minutes every day .
Whenever I ’ve stopped doing this , I ’ve found that self - doubt always returns , and my productivity drops off .
It ’s truly amazing how constantly feeding your mind with positive material can maintain your enthusiasm indefinitely .
And if you multitask , you can get this benefit without investing any extra time into it .
Eat and Exercise for Optimal Energy
During the summer before my last semester in college ( 1993 ) , I became a lacto - ovo vegetarian , and I noticed a decent boost in my energy and especially in my ability to concentrate .
Four years later ( 1997 ) I became a complete vegan ( no animal products at all ) , and this yielded an even bigger boost .
For details on why I made this change , see the article Why Vegan ?
What you eat can have a profound effect on your productivity .
Animal products take significantly more time and energy to digest than plant foods , and when your body must divert extra energy to digestion , it means you have less energy available for productive mental work .
Effectively your work will seem harder while you ’re digesting meals containing animal products , and you ’ll be more inclined to succumb to distractions .
So if you find yourself having a hard time focusing on mentally intense work after lunch , your diet may very well be the culprit .
Even Benjamin Franklin credited eating lightly at lunch time as being a significant factor in his productivity .
While his colleagues were sluggish and sleepy in the afternoon , he could continue to work productively the rest of the day .
Regular exercise is also necessary to maintain high energy and mental clarity .
In college I would go running for 30 minutes first thing every morning before breakfast .
And of course I ’d be listening to motivational and educational tapes at the same time .
This daily renewal kept me in good physical condition and helped me maintain my ideal weight .
Furthermore , my class schedule kept me zigzagging around campus each day to attend all my classes , and I ’d usually have to carry a 20 - 30 pound backpack full of textbooks with me .
So even though I spent most of my weekdays sitting in classrooms , I still got plenty of daily exercise .
If you want to master time management , it makes sense to hone your best time management tool of all — your physical body .
Through diet and exercise you can build your capacity for sustained concentrated effort , so even the most difficult work will seem easier .
If you currently find yourself overweight , take a trip to a local gym or a sporting goods store , and find a dumbbell ( or two ) that weighs as much as the excess fat you ’re carrying around .
Pick it up and walk around with it for a while .
Become aware that this is what you ’re carrying around with you every day .
Imagine how much lighter and easier everything would be if you could permanently put that weight down .
Carrying some extra weight for training purposes is one thing , but if that weight is in the form of body fat , then you ’re never able to put it down and enjoy the benefits of that training .
Make a committed decision to shed those extra pounds , and enjoy the lifelong benefits of living in a more efficient physical vehicle .
Maintain Balance
I do n’t think it ’s easy to sustain long - term productivity , health , and happiness if your life is totally unbalanced .
To excel in one area , you ca n’t let other areas lag behind and pull you down .
While in college I made an effort to take off a full day each week to have a personal life .
I exercised , went to parties , attended club meetings , played computer games and pool , and even had time to vacation in Las Vegas during my final semester .
The high turnover rates at the end of “ death march ” projects are caused by a lack of balance .
To focus exclusively on your primary work at the expense of every other area of your life will only hurt you in the long run .
Maintain balance by paying attention to every area of your life .
As you grow in your career , be sure that your personal life grows as well .
Probably my biggest regret about going through college in three semesters is that I never had a girlfriend during this time .
While I had plenty of good friends ( both male and female ) , got involved in clubs , and enjoyed fun social activities every week , I did n’t have enough time to pursue an intimate relationship on top of everything else .
I remember one instance where a girl I knew was clearly interested in pursuing a relationship with me , and she started machinating to spend more time alone with me , but I could n’t take the bait because I just did n’t have time for dating .
I would n’t have made a very good boyfriend at the time .
If I had to do it all over again , I think my college experience would have been even better if I ’d stretched it to four or five semesters and allowed myself time for a girlfriend .
It would have been great to have someone else to share my life with , not to mention all the other benefits of intimacy .
At least I had plenty of time for dating after graduating .
Within a few months I had a steady girlfriend , and four years later we were married .
She and I actually went to the same college at the same time , but we never happened to meet while we were there , although it turned out we had a few mutual acquaintances .
I believe the main goal of time management is to give you the power to make your life as juicy as you want it to be .
By getting clear about what you want and then developing a collection of habits that allow you to efficiently achieve your goals , you ’ll enjoy a much richer , more fulfilling life than you would otherwise .
When I look back on my college days from more than a decade in the future , I feel a sense of gratitude for the whole experience .
I set an enormous stretch goal and grew tremendously as a person in the pursuit of that goal .
It was one of the best times of my life .
If you wish to become more productive , then do so with the intention of improving the totality of your life from top to bottom .
The reason to master time management is to take your good life and transform it into an exceptional one .
Time management is not about self - sacrifice , self - denial , and doing more of what you dislike .
It ’s about embracing more of what you already love .
ourselves
To be honest , we 're still not sure exactly how much these RedWire DLX iPod Jeans from Levi's will retail for , but we 're guessing the price - to - fashion ratio will be astronomical .
At least the RedWire moniker is explained by a snazzy red ribbon that tethers your iPod to its assigned sidepocket , but the dork factor is quite evident in the retractable headphone doo- hickey and the overly obvious control pad .
Or is that the whole point ?
We never claimed to be fashionable , only to be practiced in lambastating the fashion of others .
Keep reading for a picture of the dorkiness in full effect ( i.e. no sexy models to get in the way ) .

Paper , yes paper , is still the best , least expensive , most long - lived and most reliable technology :
- It does n't need to be upgraded .
Paper has not significantly changed for thousands of years .
A hundred - year - old piece of paper is still usable -- readable and writable -- today .
- It does not need electricity or any other power source to function .
- It does not crash .
Unless you spill something on it , or take the effort to light it on fire , you will not lose your work .
- Industry standards are open and widely accepted .
Paper comes in standard formats for standard purposes : Letter - size , tabloid - size , index cards , business cards , etc .
These standard sizes fit standard devices such as printers , fax machines , etc .
- It is ligher in weight and more transportable than any other technology .
- It 's inexpensive .

Given minimal input the software generates jokes
Computer scientists in Scotland developed the program for children who need to use computerised speech aids .
The team said enabling non-speaking children to use puns and other jokes would help them to develop their language and communication skills .
The researchers admitted some of the computer - generated puns were terrible , but said the children who had tried the technology loved them .
The System to Augment Non-speakers Dialogue Using Puns ( Standup ) project has been developed by scientists at the Universities of Dundee , Aberdeen and Edinburgh .
Computer scientist Dr Annalu Waller , one of the project researchers at the University of Dundee , said : " Basically , the computer comes up with novel jokes - many of which are terrible . "
" Children who are developing on a typical development track actually tell very unfunny jokes , so we have provided that facility for non-speaking children as well . "
Funny bunny
Children using the software can choose a word or compound word , which will form some or all of the punch line , from the system 's dictionary .
The program then writes the joke 's opener .
It works by comparing the selected word with other words in its dictionary for phonetic similarity or concepts that link the words together , and then fits them into a pun template .
Some examples of jokes the software has generated include :
What do you get when you cross a car with a sandwich ?
A traffic jam
What do you call a strange rabbit ?
A funny bunny
What do you call a frog road ?
A main toad
What do you call artist who is a minister ?
A pastor master
Dr Waller said children who are unable to speak can suffer from communication setbacks because their computerised speech aids can lack scope for generating novel language .
Language play , including use of humour , is believed to have a beneficial effect on a child 's developing language and communication skills .
The software has recently been used in a 10 - week trial at a school outside of Glasgow .
Dr Waller said : " The kids have been superb , they have taken to the software like fish to water .
They have been regaling everybody with their jokes . "
She said it seemed to have boosted their confidence as well as their language skills .
" It gives these kids the ability to control conversations , perhaps for the first time , it gives them the ability to entertain other people .
And their self - image improves too . "
The researchers are in talks with manufacturers to see if the software can be integrated into computerised - speech aids for children .
Bush says he signed NSA wiretap order Adds he OK'd program more than 30 times , will continue to do so President Bush arrives for his radio address in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on Saturday .

In acknowledging the message was true , President Bush took aim at the messenger Saturday , saying that a newspaper jeopardized national security by revealing that he authorized wiretaps on U.S. citizens after September 11 .
After The New York Times reported , and CNN confirmed , a claim that Bush gave the National Security Agency license to eavesdrop on Americans communicating with people overseas , the president said that his actions were permissible , but that leaking the revelation to the media was illegal .
During an unusual live , on - camera version of his weekly radio address , Bush said such authorization is " fully consistent " with his " constitutional responsibilities and authorities . "
( Watch Bush explain why he 'authorized the National Security Agency ... to intercept ' -- 4:29 ) Bush added : " Yesterday the existence of this secret program was revealed in media reports , after being improperly provided to news organizations .
As a result , our enemies have learned information they should not have , and the unauthorized disclosure of this effort damages our national security and puts our citizens at risk . "
He acknowledged during the address that he allowed the NSA " to intercept the international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations . "
The highly classified program was crucial to national security and designed " to detect and prevent terrorist attacks , " he added .
( Transcript )
The NSA eavesdrops on billions of communications worldwide .
Although the NSA is barred from domestic spying , it can get warrants issued with the permission of a special court called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court .
The court is set up specifically to issue warrants allowing wiretapping on domestic soil .
' Sad day '
After hearing Bush 's response , Sen . Russ Feingold , D - Wisconsin , said there was no law allowing the president 's actions and that " it 's a sad day . "
" He 's trying to claim somehow that the authorization for the Afghanistan attack after 9/11 permitted this , and that 's just absurd , " Feingold said .
" There 's not a single senator or member of Congress who thought we were authorizing wiretaps . "
He added that the law clearly lays out how to obtain permission for wiretaps .
" If he needs a wiretap , the authority is already there -- the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act , " Feingold said .
" They can ask for a warrant to do that , and even if there 's an emergency situation , they can go for 72 hours as long as they give notice at the end of 72 hours . "
Bush defended signing the order by saying that two of the September 11 hijackers who flew the plane into the Pentagon -- Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi -- " communicated while they were in the United States to other members of al Qaeda who were overseas , but we did n't know they were here until it was too late . "
He said the authorizations have made it " more likely that killers like these 9/11 hijackers will be identified and located in time , and the activities conducted under this authorization have helped detect and prevent possible terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad . "
Re-authorized 30 times Sources with knowledge of the program told CNN on Friday that Bush signed the secret order in 2002 .
The sources refused to be identified because the program is classified .
Bush , however , said he authorized the program on several occasions since the September 11 attacks and that he plans on doing it again .
" I have re-authorized this program more than 30 times , " he said .
" I intend to do so for as long as our nation faces a continuing threat from al Qaeda and related groups . "
The New York Times had not responded to Bush 's allegations that the paper endangered national security as of Saturday afternoon .
But in a Friday statement , Executive Editor Bill Keller said the newspaper postponed publication of the article for a year at the White House 's request , while editors pondered the national security issues surrounding the release of the information .
But after considering the legal and civil liberties aspects , and determining that the story could be written without jeopardizing intelligence operations , the paper ran the story , Keller said , emphasizing that information about many NSA eavesdropping operations is public record .
CNN has not confirmed the exact wording of the president 's order .
The political ramifications of the newspaper 's report were felt even before Bush acknowledged the report 's veracity .
Senators contemplating a vote Friday on whether to renew some controversial portions of the Patriot Act used The New York Times ' report as evidence that the government could not be trusted with the broad powers laid out in the act .
( Read about the Patriot Act vote )
In particular , Sen .
Arlen Specter , R - Pennsylvania , said such behavior by the executive branch " ca n't be condoned , " and Sen.
Charles Schumer , D - New York , said the report swayed his decision on the Patriot Act proposal .
" Today 's revelation that the government listened in on thousands of phone conversations without getting a warrant is shocking and has greatly influenced my vote , " Schumer said .
" Today 's revelation makes it very clear that we have to be very careful -- very careful . "
Specter , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , added Friday that his committee would immediately begin investigating the matter .

Advice for Undergraduates Considering Graduate School
Phil Agre
October 1996 .
With some additional notes added May 2001 .
A PDF version is available here : http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/grad-school.pdf
This article contains informal advice for undergraduates who are thinking about graduate school .
Graduate school comes in three varieties : professional schools ( law , medicine , education , and so on ) , master 's programs , and doctoral programs .
I know little about either professional schools or master 's programs , so I will concentrate on doctoral programs .
In particular , I will use the term " graduate school " to refer to doctoral programs .
Please note , too , that I originally wrote this document for students in my own field and department .
Things might work differently where you are , particularly if you are not currently in college , or if the faculty in your college do not do much research in the area that most interests you .
As with all advice , only trust these notes to the extent they correspond to your own experience .
You might also consider reading books about job - hunting , since that 's often a good way to look at the process of applying to graduate school .
I recommend Tom Jackson 's " Guerrilla Tactics in the New Job Market " ( second edition , New York : Bantam , 1991 ) .
WHAT IS GRADUATE SCHOOL ?
Graduate school is training in research .
It is for people who love research , scholarship , and teaching for their own sake and for the difference they can sometimes make in the world .
It is not for people who simply want more undergraduate courses .
It is not for people who are in a hurry to get a real job .
The eventual goal of many doctoral students is to get a job as a college professor , or perhaps in industrial or government research .
Some in technical subjects go on to start companies .
But many just do it because they like it .
More specifically , graduate school is typically a five to eight year program ( in the US anyway ; fewer years in most other countries ) of study and research organized by a single department or interdisciplinary program of some university , culminating in a doctoral degree ( usually a PhD ) .
In the United States , as a general rule , the term " university " refers to a college that grants doctoral degrees .
Some individual departments in a university may not have graduate programs .
But a research - oriented university will normally grant doctorates in dozens of different fields .
A common misconception is that you cannot apply to a PhD program until you have completed a master 's degree .
This is rarely the case .
If you want a PhD , apply to a PhD program .
You 'll need an undergraduate degree before you start the PhD program , but you can apply to the PhD program before your undergraduate work is done .
Graduate school , as I mentioned , generally takes five to eight years .
That 's a long time .
The first year is often the worst .
It usually consists of an overwhelming amount of structured reading , designed to give you a generalized background in the basic texts of the particular field .
But the exact format of the first few years of graduate school varies widely .
Typically one must pass a set of " comprehensive exams " ( often called " comps " ) to continue in the program past a certain point .
People do fail these exams .
And the workload and the possibility of failure often cause a great deal of anxiety .
I have elaborate ideas about the causes and cures of this situation , but I 'll reserve them for another occasion .
My point here is simply that this unhappy period passes , to be followed by more interesting periods .
The next few years of graduate school are usually focused on finding a topic and advisor for one 's dissertation , along with additional coursework and teaching assistantships .
The best part of graduate school , the part that makes it worthwhile , comes toward the end , when you begin to present your research in public .
Suddenly you will begin to join the community of scholars who work in your chosen area ; they will take you seriously and you will begin to make numerous professional acquaintances , some of whom you will probably keep for the rest of your life .
( I 've written another article , similar to this one , about this process of professional networking .
It 's online at http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/network.html .)
Graduate school , then , is quite different from undergraduate school .
It takes longer , it requires more focused and sustained work , it involves more intensive relationships with faculty and other students , and it makes considerably greater demands on your personal identity .
You can get through your undergraduate education , if you care to , without ever really thinking about who you are or what you want to accomplish in the world .
In graduate school , though , your personal identity will almost certainly undergo great change .
In particular , you will acquire a particular sort of professional identity : you will become known as the person who wrote such - and - such a paper , who did such - and - such research , who refuted such - and - such theory , or who initiated such - and - such line of inquiry .
This process can be tremendously satisfying .
But it 's not for everyone .
DO I WANT TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL ?
Your undergraduate education will not enable you to decide whether to go to graduate school .
You will need to ask for advice .
You should figure that the decision will take about a year to make , so ask for a lot of advice over a long period .
Start toward the middle of your junior year , if not before .
You should get advice from everyone you consider either knowledgeable or wise , but particularly from professors .
Actively explore the possibility of graduate school even if you think your odds of actually going are relatively low ; many people have discovered that they had misconceptions about graduate school and that it is more interesting than they thought .
Many people have difficulty asking for advice about such things , especially from professors , because they are embarrassed at not already knowing all the answers .
But you should understand that a large part of what professors do all day is to give people advice .
And professors know a great deal about graduate school .
In particular , a professor who does research in a given area will probably know a large proportion of the other people who do research in that area .
Indeed , he or she will probably have visited most of the departments that have good graduate programs in the area .
On the other hand , professors ( like everyone else ) see things from their own personal angle , so you should expect to get different advice from different people .
That 's life .
You can also talk to the graduate students in your department , for example the ones who have served as teaching assistants in your classes .
The first step is the hardest .
Start by making a guess at the field or topic that you might want to study in graduate school .
Then pick a professor who seems approachable and might know something about that topic , perhaps because he or she teaches a course in that area .
Show up in that person 's office during scheduled office hours and say , " Hello .
I 'd like to ask your advice .
I am thinking I might want to go to graduate school , but I 'm still uncertain about where I would go or what exactly I would study .
I do know that I 'm pretty interested in such - and - such .
How would I find out about graduate schools in that area ? "
Some common responses to this are as follows :
(1) " I do n't actually know much about that area , but you should talk to so - and - so who is really the expert on that . "
Go talk to so - and - so .
( 2) " I think you 're going to have to define your interests a little better before I can help you . "
Ask for help in defining your interests better .
(3) The response you 're looking for , namely a list of all the good graduate programs in that area , with as much detailed description of them as you can possibly digest .
What next ?
Well , let 's back up and talk about research .
RESEARCH
Graduate school , as I said , is training in research .
When a graduate school looks at your application , their principal question is , " Is this person going to be good at research ? "
Indeed , that should be one of your own principal questions as well .
How can you tell if you 're going to be good at research ?
Getting good grades in your undergraduate classes is important , but it 's not really the main thing .
The main thing is this : if you want to go to graduate school , you should start getting involved in research as an undergraduate .
This fact is usually kept secret , but it 's true .
And in retrospect it 's obvious why .
Graduate school is a big commitment , both for you and for the department that accepts you into its graduate program .
You should try your hand at research first so that everyone can make a well - informed decision .
( On the other hand , if you do n't manage to get involved in research as an undergraduate , you should go ahead and apply to graduate school anyway , and consider including your best undergraduate term paper with your application . )
How can an undergraduate get involved in research ?
This question has two answers , the official answer and the real answer .
The official answer will take the form of administrative mechanisms ( independent study courses , faculty mentor programs , and so forth ) that provide formal structures around a project that you might be involved in .
Go talk to your department 's undergraduate coordinator , find out what these mechanisms are , and read the necessary paperwork .
Then forget about them for a while , because the real answer to the question lies in your professional relationship to the faculty member who will supervise your research .
But who will this person be ?
That 's the hard part .
As with all professional relationships , you 're looking for a match between your interests and abilities and those of a faculty member .
Finding this match will take a little time , but like all hard projects it starts with asking advice .
One way to start is by finding out which faculty members have supervised undergraduate research in the past .
Teaching assistants are often a good source for this sort of information ( and much other information as well , though you should realize that TA's , like everyone else , see the world from a particular angle and often have differing opinions ) .
You can also start with someone whose course you liked and did well in .
This approach has the advantage that the professor in question already knows you .
Show up in that person 's office hours and say , " I 'd like to ask your advice .
I liked your course on such - and - such and I 'm thinking I might want to go to graduate school in that area .
In particular I 'd like to see if I can get involved in a research project in the area starting maybe next term .
But I have n't got a precise idea of how to go about it , or about how to define a good project .
What do you think I should do ? "
Maybe they 'll just send you to someone else , or maybe they wo n't .
The ensuing conversation will be complicated but probably less painful than you think .
Keep in mind that it is basically a negotiation .
It is your first chance to practice a skill that you will need for the rest of your career as a scholar : formulating and reformulating your research interests in language that particular people can understand .
Listen to their language .
What do they think a research topic is like ?
How do they think a research project should be conducted ?
Do they see research as an individual activity or as a collective one ?
How enthusiastic do they really seem about the idea of supervising undergraduate research ?
Are you comfortable with the answers to these questions ?
No need to make a quick decision , though .
Most likely your conversation will be inconclusive .
That 's normal .
Sleep on it .
Ask for research papers to read and then read them -- and then ask yourself if you want to learn to write papers like that .
Have the same sort of conversation with other professors ( do n't forget other departments and even other universities in the same geographic area ) .
Then compare and contrast the results .
Undergraduate research projects can take a wide variety of forms .
Sometimes a professor will have a large research project that involves dozens of people .
Such projects frequently have niches for undergraduates .
This can be the best kind of undergraduate research experience because it will give you the opportunity to work with a group , observe the whole process of research , and feel like you 're contributing to something .
But maybe nobody has project of that type in your area .
Another possibility is simply to set up a project of your own , with regular meetings with a professor to discuss its progress .
Projects like this work best if you have a good relationship with the professor and a strong feeling for the topic .
Try to get to know other people with interests in that area , both because it 's interesting and to keep from getting isolated or dependent on a particular professor .
Your project will make a good conversation topic .
Yet another possibility is to become a professor 's assistant on some project .
This might involve anything : library work , data collection , putting together complex research papers , etc .
The work might be tedious ( or it might not ) , but it can be a good way to learn about research through apprenticeship .
All such deals are unique and should be weighed on their particular merits ( e.g. , whether you feel that you can work for this person ) , but you should always give them serious consideration because they do n't happen every day .
And the world is full of other possibilities .
Maybe you will become involved with an off - campus project of some sort -- a company , a community group , an alternative media project -- that you can integrate with a university research project .
Maybe you can get a summer job in a research group .
Maybe you will have an outside job that you want to use as a site for field research .
Who knows .
Few research opportunities are advertised ( though many universities have offices that find undergraduates for research projects ) , so you 'll have to ask around .
Most likely you 'll have to make the opportunity yourself by exploring options with various professors .
Once you have defined a project and found a supervisor , go ahead and figure out the paperwork .
Maybe you 'll arrange for independent study credit .
Maybe you 'll sign up for some official program in the university .
Maybe you 'll even get a research grant .
( If you need some money for your research , perhaps to take a trip or operate a photocopier , ask .
It may exist .
Writing a grant proposal may be the single most valuable experience of your project .
And if you 're being paid for your involvement in the project , make sure you get a clear understanding of your responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings later . )
Just keep in mind that professional relationships are the real substance of research .
Administrative details are secondary .
Maybe you wo n't even formalize the arrangement at all .
The important things , after all , are the experience you 'll get , the relationships you 'll develop , and the research paper that you can include in graduate school applications .
In particular , it is not crucial how well your research project turns out .
It will be okay in any event ; and everyone understands that research is hard and that undergraduate projects regularly fail to work out completely for reasons that are not your fault .
( The main pitfall for undergraduates and graduate students alike is attempting a project that 's too big .
Keep asking wise people to help you narrow your project . )
If your project works out well enough to produce a publishable paper , go for it .
But it 's not necessary .
APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL
If you have been getting advice and doing research then you will have figured out where the good graduate programs for your interests are .
You might even have an idea of which professors you want to study with .
( If you liked someone 's book , maybe you should become that person 's student .
It 's worth a try .
Ask for good books to read with this in mind , and get advice about the potential advisability of writing this person a letter . )
Apply to as many good graduate programs in your area as you can .
When in doubt , apply .
You can always turn down offers you do n't want later on .
Applications for graduate school , at least in the United States , are typically due in December or January .
You should start writing away for the application forms in September -- that is , September of your senior year , unless you are planning to take a year off .
I want to make a special point of this because it is common to forget about next year until the spring , when it is too late .
Getting the application forms is easy .
Write a letter to " Graduate Program / Department of Whatever / University of Whatever / City , State , ZIP " ( you can get the addresses from the Web or from reference books ; ask at the library reference desk ) and say " I am interested in applying to graduate school in your department .
Please send me some detailed information on the department , the necessary application forms , and information about financial aid .
Thank you very much . "
( Some departments may have Web - only application procedures , so look for these on the Web before you write away for the forms . )
You should expect to apply to five or six schools and maybe more , depending on the level of competition in your area .
Filling out the application forms is tedious , but it will get easier once you 've done a couple .
The most important part of the application form will be a blank page headed something like " Statement of Purpose " .
On this page you will be asked to explain why you want to go to graduate school , including some idea about what sort of research you would like to conduct .
You need to take this seriously .
Write about a page and a half on the subject , single - spaced , and take it to the professors you 've been getting advice from .
They will almost certainly tell you to rewrite it , and you should definitely do so .
Do n't be surprised if it takes three or four tries to get it right .
If they just make a few suggestions around the edges , ask them specifically what the best approach would be in rewriting it from scratch .
Your statement should demonstrate that you know what research is , that you have had at least one idea in your life , and that you have an interesting and tractable idea about your research for the future .
The problem , of course , is that you probably have only the sketchiest idea of what your research in graduate school will be about .
That does n't matter .
You are not promising to do the research you describe in your statement ( although I am told that this is changing in some areas of the hard sciences ) ; you are only spelling out a single plausible scenario , one that fairly reflects your interests .
Try to be concrete , but also include a few hedges such as " perhaps " and " these possibilities include " .
Good writing counts .
Project sobriety and maturity .
Avoid frivolity , boasting , and self - deprecation .
Show that you 've read the research literature , but go easy on academic jargon .
Minimize adverbs .
Eschew the words " interesting " and " important " , which say little .
Many people start their statements with a paragraph or two of commonplaces ; cut this material until you reach a statement that says something non-obvious about the world and your research involvements .
Do n't talk about your family , your feelings , or your non-professional interests .
Do n't say anything bad about anyone , including yourself .
And make sure that you are not simply describing the year 's most fashionable cliche of a research project -- ask for advice about this issue specifically .
Put yourself in the shoes of the graduate admissions committee : they 're looking at hundreds of applications and they 're only going to take a second look at the ones that stand out .
If you follow the above advice then your application will make the first cut and receive the serious consideration it deserves .
It is also a good idea , if you have the energy , to tailor your statement to fit the particular departments you 're applying to .
You might write a generic statement and then edit in some passages that fit each department , for example mentioning one of the professors there whose work is relevant to your interests , just to show that you know what you 're doing .
If you have your heart set on a particular department ( say because you want to work with a particular professor whose work you admire ) then write a customized statement for that department .
Find people who are well acquainted with that department and ask their guidance .
In short , show the admissions committee that you 've done your homework .
It makes a difference .
Make sure your graduate application includes the research papers you wrote as an undergraduate , and be sure that your statement explains the connection between these papers and the graduate research you are envisioning .
Meanwhile , apply for fellowships , that is , grants from foundations and other sources that pay your tuition and a small salary so that you can commit yourself full - time to studying .
Do n't wait until you 're accepted somewhere to apply for outside funding !
Deadlines typically fall between November and January in the United States and a few months later in many other countries .
Ask someone in your department which are the major fellowships in your area and apply for them all .
Also , at each university it is usually somebody 's job to keep a list , maybe on the Web , of obscure graduate fellowships .
It might be called the office of research development .
You might also look in the acknowledgements sections of papers written by younger researchers in your field .
Find such lists and write away for applications forms for all of the fellowships that seem relevant .
Get advice about which ones are worth applying for .
When in doubt , apply .
Fellowships are good because they give you much more freedom to choose your own research topics .
Without a fellowship , you will have to work for someone else as a teaching assistant or research assistant .
Assistantships are often perfectly fine , but a fellowship is always better .
About grade point averages .
Many people worry that their GPA will prevent them from getting into graduate school .
Good grades are important , but they can be measured in different ways .
For example , you might recompute your GPA without your freshman classes ( many universities do this routinely ) , or your GPA for upper - division courses only , or only for courses in your major .
If any of these numbers is significantly more impressive than your official GPA , you should mention it somewhere in your application .
About exams .
Certain exams ( eg. GRE , GMAT etc. ) are necessary for many graduate programs , and you often need to apply to take these over a year before you apply , particularly if you do n't want to take a general and a subject GRE on the same day .
You can get details of what exams are needed from the course catalog or brochure from the graduate programs you might be interested in ; this is one more reason to get the brochure well ahead of time , whether you 're serious yet about applying or not .
You are probably appalled at how many applications you are filling out .
Rest assured , though , that filling out applications is a major part of a career in research .
Look on the bright side : applying for things is an opportunity to assess your career and to articulate it in the best and most sincere light for other people .
You will be doing a great deal of this in the future .
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
Your application to graduate school will also involve some letters of recommendation , usually three or four .
Most of these letters will probably ( but not necessarily ) be from professors in the department where you got your undergraduate degree .
It helps , other things being equal , if you get letters from famous professors as opposed to junior ones .
But the important thing is to get letters from people who know you and who can say things about you that make you sound like you belong in graduate school .
But there 's a problem .
Most letters that professors write for undergraduates are not very impressive because most professors do not know the undergraduates in their department very well .
If you want good letters then you need to do something about this .
The best thing is to get involved in research , as I 've described above .
The person who supervises your research will then be able to write you a helpful letter that does n't sound like a computer wrote it .
The other way to get good letters of recommendation is to get to know the professors who teach the classes that you particularly like .
This is a remarkably difficult matter .
Doing really good work in the class definitely helps , but this in itself need n't entail any actual acquaintance with the professor who taught it .
So how do you do this ?
The wrong way to go about it is to show up in the professor 's office to chat randomly , hoping that you 'll make a good impression along the way .
This strategy almost always makes a dreadful impression , for the simple reason that professors are busy people who hate it when you waste their time .
Think about it like this .
Your relationship with a professor will be defined by a set of ideas -- the ideas that the professor is trying to teach in the classes you 're taking .
Either you find those ideas compelling and interesting or you do n't .
If you do n't get a genuine thrill out of the ideas then you 're better off investing your energies elsewhere in the first place .
But if you actually do find the ideas interesting then you are going to have questions about them -- questions that go beyond the course .
Maybe your term papers will address those questions .
Or whatever .
In any event , do n't keep your questions a secret .
Go ask them .
There 's no need for flattery or hints or hidden agendas .
Simply ask the questions because you want to know the answers .
Only a jerk considers it a waste of time to answer genuine questions .
Letters of recommendation will take care of themselves when the time comes .
GETTING ACCEPTED TO GRADUATE SCHOOL
In March or April you will start getting letters of acceptance or rejection from graduate schools .
When you are accepted , the main thing you want to know is how much money they are offering you .
Graduate school is expensive and you want to avoid paying the fees yourself .
The most common arrangement is for you to be offered a teaching assistantship ( TA ) , a nominally half - time teaching job , or a research assistantship ( RA ) , which may involve prescribed work for some professor or may simply be support for your own work .
A better arrangement , though , is to get a fellowship .
Maybe you will win a fellowship through your own efforts .
Another possibility is that the department that accepts you can provide its own fellowship money .
Whatever you do , do n't accept the department 's offer right away .
Reply to the offer with a polite acknowledgement and then stall them for a couple of weeks while you wait for other acceptances to arrive .
Meanwhile , think much more seriously about the offer .
Do you really want to move to that city ?
What is that university really like ?
What is that department really like ?
The important thing here is that you are about to be treated with more respect than you might be accustomed to .
Take advantage of this by getting more advice .
The faculty in your department will celebrate your acceptance to graduate school , and they will probably be happy to help you decide what to do .
Ask them about reputations and rumors .
Ask them if anybody else in town graduated from that same department or a closely related department at the same school .
Find out if the people in that department care about their graduate students ; some do n't .
Make lists of questions and then call the department on the phone and ask them .
Try to get a course catalog ( but be sure to ask whether it corresponds to reality ; many do n't ) .
If you can visit the department , do so .
Sometimes you can even get the department ( or even your own ) to pay for a trip .
The department will be waiting anxiously for your decision ; if you turn them down they will offer your space to someone else who seems promising .
They may even try to pressure you into making a decision .
If this happens , get more advice .
If you can talk to the department 's existing graduate students , go right ahead ; graduate students do n't always have all the facts , but they usually have blunt opinions .
Unless the department has offered you a good fellowship , one of your main goals will be to extract more money from them .
Sound reasonable about this .
Plead poverty .
Explain that you find the offer exciting but that you still need to eat .
If you have kids to feed , tell them that .
If you have a good offer from another school , tell them that too ( but do n't tell them the details of that offer or make it sound like you 're just after the money ; just say that the other offer , taken as a whole , is attractive and more financially feasible ) .
Your basic stance is that you simply need enough money to do your graduate work without having to take outside jobs , at least for the first few years .
Often some additional money will materialize as other people turn down offers from the same place .
After a couple of weeks , though , you will have to decide .
Send a brief message to the winning school accepting its offer , wait for acknowledgement , and inform the losing schools of your decision with a brief message such as , " After long thought , I have decided to attend graduate school at Podunk U. I appreciate your interest in my career , though , and I hope we can keep in touch .
Thanks very much . "
Congratulations and good luck .
MORE NOTES , MAY 2001
Many people have written me about " Advice for Undergraduates " , and their comments and questions have made clear that I ought to throw it out and write it again .
I do n't have time for that , but perhaps these additional notes will be useful .
First , I need to re-emphasize that " Advice for Undergraduates " is written solely for people who are thinking of applying to PhD programs .
I do not know much about master 's and professional programs , and I do not have any advice to offer people who are thinking about applying to them .
Throughout this article , both above and below , the phrase " graduate school " refers strictly to PhD programs , which are training in research .
Now some more substantive comments .
Most people who apply to graduate school understand the process by analogy to applying to undergraduate programs .
On the surface the two processes are similar : they both involve paperwork , written statements , course transcripts , recommendation letters , and so on .
Underneath , however , the processes could not be more different .
Undergraduate admissions is handled entirely by professional admissions officers who evaluate large numbers of applications covering every field .
Graduate admissions , by contrast , is handled by each department separately .
You might send your application to a bureaucratic office , but that office exists only to assemble a file on each applicant .
The applications are evaluated by a committee of faculty .
This means that your application will be read by people who have a deep knowledge of the field that you want to study .
If you have knowledge of the field yourself , then you would be well - advised to tell them about it .
Do n't show off or pretend to knowledge that you do n't really have , but do address your materials to the people who will become your professional peers once you finally get your PhD degree .
Having your application evaluated by the faculty is also advantageous because superficial bureaucratic criteria are less important .
It is in the faculty 's interest to admit students who are likely to do well , and any faculty worth your time will consider whatever evidence of aptitude for research you can give them .
The admissions process on the graduate level is therefore more human , with all of the positive and negative consequences that that implies .
I originally wrote " Advice for Undergraduates " in 1996 , before the Web became an important factor in most academic fields .
If I were to write it over again today , I would put the Web in the middle of the picture .
The most important intuition , already hinted at in the previous paragraph , is that a PhD program , unlike most undergraduate programs , is about relationships with particular individuals .
Therefore , I recommend the following rather aggressive - sounding procedure .
Hit the library and identify a half - dozen professors in your intended field whose work you admire and identify with .
You might be able to get these people 's names from the professors that you talk to at your own school , but there is no substitute for the library .
So take the time to read the books and journals that are relevant to your field .
Once you have several names in hand , hit the Web .
Look up those professors ' home pages , which will hopefully provide you with a more complete map of their research interests and publications .
Inform yourself more deeply about each individual 's work .
If you 're still interested in exploring a relationship with them , proceed to their departments ' home pages .
Look at the other faculty in the department , and see if you can identify three or four other faculty whose research topics are at least in the basic ballpark of your own .
It 's dangerous to rely on one single individual .
Having done all this , you will have narrowed down your list of candidate departments .
You are now in a position to establish contact with each of the professors who you are still strongly interested in .
Send each one a customized e-mail message , no more than a few hundred words in length .
This message should do four things : ( 1 ) demonstrate knowledge of their research , ( 2 ) explain that you are looking for the right PhD program , ( 3 ) explain the general research area you are interested in working in , and ( 4 ) ask them whether they are taking on new students .
Do n't make it sound like you 're asking for a commitment at this point , just a conversation to determine whether you should apply .
If you happen to be in the same geographic region , or if you can travel , ask if you can stop by .
Never ask the professor or the department about financial aid until the department has accepted you to its program .
( You should apply for fellowships on your own initiative at the same time that you apply to the departments , but you should also recognize that most departments at serious research universities have a lot of financial aid for their students , especially in their first couple of years . )
And do n't get hung up on the administrative details of the application process .
Right now , the important thing is to establish an intellectual relationship .
In the sciences and engineering , it is important to have a specific idea of your intended research topic , even though it will surely evolve later on , and you should work out a clear understanding of your topic with the professors at your home institution first .
Other fields allow for more exploration , for the simple reason that less money is at stake .
If you get no response from the professor , then that tells you something right there .
It might mean that the professor gets lots of spam - like messages from prospective students who have n't done any real homework , but it might also mean that the professor 's department deals with students in a relatively impersonal way , so that the time for advising discussions is after you 've been accepted and passed all the classes .
The professor might say " no " , either because their lab is already full or for lack of an intellectual match .
The professor wo n't say " yes " , because that 's the admissions committee 's job .
But if it turns out that the two of you have something to talk about , then definitely apply to the department .
Briefly mention your correspondence with the professor in your application letter .
Many people have asked me how to proceed if they have been out of school for several years .
The basic answer is given in the last few paragraphs .
It is not crucial to have been involved in research as an undergraduate , and you should only try to get letters from your undergraduate professors if there is a good chance that they will remember you .
( Keep in mind , however , that if you did good work in their class , then a copy of your work is likely to refresh their memory .
If you did n't do good work in their class then forget them . )
Treat the process as a rational conversation among adults -- if it 's not then walk away .
You 're basically looking for a job in a different industry , and you should do your homework and build networks accordingly .
If you can attend the major annual conference in your intended field then gathering intelligence and talking to people there would be ideal .
As I say , the faculty simply need evidence that you are likely to succeed in their program , and the ones you want to work with will be open to any kind of evidence that convinces them .
If you do n't have letters from faculty whose reputations they know , and if you have n't been involved in research , then they are going to need other kinds of evidence .
You might think about , or even explore with them , ways that you can move stepwise back into graduate school .
Maybe you can get involved with the research on some other basis first .
Maybe you can write something on your own .
Maybe you can get into a master 's program first , and use the faculty that become available to explore the transition to a PhD program .
( Many PhD programs include a master 's degree as a halfway point , but most programs will not recognize a terminal master 's degree as a substitute for this halfway master 's .
The reason is that the first couple of years of a PhD program , having been designed as socialization into a research discipline , are very different from a terminal master 's program in both content and style .
So if you get a terminal master 's then it will probably not shorten the amount of time it takes to get a PhD. )
Another common question is how heavily the admissions committee for graduate school will weigh your undergraduate school .
Is it better to attend a good school and risk getting a low GPA , or to attend a not - so - good school and get a better GPA ?
The answer , if you 're really talking about getting into a PhD program worth attending , is that you should attend a good school and get a good GPA .
The admissions committee for the PhD program is trying to decide which students will be good at research , and they are making this decision based on the limited information available to them in the applications .
They know that a good GPA from a not - so - good undergraduate program is not a very meaningful predictor of graduate school success .
When you apply for graduate school , you will be competing against people who went to good schools , got good grades , and wrote papers that were in the general ballpark of being publishable .
So if you have a choice , go to a good school and get involved in research .
If you 've already been to undergraduate school and your school was n't so great , go ahead and apply anyway , making sure to enclose your best undergraduate papers .
If you are uncertain whether a particular school is considered " good " , then it 's time to ask the advice of people who are engaged in research in your chosen field .
Foreigners have asked me how they should apply to American PhD programs .
Foreign students often assume that they lack " inside information " that American students enjoy , and they sometimes respond by trying to divine this information from statistics about what kinds of test scores got someone into one school or another .
I 'd like to suggest a different approach .
First of all , you should not assume that American students are insiders who have secret knowledge that you lack .
The great majority of American students just take their classes and follow the rules without becoming part of the research institutions around them .
I hope to change this by encouraging more undergraduates to become more involved in research , but undergraduate involvement in research is not yet the norm .
The central point is that a PhD program allows you to integrate yourself into the research community , and you are more likely to be accepted into a PhD program if you have already begun the process .
The research community is global , so if you are attending a research university then the starting place is with your professors .
If you are not attending a university that is part of the global research community , or if your professors cannot help you , then you need a research library .
A research library is a library that has a large collection of current research literature -- books and journals -- in your field .
In most scientific and technical fields this means a large collection in English ; in the humanities a large collection in a major world language will suffice .
You need to spend a month , full - time , in a research library .
Read extensively in the literature of your field .
Determine which research topics you find most interesting , and then judge which research groups are doing the best work .
Take extensive notes .
Then base your application letter on what you 've read in the journals .
Demonstrate that you are familiar with the literature and that you understand the concepts by using the vocabulary of the literature to explain very clearly what topics you want to conduct research on .
If you do not have a research library near your home you will need to travel .
Talk to the librarians at your university , and figure out which library in your region is best - suited to your needs .
Then find out if you can get permission to use the library .
It is usually easier to get into the library of a public university than a private university , and libraries in English - speaking countries tend to be more liberal , as a broad generalization , than libraries in other countries .
In extreme cases you might even have to fly to a country such as Australia and sleep on the floor somewhere .
It 's difficult and expensive , I understand , but it will dramatically increase your chances of being accepted to a PhD program .
A final comment .
Many people have written me with questions about their own particular situation .
I am happy to help if I can , but please understand that many questions depend on the policies of particular schools or the customs of particular fields , and in these areas I am afraid I can't help .
I know about the intellectual and relationship aspects of getting accepted to graduate school , but I refuse to know anything about the more bureaucratic aspects .
Each school makes its own decisions about what examinations to require , how to establish English - language proficiency for foreign students , how to set fees , where to obtain application forms and where to send them , whether students are allowed to attend school part - time , what kinds of grades and test scores they require , and so on .
For answers to these types of questions , you should consult the individual department 's Web site .
Likewise , I do have not have any kind of directory of graduate programs or fellowship opportunities , even in my own field .
I do not even know if such directories exist .
It does n't matter , in my opinion , since I believe that you should select a graduate program using the kinds of social networking and library homework that I described above .
Nor , unfortunately , do I have any way of evaluating how strong a candidate for graduate school you might be .
So , bottom line , if you have questions about intellectual and relationship aspects of getting into graduate school that I have not addressed above , you are most welcome to write .
Otherwise please talk to the experts in your own field .

Recently Microsoft announced a new product it will be releasing called Oragami .
It is an interesting piece of hardware that falls somewhere between a PDA and a laptop in both size and functionality .
Unfortunately for Microsoft , products like these are practically doomed to fail outside of their niche markets .
And this trend continues not because quality products are n’t produced , but rather they are solutions in search of a problem .
As products , they have fundamental flaws which inevitably lead to their failure in the marketplace .
Here is a brief summary of the main reasons why Oragami ( and devices like it ) wo n’t be successful .
Who is it geared to ?
The biggest problem with a device like this is that everyone who might buy it , already has something that works just fine right now .
Thus , for a product like this to survive , Microsoft must convince a sufficient number of consumers that the current way they are doing things is n’t very good .
And the only way to make their lives better is to use the new product .
This is a very hard task to accomplish because this type of device is trying to pull people in from two different consumer groups , PDA users and ultra-portable laptop users .
PDA users will most likely look at Origami and conclude that it is too big for what they need .
These are users who favor BlackBerries , PDA Cell Phones , Palm Pilots and the like .
They are looking for a small device that will organize their life and fit in their pocket .
This Origami device should easily do the former , but its dimensions prevent it from realizing the latter .
So , all but the most diehard of PDA junkies wo n’t be interested in Origami .
Having failed in the PDA market , an enterprising company will turn to another promising market , laptop users .
Sadly Microsoft ( or any another company ) wo n’t have much more luck here than it did with the PDA crowd , but that wo n’t prevent a valiant attempt from being made .
What argument can possibly be made that will convince someone who already owns a small laptop or a tablet PC to give Origami a try ?
What can it do that a standard laptop can ’t ?
Yes it is smaller , but also much harder to use due to a small screen , cramped keyboard and tiny controls .
Dedicated Devices vs Mutli-Use Systems
Where are tablets most popular ?
In industries that need a dedicated device that performs a small set of functions very well .
Nurses , deliverymen , inventory control clerks , Firemen ( they use them in the trucks for maps and reports ) .
Other professionals in similar industries can always find a use for a moderately cheap , fairly durable tablet PC .
These types of users will gladly buy a device like this . . .
FOR THEIR JOB .
But when quiting time rolls around they get dropped on the desk as everyone heads home .
Meaning , they do n’t use these products at the office and then go out and order one for home too .
They have no need for one at home , only in their work environment .
Thus these users are a profitable niche market , but one that is incapable of driving any explosive growth on the consumer side .
Why ?
Because the current group of dedicated devices has the market locked up pretty tight already .
Consumers have no reason to go out and spend $ 1,000 on Origami when the same functionality can be had in 3 or 4 cheaper products .
Need to play music ?
Get an iPod , $ 100
Need to organizes your life ?
Get a PDA , $ 100
Need to play movies ?
Get a portable DVD player , $ 100
Need to make phone calls ?
Get a cell phone , $ 50
$ 350 – 4 devices vs $ 1,000 – 1 device
Consumers will look at this and realize that if they really wanted to scrap most of their dedicated devices , then they are much better off spending an extra hundred dollars or so and getting a decent laptop .
It will have a bigger screen , bigger harddrive , more RAM , a keyboard and trackpad , DVD drive , lots of ports and will be easier to use than Origami .
It might be heavier , but how many of us are really going to care about a few extra pounds when there is so much else going for the laptop ?
Interface
This is the most difficult problem , by far , that must be overcome before adoption of Origami ( or any other such product ) can really take off .
And unfortunately for Microsoft ( and in fact most other companies ) they will never be able to beat this one .
Not because they do n’t have the programmers to write the code or the resources to make the product ( s ) , but rather , they lack someone who will put “ ease of use ” above everything else .
Someone who will focus on style before features .
That someone is not Bill Gates .
Origami ( or Apple ’s fabled ‘ SuperPod ’ ) will ultimately be faced with the same question .
Should the device run a specialized OS ( think Palm Pilot or iPod ) or an actual operating system ( Windows CE , OS X kitty cat ) ?
This is a crucial choice because if the device is to complex then operating it will be too much of a hassle and no one will use it .
Make it too simple and you will never be able to convince people to spend $ $ $ on a glorified PDA .
A balance must be struck , but where ?
What is more important , funcitonality or ease of use ?
If Microsoft does this I see it as a laptop that is just really hard to use .
If Apple does it , I see it as a much simpler portable media device .
Where Origami will have a keyboard , Apple will have a scroll wheel .
Origami can be used with one hand , a device from Apple can be operated with one finger .
And yet , I still do n’t know what the point would be .
If Apple produced this product tomorrow it might succeed .
Notice I said might .
If a product such as Origami came from Apple it would definitely look cool .
And it would be easy to use .
It would integrate tightly with all of Apple ’s other products .
. . but even with all of that going for it , I am not sure we are really ready for such a device .
What will we do with it ?
Seriously , at the end of the day what makes this product special enough for you to spend almost a thousand dollars on it ?
Do you really need your media portable that bad ?
Even if it was as easy to use as the iPod , what would be the main selling point ?
It plays movies ?
I do n’t think the demand is there yet .
Wireless internet ?
Get a laptop .
Music ?
Pictures ?
Games ?
Maybe what you really need is a PSP .
This alone should be the biggest indicator that the market is n’t ready for something like this .
If you look at things fairly and are struck by the fact that even Apple might not be able to pull this one off , well , at that point it is time to reconsider what it is exactly Microsoft hopes to accomplish .
But maybe I am wrong .
Maybe the demand is there .
Maybe Origami will be everything Microsoft hopes it will be .
Maybe people will use it to listen to music , watch movies , organize their lives , read books , play games and maybe it will become a sensation on par with the iPod .
Maybe . . .
But I would n’t bet the farm on it .
July 24 , 2006  --
Someone hacked into Lindsay Lohan 's BlackBerry to send out harassing messages to the people on her buddy list , but it was n't Lohan 's rival heiress Paris Hilton .
Leslie Sloane Zelnik , the pop star 's spokeswoman , said the " disgusting and very mean messages " had everyone in her camp thinking that Hilton had been involved .
The two have had several confrontations in recent months , including a spat at Hollywood hot spot Hyde , where the two engaged in an argument in front of other patrons .
" Some people think Paris may have been involved because the wording of the messages sounds very familiar , " Zelnik told The New York Post 's Page Six .
" They were n't , " she now said .
" We now have her lawyers looking into it . "
Hilton had her own problems with portable electronics two years ago , when her T - Mobile account was hacked and private messages were put on the Web .
That incident exposed juicy tidbits that included her belief that Jessica Simpson , who was then married to Nick Lachey , had a crush on Justin Timberlake .
Hilton 's representative Elliot Mintz further denies that his client was involved in the apparent invasion into Lohan 's buddy list .

Tools for foiling malicious links and files : Rex Swain 's HTTP Viewer reveals browser activity .
A special " thank you " from Yves Latour , co-founder of the search engine for brochures & catalogs :
Who-sells -it.com
10 - Jul - 2008
Who - sells - it.com is a search engine for brochures and catalogs .
Everyone owning some sort of product catalog using the popular PDF format can have it added for free .
There are no catchy terms attached , but the catalog file should be online already and allow an easy spidering and fetching .
The robots . txt file is supported .
Sometimes our catalog spider cannot fetch a catalog as supposed or we have a problem with one of our own web documents .
Usually , the first move is getting over to Rex Swain 's HTTP Viewer , slapping the URL into the input box to check the document header .
In most cases this gives us the information we need to know to be able to understand the problem .
We appreciate the existence of such free tools .
Thank you , Rex , for saving us time !
From Fred Langa 's " LangaList " Newsletter 17 - Feb -2000 LangaList reader Rex Swain is a consultant and needed a way to see easily what was going on behind the scenes of various web sites when he clicked in .
So , he wrote an " HTTP Viewer " that anyone can use ( for free ! ) .
It intercepts and displays * everything * that transpires between a browser and any given web page , showing you stuff your browser normally hides .
For example , when you connect to Amazon .
Com , you 'll normally see your browser churn for a few seconds ( showing a blank page ) and then the Amazon home page comes up .
But Rex 's tool lets you see that you 're actually viewing three pages in rapid succession :
An initial page quickly redirects you to a second page that sets a cookie ; and then that page dumps you to a third page where another cookie is set .
Your browser only shows you the third page , but Rex 's spy tool lets you see everything -- and I mean everything -- that 's going on , including the cookie contents and the URLs of the hidden pages .
10 Things You Might Not Know About Google
This article is written by Philipp Lenssen as part of the Blog Swap with Seth Finkelstein – Seth 's article on 10 Things You Might Not Know About Censorware can be found at Philipp 's blog .
1. Google query syntax underwent some subtle changes over the years .
Not too long ago , you could n't enter more than 10 words into the Google search box .
Or to be more precisely , you * could * , but subsequent words were ignored .
I bet the Google founders were thinking " 10 words ought to be enough for everyone , " and mostly there were right – but for some advanced uses , especially with the Google Search API , a little more is helpful .
Then , a while ago , Google increased the words limit to 32 words .
This is probably OK for a few more years !
Another change is that Google ignores stop words nowadays .
Stop words in search engines are words like " the " or " a " which are too tiny or common to be useful additions to most searches .
However , Google is now accepting them as semi-normal words ( one remaining difference being that they 're not highlighted , or linked to the dictionary ) .
This means in Google.com , you get different results when search for [ the tale of a cowboy ] vs [* tale * * cowboy ] vs [ tale cowboy ] .
( I 'll be using square brackets around search queries – they 're not to be included in the search . )
Another operator changed its functionality during the years ; a couple of years ago , you could only query Google for [ site:something.com ] , but not [ site:something.com /something / ] .
Today , you can add folders to the site operator .
2. Google itself was Beta .
These days , everyone puts a Beta tag on their 2.0 - ish web app .
But did you know back in 1998 , when Google launched their search , it was also in Beta ?
Take a look at a copy stored in the WayBack Machine to see it .
Be aware the page might look quite ugly by today 's standards ... heck , it was probably ugly even back in 1998 ( then again , so was my homepage in 1998 ! ) .
3. PageRank more than 1 - 10 – maybe .
While no one outside Google knows for sure , it is often speculated that Google 's PageRank value – the " authority rank " ( or quantity of backlinks which themselves receive lots of backlinks ) – is a much more precise number than the plain 1 , 2 , 3 ... 10 values .
A float , not an integer , if you will .
So , for example , if you 're looking at a site which shows a PageRank 8 in the Google Toolbar , its internal PageRank may be something like 8.355 ( or however precise Google 's number is ) .
But we do n't know for sure – maybe Google 's algorithms prefer speed over quality when it comes to the recursive PR calculations of billions of pages .
This calculation might not be a breeze even for Google 's 10,000 - 200,000 computers ( that 's another number we can't be too sure of outside of Google ) .
4. Google 's co-founders did n't like each other in the beginning .
I guess when you 're an uber - geek , like Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are , you are also very competitive ( to the point of risk being arrogant towards slower thinkers , maybe ) .
John Battelle in his book The Search ( page 67/68 ) , tells of how the two met at Stanford University in the summer of ' 95 :
Like most schools , Stanford invites potential recruits to the campus for a tour .
But it was n't on the pastoral campus that Page met Brin – it was on the streets of San Francisco .
Brin , a second - year student known to be gregarious , had signed up to be a student guide of sorts .
His role that day was to show a group of prospective first - years around the City by the Bay .
Page ended up in Brin 's group , but it was n't exactly love at first sight .
" Sergey is pretty social ; he likes meeting people . "
Page recalls , contrasting that quality with his own reticence .
" I thought he was pretty obnoxious .
He had really strong opinions about things , and I guess I did , too . "
" We both found each other obnoxious , " Brin counters when I tell him of Page 's response .
" But we say it a little bit jokingly .
Obviously we spent a lot of time talking to each other , so there was something there .
We had a kind of bantering thing going . "
5. Google has 16 official blogs .
You might have come across the official Google Blog .
But did you know Google actually has 16 different – and all official – blogs ( give or take one ) ?
Here 's the full list ( I 'm also collecting these all on one page ) :
Google Blog - googleblog.blogspot.com
Google Talkabout - googletalk.blogspot.com

6 . Google self - censors in several countries .
You heard about how Google self - censors in China ( e.g. human rights sites top - ranked by Google in other countries are missing in Google.cn ) .
But did you know that Google showed censored search results in other countries for years , sometimes even without showing a disclaimer that something was missing ?
In Germany and France , that was the case .
You can see this for yourself if you first search Google.com for [ site:ety.com ] .
This will result in 9,940 results .
Now if you do the same search on Google .
fr – Google France – you get zero results .
However , there 's a disclaimer at the bottom :
" In response to a legal request submitted to Google , we have removed 260 result (s ) from this page .
If you wish , you may read more about the request at ChillingEffects.org . "
Note Google 's disclaimer is showing the wrong number of missing pages – it 1,000s , not 260 .
Following the link to Chilling Effects , we see this text :
Google received complaints prior to March 2005 about URLs that are alleged to be illegal under U.S. or local law .
In response to these complaints , one or more URLs that would have appeared for this search were not displayed .
In other words , Google is not censoring this out of their own belief , but by following government requests .
Now what 's ety.com anyway , except being one of the many censored domains ?
A quick glance will show it 's some kind of stupid Nazi propaganda site , illegal by some country 's standards .
But you know what Voltaire said ...
" I may disagree with what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it . "
7 . Google stopped counting their index size .
Since around 2001 , Google on their front - page were proud to show off the number of pages they search through ... a number that went from a billion and a half to over 8 billion ( according to Google ) .
Today , Google does n't show this number anymore .
Maybe Googlers – that 's what Google employees are called – realized that results quality beats results quantity .
Or maybe they just realized that by sheer numbers , competitors were winning .
In August 2005 , Yahoo in their blog announced :
As it turns out we have grown our index and just reached a significant milestone at Yahoo !
Search – our index now provides access to over 20 billion items (... ) [ including ] over 19.2 billion web documents
Today , when you want to find out about the Google index size , there 's a workaround though : search Google for [ " * * " ] – that 's a good estimate .
Right now , it 's displaying 25,270,000,000 pages .
In a direct comparison , when we search for " the " on both Google and Yahoo , Google shows a couple of billion pages more .
Then again , these numbers are hard to verify – Google only lets us see the first 1000 results for each query .
And in the end , who wants to see more than that anyway ?
Most people do n't even go beyond the first 10 results , and rather adjust their search query instead !
8. The Google API may offer over 1,000 requests .
If you 're a developer utilizing the Google web search API , and you need way beyond the 1,000 requests per day Google offers by default , here 's a tip : you can email the Google API support and request more hits for your API key .
Depending on your projects and traffic needs , which you will have to outline , Google just might grant you the request !
9 . Google comic book search .
While Google does n't have its own comic book search engine , you can still achieve good results by going to Google Images , setting the file size to " Large images " , and then searching for [ comics ] .
Using this setting , you can also search for an artist 's name , like [ " john byrne " ] , [ " john romita jr " ] , [ " frank miller " ] or [ " daniel clowes " ] .
You might even have some fun adding your own speech bubbles to the comic book pages you find ( use a free font like WebLetterer for best results ) ...
10 . Google Writely is a multi-user chat .
OK , so Writely – which Google recently acquired – is not really a chat , but an online word processor .
However , by inviting others to your Writely document , you can group - edit any document ... and see the changes by others merged into the document as you type !
This feature allows you to chat with a group , and you can have fun with positioning text on different places on the screen , wiki-editing what others wrote , or adding colors and images .
Researchers believe they have found a second code in DNA in addition to the genetic code .
The genetic code specifies all the proteins that a cell makes .
The second code , superimposed on the first , sets the placement of the nucleosomes , miniature protein spools around which the DNA is looped .
The spools both protect and control access to the DNA itself .
The discovery , if confirmed , could open new insights into the higher order control of the genes , like the critical but still mysterious process by which each type of human cell is allowed to activate the genes it needs but cannot access the genes used by other types of cell .
The new code is described in the current issue of Nature by Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute in Israel and Jonathan Widom of Northwestern University in Illinois and their colleagues .
There are about 30 million nucleosomes in each human cell .
So many are needed because the DNA strand wraps around each one only 1.65 times , in a twist containing 147 of its units , and the DNA molecule in a single chromosome can be up to 225 million units in length .

Okay , I am a TOTAL FREAK for having noticed this weird typographic pattern on 24 .
You have been warned .
My discovery of this bizarre typographic anomaly took place in a few steps over the course of several episodes , so bear with me as I explain .
I loved the first season of 24 , but I gave up on the show after the second season , because the pulled - out - of - thin - air plot twists , the hammy acting , and the fluid - as - water loyalties of the characters became increasingly maddening .
“ This show is ridiculous , ” I eventually said to myself , perhaps when drunk , because I do n’t usually talk to myself .
“ I refuse to watch it anymore . ”
But thanks to recommendations from a few enthusiastic friends , I returned to the show late in the fourth season , and now I ’m totally hooked again .
The fifth season has been fantastically entertaining .
The producers have worked out most of the kinks in the format and now know exactly what they ’re doing .
The show is still ridiculous sometimes , but that ’s part of the fun .
A few months ago I began to notice something unusual about the 24 clock — the timer that appears onscreen at regular intervals throughout each episode .
It ’s modeled on a standard LED clock , the kind you ’ll see on the radio next to your bed or the microwave in your kitchen or inside a ticking rogue nuclear weapon once you ’ve pulled off the face plate .
You know — the standard workaday places .
On a typical such clock , each number is rendered within a matrix of two vertical bars on either side and three horizontal bars in the middle .
At first glance , the 24 clock appears to be based around exactly that sort of matrix .
Here ’s a screenshot from last Monday ’s episode :
HBO continues their quest to specify what you can and cannot record to your DVR .
They ’ve been at the forefront of limiting our recording rights and are at it again , this time petitioning that subscription video - on - demand should be off - limits .
It ’s interesting that they attempt to segregate content … why should one network or type of programing be treated differently than any other ?
If you ’re piping media into my house that I ’ve paid for I intend to retain the right to copy whatever I want , whenever I want for my personal use — broadcast flag and similar legislation be damned .

My latest Business 2.0 article , The Black Box That Would Conquer Telecom , just went online over at the CNN Money website .
This is a story about a stealthy startup called Vyatta , that has build the world ’s first commercial open - source router , and how open source is slowly moving its way into the telecom world .
Vyatta ’s first product , an enterprise class router that will compete with Cisco - medium to low end offerings is currently in beta testing with some customers is based on XORP or extensible open router platform and runs off on two Intel chips .
The versatile open - source application can direct data traffic for a giant corporation as easily as it can manage a home Wi -Fi network .
And that ’s what makes it as disruptive as a leaf blower in a feather factory : Vyatta ’s router will cost about a fifth the price of comparable models from big networking equipment makers such as Cisco Systems .
Vyatta is one of the many start - ups that are bringing open source disruption to the highly profitable and closed world of networking .
While open source software movement has ravaged the bottom lines of companies like Sun Microsystems ; networking behemoths like Cisco and Juniper have continued to enjoy fat margins they earned even before the telecom crash of 2000 .
Even today , a big portion of their IT budget goes into networking gear .
Routers , switches , firewall devices , and even VPN boxes cost thousands of dollars .
“ Open - source is providing real competition to the commercial telecom companies , ” says John Todd , an open - source telephony expert .
“ It will force them to improve . ”
The scramble for open source in networking comes because two primal forces tearing the old telecom order apart .
First , the Internet - based technologies are replacing the closed legacy phone systems , thus helping the convergence of computer and the phone systems .
In old times , in order to build a networking box , companies would design specialized chips , and run specialized software on them to get the best performance .
Now you can buy extremely powerful processors like Advanced Micro Devices ’
Opteron chips for a few hundred dollars , run special networking software on them , and get similar performance .
There are nearly half - a- dozen open source projects that capitalize on the cheap processing power .
“ I used to work in Novell ’s multi protocol router group , but that failed because the chips were not fast enough , ” Chris Ranch , Director of Network Architecture at data center operator Affinity Internet .
“ But you can do it all on a good PC . ”
His company is currently using open source load balancing software running on 15 - pizza - box style servers that cost about $ 25,000 .
Similar gear from Cisco Systems or F5 Systems could have cost Affinity at least $ 750,000 .
“ Given that we making money by selling hosting services , the cost of equipment is the difference between us making money or not , ” says Ranch .
Corporations shopping for PBX systems are reaching same conclusions , and are turning to ultra- cheap boxes made by start - ups like Fonality , a Los Angeles company that packages open source Asterisk PBX software onto PCs running Linux .
But no project is as audacious as Vyatta ’s attempt to take on the highly lucrative and profitable router market .
Vyatta ’s core brains come from XORP , a software router project started at ICSI in Berkeley back in January 2001 .
Atanu Ghosh a British - born researcher who works on the project points out that the software can be scaled down to run a simple enough home router on one end of the spectrum , to large - scale data network on the other extreme .
“ It is easy for third parties to extend the software , and I think people will come up with ideas to extend it , ” says Ghosh .
The biggest interest in XORP and future Vyatta products will be in emerging economies like China and India , which are not cash rich , but have broadband ambitions .
No one wants to pay for expensive commercial routers .
“ In the near future there would be ad - hoc networks on a person , and that could conceivably need a router with a tiny footprint , like XORP , ” Ghosh predicts .
In a Q&A session following the platform keynote address at GDC 2006 this morning , Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios President Phil Harrison confirmed what was heavily demanded for import gamers all over the world , and yet previously thought unthinkable for a major corporation : the PS3 will be region - free for gaming .
The move was not unexpected , as SCE had previously mentioned considering the possibility of opening up the region structure for PS3 software ( the newly - released PSP system does n't use a region code for games already , but that 's more of a standard for portable titles than a new development ) .
This system is , amongst other things , hoped to combat piracy -- many import fans " chip " their consoles with region - free mods to play import games , and while that desire has some legitimacy , it also opens the doors for pirates to release illegal copies of games .
( Funnily enough , it 's most often easier to run illegal games on a console than it is to run legit games from other countries due to the way most mod chips work , leading to a slippery slope for importers hoping to stay legit but finding the road difficult to maneuver . )
Region - free gaming also allows publishers to release titles across the globe simultaneously , either through e-distribution or on disc .
The capacity of Blu - Ray had previously been mentioned to allow for multiple languages of a game to be encoded onto the same massive - capacity disc .
The one caveat of this new region - free structure is that games made for specific regions ' electrical and TV standards may have problems on your TV set .
A PAL PS3 game , for instance , will have difficulty running on an NTSC TV , unless the developers have thought ahead and planned for that issue .
It is currently unknown how the PS3 will cope with this problem ( whether there will be a warning when you run an import about possible TV incompatibility , or if there might be a no-play screen for incompatible games depending on your PS3's TV settings . )
Luckily , modern HDTV standards go a long way towards making that problem moot .
Also , games made in other countries will naturally only have the text and dialog it is programmed with -- so do n't pre-order all of those Japanese RPGs and Dragon Ball Z games too fast if you do n't know a lick of kanji ( English will only be in if the developers have planned for it , though it 's unknown if there will be any type of " patching " system for multi-language releases , although that might be possible on supported games post - release now that the PS3 is carrying its massive HDD and flash memory support . )
We 'll have more details on how this impacts publishers and importers as soon as we know more about SCE 's plans for region - free PS3 gaming .
A US net entrepreneur has solved his lack of advertising budget problem by paying beggars to stand motionless beside Seattle Highway exit ramps with ads proclaiming his wares , the Seattle Post Intelligencer reports .
Ben Rogovy , 22 , wanted to promote his website for poker fans , but was a bit short in the wonga department .
Inspiration struck , however , when he was looking at a cardboard sign commonly held by bums hoping for a hand - out beside the city 's freeway exits .
Rogovy explained : " So much traffic goes by these sign holders , I thought , ' Would n't it be cool if they could advertise themselves and me at the same time ? ' "
He then hit the streets in search of bums willing to add his poster to their own advertising material .
He recalled : " I was a little nervous when I walked up to the first guy .
I was expecting all kinds of questions , but the first thing he asked was , ' Do you have any tape ? '
He understood exactly what I wanted to do . "
Rogovy now has around 12 vagrants " Bumvertising " his site .
He pays them " a bit of food and water , plus $ 1 to $ 5 , according to each beggar 's relative value , based largely on traffic patterns " .
Rogovy admitted : " I am fascinated by these people , out there from dawn to dusk .
Some of them were working longer days than I was . "
Naturally , homeless rights campaigners are up in arms about the whole thing , dubbing Merc - driving Rogovy a " poverty pimp " and calling Bumvertising " craven exploitation " .
He is unconcerned , and concluded : " Possibly insensitive .
Definitely accurate . " ®
Dr. Sames added : " I would not do anything like this lightly .
To retract a paper is very difficult for any scientist . "
Dr. Sezen , now a doctoral student in another field at the University of Heidelberg in Germany , has vigorously disputed the retractions .
She said she had not been told that the papers were being withdrawn , and she questioned whether other members of Dr. Sames 's group had even tried to repeat the experiments .
The retraction of one paper , published in the journal Organic Letters in 2003 , appears today .
The three others were published in The Journal of the American Chemical Society in 2002 and 2003 , and the retractions will appear later this month .
Columbia has opened an inquiry into why the experiments were not reproducible .
The research in question lies in an esoteric field known as carbon - hydrogen bond activation .
But the ability to manipulate precisely the bonds between hydrogen and carbon atoms in molecules could lead to important practical applications .
For example , scientists might one day be able to change simple hydrocarbon molecules like methane into more complex ones like those in plastic and pharmaceuticals .
In e-mail messages yesterday , Dr. Sezen said that other members of Dr. Sames 's group had not followed detailed procedures for the experiments and that the catalysts needed to shepherd the chemical reactions had not been made .

The Linux Kernel : It ’s Worth More !
David A. Wheeler
This paper refines Ingo Molnar ’s estimate of the development effort it would take to redevelop Linux kernel version 2.6 .
Molnar ’s rough estimate found it would cost $ 176M ( US ) to redevelop the Linux kernel using traditional proprietary approaches .
By using a more detailed cost model and much more information about the Linux kernel , I found that the effort would be closer to $ 612M ( US ) to redevelop the Linux kernel as it existed in 2004 .
A postscript lists some recalculations since then , showing that these values have grown .
In any case , the Linux kernel is clearly worth far more than the $ 50,000 offered in 2004 .
On October 7 , 2004 , Jeff V. Merkey made the following offer on the linux .
kernel mailing list :
We offer to kernel.org the sum of $ 50,000.00 US for a one time license to the Linux Kernel Source for a single snapshot of a single Linux version by release number .
This offer must be accepted by ** ALL ** copyright holders and this snapshot will subsequently convert the GPL license into a BSD style license for the code .
Many respondents noted that this proposal was unworkable , because it required complete agreement by all copyright holders .
Not only would such a process be lengthy , but many copyright holders made it clear in various replies that they would not agree to any such plan .
Many Linux kernel developers expect improved versions of their code to be continuously available to them , and a release using a BSD - style license would violate those developers ’ expectations .
Indeed , it was clear that many respondants felt that such a move would strip the Linux kernel of legal protections against someone who wanted to monopolize a derived version of the kernel .
Many open source software / Free software ( OSS / FS ) developers allow conversion of their OSS / FS programs to a proprietary program ; some even encourage it .
The BSD - style licenses are specifically designed to allow conversion of an OSS / FS program into a proprietary program .
However , the GPL is the most popular OSS / FS license , and it was specifically designed to prevent this .
Based on the thread responses , it ’s clear that many Linux kernel developers prefer that the GPL continue to be used as the Linux kernel license .
In addition , many people were suspicious about the motives for this offer .
Groklaw published an article that mentioned this proposal , and noted that someone with the same name is listed on a patent recently obtained by the Canopy Group .
SCO is a Canopy Group company , and I have since confirmed that the patent application refers to the same person .
Groklaw later tried to learn more about him .
I do n’t really know why Merkey made this proposal , and it does n’t really matter .
What ’s more interesting to me is the questions that this raised , namely , how much is Linux “ worth ” ?
That is a valid question !
In one of the responses , Ingo Molnar calculated the cost to re-develop the Linux kernel using my tool SLOCCount .
Molnar did n’t specify exactly which version of the Linux kernel he used , but he did note that it was in the version 2.6 line , and presumably it was a recent version as of October 2004 .
He found that “ the Linux 2.6 kernel , if developed from scratch as commercial software , takes at least this much effort under the default COCOMO model ” :
Total Physical Source Lines of Code ( SLOC ) = 4,287,449 Development Effort Estimate , Person - Years ( Person - Months ) = 1,302.68 ( 15,632 ) ( Basic COCOMO model , Person - Months = 2.4 * ( KSLOC **1.05 ) ) Schedule Estimate , Years ( Months ) = 8.17 ( 98.10 ) ( Basic COCOMO model , Months = 2.5 * ( person - months * * 0.38 ) ) Estimated Average Number of Developers ( Effort / Schedule ) = 159.35 Total Estimated Cost to Develop = $ 175,974,824 ( average salary = $ 56,286 / year , overhead = 2.40 ) .
SLOCCount is Open Source Software / Free Software , licensed under the FSF GPL .
Please credit this data as " generated using David A. Wheeler 's ' SLOCCount ' . "
After noting the redevelopment cost of $ 176M ( US ) , Ingo Molnar then commented , “ and you want an unlimited license for $ 0.05 M ?
What is this , the latest variant of the Nigerian / 419 scam ? ”
Strictly speaking , the value of a product is n’t the same as the cost of developing it .
For example , if no one wants to use a software product , then it has no value , no matter how much was spent in developing it .
The value of a proprietary software product to its vendor can be estimated by computing the amount of money that the vendor will receive from it over all future time ( via sales , etc. ) , minus the costs ( development , sustainment , etc. ) over that same time period -- but predicting the future is extremely difficult , and the Linux kernel is n’t a proprietary product anyway .
Estimating value to users is difficult , and in fact , value estimation is surprisingly difficult to compute directly .
But if a software product is used widely , so much so that you ’d be willing to redevelop it , then development costs are a reasonable way to estimate the lower bound of its value .
After all , if you ’re willing to redevelop a program , then it must have at least that value .
The Linux kernel is widely used , so its redevelopment costs will at least give you a lower bound of its value .
Thus , Molnar ’s response is quite correct -- offering $ 50 K for something that would cost at about $ 176 M to redevelop is ludicrous .
It ’s true that the kernel developers could continue to develop the Linux kernel after a BSD - style release , after all , the *BSD operating systems do this now .
But with a BSD - style release , someone else could take the code and establish a competing proprietary product , and it would take time for the kernel developers to add enough additional material to compete with such a product .
It ’s not clear that a proprietary vendor could really pick up the Linux kernel and maintain the same pace without many of the original developers , but that ’s a different matter .
Certainly , the scale of the difference between $ 176 M and $ 50 K is enough to see that the offer is not very much , compared to what the offerer is trying to buy .
But in fact , it ’s even sillier than it appears ; I believe the cost to redevelop the Linux kernel would actually be much greater than this .
Molnar correctly notes that he used the default Basic COCOMO model for cost estimation .
This is the default cost model for SLOCCount , because it ’s a reasonable model for rough estimates about typical applications .
It ’s also a reasonable default when you ’re examining a large set of software programs at once , since the ranges of real efforts should eventually average out ( this is the approach I used in my More than a Gigabuck paper ) .
So , what Molnar did was perfectly reasonable for getting a rough order of magnitude of effort .
But since there ’s only one program being considered in this analysis -- the Linux kernel -- we can use a more detailed model to get a more accurate cost estimate .
I was curious what the answer would be .
So I ’ve estimated the effort to create the Linux kernel , using a more detailed cost model .
This paper shows the results -- and it shows that redeveloping the Linux kernel would cost even more .
This estimate is what it would cost to rebuild a particular version , and not exactly the same as the effort actually invested into the kernel .
In particular , in Linux kernel development , a common practice is to have a “ bake - off ” where competing ideas are all implemented and then measured ; the approach with the best result ( e.g. , faster ) is then used .
Bake - offs have much to commend them , but since only one approach is actually included , the effort invested in the alternatives is n’t included in this estimate .
To get better accuracy in our estimation , we need to use a more detailed estimation model .
An obvious alternative , and the one I ’ll use , is the Intermediate COCOMO model .
This model requires more information than the Basic COCOMO model , but it can produce higher - accuracy estimations if you can provide the data it needs .
We ’ll also use the version of COCOMO that uses physical SLOC ( since we do n’t have the logical SLOC counts ) .
If you do n’t want to know the details , feel free to skip to the next section labelled “ results ” .
First , we now need to determine if this is an “ organic ” , “ embedded ” , or “ semidetached ” application .
The Linux kernel is clearly not an organic application ; organic applications have a small software team developing software in a familiar , in - house environment , without significant communication overheads , and allow hard requirements to be negotiated away .
It could be argued that the Linux kernel is embedded , since it often operates in tight constraints ; but in practice these constraints are n’t very tight , and the kernel project can often negotiate requirements to a limited extent ( e.g. , providing only partial support for a particular peripheral or motherboard if key documentation is lacking ) .
While the Linux kernel developers do n’t ignore resource constraints , there are no specific constraints that the developers feel are strictly required .
Thus , it appears that the kernel should be considered a “ semidetached ” system ; this is the intermediate stage between organic and embedded .
“ Semidetached ” is n’t a very descriptive word , but that ’s the word used by the cost model so we ’ll use it here .
It really just means between the two extremes of organic and embedded .
The intermediate COCOMO model also requires a number of additional parameters .
Here are those parameters , and their values for the Linux kernel ( as I perceive them ) ; the parameter values are based on Software Engineering Economics by Barry Boehm :
RELY : Required software reliability : High ( 1.15 ) .
The Linux kernel is now used in situations where crashes can cause high financial loss .
Even more importantly , Linux kernel developers expect the kernel to be highly reliable , and the kernel undergoes extensive worldwide off - nominal testing .
While the testing approach is different than traditional testing regimes , it clearly produces a highly reliable result ( see the Reliability section of my paper Why OSS / FS ?
Look at the Numbers ! ) .
the kernel to be highly reliable , and the kernel undergoes extensive worldwide off - nominal testing .
While the testing approach is different than traditional testing regimes , it clearly produces a highly reliable result ( see the Reliability section of my paper Why OSS / FS ?
Look at the Numbers ! ) .
DATA : Data base size : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
Typically the Linux kernel manages far larger data bases ( file systems ) than itself , but it handles them as somewhat opaque contents , so it ’s questionable that those larger sizes can really be counted as being much greater than nominal .
Handling the filesystems ’ metadata is itself somewhat complicated , and does take significant effort , but filesystem management is only one of many things that the kernel does .
So , absent more specific data , we ’ll claim it ’s nominal .
If we claim it ’s higher , and there ’s reason for doing so , that would increase the estimated effort .
CPLX : Product complexity : Extra high ( 1.65 ) .
The kernel must perform multiple resource handling with dynamically changing priorities : multiple processes / tasks running on potentially multiple processors , with multiple kinds of memory , accessing peripherals which also have various dynamic priorities .
The kernel must deal with device timing - dependent coding , and with highly coupled dynamic data structures ( some of whose structure is imposed by hardware ) .
In addition , it implements routines for interrupt servicing and masking , as well as multi-processor threading and load balancing .
The kernel does have an internal design structure , which helps manage complexity somewhat , but in the end no design can eliminate the essential complexity of the task today ’s kernels are asked to perform .
It ’s true that toy kernels are n’t as complex ; requiring single processors , forbidding re-entry , ignoring resource contention issues , ignoring error conditions , and a variety of other simplifications can make a kernel much easier to build , at the cost of poor performance .
But the Linux kernel is no toy .
Real - world operating system kernels are considered extremely difficult to develop , for a litany of good reasons .
TIME : Execution time constraint : High ( 1.11 ) .
Although it does n’t need to stay at less than 70 % resource use , performance is an important design criteria , and much effort has been spent on measuring and improving performance .
an important design criteria , and much effort has been spent on measuring and improving performance .
STOR : Main storage constraint : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
Although there has been some effort to limit memory use ( e.g. , 4 K kernel stacks ) , Linux kernel development has not been strongly constrained by memory .
VIRT : Virtual machine volatility : High ( 1.15 ) .
The most common processor ( x86 ) does n’t change that quickly , though new releases by Intel and AMD do need to be taken into account .
The Linux kernel is also influenced by other processor architectures , which in the aggregate change quite a bit over time .
Even more importantly , the other components of underlying machines ( such as motherboards , peripheral and bus interfaces , etc. ) change on a weekly basis .
Often the documentation is unavailable , and when available , it ’s sometimes wrong ( which from a developer ’s point of view looks like a volatile interface , since it keeps changing ) .
The Linux kernel developers spend a vast amount of time identifying hardware limitations / problems and working around them .
What ’s worse , there ’s a variety of different hardware , and new ones keep arriving .
The kernel developers do attempt to control things where they can .
For example , while they try to write code that works with a variety of gcc versions , they limit themselves to one compiler ( gcc ) , designate an official gcc version , and try to limit when official gcc versions are changed .
But these measures cannot hide the fact that the interface of the underlying machine is actually quite volatile .
TURN : Computer turnaround time : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
Kernel recompilation and rebooting are n’t interactive , but they ’re reasonably fast on 2 + GHz processors .
Once the first compilation has occurred , recompilation is usually quite quick for localized changes .
Thus , there ’s no reason for this to be a penalty .
ACAP : Analyst capability : High ( 0.86 ) .
It appears that the people analyzing the system , identifying the “ real ” requirements , and the needed design modifications to support them , are significantly better at doing this than the industry average .
This analysis tends to be more distributed than in a typical proprietary project , but it obviously still occurs .
AEXP : Applications experience : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
It ’s difficult to determine how much experience with the Linux kernel the software developers of the Linux kernel have .
Clearly , if you modify the same program day after day for many years , you ’ll tend to become more efficient at modifying it .
Some developers , such as Linus Torvalds and Alan Cox , clearly have a vast amount of experience in modifying the Linux kernel .
But for many other kernel developers it is n’t clear that they have a vast amount of experience modifying the Linux kernel .
In absence of better information , I ’ve chosen nominal .
This suggests that on average , developers of the Linux kernel have about 3 years ’ full - time experience in modifying the Linux kernel .
More experience on average would help , and lower the effort estimation somewhat .
PCAP : Programmer capability : High ( 0.86 ) .
Modern kernels such as Linux are complex , creating a strong barrier against attempts to contribute by less capable developers .
Would - be contributors must convince the existing experts that their work is worthwhile , so new contributors ’ works are normally revised by highly capable developers .
Key kernel developers are not accepted as such unless they convince the other , already highly capable developers that they are also capable .
Generally only highly capable , above - average developers ( 75th percentile or more ) will be successful at helping to develop the Linux kernel .
VEXP : Virtual machine experience : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
The x86 processors , which are by far the most popular for the Linux kernel , are relatively stable and kernel developers have a lot of experience with them .
But they are not completely stable ( e.g. , the new 64 - bit extensions for x86 and the NX bit ) , which can also reduce experience slightly .
Authors of ports to other processors also tend to be experienced with those processors .
On the other hand , most of the kernel ’s code is in its hardware drivers , and this hardware often acts as a virtual machine as well as a needed interface .
Many driver developers , while experienced in general , often have less experience with the particular component they ’re writing a driver for .
In particular , many drivers are not written by companies that produce the hardware , and the developers often do n’t have good documentation to help them .
Sometimes this has helpful side - effects .
It can help unify how hardware is handled , since the kernel developers who are writing drivers for several similar peripherals will often develop a way to unify their handling and apparant interface .
It can also have aid reliability in the long term , since the driver writers undrerstand how the kernel works ( Windows drivers tend to be written by hardware companies who understand their product but have less knowledge about Windows , and since their code is often not peer reviewed by Windows developers , many Windows drivers can cause the entire operating system to crash ) .
But this initial lack of information by Linux kernel developers about the components does increase the effort to develop a driver .
What ’s worse , hardware components are notorious for not operating as their specifications proclaim , and the kernel ’s job is to hide all that .
Thus , this is averaged as nominal , and this is probably being generous .

LEXP : Programming language experience : High ( 0.95 ) .
MODP : Modern programming practices : High - in general use ( 0.91 ) .
This program is written in C , which lacks structures such as exception handling , so there is extensive use of “ goto ” ( etc. ) to implement error handling .
However , the use of such constructs tends to be highly stylized and structured , so credit is given for using modern practices .
Some might claim that this is giving too much credit , but changing this would only make the estimated effort even larger .
TOOL : Use of software tools : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
SCED : Required development schedule : Nominal ( 1.0 ) .
There is little schedule pressure per se , so the “ most natural ” speed is followed .
So now we can compute a new estimate for how much effort it would take to re-develop the Linux kernel 2.6 :
MM-nominal - semidetached = 3*( KSLOC ) ^1.12 = = 3 * ( 4287.449 ) ^1.12 = 35,090 MM Effort - adjustment = 1.15 * 1.0 * 1.65 * 1.11 * 1.0 * 1.15 * 1.0 * 0.86 * 1.0 * 0.86 * 1.0 * 0.95 * 0.91 * 1.0 * 1.0 = 1.54869 MM- adjusted = 35,090 * 1.54869 = 54,343.6 Man-Months = 4,528.6
Man -years of effort to ( re ) develop
If average salary = $ 56,286 / year , and overhead = 2.40 , then : Development cost = 56286*2.4*4528.6 = $ 611,757,037
In short , it would actually cost about $ 612 million ( US ) to re-develop the Linux kernel .
Why is this estimate so much larger than Molnar ’s original estimate ?
The answer is that SLOCCount presumes that it ’s dealing with an “ average ” piece of software ( i.e. , a typical application ) unless it ’s given parameters that tell it otherwise .
This is usually a reasonable default ; almost nothing is as hard to develop as an operating system kernel .
But operating system kernels are so much harder to develop that , if you include that difficulty into the calculation , the effort estimations go way up .
This difficulty shows up in the nominal equation - semidetached is fundamentally harder , and thus has a larger exponent in its estimation equation than the default for basic COCOMO .
This difficulty also shows up in factors such as “ complexity ” ; the task the kernel does is fundamentally hard .
The strong capabilities of analysts and developers , use of modern practices , and programming language experience all help , but they can only partly compensate ; it ’s still very hard to develop a modern operating system kernel .
This difference is smoothed over in my paper More than a Gigabuck because that paper includes a large number of applications .
Some of the applications would cost less than was estimated , while others would cost more ; in general you ’d expect that by computing the costs over many programs the differences would be averaged out .
Providing that sort of information for every program would have been too time - consuming for the limited time I had available to write that paper , and I often did n’t have that much information anyway .
If I do such a study again , I might treat the kernel specially , since the kernel ’s size and complexity makes it reasonable to treat specially .
SLOCCount actually has options that allow you to provide the parameters for more accurate estimates , if you have the information they need and you ’re willing to take the time to provide them .
Since the nominal factor is 3 , the adjustment for this situation is 1.54869 , and the exponent for semidetached projects is 1.12 , just providing SLOCCount with the option “ -- effort 4.646 1.12 ” would have created a more accurate estimate .
But as you can see , it takes much more work to use this more detailed estimation model , which is why many people do n’t do it .
For many situations , a rough estimate is really all you need ; Molnar certainly did n’t need a more exact estimate to make his point .
And being able to give a rough estimate when given little information is quite useful .
In the end , Ingo Molnar ’s response is still exactly correct .
Offering $ 50 K for something that would cost millions to redevelop , and is actively used and supported , is absurd .
It ’s interesting to note that there are already several kernels with BSD licenses : the * BSDs ( particularly FreeBSD , OpenBSD , and NetBSD ) .
These are fine operating systems for many purposes , indeed , my website once ran on OpenBSD .
But clearly , if there is a monetary offer to buy Linux code , the Linux kernel developers must be doing something right .
Certainly , from a market share perspective , Linux - based systems are far more popular than systems based on the * BSD kernels .
If you just want a kernel licensed under a BSD - style license , you know where to find them . *
It ’s worth noting that these approaches only estimate development cost , not value .
All proprietary developers invest in development with the presumption that the value of the resulting product ( as captured from license fees , support fees , etc. ) will exceed the development cost -- if not , they ’re out of business .
Thus , since the Linux kernel is being actively sustained , it ’s only reasonable to presume that its value far exceeds this development estimate .
In fact , the kernel ’s value probably well exceeds this estimate of simply redevelopment cost .
It ’s also worth noting that the Linux kernel has grown substantially .
That ’s not surprising , given the explosion in the number of peripherals and situations that it supports .
In Estimating Linux ’s size , I used a Linux distribution released in March 2000 , and found that the Linux kernel had 1,526,722 physical source lines of code .
In More than a Gigabuck , the Linux distribution had been released on April 2001 , and its kernel ( version 2.4.2 ) was 2,437,470 physical source lines of code ( SLOC ) .
At that point , this Linux distribution would have cost more than $ 1 Billion ( a Gigabuck ) to redevelop .
The much newer and larger Linux kernel considered here , with far more drivers and capabilities than the one in that paper , now has 4,287,449 physical source lines of code , and is starting to approach a Gigabuck of effort all by itself .
If the kernel reaches 6,648,956 lines of code ( ($ 1E9 / $ 56286/2.4*12/3/1.54869 ) ^ ( 1/1.12 ) ) given the other assumptions it ’ll represent a billion dollars of effort all by itself .
And that ’s just the kernel , which is only part of a working system .
There are other components that were n’t included More than a Gigabuck ( such as OpenOffice.org ) that are now common in Linux distributions , which are also large and represent massive investments of effort .
More than a Gigabuck noted the massive rise in size and scale of OSS / FS systems , and that distributions were rapidly growing in invested effort ; this brief analysis is evidence that the trend continues .
In short , the amount of effort that today ’s OSS / FS programs represent is rather amazing .
Carl Sagan ’s phrase “ billions and billions , ” which he applied to astronomical objects , easily applies to the effort ( measured in U.S. dollars ) now invested in OSS / FS programs .
I ’d like to thank Ingo Molnar for doing the original analysis ( using SLOCCount ) that triggered this paper .
Indeed , I ’m always delighted to see people doing analysis instead of just guesswork .
Thanks for doing the analysis !
This paper is not in any way an attack on Molnar ’s work ; Molnar computed a quick estimate , and this paper simply uses more data to refine his effort estimation further .
Also , I ’d like to tip my hat to Charles Babcock ’s October 19 , 2007 article “ Linux Will Be Worth $ 1 Billion In First 100 Days of 2009 ” .
He noticed that , by my calculations , if the Linux kernel ever reached 6.6 million lines of code , it would be worth more than $ 1 billion in terms of equivalent , commercial development costs .
Using the current size and growth rates of the Linux kernel , he examined the trend lines and found that “ Sometime during the first 100 days of 2009 , Linux will cross the 6.6 million lines of code mark and $ 1 billion in value . ”
In 2010 , researchers re-did the analysis , and found that it had crossed this milestone .
Jesus Garcia - Garcia and Ma Isabel Alonso de Magdaleno found that the then - latest version ( 2.6.30 ) of the Linux kernel would cost an estimated EUR 1,025,553,430 to re-develop ; at the exchange rate of 1.3499 U.S. Dollars per Euro of 2010 - 02 - 25 ( reported by Yahoo finance ) , this becomes about $ 1.4 billion .
The Linux kernel keeps growing ; as of March 7 , 2011 , it would cost approximately $ 3 billion USD to redevelop using this estimation method .
Of course , the real story is n’t the exact numbers , it ’s that instead of disappearing , FLOSS programs like the Linux kernel are thriving .
Zwiebelfisch Verwirrender Vonitiv
Grammatik ist nicht jedermanns Sache , das Deklinieren schon gar nicht .
Darum wird ein Fall immer beliebter : der Vonitiv .
Der Name sagt Ihnen nichts ?
Sie kennen ihn bestimmt !
Der Vonitiv ist der Tod von dem Genitiv .
It 's my favorite new adjective .
Aspergery .
I came across it while reading Time Magazine 's series of autism articles .
In one of the articles , The Geek Syndrome , reporter J. Madeleine Nash writes , " There is no question that many successful people — not just scientists and engineers but writers and lawyers as well — possess a suite of traits that seem to be , for lack of a better word , Aspergery . "
I 'm currently making a career move from teaching kids with a range of disabilities to exclusively teaching kids with autism .
Why ?
While other teachers seem to get exasperated by their students with Asperger 's and autism , I get along with them easily .
I really do n't get the problem .
These kids are amazing .
Who would n't want to teach them ?
At the beginning of the semester , I was warned by several teachers about Jeremy , a 9th grade " troublemaker . "
Teachers apparently could n't control him .
One teacher said , " I just do n't know what his problem is . "
This is why EVERY teacher needs special ed training .
I realized within two minutes of meeting Jeremy that he has a classic case of Asperger's .
As yet another example of the stellar special ed services in the South Bronx , Jeremy , despite having a very clear IEP indicating that he should be in small classes , had been placed in large high school classes with no special ed support .
According to a guidance counselor , Jeremy 's IEP had been " lost in the shuffle . "
He was n't placed in my class until spring semester .
Jeremy is wonderful .
I hang out with him during lunch .
He fixes the classroom computers and shares his unique life insights .
One of his more colorful insights came during a fixation on breakfast cereals : " Apple Jacks make sense .
I realized that this morning .
They make sense .
They just do . "
( He went on for about 15 minutes . )
Jeremy also easily passed the Living Environment Regents exam on his first try .
Although I try not to show favorites , the other kids are obviously becoming jealous of my relationship with Jeremy .
One day , hyperactive Christopher began banging on my classroom door during lunch .
Jeremy was absent that day .
When I ignored Christopher 's banging , he shouted , " If I was Jeremy Stevens you would let me in !!! "
( Christopher actually banged out each syllable of the sentence on the door as he yelled this - we'd had a grammar lesson earlier that day . )
What can I say ?
He was right .
I love kids with autism , and I know that teaching them is what I want to do with my life .
As I 've begun to interact more with my students with autism , I 've also begun to realize that there is a reason I understand and get along so well with them .
I 'm a bit Aspergery myself .
I would certainly never claim to have any form of autism , because I do n't , but mild Obsessive Compulsive Disorder does seem to run in my family , and I believe OCD and Asperger 's are neurologically linked .
In his brilliant portrayal of an OCD - inflicted detective on the hit USA show Monk , Tony Shalhoub shows us just how quirky , exhausting and lovable people with severe OCD can be .
Some Monk fans believe Shalhoub 's performance more closely resembles a person with Asperger 's or high functioning autism .
In any case , Detective Adrian Monk reminds me of Jeremy .
A lot .
He also reminds me , to a lesser extent , of my sister , several friends , and - oh crap ! - myself .
I suspect there are many people out there who have more Aspergery minds than they 're willing to admit .
Taking a look at my own mind helps me better understand my students with autism .
I recently began working with Pre-K kids in their homes .
One four - year old girl lines up all her stuffed animals on her bed in a particular order , and she has a tantrum when they 're out of order .
( We 're working on this . )
Another student fixates on symbols .
On the playground , while his non-autistic classmates naturally socialize and play together , this boy naturally gravitates toward every letter or number to be found on the playground - usually on signs .
This is in some ways great because he 's learning to read at an unusually early age .
But it 's not so great when he socially isolates himself .
Like Adrian
Monk says , " It 's a blessing .
And a curse . "
Hanging out with these kids has helped me recall some of my own childhood ' quirks . '
Like many of my students , I have hypersensitive hearing , and I 've always been easily overwhelmed by certain noises .
I used to get unusually upset by seemingly minor sounds around the house .
I also remember fixating on symbols , creating patterns , and repeating them in my head when I was a kid .
I used to sit in my childhood living room , stare at the digital clock on the VCR , and repeat in my head , " Eight flash flash ten .
Eight flash flash ten . "
The " flash flash " came from the blinking colon on the digital clock .
Who even notices that ?
I also remember fixating on street signs while sitting in the back of the family car and having to repeat , " Stop ahead , stop ahead , stop line , stop " eight times before reaching a stop sign .
( There was a " Stop Ahead " sign , then " Stop Ahead " was also written on the road , then " Stop " was written on the road , then there was a white line on the road , and then , finally , there was the stop sign .
Thus , " Stop ahead , stop ahead , stop line , stop . " )
I 'm not sure what I thought would happen to me if I did n't repeat this phrase eight times , but I just had to do it .
I think it started when I was eight .
As many girls do , I kept these things hidden , and no one knew what was going on in my mind .
( I believe both autism and OCD are under - diagnosed in girls . )
I still occasionally catch myself memorizing a license plate for no apparent reason or washing my hands far too many times .
I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to check the alarm clock that I already checked ten times before falling asleep .
Of course , my apartment locks can never be checked too often .
Sound familiar ?
I think we all , to some extent , have minds that cause us to do seemingly bizarre , repetitive things from time to time .
We all have our neuroses .
( And I 'm willing to bet that those who spend time in the blogosphere have them even more so than others . )
I 'm one of the lucky ones .
My life has not been held hostage by OCD , Asperger 's , or any form of autism .
I believe fewer lives would be if , rather than judging and fearing children with neurological disorders , more people - especially more educators - were willing to take a look at their own minds and see how much they have in common with these kids .
Often , when I tell people I teach kids with autism , they 'll say things like , " Oh I could never do that .
It would be too sad . "
Sad ?!
I do n't find it the least bit sad .
Kids with autism are amazing .
Frankly , there 's something sad about people who do n't get that .
The characters and behavior of the few known liquid bomb suspects are completely inconsistent with any notion that they were preparing to kill themselves in acts of mass terror - mirroring the pre-attack demeanor of the 7/7 patsies .
A CCTV image ( top ) shows one of the suspects , Tayib Rauf , entering a bulk order supermarket in Birmingham just two hours before anti-terror police swooped in to grab him for his alleged role in a plot to bomb ten transatlantic airliners .
What were the tools of terror Rauf was acquiring before his kamikaze death mission ?
Knives ?
Peroxide to make the deadly liquid bomb ?
Cameras to detonate the bombs ?
No - he was buying cakes .
" Does this look like the kind of person planning such a plot ?
He does n't look like he 's about to blow himself up , " the owner of the store told the London Mirror .
Rauf chatted with the owner , who said he was more concerned about his father 's confectionary business than the fact that he was about to aid in the mid-air slaughter of 3,000 people .
Any two - bit psychologist can tell you that this individual 's behavior completely belies the notion that his life is about to come to an end .
That in itself exposes the alleged plot for the monumental fraud it is .
Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray has also highlighted the limited capabilities and intent of the suspects - proof he says that the alert was government propaganda from a cabal that yearns for a " new 9/11 . "
" None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb .
None had bought a plane ticket .
Many did not even have passports , which given the efficiency of the UK Passport Agency would mean they could n't be a plane bomber for quite some time , " said Murray .
Again we hear the same story over and over - they had young families , they were not political , they were active members of the community , everyone liked them whatever race , they loved football , they planned to be doctors , they had future prospects .
Is this an inside joke ?
MI5 can't even find some angry Muslim loners with criminal records to at least make it appear as if they would have any motive to carry out these attacks ?
It 's such a blatant ruse you wonder if they are doing it on purpose to send a message - that everyone should live in fear of a dawn raid from the terror cops .
The evidence that the London bombers knew they were about to die was so flimsy that newspapers and even the London Metropolitan Police concluded that they were unwitting dupes .
" A Metropolitan Police counter terrorist expert told a seminar that the four terrorists - Mohammad Sidique Khan , 30 , Shehzad Tanweer , 22 , Germaine Lindsay , 19 , and Hasib Hussain , 18 , - did not fit the preconceived terrorist profile . "
The bombers purchased return tickets , played cricket , ate Big Macs , and had arguments with members of the public in the hours before the attacks took place .
They left no suicide notes .
" I 've seen the CCTV footage of these people .
They do not appear to be on their way to commit any crime at all .
The Russell Square bomber [ Hasib Hussain ] is actually seen going into shops and bumping into people [ prior to his attack ] , " the expert said .
The bombers were described by friends as as four " nice lads " , " normal kids who played basketball and kicked a ball around . "
A week after the liquid bomb alert and we still have no motive and no evidence that suggests these individuals are anything other than unfortunate fall guys for Blair 's latest act of psychological warfare against the British people .
But it 's a battle of information that is increasingly swinging away from baseless fearmongering and in favor of the truth .
BBC and British newspaper website forums have been swamped with people expressing their incredulousness about the reality of the latest so - called threat .
A London Guardian journalist in an article today highlights how he traveled the country and found widespread skepticism about the real nature of the alert amongst British citizens - with only tourists wholeheartedly trusting the government .
Assertions that the alert is nothing more than political propaganda have also been echoed by commentators and journalists themselves , following a rash of articles in broadsheet newspapers that scoff at the much vaunted scope of the alleged plot .
It appears some breaking news came out that IronRuby was unveiled at MIX07 .

In the short term , the site will not show video from established media companies , even though it does so on its main Web site , Blinkx.com , with the companies ' permission .
Mr. Chandratillake said the company was calling on broadcasters and production companies to sign them up , but he acknowledged that it might not be an easy sell initially .
For one thing , companies like CNN may not want their video clips wedged between those of two amateur journalists .
But media companies also want to be paid for their video , of course , so they will have to work through details about how to insert advertisements , pay - per- view mechanisms and subscription buttons , and how to share the proceeds .
In the near future , Blinkx will introduce methods for marketers to run ads between clips , and for the producers of the videos to share in those revenues .
The granddaddy of the online video market , pornography , will eventually be included in the Blinkx mix , but not initially .
" This is an experiment , so we do n't want to be dragged down that path , " Mr. Chandratillake said .
When porn producers do join the ranks , he said , users will be able to block such content .
Mr. Weiner of Gartner said Blinkx 's new site " moves them to the head of the group of companies looking at TV - type content over the Web . "
That group , he said , includes the Open Media Network , Veoh Networks and DAVE.TV , among others .
Of those , the Open Media Network ( omn.org ) is farthest along in its efforts .
The nonprofit company , which got started in April , is the brainchild of Mike Homer , who co-founded Kontiki , a software company that helps companies like Ernst & Young show full - screen , high - resolution videos on their Intranets .
Open Media Network relies on Kontiki 's software to deliver videos of similar quality free to users .
Because the video company 's mission is to promote public broadcasting , users choose among video clips from public TV stations -- about 350 of them , and counting -- as well as videos submitted by amateurs .
Mr. Homer said users were fed relevant videos when they typed in keywords , but in the future the site would push to the top of a user 's search results items that were similar to those the user had watched , and rated highly , in the past .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday strongly limited the power of the Bush administration to conduct military tribunals for suspected terrorists imprisoned at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The 5 - 3 ruling means officials will have to come up with a new policy to prosecute at least 10 so - called " enemy combatants " awaiting trial .
It does not address the government 's right to detain suspects .
The case was a major test of President Bush 's authority as commander in chief during war .
Bush has aggressively asserted the power of the government to capture , detain and prosecute suspected terrorists in the wake of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
( Watch analyst say administration has to start over -- 3:50 )
At the center of the dispute was a Yemeni man , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , captured in Afghanistan in 2001 shortly after the 9/11 attacks .
Officials said he has admitted being a personal assistant , bodyguard and driver to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
" The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional act , " said Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for the majority .
The tribunals , he said , " must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial protections that have been recognized by customary international law . "
" In undertaking to try Hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment , the executive [ Bush ] is bound to comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction , " Stevens wrote .
" Congress has not issued the executive a ' blank check , ' " Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a concurring opinion .
" Indeed , Congress has denied the president the legislative authority to create military commissions of the kind at issue here . "
Breyer noted , however , that " nothing prevents the president from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary . "
The other justices in the majority were Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter and Anthony Kennedy .
" To the extent there is latitude to work with the Congress to determine whether or not the military tribunals will be an avenue in which to give people their day in court , we will do so , " Bush said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi .
( More reaction )
The ruling means the Bush administration will have to adopt a military commission system for trying accused terrorists that meets international standards .
The court 's ruling also establishes that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals involving " enemy combatants " held overseas in U.S. military custody .
The Bush administration had argued they lacked it .
Late last year , Congress passed and Bush signed the Detainee Treatment Act , which ostensibly limited court intervention over the prisoner issue .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said Thursday afternoon he would introduce legislation after the Fourth of July break that would authorize military tribunals .
" To keep America safe in the war on terror , I believe we should try terrorists only before military commissions , not in our civilian courts , " said the Tennessee Republican .
Dissenting in the ruling were justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , each of whom entered separate opinions .
Scalia called the court 's reasoning a " mess , " and Thomas wrote that the ruling would " sorely hamper the president 's ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy . "
" The president 's decision to try Hamdan before a military commission for his involvement with al Qaeda is entitled to a heavy measure of deference , " Thomas said .
" It seems clear that the commissions at issue here meet the standard " established by the government to try the accused terrorists , Alito wrote .
Chief Justice John Roberts did not vote , recusing himself because he ruled on the case at the appellate level .
Hamdan 's lawyers argued that Bush exceeded his authority by setting up military commissions to try terrorist suspects , whom the administration terms " enemy combatants , " rather than prisoners of war .
( Watch military lawyer defend terror suspect -- 2:18 )
They also argued that the government 's charge of conspiracy against Hamdan is not allowed under international standards of law for prisoners of war , and that earlier federal courts had rejected that standard as well , since it was too broadly defined .
The administration 's position was that the term means detainees do not have the rights usually afforded prisoners of war , as outlined in the Geneva Conventions .
The enemy combatant designation , according to the Bush administration , means the suspect can be held without charges in a military prison without the protections of the U.S. criminal justice system , such as the right to counsel -- a status the court rejected .
The Guantanamo Bay facility opened in 2002 and holds about 460 men suspected of links to al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Many world leaders have pressured Bush to close the camp , and he said last week he was considering doing so , noting he would decide after the court ruled .
" I 'd like to end Gitmo , like it to be over with , " he said at a European Union summit in Vienna .
" One of the things we will do is that we will send people back to their home countries .
We have about 400 people left ; 200 have been sent back .
There are some who need to be tried in U.S. courts , " Bush said .
" They are cold - blooded killers .
They will murder somebody if they are let out on the street .
And yet we believe there ought to be a way forward in the court of law . "
Most of the prisoners were captured in Afghanistan , where U.S. troops are still battling remnants of the Taliban , the Islamic movement that harbored al Qaeda when it ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 .
Keeping that new laptop safe
Monday , August 21 , 2006
Well the calendar says August 21 so that means that millions of students will be heading back to schools all over the country very soon .
As the students stroll onto those campuses I am guessing many will be in possession of a brand new laptop computer daddy just paid for , or was paid for with hard work they did over the summer months .
While laptop computers have certainly gotten cheaper over the past couple years the ease of someone snatching that laptop is just as easy .
Also the rise in identity theft can be contributed in part to laptop theft around the world .
That is why I have decided to write this article about laptop theft / identity theft prevention .
I will spell out the usual mumbo jumbo laptop theft prevention stuff here :
Never leave your laptop computer unattended in any public location ( i.e .
The Library , study lounges , public benches , the all night kegger being held at your dorm , etc . )
Always lock offices or dorm rooms where the laptop is left .
If possible use a security device such as steel cable locks to secure your laptop computer .
Most computer stores sell a number of security devices .
Also the laptop manufacturer may recommend and sell overpriced security devices on their own website .
Always contact the cops in the event of a theft .
Keep a copy of the serial number in a safe place that is easily accessible in the event of a theft .
Homeowners insurance may cover the loss of your laptop outside the home ( contact your agent or insurance company for more information ) .
People living in apartments should consider getting renters insurance .
Register your laptop with your university program .
Consider buying a small personal safe that your laptop can fit in along with other important items .
Now onto the fun stuff .
Targus sells a laptop computer alarm that senses motion and puts out an ear bleeding scream sure to wake that passed out roommate of yours .
Find them cheap at Ebay for around $ 15 - $ 20 shipped .
Thanks to biometrics IBM sells a laptop computer with a fingerprint reader .
What this means is when the stupid criminal that takes your laptop tries to use it he will have no luck whatsoever because the laptop will need your fingerprint to boot up .
Hopefully the thief will realize this when they are about to take your laptop and move onto an easier target .
There are a number of laptop computer tracking services that allow you to hunt down the thief and give him or her a good beating .
Ok maybe not quite like that but they can detect what ip address the laptop is using while on the net and then let you know .
Use passwords for all logins .
Bios password , Hard drive password , user name password , administrator password , and the user tag enabled .
Yes this requires entering password hell but if you make one password that fits all of these it should make it easier .
Here you can make a password with a Secure Password Generator .
Even though random number and letters are hard to remember I remember them by where they are on the keyboard and in relation to each other .
It seems to help me .
Many of the newer laptops have webcams on them .
Here is a sweet webcam security system article if you were lucky enough to get a Mac .
There is also something similar for Intel / Windows based computer with TinCam Video surveillance software which detects motion and then alerts you .
Consider buyng a small USB Jump Drive to store sensitive information on .
Also backups of important school documents can be saved on them .
Nothing would be worse than having your laptop stolen and then be a victim of identity theft .
** Update 8-22-06 **
Beaumont Hospital in Detroit loses 28,473 patient records in a stolen / missing laptop .
Recently I found myself , for my own obscure reasons , wanting to know ( at runtime , by introspection ) which variables a piece of Python code read .
At first glance , this looked fairly straightforward .
Python ’s eval statement takes three parameters : a code object to run , and two dictionaries for the global and local variables .
Since you can subclass a dictionary and override its getters it seemed trivial to monitor what was read , using some variation on a theme of :
python
class MonitorDict ( dict ) : def __init__ ( self , * prm , ** kw ) : dict .
__init__ ( self , * prm , ** kw ) self .
accessed = set ( ) def __getitem__ ( self , name ) : self.accessed.add( name ) return dict .
__getitem__ ( self , name )
( Depending on the detail needed , instead of returning the dictionary contents directly , you might want to wrap them in ‘ proxy objects ’ first , that had similar ‘ instrumentation ’ to monitor what was read from those , in turn . )
For locals , this works a treat .
Unfortunately , for globals , it does not .
As the eval documentation says :
The globals must be a dictionary and locals can be any mappping
We ca n’t pass our magic dictionary in to wrap the global variables , like we can with the locals .
Why eval insists on a vanilla dictionary , I ’m not sure — it ’s quite unPythonic ; duck typing is the norm — but I guess the CPython implementation depends on it for some reason .
I expect because reading the dictionary directly instead of checking for subclassed methods gives some performance advantage .
So I needed some darker , filthier magic .
Poking About In Bytecode
The answers we seek are contained in the code , so what if we examine it directly ?
Python source is compiled to bytecode which you can read from within Python itself easily — it ’s stored in the co_code member of a code object .
( A “ code object ” , by the way , is what you get if you call the built - in compile ( ) function on some source code .
There ’s also one for every function ( except built - ins / extension modules ) , in the function ’s func_code member .
Remember , in Python , everything is an object , even functions — with constructors and members and all that implies . )
If you print it out , though , it ’s pretty cryptic :
python
interactive shell :
>>> x = ' hi ' >>> def test ( ) : ... print x >>> test .func_code.co_code ' t \x00\x00GHd\x00\x00S '
Fortunately , Python has a disassembler in the standard library : dis .
Although it ’s not as Stygian as its name would suggest , it ’s slightly danker than we ’d like because it only outputs in human - readable text :
python
interactive shell ( ctd. ) :
>>> import dis >>> dis.dis( test ) 2 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 ( x ) 3 PRINT_ITEM 4 PRINT_NEWLINE 5 LOAD_CONST 0 ( None ) 8 RETURN_VALUE
While this is normally what people want , we ’re trying to examine code with code .
At least that LOAD_GLOBAL looks kinda promising , right ?
dis is itself written in Python , so it ’s easy enough to make a new version that returns something machine - readable instead .
I ’m not going to walk you through it here — it ’s mostly just a bunch of cut - and - paste — but I ’ve put a copy online in the new kibble section , a sort of overflow bucket for the odds and ends that have nowhere else sensible to go .
It ’s called discode.py , and contains the new disassemble function .
It returns a list containing a tuple for each bytecode instruction , constisting of the opcode name , the kind of argument it takes ( local , global , constant , None , etc ) and the value of the argument ( or None ) .
And , by way of examples , there ’s also a function that plucks out the names of the globals that a piece of code read ( even inside lambda functions it defines ) , returning them in a set .
It simply compares the opcode name to LOAD_GLOBAL as seen above , and also checks for code objects being loaded , and recurses on them .

In an exclusive interview Wednesday , after finishing a meeting with her publicist Elliott Mintz , Hilton agreed to talk to TMZ's Harvey Levin about thousands of messages TMZ users have posted , many of which are , as Hilton says , " mean and sadistic . "
Levin asked Hilton about such comments as , " Paris is just an overused human condom , " " Paris is like a fart in a mitten .
You know it 's there , you can't stand it , but you can't get rid of it , " and " Would you please drop over dead or commit suicide you damn slut . "

The mainstream media has joined the hunt , egged on by the Internet , which is bursting with questions about the baby ’s health , her provenance and even her existence .
“ The shroud of Suri has yet to be lifted , ” intoned The Associated Press .
“ Missing : baby girl of press - addicted parents , ” Newsweek said .
Image Us Weekly ran a story last week on Suri Cruise , with photos of her mother , Katie Holmes , but none of the baby herself .
Credit ... Lars Klove for The New York Times
While others fanned the flames , the approach at People has been minimalist , giving no hint that Mr. Cruise and Ms. Holmes are living at the white - hot center of a sensational tabloid mystery .
Larry Hackett , the managing editor of People , said that while People may be accused of going soft in hopes of getting the pictures , the magazine was the first , in mid-June , to flag that after 49 days , baby Suri had not materialized in public .
A chart showed that this was an unusual delay for a celebrity baby ; the pictures of the Pitt - Jolie baby , Shiloh , appeared seven days after her birth .
“ What gives ? ” People asked aloud of the delay .
It quoted Mr. Cruise as saying that all was well .
Beyond that , Mr. Hackett said , People may appear soft compared with other magazines because it does not present as fact anything that it cannot verify .
He said the magazine had no evidence of anything wrong with the baby or awry in the Cruise - Holmes relationship .
The two are not married , but reports over the weekend suggested that a wedding may be imminent and that the couple may show off the baby at their nuptials , making the pictures public to everyone at once .
Mr. Hackett said he would love to have the baby pictures and that the magazine ’s treatment of Mr. Cruise and Ms. Holmes and other celebrities “ should put us in good stead because we ’re fair and that ’s paid off for us in the past . ”
He said Team Cruise was fully aware that People wanted the pictures , but in terms of making a pitch , he declined to be specific .
“ Nothing any editor says to Tom Cruise and his camp is n’t anything they have n’t heard before , ” he said .
Mr. Dolce of Star said there were several negotiating tactics that magazines used behind the scenes to land a celebrity .
“ You could promise no negative stories on Tom and Katie for X number of months , though Tom and Katie would probably ask for a blackout more than anything else , ” he said .
“ Or you might swing a deal like OK ! had with Jessica Simpson — we ’ll pay you $ 5 million and that will cover the next four stories . ”

Gmail is hands - down the best web - based email service on the 'net .
Conversation threads , search , tagging , and keyboard shortcuts have completely revolutionized the way I look at my inbox .
I manage all of my email from my personal Gmail inbox , including the daily flood of Lifehacker messages .
At this point , I can't imagine a program I could use to manage my email any more efficiently .

Despite my undying love for Gmail , there are still a lot of people who are n't won over by sheer enthusiasm alone , and still others who just are n't taking full advantage of the features and functions they 've got at their fingertips in Gmail .
Either way , the only thing a Gmail naysayer needs is a better understanding of everything you can do with Gmail .
Today I 've got a rundown of the methods and add - ons I use to make Gmail more powerful .
By the time you 're done with this article you 'll be a bona fide Gmail power user , too .

Quick look at what to expect
When you 're done setting up your Gmail account , you should be able to do everything you see in this short video without once leaving your keyboard ( which means beaucoup productivity for you ) :
Let 's get started down your path to Gmail mastery .
Set up labels
The first thing you 'll want to do to flex Gmail 's muscle a bit is set up a few labels .
If you 're new to labels , think of them as folders , or better yet , tags . [ 1 ]
Your email does n't have to specifically reside in any folders to be just as accessible .
In fact , labels are great specifically because you can apply multiple labels to one email , making your email that much easier to find .
Setting up labels is super -easy :
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here
Go to Settings , and then select the Labels tab .
In the textbox labeled , " Create a new label : " simply type your label and click Create .
Advertisement
Yep , that 's it .
I 'd suggest going through your email and figuring out how you might want to categorize and label your emails .
I generally create labels for any mailing lists I 'm on , along with labels for different work - related emails and an ever - important Follow - up label for the emails I want to make sure I remember to reply to ( e.g. , those emails I 'm not going to reply to immediately but I do n't want to fall through the cracks ) .
Of course , your labels will revolve around your needs ( as they should ) , and if you do n't already have an email system , I 'd encourage you to examine your email and develop one .

Set up filters
While labels are great on their own - and I label a lot of messages after they land in my Inbox - there are a lot of instances where you can assign labels automatically based on the characteristics of the message , thus saving yourself the work .
That 's where filters come in .

Gmail can filter an email based on six criteria : From , To , Subject , Has the words , Does n't have , and Has attachment .
Obviously this setup offers a lot of power for filtering your incoming mail .
After you choose your criteria , you can choose any combination of the following options : Skip the Inbox ( Archive ) , Star it , Apply the label ... , Forward it to , and Delete it .

When I set up a new filter , I commonly choose to Skip the Inbox and Apply a label .

Managing multiple email accounts with Gmail
It 's not at all uncommon to have more than one email address these days ( actually , for many of you it 's been pretty common for years now ) .
Though you may never be able to consolidate all of your email to one address , you can at least deal with all of your email from one account .

If your non-Gmail account allows for email forwarding , set it up to forward your mail to your main Gmail address ( this process will vary based on your email account , but it 's generally really easy to do somewhere in the settings ) .
For example , all of the Lifehacker tips email ( which comes to Gina , Keith , and me ) comes straight to my personal Gmail address , at which point it 's filtered out of my inbox and labeled " Lifehacker Tips . "

With Gmail 's recent addition of smart replying , you should n't have to worry about sending email from the wrong address .
When someone sends you an email , Gmail will automatically use the appropriate email address when replying ( whether it 's a Gmail address or not ) .

Using keyboard shortcuts
This is where Gmail really starts to shine .
Despite the fact the Gmail does a lot of things very well , a lot of these features were just sort of ho - hum for me .
It was n't until I started using keyboard shortcuts , and then the Gmail Macros script , that I completely fell in love with Gmail .
Advertisement
The first thing you 'll want to do is enable keyboard shortcuts in Gmail .
This is as simple as navigating to the General tab in the Settings and selecting " Keyboard shortcuts on . "
The keyboard shortcuts let you navigate through your messages , within your conversations , archive a conversation , and jump to your inbox without ever having to go for the mouse .
Here 's a list of the default Gmail keyboard shortcuts .
Gmail 's keyboard shortcuts by themselves are great , but if you really want to take control of your Gmail inbox , I very highly recommend installing the Gmail Macros script for Greasemonkey .
Though it does a lot , the most powerful thing you 'll use the Gmail Macros script for is navigating through your labels ( including your inbox , trash , drafts , etc. - after all , they 're all just labels ) and labeling your conversations with a really slick Quicksilver - like interface .

First you 'll need to install the Greasemonkey Firefox extension if you do n't already have it installed .
Next , install the Gmail Macros script .
There are a couple of different scripts available on the linked blog post , but I prefer a patched version of the script that stays more true to Gmail 's original keyboard shortcuts .
Here 's a quick look at the key commands that the Gmail macros script provides ( click for a larger version ) :

It may take a little time to get the shortcuts embedded in your memory , but you can easily bring up the list of shortcuts at any time in Gmail by typing a question mark ( ? ) .
Knock out repetitive email
If you do a lot of repetitive typing in your emails ( if I type the same thing three times a day I consider it repetitive ) , you can really knock down your repetitive emails quickly with AutoHotKey HotStrings .
I 'd never get through my inbox without them , and they 're very easy to set up and edit .

Searching your Gmail inbox
Of course , a solid Gmail tutorial would n't be complete without a quick rundown of searching your Gmail ( it 's Google , after all ! ) .
Advertisement
Search operators in Gmail work much the same as they do with Google .
Type the operator followed by a colon , and then your search term ( e.g. , to:tips@lifehacker.com ) .
Likewise , you can exclude terms from your search with the hyphen ( - ) .
The search operators allow you to limit the scope of your search to the to ( to : ) , from ( from : ) , and subject ( subject : ) fields .
Easy enough , right ?
You can also search based on labels ( label : ) , emails with attachments ( has : attachment ) , and even dates ( after : / before : yyyy / mm/dd ) .
Advertisement
Search operators will come in especially handy if you need more flexibility when setting up filters ( you can add any search term to the " Has the words " field ) .
Here 's a comprehensive list of Gmail search operators .
Take your Gmail toolbox on the road

There are a lot of advantages of Labels or tags over folders .
One huge benefit of labels is that if you choose to delete a label because you no longer find it useful ( perhaps your system has evolved and you want to clean house ) , the associated email will not be deleted .
Instead , the label is simply removed .
Remember that with Gmail , the whole point is that you do n't have to delete any of your email - ever .
A second benefit of labels is that you can mark one email with as many labels as you like .

Tycoons in the making    NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Real - estate investing is big business ... and getting bigger .
Second - home purchases , mostly for investment purposes , last year accounted for more than a third of all single - family home sales in the United States , according to the National Association of Realtors .
Throw in sales of duplexes , apartment houses , and condos for investment purposes and you get some idea how many people want to play landlord .
And why not ?
Not only do you rake in rent money every month , you can also reap profits from soaring housing prices .
As any landlord will tell you , however , it 's not as easy as it looks .
Erwin Jackson , who owns about 300 units in the Florida panhandle , has done well swooping in and buying from disillusioned landlords .
" The best deals I ever got were from new landlords who six months in realized , " ' This is a lot more work than I thought . ' "
Ken McElroy , a founder of MC Companies in Scottsdale , Arizona and author of a bestseller , " The ABCs of Real Estate Investing , " said too many buyers of rental properties look at is as an investment , not as a business .
" But it 's both -- the business part takes much more time than they imagined . "
McElroy said the only properties he buys anymore are mismanaged ones , and there are plenty of those .
The prices they command are low enough that he can spend some money to fix them up and turn them around -- and still rent them at a profit .
The biggest single mistake new landlords make , according to McElroy , " Is who they put in the asset .
That 's where the problems come from . "
Keep up the cash flow
The pressure to fill vacancies can be intense .
Matthew Martinez , a landlord and real estate investor from Massachusetts who has a book coming out in a few months entitled , " Two Years to a Million in Real Estate , " said , " Any vacancy is an attack on your financial prosperity .
When I think about the money I lose every day I have a vacancy , I feel sick to my stomach . "
Landlords have to screen renters carefully .
" We run a credit check , a criminal background check , and now a sex offender check on every applicant , " said McElroy .
In addition to making sure tenants will pay their rent , there are liability issues involved .
Landlords can be sued if they negligently rent to criminals .
These checks , however , are far from foolproof .
" You can do a great background check , even have a perfectly wonderful tenant for a year or two , " said Martinez , " and still , all of a sudden , get in trouble . "
Martinez rented a Boston apartment to a woman who , after many months living there , began to " date the wrong person , " he said .
" She started using drugs , then she started dealing drugs , although I could n't prove that . "
Evicting her took five months , and she paid no rent that entire time .
And if he had n't gotten her out , it could have caused more problems .
What if another tenant had been injured because of the criminal activity ?
Lawsuits of all stripes prey on landlords ' minds .
Jackson said his company provides many services to his renters just to avoid legal hassles .
" Early on , " he said , " one of my tenants borrowed my lawnmower .
He hit a piece of metal in the grass .
His roommate was sunning himself nearby and the metal flew up and opened a gash in his forehead .
The roommate sued me .
Now we do all the lawns , replace fluorescent light , repair the windows ; I do n't want tenants doing anything . "
Day by day Besides these acute problems , there 's the everyday hassle of managing the paperwork , overseeing contractors , paying the ever - increasing taxes , collecting rents , and looking after the properties .
Getting called in the middle of the night to fix someone 's clogged toilet is not for everyone .
Even when you can afford to let others handle the day - to - day headaches , there are other rough seas to navigate .
Gary Cherry farms out the management duties of the three properties in Tallahassee , Florida he owns , two small and one medium - sized multi-family sites with a total of 75 units .
The largest , a 66 - apartment building , was the latest purchase and has proven the most difficult .
" The building had a lot more problems than I thought , " said Cherry .
" Afterwards , you scratch your head and say , ' Why did n't I notice that . '
You have to look the structure over very carefully . "
Doing the math Buyers of investment properties must make dispassionate assessments of the benefit they 'll derive from their investments and the downside risk involved .
Landlords can't afford to fall in love with a property like an owner of a primary residence can .
It boils down to a numbers game :
How much cash will flow from the investment ?
For many landlords , cash flow is essential because they can't really count on housing prices to continue to soar .
One key calculation is the " cap rate , " annual rents you can collect versus the property value .
For a property that costs $ 500,000 dollars and generates $ 3,300 per month in rent , the cap rate would be nearly 8 percent ( $ 39,600 divided by $ 500,000 ) .
" Anyone who gets less than 8 percent cap rate is going to be out - of - pocket every month , " said Martinez .
That 's because out of that $ 39,600 in rents , the landlord must pay the mortgage ( at recent rates of about 5 percent for a $ 400,000 loan , that would come to about $ 3,167 a month ) and pay for repairs as well .
At 8 percent , even just routine repairs and replacements can wipe out your profits .
Then too , if a landlord finds himself spending for repairs of structural defects that he did n't identify before the purchase and did n't plan for , it can really wreck his budget .
As Erwin Jackson said , " Everybody wants to try it and I would encourage them to do so .
Just make sure they have my phone number so they can get in touch when they 're ready to sell . "

Free advice from a lawyer
Handy advice from a lawyer who writes from his own experience , a passalong email .
Your checks
When next you order checks , have only the initials of your first name printed .
If someone takes your checkbook , they will not know if you sign your checks with just your initials or your first name , but your bank will know how you sign your checks
Never have your social security number printed on your check .
You can always add it if necessary .
have your social security number printed on your check .
You can always add it if necessary .
Put your work phone number on your checks instead of your home phone .
If you have a PO Box use that instead of your home address .
If you do not have a PO Box , use your work address .
When you are writing checks to pay on your credit card accounts , DO NOT put the complete account number on the " For " line .
Instead , just put the last four numbers .
The credit card company knows the rest of the number , and anyone who might be handling your check as it passes through all the check processing channels wo n't have access to it .
Your credit cards
Do not sign the back of your credit cards .
Instead , put " PHOTO ID REQUIRED " .
See update .
Your wallet
Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine .
Do both sides of each license , credit card , etc .
You will know what you had in your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and cancel .
While you ’re at it , make a photocopy of your passport .
Next to each card , write down the toll free number to call if the card is stolen .
Do n’t forget the number to the Registry of Motor Vehicles
Keep the photocopy in a safe place .
Thieves work fast .
The key to stopping them –and limiting your damage - is to cancel cards quickly .
If your wallet is stolen
File a police report immediately where it was stolen .
This proves to credit providers that you were diligent and it ’s the first step toward an investigation if there is one .
Report your cards stolen and cancel them .
Believe me , you will be SO glad you made that photocopy
Call the three national credit reporting organizations to place a fraud alert on your name and social security number .
This prevents thieves from applying for credit cards in your name .
Such an alert means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit .
Here are the numbers you need .
Keep this with the photocopy of your credit cards .
1. Equifax : 1-800-525-6285
2. Experian ( formerly TRW ) : 1-888-397-3742
3. Trans Union : 1-800-680-7289
4. Social Security Administration ( fraud line ) : 1-800-269-0271
UPDATE : From two commenters .
Seems as if you must sign the card as Visa merchants will not accept the card if not signed .
UPDATE 2 : If you have n't seen Zug 's hilarious credit card prank , you owe it to yourself to be one of the 30 million who have done so .
Only then are you ready to appreciate credit card prank 2
It seems as if no one ever checks the signature .

One of my favorite films is ‘ The Great Escape ” with its spectacular cast and haunting conclusion .
If you are unfamiliar with the film , it is based upon a true account concerning a POW camp especially built for Allied officers who were “ problematic ” ; that is , always escaping .
The audacity of their escape had wide effects , and is said to have helped with the D - Day landing , considering the escapees tied up a whole lot of soldiers trying to round them up .
Tragically , the majority of the escapees were executed upon capture in retaliation .
A largely unknown story is about to be told .
It is well chronicled in the book “ Colditz ” by Henry Chancellor ( among other books ) .
The town of Colditz is located approximately 150 km southwest of Berlin .
Prisoners , upon arrival , found it confusing .
Disembarking from the train , there was no camp .
They were marched from the station , through the village , up a hill and right into the courtyard of a large , gloomy castle .
They half expected to be executed .
Colditz Castle was built in 1014 and steadily enlarged until about 1694 when it comprised about 700 rooms .
It was used as a hunting lodge at times until 1824 when it was converted to an asylum .
In 1933 , it was converted into a labor camp for Hitler ’s communist enemies .
The structure looked extremely formidable .
It was situated on a rocky outcropping .
The outer courtyard housed the 200 or so Germans it took to maintain the place and the inner courtyard was used by the prisoners .
The outer courtyard had two exits .
One led over the moat into the town , the other into the forest .
The prisoner side was lined with a 100 foot cliff into a river .
Although this seemed terribly impregnable , one German officer mentioned , “ … apart from putting bars on the windows , it had never really been built for he purpose of keeping people in .
A more unsuitable place to hold prisoners will probably never again be chosen . ”
As with similar structures , the place was a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways , perfect for escaping “ bad boys ” .
Still it was n’t all tea and crumpets .
Before the influx of Red Cross packages , they were literally starving .
When the first Allied officers arrived in 1941 , there were over 100 Polish soldiers who were also termed “ bad boys ” .
During the war , the Polish and Russians were treated as subhumans by the Germans .
The Polish because they were conquered and technically had no country under the Nazi rule and the Russians because they never signed the Geneva Convention .
The prisoners were separated into nationalities and housed such .
There were Polish , British , French , Dutch , Indian , and so on .
There were more unsuccessful attempts than successful ones .
It is estimated that there was an escape attempt every 10 days during the four years prisoners were housed there .
The attempts were so many , that the Kommandant began an escape museum to train his men in finding and stopping as many attempts as possible .
The British war department was also helpful in these attempts , smuggling useful escape items into the camp in care packages .
The would hide compasses in walnuts or spools of thread , saws in shoelaces or combs , maps in wax phonographic records or in false walls of food tins .
They had secret codes and maps embedded in silk handkerchiefs that would develop when placed in water boiled with a certain yellow almond .
Blankets washed would reveal patterns for making civilian suits .
The possibilities were endless and it turned into a serious game to hide them from the Germans .
The first successful attempt was made by a Frenchman name Le Ray .
His attempt was fairly simple .
Two or three times a week , the officers were led down a zigzag path to a barb - wired area called the park .
On the way down they passed an unused building that was under construction .
The workers stored their tools in one of the rooms on the first floor .
On one of the walks , Le Ray , who had hidden some civilian clothes under his great coat , ran up the small bank and hid in the house while the zigzag shielded him from the guard following him .
After changing into his civilian clothes , which was dangerous considering you could be taken for a spy and shot , he made his way over 400 miles to the border and into freedom .
One officer , very young looking and small , was sewn into a mattress as it was being removed by some French orderlies .
His costume was that of a Hitler Youth .
He traveled quite far , even getting a ride with some soldiers until hunger drove him to the American consulate in Vienna .
From fear of loss of diplomatic status , he was turned away and betrayed ; directed to a police station .
The attempts became more audacious at time went on .
Another Frenchman Lebrun spent time running in the park to build up his legs .
When the day came , he was in his accustomed running outfit .
Using his friend as a catapult , he ran , stepped into his friend ’s cupped hands and leaped clear over the 10 ft wire .
Dodging bullets , he cleared another 8 ft wall and escaped .
Soon after he stole a bicycle and rode his way to the border .
His disguise , also to hide his awful German accent , was an Italian officer on holiday .
A few miles from the border , he ditched the bike and took the pump with him as a weapon .
Lebrun actually crossed into freedom twice .
Mistakenly , he crossed into Switzerland and then back out into Germany .
Retracing his path , he ran into a German police , who , for some strange reason , did n’t believe his Italian officer story at 6 a.m. in the morning near the Swiss border walking with a bicycle pump .
Lebrun knocked him out with the pump , took his pistol and made across the border again .
Enlisting the help of a passing village girl , he had himself arrested by the Swiss police .
Two weeks later the Kommendant of the camp received a letter requesting his personal effects .
In true British fashion , a theatre with stage was built and various plays were performed .
The soldiers put on full performances , growing out their hair and drawing hose on their legs to play female parts .
They were so convincing that a couple of them received invitations to the French officers ’ quarters for dinner .
In even truer British fashion , the stage and props were built on the promise that the tools would not be stolen or used for escape .
No one broke that promise ; they made their own tools .
Under the stage they cut a hole in the ceiling which opened into a locked room .
Picking the lock , they found that the adjoining hall led out into the German side of the camp near the main gates .
At the end of one play , they dropped down through the hole , picked the lock on the door , exited out into the German side of the castle .
Dressed as German officers , they marched out , even reprimanding a soldier for not returning their salute .
One attempt led 6 officers to make a hole leading from a German officer ’s office to an adjoining storeroom where they left the camp dressed as 2 German officers and 4 Polish workers .
Two successfully made it on that one .
Other attempts were made using disguises matching either German officers or frequent visitors to the camp .
Here is a side - by - side photo of the camp electrician and the POW dressed as him .
One day , while returning from the park to the castle , some British soldiers noticed that a passing lady dropped her watch .
The Brits , being all form and manners , picked up the watch and attempted to return it to the lady .
The German guards only thought it odd when the lady kept walking instead of retrieving her watch .
Upon inspection , it turned out to be a French officer decked out to look like a very respectable woman .
During the numerous attempts to escape , the three or four Appells ( roll calls ) a day could make or break an attempt .
If the Germans did n’t know you were gone , they would not send out the goon squad to find you .
The Dutch utilized the fact that they were just counted to give escapees more time .
One of the prisoners , an artist , sculpted two heads which were then dressed in a hat and long coat .
At roll call , the dummies were brought out and stood at attention with a pair of boots .
It worked fine until one day the dummy was told to dress right , which it did n’t .
The glider built in the attic .
The most outlandish attempt was never put into play as the war ended before it could be utilized .
A British aeronautical engineer designed a plan for a 2 man glider .
The prisoners built it in the attic of the castle chapel .
It was extremely light and was made with materials at hand : bedding , wooden bed slats , floor boards , electrical wiring .
It would be launched off a runway of tables using a bathtub full of concrete to provide the necessary acceleration .
The project was extremely well hidden using false walls , lookouts and an electric alarm system .
At the start of the period , the Abbasids ruled Bactria ( northern Afghanistan ) , where they allowed the local Buddhists , Hindus , and Zoroastrians to keep their religions if they paid a poll tax .
Many , however , voluntarily accepted Islam , especially among the landowners and the educated upper urban classes .
Its high culture was more accessible than their own and they could avoid paying the heavy tax .
The Turki Shahis , allied with the Tibetans , ruled Kabul , where Buddhism and Hinduism were flourishing .
The Buddhist rulers and spiritual leaders might easily have worried that a similar phenomenon , conversion out of convenience , would happen there .
The Turki Shahis ruled the region until 870 CE , losing control of it only between 815 and 819 .
During those four years , the Abbasid Caliph al - Ma'mun invaded Kabul and forced the ruling shah to submit to him and accept Islam .
To represent his submission , the Kabul Shah presented the Caliph , as a gift , a gold Buddha statue from Subahar Monastery .
As a sign of the triumph of Islam , Caliph al - Ma'mun sent the enormous statue , with its silver throne and jeweled crown , to Mecca and displayed it there at the Kaaba for two years .
In doing so , the caliph was demonstrating his authority to rule the entire Islamic world after vanquishing his brother in a civil war .
He did not force all the Buddhists of Kabul to convert , however , nor did he destroy the monasteries .
He did not even smash , as an idol , the Buddha statue that the Kabul Shah had presented him , but sent it instead to Mecca as booty .
After the Abbasid army withdrew to fight against movements for autonomy in other parts of their empire , the Buddhist monasteries quickly recovered .
The next period in which the Kabul region came under Islamic rule was also short , between 870 and 879 CE .
It was conquered by the Saffarid rulers of an autonomous military state , remembered for its harshness and destruction of local cultures .
The conquerors sent many Buddhist “ idols ” back as war trophies to the Abbasid caliph .
When the successors to the Turki Shahis , the Hindu Shahis , retook the region , Buddhism and the monasteries once more recovered their previous splendor .
The Turkic Ghaznavids conquered eastern Afghanistan from the Hindu Shahis in 976 CE , but did not destroy the Buddhist monasteries there .
As vassals of the Abbasids , the Ghaznavids too were strict followers of Sunni Islam .
Although they tolerated Buddhism and Hinduism in eastern Afghanistan , their second ruler , Mahmud of Ghazni , launched a campaign against the Abbasid rivals , the Ismaili state of Multan .
Mahmud conquered Multan in 1008 CE , driving the Hindu Shahis from Gandhara and Oddiyana on the way .
The Hindu Shahis had allied themselves with Multan .
Wherever he conquered , Mahmud looted the wealth from the Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries , and consolidated his power .
After this victory in Multan , and driven undoubtedly by greed for more land and wealth , Mahmud pressed his invasion further eastward .
He conquered the present - day Indian Punjab , known in those days as " Delhi . "
However , when the Ghaznavid troops pushed northward from Delhi to the foothills of Kashmir , chasing after the remnants of the Hindu Shahis in 1015 or 1021 , depending on the sources one uses , they were defeated , purportedly by the use of mantras .
This was the first attack on Kashmir attempted by a Muslim army .
The Kalachakra description of the future invasion and defeat of the non-Indic forces in Delhi is most likely , then , a conflation of the Multanese threat to the Abbasids and Ghaznavids with the Ghaznavid threat to Kashmir .

Zu Hause bei Schwarz - Grüns
VON GEORG LÖWISCH
Bad Schussenried , Oberschwaben .
Oswald Metzger macht Cappuccino .
Er ist ein begnadeter Schwätzer , und deswegen kann er vom Gurgeln seiner Espressomaschine eine Verbindung zur Eiszeit herstellen .
„ Wir sind hier direkt Endmoränengebiet , eine Wasserhärte von 21 , 23 “ , sagt er , „ da hat es die Maschine schwer .
Obwohl wir das Wasser filtern . “
Auch wenn es um seine Partei geht , die Grünen , liebt der Politiker den großen , den existenziellen Bogen .
Er beschreibt , wie sie auf Klippen tanzen , wie sie in der Postpubertät Selbstmord begehen .
Sein spezielles Grünen - Thema hat er sich vor zehn Jahren angeschafft .
Er mag es , es ist bei ihm zu Hause , und es hat Konjunktur : Schwarz - Grün .
Zu Metzger geht es die Hauptstraße von Bad Schussenried hoch .
Vorbei an der Bäckerei Zoll und der Metzgerei Huber , die Maultaschen im Angebot hat , vier 500 - Gramm - Beutel zu zehn Euro .
Dann rechts die Zeppelin runter und links in die Robert Bosch , eine Spielstraße , in der nur Schrittgeschwindigkeit erlaubt ist .
Ziemlich am Ende steht ein skandinavisches Fertighäuschen aus viel Holz .
Familie Metzger .
Er trägt die Kaffeebecher in den Wintergarten und setzt sich auf einen Korbhocker .
„ Wenn Sie sehen , wo unser Laden hintreibt … “ , stöhnt er. „ Eine Katastrophe .
Die Bejubelung von Buntenbachs Nominierung für den DGB - Vorstand . “
Er guckt , als habe jemand Essigreiniger in den Cappuccino gekippt .
„ Als ob wir ein Wurmfortsatz der Gewerkschaften sind “ , sagt er. „ Ein Riesenfehler .
Wo sind denn grüne Hochburgen ? “
Er zeigt nach links und rechts in die Nachbarschaft .
Gerade hat er einen Artikel für die Welt getippt .
Abrechnung mit seiner Partei , Beschwören einer Schicksalsstunde , Schwarz - Grün als Alternative – ein klassischer Metzger .
Über ein unartiges Kind reden die Tanten mehr als über ein braves .
Metzger lebt von diesem Prinzip .
Obwohl er in keinem Parlament sitzt .
Mit 51 Jahren arbeitet er als eine Art freiberuflicher Politiker , der Vortrag zu 3.000 Euro .
„ Aber jetzt muss ich wieder andocken .
Ich will nicht den Pausenclown abgeben . “
Er überlegt einen Moment .
„ Oder den Besserwisser .
Ich bin einer , der was bewegen will . “
Deshalb kandidiert er bei der Landtagswahl in Baden - Württemberg am 26 .
März. Seine Chancen sind gut .
„ Ich habe mir eine Benchmark gegeben : 10.000 Stimmen .
Ich sage jetzt : Freunde , ihr könnt eine Volksabstimmung machen , ob ihr Leute wie Metzger in der Politik haben wollt . “
Eigentlich haben die Grünen ausgemacht , bis nach der Wahl nicht laut darüber zu sprechen , ob sie in Baden - Württemberg erstmals eine Koalition mit der CDU auf Landesebene eingehen würden .
Sie fürchten immer noch , dass ihre Stammwähler plötzlich für die SPD stimmen oder gleich zu Hause bleiben .
Oder dass Grünen - Allergiker bei der CDU - Wählerschaft sicherheitshalber die FDP wählen .
Metzger hält sich natürlich nicht an das Verbot .
„ Das Feindbild ist weg .
Die Jamaika - Gespräche waren die Lockerungsübungen . “
Er reckt sich auf seinem Korbhocker .
„ Ja , Freunde : Ihr müsst euch entscheiden “ , legt er los , als wäre sein Wintergarten eine Stadthalle , „ ob ihr euch als ökologisch - bürgerliche Partei aufstellt oder ob ihr euch zur SPD und zur Linkspartei orientiert : zu einer Volksfront .
Und dann geht ihr unter . “
Mitte der 90er - Jahre begann Oswald Metzger den Reiz von Schwarz - Grün zu spüren .
Als haushaltspolitischer Sprecher der Grünen im Bundestag sprach er erstmals öffentlich über eine Koalition mit der Union .
Die Grünen - Chefs rüffelten ihn .
Aber die Journalisten belohnten ihn mit Aufmerksamkeit .
Im Wahlkampf 1998 übernahm sogar Helmut Kohl das Gedankenspiel und versuchte in einem Interview , das rot -grüne Lager aufzumischen .
Neben Joschka Fischer lobte er Oswald Metzger : „ Alle Achtung ! “ , schmeichelte Kohl .
Metzger lacht vergnügt : „ Eine Adelung durch den Dicken , aber eine Hinrichtung vor den eigenen Leuten . “
Kohl verlor die Wahl , Rot -Grün kam an die Macht , und in den kommenden Jahren musste Metzger schon den Rücktritt von Scharping oder Trittin fordern , damit die Medien ihn nicht vergaßen .
Bei der Nominierung zur Bundestagswahl 2002 ließen die grünen Delegierten ihn durchfallen .
Jetzt ist sein
Thema wieder da .
Er will Schwarz - Grün endlich testen .
Andererseits muss er aufpassen : Am Ende kommt es zu seiner Wunschkoalition und er dümpelt im Mainstream rum .
So sagt er noch , dass Schwarz - Grün nichts bringt , wenn die Grünen sich nicht ändern : Wachstumsskepsis , Mittelstandsförderung , Ächtung von Staatsschulden – seine alten Forderungen .
Metzger ist in Bad Schussenried bei den Großeltern aufgewachsen .
Er hat als Studienabbrecher sein eigenes Schreibbüro aufgebaut .
Jetzt sitzt er in Diskussionsrunden mit Roman Herzog und Jutta Limbach , trägt eine Brille von Dolce & Gabbana und Anzüge aus dem Herrenmodengeschäft seiner Frau .
Viele Grüne , sagt er , kämen aus bürgerlichen Elternhäusern .
Und jetzt lebten sie diese Erfahrungen eben wieder aus .
„ Vom Hausbesetzer zum Hausbesitzer . “
Er schaut zufrieden drein .
Er mag den Spruch .
Mainhausen , Hessen .
Kommt es wirklich bald zu Schwarz - Grün ?
Dieter Gröning fände das nur logisch .
„ Ich war ja meiner Zeit immer voraus . “
Gröning ist 67 Jahre alt , gerade kommt er vom Computerkurs heim .
Er wirkt fit , vielleicht nicht ganz ausgelastet .
Er ist seit 2004 pensioniert , nach 19 Jahren als Bürgermeister der 8.000 Einwohner zählenden Gemeinde Mainhausen im Kreis Offenbach .
Ins Amt hat ihn 1985 eine schwarz - grüne Koalition gewählt , so was gab es in Deutschland bis dahin noch nie .
In Grönings Wohnzimmer hängen weiße Gardinen vor den Fenstern und der Kratzbaum soll die Katze von der Couchgarnitur weglocken .
In der Schrankwand stehen Bücher von Tom Clancy und John Grisham .
„ Oben habe ich noch mehr “ , sagt er. Erzählen kann er. Seine Geschichten funktionieren wie Thriller .
Es gibt einen Helden , der gegen finstere Mächte kämpft , immer wieder mit sich hadert und am Ende gewinnt .
Der Held ist er. „ Ich war innerlich zerrissen “ , sagt Gröning .
Oder : „ Da musste ich alle Tricks auspacken . “
Im Mittelpunkt seiner Geschichte steht ein gefährlicher Plan für eine Giftmülldeponie – und der Kampf dagegen .
Die Anlage soll in einer Tongrube unterhalb des Grundwasserspiegels entstehen , die größte Europas , eine Millioneninvestition .
Im Jahr 1985 kämpfen die Menschen in der Gegend gegen den Müllkonzern und die sozialdemokratisch geführte Landesregierung .
Dieter Gröning , ein engagierter Beamter Mitte 40 , kommt als Bürgermeisterkandidat der CDU nach Mainhausen .
Die SPD verpasst knapp die absolute Mehrheit im Gemeinderat , CDU und Grüne tun sich zusammen – gegen die Deponie .
Die Grünen sind Jungs vom Ort , einer trägt sogar Krawatte .
Manfred Kanther von der CDU grollt über den „ Dorfschwank “ , und die grüne Partei versucht , das Bündnis zu verhindern .
Gröning wird gewählt .
Sozialdemokraten erklären wütend , die CDU habe Zauberstifte verteilt .
Damit die Tinte verschwindet und hinterher die Kreuzchen bei Gröning gemacht werden könnten .
Die Geschichte zeigt , wie ein schwarz - grünes Bündnis die Parteien spalten und trotzdem sein Ziel erreichen kann .
Zuerst sagte sich die Grünen - Fraktion von der Partei los und nannte sich Wählergemeinschaft Umwelt Naturschutz .
Dann kam es zur Machtprobe in der CDU .
Gröning gegen den CDU - Fraktionsvorsitzenden .
Am Schluss lief der Vorsitzende zu den Ex - Grünen über , die Koalition zerbrach .
Gröning regierte allein weiter , holte bei der nächsten
Wahl die absolute Mehrheit .
Er war der Gewinner .
Und er kämpfte gegen die Deponie , bis die Landesregierung aufgab .
In Grönings Lebensthriller ist Schwarz - Grün wichtig , aber andererseits nur ein Kapitel .
Er erzählt , dass er nach dem Krieg in ein Waisenhaus in die Sowjetzone kam , dass er den Vater wiederfand und der ein Jahr später bei einem Autounfall starb .
Er beschreibt , wie er sich 1986 mit dem Umweltminister Joschka Fischer anlegte , der an der Mülldeponie festhielt , wie er dessen CDU - Nachfolger überlistete , indem er das Rathaus abschloss und wegfuhr , damit die Pläne nicht vorschriftsmäßig ausgelegt werden konnten .
Wie er bei der ersten Direktwahl 70 Prozent bekam , aus Altersgründen abtrat und um die Nachfolgefrage den Krieg mit der CDU begann .
„ Wenn man mir das Fell über die Ohren zieht , möchte ich dabei sein “ , sagt er. Bei der Gemeinderatswahl Ende März kandidiert er für die FDP .
Schwarz - Grün ?
Gröning interessiert die Frage nicht mehr besonders .
In großen Geschichten sind Parteizugehörigkeiten Kulissen , entscheidend sind Männer , die sich was trauen und deren Handschlag zählt .
Die Katze streicht durchs Wohnzimmer .
„ Ich fahr ’
Sie noch zur Bahn “ , sagt er. „ Warten Sie an der Pforte . “
Das Garagentor öffnet sich , und Gröning lässt seinen Jaguar aus der Einfahrt gleiten .
Berlin , Hackescher Markt .
Ralf Fücks konzentriert sich auf das Wesentliche .
Er trägt einen schwarzen Anzug , ein schwarzes Hemd , schwarze Strümpfe und schwarze Schuhe .
Das Büro im Dachgeschoss der Hackeschen
Höfe ist schlicht eingerichtet .
Ein altes Wahlplakat der Grünen von Joseph Beuys , ein Schreibtisch für ihn , einer für seine Assistentin , ein Glastisch für Besprechungen .
Fücks stützt seine Arme auf den Glastisch und dreht sein kleines Wasserglas langsam zwischen Daumen und Zeigefinger .
„ Jetzt geht es darum , dass die Grünen ihren Standort finden und politische Perspektiven überdenken . “
Er betrachtet sein Mineralwasser .
Fücks leitet die Heinrich - Böll - Stiftung , die den Grünen nahe steht .
Früher war er Bundessprecher der Partei .
Er hat auf Parteitagen die Grabenkämpfe mitgeführt und sich in Bremen als Umweltsenator einer Ampelkoalition mit SPD und FDP gefetzt .
Lange her .
Er kommt gerade von einer Tagung in Warschau , und morgen muss er nach Kuala Lumpur .
„ Das heißt nicht , dass ich immer nur als Konferenztourist durch die Welt reise “ , stellt er fest .
Ein paar
Tage später wird er noch eine E - Mail schicken .
Aus Nairobi .
Fücks ist vorsichtig .
Er kennt die Abwehrreflexe der Grünen .
Er sagt , dass er nicht der schwarz - grüne Prophet sei .
Und wenn er die Einwanderungspolitik der CDU analysiert oder die Schulpolitik , dann legt er sich wirklich die Hände an die Schläfen , als plage ihn eine Migräne .
„ Mich hat die Schwarz - Grün - Debatte schon immer im gesellschaftlichen Kontext interessiert “ , sagt er . „ Ob das gelingen könnte : an den Nahtstellen gesellschaftlicher Entwürfe von Union und Grünen ein paar Blockaden aufzulösen . “
Er lässt jeden Satz einzeln in den Raum fallen , manchmal auch jedes einzelne Wort .
Sein Gedanke sieht so aus : Die Grünen schließen Koalitionen mit der Union , in der großen Volkspartei setzen sich die weltoffenen , liberalen gegen die deutschnationalen Strömungen durch .
Die haben die Kraft , die Unternehmer zu überzeugen , Ökologie und Ökonomie zu versöhnen .
Und sie bringen die konservativen Deutschen dazu , ihre Haltung zu Einwanderern zu überdenken .
Früher hat Fücks als einer der Ersten für Rot -Grün gekämpft .
Dann klappte es .
Und jetzt , nach Rot -Grün , gesteht er Schröder und Fischer gerade noch zu , dass nicht alles Schrott gewesen sei .
„ Merkels Auftritt in Moskau . “
Er nickt .
Überlegt .
Nickt .
„ Gott sei Dank , dass Schröder nicht mehr den Kurs bestimmt . “
Er schaut zum Fenster , die Spitze des Fernsehturms ist gerade von Wolken verdeckt .
„ Es könnte mit der Union einen antitotalitären Konsens geben , als Klammer in der Außen - und Sicherheitspolitik . “
Er schaut auf die Uhr . Er findet , die Grünen müssten an die Macht zurück .
Über die Länder .
„ Ich hoffe , dass die Grünen in Baden - Württemberg drittstärkste Partei werden “ , sagt Fücks .
„ Dann ist das Spiel offen . “
Stuttgart Mitte. Michael Kienzle schlüpft durch eine Hintertür ins Café Deli .
Er ist ein großer Mann mit weißen Haaren und , weil er der Stiftung vorsteht , der das Haus gehört , auch so was wie der Patron .
Trotzdem duckt er sich ein wenig , damit seine 1,93 Meter niemandem Angst machen .
Das Haus Geißstraße 7 in der Stuttgarter Innenstadt hat 1994 ein rechtsradikaler Psychopath angezündet .
Es war die Zeit nach den Anschlägen von Mölln und Solingen , in dem Haus lebten ausländische Familien .
Viele sprangen aus dem Fenster , es starben sieben Menschen , darunter eine Frau , die im neunten Monat schwanger war .
Feuerwehrleute haben heute noch Angst , am Haus vorbeizugehen .
Der Literaturwissenschaftler Michael Kienzle und einige andere überredeten die Hauseigentümerin , eine Brauerei , das Gebäude einer Stiftung zu überlassen .
Mit dem Geld von der Versicherung bauten sie es wieder auf und vergaben die Wohnungen an Obdachlose und Familien aus Bosnien oder Vietnam .
Im ersten Stock ist ein Veranstaltungsraum untergebracht und unten das Café Deli .
„ Man kann an der Basis viel machen “ , sagt Kienzle .
Er ist ein Mann jenes
Typs , der zum Sommerfest nicht nur einen Kuchen mitbringt , sondern auch den Grill .
Und der vorher rumfragt , wer kein Fleisch isst .
Ohne Projekte wäre er unglücklich .
Sein neustes ist ein Kinder - und Jugendtheater , vorher hat er sich um eine Gedenkstätte der Deportation von Juden von Stuttgart aus gekümmert .
Er sitzt für die Grünen im Stadtrat , seine Frau arbeitet ehrenamtlich als Bezirksvorsteherin , die Tochter besucht die Waldorfschule .
Wenn Kienzle von seinen Projekten berichtet , sagt er immer „ wir “ .
Er meint nicht die Grünen , sondern sich und die anderen Bürger .
Zum „ wir “ gehört meistens auch die CDU .
Zum ersten Kuratoriumspräsidenten der Geißstraßen - Stiftung hat er den damaligen CDU - Kulturbürgermeister gemacht .
„ Ich versuche die Idee sofort so zu entwickeln , dass alle mitmachen .
Deswegen ist die Frage Schwarz - Grün für mich nix Neues . “
Den grünen Bildungsbürger trennt vom christdemokratischen nicht so viel .
Vielleicht noch , dass Kienzle mit dem Rad zur Uni und zum Rathaus fährt und die CDU - Leute zu autofixiert findet .
Und dass er festgestellt hat , dass sie immer an Posten denken .
Na schön .
Im Stadtrat gibt es keine feste Koalition .
CDU und SPD sind gemeinsam für die Verlegung des Hauptbahnhofs unter die Erde .
„ Aber im Kulturbereich haben wir in den letzten Haushaltsberatungen alle Anträge mit der CDU durchgesetzt “ , sagt Kienzle .
Oft beantragt die SPD mehr Geld als CDU und Grüne .
Neulich bei einem Radweg war das wieder so .
„ Das geht halt nicht . “
Kienzle ist 60 .
Früher hat er beim Kommunistischen Bund Westdeutschland mitgemacht , das waren die Maoisten .
Chef war Winfried Kretschmann , heute Grünen - Spitzenkandidat in Baden - Württemberg .
Irgendwann hat Kretschmann Kienzle rausgeschmissen .
Wegen bürgerlicher Abweichung .
Kienzle lächelt .
„ Auf dem Klo haben wir uns versichert , dass wir uns schätzen . “
Kiel , Rathaus .
Der Spitzname erzählt schon viel : Püppi . Harmlos .
Zum Spielen .
Niedlich , aber dumm .
Einer von der SPD hat ihn ihr zugerufen , die Journalisten haben ihn sich weitererzählt , und an den Biertischen haben sich die Männer angegrient .
Der Name erzählt viel darüber , dass sie es nicht verstanden : warum diese Frau einen Erfolg nach dem anderen eingefahren hat .
Angelika Volquartz ist methodisch , freundlich , entschlossen .
Oberbürgermeisterin von Kiel , Mitglied im CDU - Bundesvorstand , eine , die Angela Merkel zur Verbündeten hat .
Sie sitzt in dem Amtszimmer des Kieler Rathauses , in dem über 50 Jahre lang sozialdemokratische Männer regiert hatten .
Es ist ein hoher Raum mit heller Holztäfelung an Decke und Wänden .
Es gibt Gemälde mit Schiffen und ein Steuerrad .
Auf einem Schrank steht sogar ein Flugzeugmodell , der Lufthansa - Jumbo „ Kiel “ .
Volquartz schaut hoch : „ Ich fliege ausgesprochen gern “ , sagt sie und lacht .
Der Ausbau des kleinen Kieler Flughafens war das einzige Vorhaben , das ihre schwarz - grüne Koalition belastet hat .
Die Grünen waren dagegen , die CDU war dafür , sie war dagegen .
Kein Geld , kein Bedarf .
Das Land hat den Unsinn vor ein paar Wochen abgeblasen , der Stadtrat zog nach .
„ Ich konnte die Befindlichkeiten nach dem Beschluss verstehen “ , sagt sie mitfühlend .
„ Die einen , die traurig waren , und die anderen , die sich gefreut haben .
Es wäre wirklich schade gewesen , wenn die Zusammenarbeit da gescheitert wäre .
Aber wir hätten auch dann eine Lösung gefunden , weil wir uns menschlich so gut verstehen . “
Sie redet oft so .
Sie war früher Lehrerin für Biologie und Erdkunde und später Rektorin einer Realschule .
Vermutlich hat sie es immer so gemacht .
Sie ist in Machtkämpfe gezogen , in Auseinandersetzungen um Parteiämter , um Landtag und Bundestag , ist gelassen geblieben und hat versucht , nicht viel Krach zu machen .
Sie redet über Schwarz - Grün so selbstverständlich , dass es fast langweilig wird .
Eine Handelsfirma wurde bewegt , 500 Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen , die Hafenerweiterung ist beschlossen , mehr Kinderbetreuung auch , ein Sparplan für die nächsten zehn Jahre wurde aufgestellt .
Die Grünen stellen Volquartz ’ Vize , einen Bürgermeister , immerhin hat der den schönen Namen Peter Todeskino .
„ Wissen Sie “ , sagt sie , „ die Grünen sind einfach pragmatisch geworden .
Die Chemie stimmt . “
Sie hat sich schon im OB - Wahlkampf mit dem grünen Konkurrenten verstanden .
Sie saßen abends bei Diskussionsrunden in der Hebbelschule oder in der Halle 400 am Ostufer .
Lutz Oschmann von den Grünen hat gesagt : „ Ich bin eigentlich genau der Meinung von Frau Volquartz . “
Und sie hat gesagt : „ Ich sehe das so wie Herr Oschmann . “
Vor der Stichwahl hat Oschmann zurückgezogen und die übliche Wahlempfehlung für die SPD stecken lassen .
„ CDU und Grüne haben sich schon mal angeblinzelt “ , sagt Volquartz .
Sie gewann , und im Rat wurde die Koalition geschlossen .
Wenn sie nach Berlin zu CDU - Sitzungen fährt , lästert niemand wegen Schwarz - Grün .
„ Man muss von dem Weg runter , dass es nur CDU und FDP , große Koalition oder SPD und Grüne gibt “ , sagt sie .
„ Mit dem Druck , Probleme zu lösen und nicht Parteiprobleme , zieht ein anderes Denken ein . “
Bei der letzten Vorstandswahl hat sie das drittbeste Ergebnis bekommen .
Sie ist etabliert .
Auch , weil sie früh auf Angela Merkel gesetzt hat .
Dafür hat die ihr im Wahlkampf geholfen .
„ Wir haben eine Art der Kommunikation , die kurz und bündig ist . “
Sie zuckt mit den Schultern .
„ Kein Brimborium .
Sich unterstützen und sagen : Ich halte zu dir . “
Neulich haben sie per SMS ausgemacht , dass Merkel die „ Kieler Woche “ eröffnet .
Das ist im Juni .
Schwarz - Grün in Kiel ist dann genau drei Jahre alt .
First , let me tell you a little story involving butterflies and bladders .
I 've spent the past few days at MicroConf .
Just a phenomenal conference , full of like - minded folks , loaded with actionable content .
Not to get too carried away , but it was a life - changer .
I 'd go on some more , but I do n't want you competing with me for tickets next year .
On the second day , Joanna Wiebe from Copyhackers selected a handful of sites from the audience to do a public " tear down " of in front of these 200 folks .
200 folks I admire and respect .
I had submitted my baby , my brand - new , just launched site ( DownDetect.com ) ahead of time as a candidate to be selected .
As soon as she took the stage , an angry mob of butterflies started attacking my internal organs .
She opened the first site and started working it over and providing some great , if slightly brutal feedback .
Really good stuff .
After she moved to the next site I could see in her browser window that she had about 12 tabs open .
It dawned on me that she was working her way through these open tabs , and that the open tabs were the sites she had selected for tear down .
About eight tabs in , I saw the favicon for my site .
The angry butterflies grew teeth .
Sharp ones .
And they pulled out pitch forks .
And chainsaws .
And congregated in my bladder .
I figured 7 tabs was a lot of ground to cover , so I would have the time to address the sudden urge , and from where I was sitting in the very front row I quickly slinked out the back of the room to the bathroom .
What a baby , I know .
I emptied my bladder and the butterflies relocated to my stomach and heart .
I hurried back to the conference room and what to my wondering eyes did appear as I walked in the room than my site , my baby , my precious up on the big screen .
She had already started .
The moderator was looking for the site owner to hand the microphone to .
I pulled a hamstring sprinting to the front of the room , groping for the microphone like the final runner in a relay race .
So here 's what I learned , and how I dramatically improved the copy on my site in 5 minutes ( and how you can too ) :
After she said some nice things , Joanna pointed out the main problem with my copy - the language was all focused on me , and it should instead be focused on my prospect .
I was selling myself , when I should be focusing on what 's in it for them .
In Joanna 's own words :
Talking about yourself -- even thinking about yourself -- when you write your copy will only do one thing : get in the way .
It will shut down the sale .
Which means that you are the biggest roadblock to better communication with your customers .
This is the foundation of great copywriting : People do n't care about you .
They only care about themselves .
You care about you .
But no one else does .
( Except yo ' mama . )
Your visitors want what they want .
They do not " want " what you 're trying to sell them .
Your job then , is not to " try " to sell your visitors a product .
You 're trying to sell them themselves .
Ok , so here 's a fun little exercise , take a look at the version of my site Joanna ( and everyone ! ) saw and see if you can spot the problems .
To make it easier , I 've color - coded my stupidity .
BEFORE
So as soon as I got home , I spent 5 minutes ( and I 'll need to spend more , we 're not perfect yet ) and turned those sub headings around .
Check out the difference below ( or see it here in the wild ) .
AFTER
Notice the difference ?
Yeah .
Serious improvement .
My humble thanks to Joanna for the help .
I hope this gives you some ideas for your site .
I highly recommend Joanna 's email list , by the way .
The first lesson she sends out addresses the same topic I 've addressed here in even more depth .

I 've enjoyed recreational fishing since I was a kid .
Over the years I 've had the chance to fish and associate with some top anglers , and I 've noticed something about them - they do n't waste time in an unproductive location .
If the fish are n't biting , they quickly move to a new spot .
This applies to startup ideas too .
Finding out if the market will respond positively has to be as early in the process as possible , and you should move on if it 's not a fit .
I 've poured emberassing amounts of time into terrible ideas that I thought were brilliant , so please learn this principle from me , it will save you unspeakable time , money and shame if you do :
The market does not care how long you worked on something or how well you did it .
Effort is not rewarded .
The market cares only if what you 've done is a fit for their needs .
This can be a crushing truth , especially for a craftsman .
We take our startups very personally , and the more time we invest in them , the more personally we take them .
But if we 're serious about turning our venture into something that pays the bills , and grants us freedom , we have to accept and embrace this truth .
There is no reward for sticking to something for a long time , if it 's the wrong thing .
If it 's the wrong thing , if there is not a market fit , you fail .
And unfortunately , there is no correlation between time invested and market fit .
And very often we have no idea what 's going to resonate , and what 's not , even when we think we do .
This is why building an MVP , and validated learning are so important .
Before we get too carried away , we have to find out if the market wants what we 're building .
I leave you with a multimedia nugget for thought from the great Derek Sivers .
( Incidentally , I highly recommend his book .
Short and sweet , and full of similar insights , including the one shown in this video ) .
Side note :
An interesting benefit to the KickStarter ( and similar ) phenomena is that folks are pumping out ideas , and using KickStarter not just to raise money , but to validate their idea .
This seems like a big deal , especially for hard goods that require a larger capital investment to get started .

What is it ?
LaunchRock : A service that provides a pre-launch page for your startup ( you know , the " signup to be notified when we launch " type of site ) .
Heres the one I created for a project I 'm working on for startup founders ( and those aspiring to be ) .
Who makes it ?
LaunchRock
Why is it the killerest ?
In addition to a nice pre-launch page , it has good social integration , encouraging those who sign up to share it with their friends via Twitter , Facebook , Linked In , Tumblr or email .
There are also some modest stats telling you your conversion rate , which can be helpful .
It 's fairly easy to use , and they 've thought of a lot of details like a confirmation email , social integration where you can pre-seed what they say when they share , an ability to export all of your subscribers for easy loading into your favorite email sending system , and domain mapping ( i.e. you can point your own URL to your page ) .
If you feel too constrained by their limited template , you can embed the form on your own site , where you have more latitude .
What could be improved ?
They offer a very limited ability to customize the design and layout for the fully hosted version .
They have custom CSS " coming soon " which should help immensely .
I was able to work around some of these limitations by using inline HTML and inline styles - which seem to be supported .
It 's fairly amenable to a little lightweight " hacking . "
How much does it cost ?

There are few segments more exciting right now than alternative payment systems .
Earth 's collective contempt for the entrenched payment tech industry is ardent .
This industry has abused users , built regulatory walls to competition , made things insufferable for customers , and as a result , put payment processing options nearly out of reach , especially for bootstrappers .
Overcoming these hurdles is a huge barrier to progress .
But the alternative payment world is red smoking hot right now , and I 'm more excited about it than any other segment .
The possibilities that are unlocked by this are exciting for entrepreneurs , especially bootstrappers .
No merchant accounts .
No gateways .
No exorbitant fees , or draconian setup processes .
Here are the most exciting ones :
2.9 % + $ 0.30
Free for transactions under $ 10 , $ 0.25 for over $ 10 .
$ 0.50 for bank payment , 3.5 % for credit card payment
The exciting ones for meatspace businesses .
Square
2.75 % for swipes , 3.5 % for keyed entries
iZettle
$ 0.20 + 2.75 %
Intuit GoPayment
2.7 % for swipes , 3.7 % for keyed

I call myself an entrepreneur , but to be honest , a lot of times I do n't .
When someone asks me what I do - I often punt .
I feel like if I 'm going to describe myself as an entrepreneur , the next sentence needs to explain what that means - what I 've done , what successful business I 've launched .
And I do n't have a good answer for that .
Oh I 've cobbled together a series of modest successes , and I 'm managing to feed my family , but I have n't yet built something that I can point to with pride and say yes - that , I built that , and that is now what I do for living .
The term " serial entrepreneur " always sits a bit odd with me too .
Or maybe I 'm just reluctant to call myself that .
I mean , I 've had numerous entrepreneurial ventures .
Numerous !
But the truth is that if one of them had been the success I thought it would be , I 'd be doing that , not launching another one .
There would be no serial succession to the next one .
At least not for a long time .
Serial entrepreneur sounds like a synonym for serial failure .
Not always of course , there are plenty of examples of successes there ( Mark Cuban , Jason Calacanis , Evan Williams ) .
But Bill Gates was n't a serial entrepreneur .
Neither was Mark Zuckerburg .
Or Jeff Bezos or Jason Fried .
They 're entrepreneurs .
They built something and that thing is what they do now .
They do n't define themselves by serially starting companies .
My goal is n't serial entrepreneurship , it 's successful entrepreneurship .
So where am I going with all this navel gazing ?
I 've been thinking a lot about this lately .
Maybe it 's because I 'm growing pensive on the verge of launching my next startup ( I really do believe this is the one ! ) , or because I regularly get emails from folks who have gutted out that first hard part of getting something out there and now they 're trying to make it work .
But I want to start a community of those of us who have gotten this far .
I want to create a community of launchers .
I just have this sense that there 's a whole group of us out here in the trenches trying to make this work - and there are a whole bunch of us who have made it work , and are making it work , and another whole bunch who have n't made it work , but are destined to , because they wo n't settle for anything less , no matter what it takes .
These folks ?
These launchers ?
These , I feel like , are people I can relate to .
And I want a way to learn from them , and talk with them , and hear their stories , and I bet I 'm not the only one , I bet you do too .
And if I 'm right about that , I hope you 'll come over and sign up for my latest project .
It 's called Launch Happy , and with your help , I think it can become something really good .
At a minimum , it 'll help you expose your business to more people .
But I 'm hoping for even more than that , I 'm hoping it 'll help you make connections , and friends , and customers .
I 'm hoping that wonderful things will spring from it , and that the net result will be more entrepreneurs proud to call themselves that because they 've made it work , they 've achieved success , they 've connected , and learned , and grown , and been cheered , and helped , and challenged , and taught and can point with pride to what they 've done and say yes - that , I built that , and now that is what I do for a living .
I think it can be something really good , and I hope you 'll be a part of it .
p.s. if you 're not a launcher yet , but still want to follow along , please follow us on Twitter at @LaunchHappy or on Facebook and we 'll keep you abreast .

Gumroad : A service that lets you " sell anything you can share " which is to say - anything you do n't need to collect shipping information for .
Each purchase ends with a download link .
You create " links " that send you over to a Gumroad page where customers can enter an email address , credit card number , and boom - download what they purchased .
( Here 's an example I set up to sell one of my photos ) .
Who makes it ?
Gumroad , Inc
Why is it the killerest ?
It 's not PayPal .
Everything is elegant , simple and quick .
For entrepreneurs , I could see using it to sell stuff like advertising slots , access to a beta release , an ebook , software , stuff like that .
Here 's a nice demo they put together so you can see how it would work .
What could be improved ?
Your customers do n't have to hassle with PayPal , but Gumroad does use PayPal to pay you what you earn .
Direct deposit in my bank account would be a lot better .
They also ask for a $ 10 minimum owed , and 60 days to pay you ( I assume they pay quicker than that though ) .
It 's a touch buggy still ( I created a link , and it created two for me - easy enough to delete one though ) .
I 'd love an embed option .
Let me just drop a button on a page that opens up with this Gumroad goodness .
Every PayPal button on the internet tied to an intangible could be replaced with it .
It 's a little pricey .

5 % + $ 0.30 per transaction Rating ?

Today I was struck again by what an amazing time it is to build an internet startup .
I was on a phone call with a startup in the early stages .
They 've got an awesome idea , a smart team , good connections , validated market research , a bunch of groundwork laid , and now they 're ready to turn the idea into an internet business .
Like many of us , they 're bootstrapping it .
They need an MVP .
Five years ago , they 'd be toast .
Three years ago they'd be out of luck .
Two or even one year ago it would have been really tricky to put it all together .
Today ?
They 've got amazing options .
Here 's the basic sitemap I helped them put together :
They can cobble together various products and pieces which are very low cost , highly functional , and build something extraordinary .
This is n't a panacea , of course .
Pulling it off well is going to take some care and work , but they can do in a couple of months what would have previously been virtually impossible for a bootstrapper .
And this option is available to all of us .
With these resources we can focus less on the technology , and more on the business .
Which means a potential for higher output , higher quality , and greater functionality for a fraction of the ramp - up time and cost .
Mix in some creativity and smarts , and things are starting to get really awesome .
We 're in a golden age of internet startup possibilities .
I 'll leave you with this nugget from Seth Godin :
Make something happen
If I had to pick one piece of marketing advice to give you , that would be it .
Now .
Make something happen today , before you go home , before the end of the week .
Launch that idea , post that post , run that ad , call that customer .
Go the edge , that edge you 've been holding back from ... and do it today .
Without waiting for the committee or your boss or the market .
Just go .

What is it ?
Launch Effect : A free WordPress theme anyone can use to quickly create a professional looking , virally inclined pre-launch page for your upcoming product website , app , service , etc. ) .
Who makes it ?
Barrel LLC
Why is it the killerest ?
First let me state that I 'm saving you some trouble , because I did this the hard way first .
For my latest venture I started by building a pre-launch site from scratch .
It 's a couple pages , right ?
How hard can it be ?
Well - to do well , actually - kinda hard .
Or , time consuming anyway .
Consuming of time you should be spending building your New Thing .
1 . It 's very easy to set up - virtually anyone can do it .
I 'm no WordPress guru , but I went from nothing to a fully launched site in just a few hours .
First , I fired up a super cheap hosting account with my registrar NameCheap .
Once my account was set up , I logged in , installed WordPress ( literally a few mouse clicks ) , then downloaded the Launch Effect theme , uploaded and installed it in my WordPress , made a few tweaks , and my site was ready to go .
2 . It 's got built in social - sharing tools and viral spreading motivation
This is perhaps the nicest feature and something you likely would n't have time to build yourself .
And it 's all baked in , and very easy to configure .
How it works :
After someone gives you their email address , they 're presented with a thank you message , and a panel of social icons they can click to share .
Subscribers are also given a unique tracking link .
When they use that link ( or any of the icons ) to share , you and they will both be able to see how many folks they 've sent to the site , and how many signed up themselves .
Additionally , you can give them an incentive to share .
On mine , I 'm giving away a free lifetime account to someone who shares and leads someone else to sign up .
3 . It 's got great built in tracking
As mentioned above , each person who signs up will show up in your admin panel , along with the number of clicks they 've sent you , and how many of those have also signed up ( plus conversion rate ) .
Both you , and they can see these stats at any time .
What could be improved ?
Tracking your referrals is too confusing for visitors .
When a visitor shares , they have access to their referral , and conversion stats , but in order to see that information , they have to re-submit their email address into the signup form .
Clever - but how on earth are they supposed to know that ?
There 's really no good way to communicate that to them at this point .
It needs to integrate with MailChimp and / or Campaign Monitor .
First , it 's very easy to export your signups in a CSV and import them into MailChimp - which , if you 're only going to do that once , is no big deal .
But ideally , you 'd like to get an auto - response email to your signups .
This would allow you to tell them about the referral stuff noted in my last complaint , as well as a few other bells and whistles that MailChimp offers .
It 's a bit hard to fully customize without touching the code .
Out of the box , it probably does most everything you need , and you can certainly make a perfectly good - enough site without customization .
But if what you want to do is n't exactly what the theme expects you to do , you 'll need to dive into the css and / or php files .
This is a minor niggle though , it has very solid customization constructs .
It has only a small subset of the available Google Fonts to work with .
That said , they do natively support TypeKit and MonoType .
And I note , they 're working improving it .
This roadmap looks great .

I enjoy entrepreneurship , startups , business and the like the same way my brother in law enjoys baseball and basketball .
Which is to say , I 'm a rabid , foaming - at - the - mouth fan .
Rarely a day goes by that I do n't read , study , research , observe , or consult on the topic .
And like many of you , I 'm constantly engaged in my own attempts at it .
It captivates my attention like little else .
I 'm only a casual sports fan , so working this metaphor further will be perilous , but I 'll just say that Gold Rush is as close as I 'm going to come to the euphoria , mental swings , and irrational emotional investment that some folks have watching sports .
Gold Rush is extra interesting to me because it has all the elements of an engaging startup story , but in a completely different context than my world .
For the uninitiated ( and my apologies for those outside the US who may not have access to it ) , Gold Rush is a TV series which follows a team of hard scrabble , go - for - broke , all - in , heart - and - soul , down - on - their - luck dreamers who aim to cash in on the current high price of gold by starting a mining operation in Alaska .
Watching the sacrifices they make , the bond that builds between them , the impossible odds against them , and their pure unflagging determination in the face of a relentless wave of obstacles is , in a word , inspiring .
The parallels to the startup world that you and I live in are myriad .
There are probably some weirdos who appreciate entrepreneurism , yet do n't like this show for some reason , but I can't imagine who .
The ( relative ) ratings boom the show has enjoyed confirms that my affection for the show is not uncommon .
If you enjoy a good story , an against - all - odds tale of struggle in realizing your dream , this is a bit of television well worth your time .
If you have n't started yet , do yourself a favor and start with season one .
Unfortunately they do n't make it easy .
But there are a couple options .

What is it ?
Answers.OnStartups.com BrightJourney.com : A question and answer site focused on Startups and Entrepreneurship .
Who makes it ?
Stack Exchange ( with a dash of clout from Dharmesh Shah )
Why is it the killerest ?
Stack Exchange ( the company behind this ) have built a highly effective Question - and - Answer gamification format offering .
They started with the absurdly successful Stack Overflow which is focused on answering software development questions , and applied the model to various other topics , including startups .
All of us have questions as we venture into these challenging startup waters , and Answers OnStartups is a productive place ask them .
Because of the reward system built into the site , you will typically get high quality , and varied answers from experienced folks who know what they 're talking about .
It also skews heavily toward online and software startups , which is where my own passion lies ( as it does for many of you ) .
What could be improved ?
I 've been watching and participating for a few weeks now and I 've had a great time , but two things could be improved :
1 ) The number of participants .
What it has now is great , but I would love it to reach the level of some of the higher volume Stack Exchange sites .
I know a bunch of you reading this have valuable insights to share , so get over there .
2 ) Some repetition in questions .
Equity splitting , marketing , and funding questions occupy a large percent of the questions .
That said , there are still interesting and helpful questions posted frequently .
How much does it cost ?
Free

Finding a good domain name is hard .
If you 're like me , you 've spent absurd amounts of time on this task .
Including time which would be much better spent building your product / website / company .
Here are a list of tools I use which have significantly reduced the time I spend looking for a good domain , and have also significanly improved the quality of the domain names I end up with .
Domain Hole Panabee Name Station Bust a Name - takes a little getting used to , and is a bit painful to use , but can be valuable at getting you to think about connected ideas Value Drops , these guys update every day with quality domain names recently expired .
Domai.nr helps you find creative url structures for that name you really , really want to use .
Wordoid helps you make up names .
Avail .io LeanDomainSearch - punch in a word , get a bunch of pairs Domize.com NameMesh
And finally here 's an even more comprehensive list of tools - dozens deep .

Rounding out my landing page coverage , I 'd like to share some insights from a page in the wild that does a nice job incorporating the principles we 've been discussing here .
Stu Green , the creator , was kind enough to answer a few questions about what they 're doing :
How are you getting traffic ?
We have a few channels that put traffic through to Invoice Bubble .
The best way to get solid traffic is by getting reviewed or getting featured in CSS galleries .
We got a lot of traffic after being featured in a web gallery called Web Creme , plus we also had a few writeups and reviews on sites like MakeUseOf and Tuttoaster .
How well is that traffic converting to signup ?
The social buzz really kicked up when we made Invoice Bubble free .
We suddenly found that we were getting lots of traffic through social bookmarking because it changed from being another premium web app , to being a useful and FREE tool for freelancers .
When that happened our signup conversion also shot up from about 2 % to about 8 % of all unique visitations , which is a massive jump - but one that you would expect given the very low risk factor for signing up ( its free ) .
Those are nice conversion rates .
What principles are you employing on your landing page to achieve that success ?
Our landing page is simple .
It says what it does on the tin " Free Online Invoice Software " .
Everything is big , clear and obvious with no messing around .
We have clear call to actions to either " Get Started for Free " , or to " Take the Tour " .
Every page basically ends up on the sign up page , so therefore people have two options , close the website or sign up .
The only reason that someone would n't sign up is that they are not interested in using the app .
Therefore with that clear choice in mind , we get a pretty good percentage that do end up deciding to sign up and use the app .
How did you figure out these principles ?
The way that we learnt those principles is purely by trial and error .
We have tried 30 day trials , we have tried having just a landing page and no Tour , we have tried really clear and bold headings on the landing page ( as you see ) , and more long - winded explanations of the app , we have tried different pricing and tried ultimately making the app completely free .
So its only by experimentation that we have learnt those lessons .
One thing that we do n't do on Invoice Bubble that we DO do on Project Bubble ( the bigger brother app ) is to show a video .
I would say the most important thing when designing a good landing page is to be really clear about what the product offers , have clear calls to action ( as you see on Invoice Bubble ) , but also show off the product in a video and give your users NO excuse not to click on the video .
A human voice , visuals and music can do so much for your conversion rate than any ordinary text could ever do .
When we put a video on Project Bubble it almost doubled our conversion rate , so we might do the same thing for Invoice Bubble in the future .
Great insights Stu !
Thanks for sharing .

If you have n't seen the new Think Vitamin Membership offering from Carsonified , and you 're a web developer of any kind , it 's worth checking out .
Below I 've embedded one of their free videos ( most are behind a pay wall ) that does a great job of explaining some of the principles behind a proper landing page .
They do n't use that exact language , but you 'll see the familiar principles at play .
Enjoy .

Do n't over - complicate things , a successful landing page is simple and focused .
When visitors land on your page , they have a few questions in mind , and your landing page should answer them .
Does it offer what I need ?
What does it look like ?
How much does it cost ?
And before they act , they also want to know : Can I trust you ?
Finally , they need a way to convert .
This should not be hard to find , do , or figure out .
A old designer trick that works well here is to sit back and squint your eyes at your landing page and see if it 's obvious how to act .
I 've taken a few successful landing pages with different conversion methods , and done some of that work for you to illustrate you what I mean .
As you look over these page screenshots , is it obvious how to convert ?

This one is simple .
The metric that matters when defining a " successful " landing page is profitability .
You need to make more than you spend to bring the traffic .
If you 're spending X to get traffic , and you 're profiting X - plus - anything after the conversion , you 're successful .
If not , you are n't .
This might require a 25 % conversion rate , or it might work with a 1 % conversion rate .
A couple of examples of a successful landing page :
You are running an AdWords campaign , and you pay $ 1.00 per click and you have a 1 % conversion rate .
Your offering costs $ 150 .
Assuming you have less than $ 50 in labor and other costs associated with a conversion , you 're profitable and have a successful landing page at a 1 % conversion rate .
You are giving way an eBook full of great , useful information .
In the eBook you establish yourself as an expert . 25 % of those who land on your page click the link and download your book .
Of those who download the eBook , 0.2 % ( 1 in 500 ) hire you to consult .
You make $ 200 / hr consulting and a typical gig is 25 hours .
You 're not spending anything explicitly to gain traffic , but you 're hustling to spread the word using social media .
Each month you get 4,000 visitors to your landing page ( giving away 1,000 eBooks ) .
That translates to two consulting gigs , or $ 10,000 which is enough to cover your overhead with enough left over to live the way you 'd like .
You 're profitable at a 25 % conversion rate .
( btw , do you have a successful landing page ?
You should share it with us ) .

Religious right fumes after Arnold signs gay rights bill
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday August 29 , 2006
The religious right is fuming after California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a law that requires schools that receive state funds to introduce nondiscriminatory practices relating to sexual orientation , RAW STORY has learned .
California Assemblyman Doug LaMalfa said earlier that this month that the bill would result " in tremendous crippling , if not complete destruction , of Christian Universities and colleges all throughout California . "
" He speaks at churches and says he believes in religious freedom and family values , " said Randy Thomasson , president of Campaign for Children and Families in a release , " yet hes stabbing pro-family Californians in the back .
People of faith are suffering under Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Hes not the lesser of two evils , hes doing evil . 
 People of conscience are appalled that Arnold Schwarzenegger has trampled religious freedom to satisfy hyperactive sexual activists ,  Thomasson railed .
" Schwarzenegger is ... [ trampling ] religious freedom at the bidding of liberal activists from San Francisco and West Hollywood . "
Christian colleges last week wrote Schwarzenegger urging him not to sign the law .
Schwarzenegger signed the bill -- which not a single Republican and all but one Democrat in the state legislature supported - - into law today .
Campaign for Children and Families has called the law a " sexual indoctrination bill . "
" The gates of hell are prevailing against the church , " Thomasson told World Net Daily for a story titled , " Gov. Arnold Tosses Out School Moral Codes . "
Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo , the president of the Vatican 's Pontifical Council for the Family , said in addition to the doctors and nurses , the measure could apply to " relatives , politicians and lawmakers " whom he called " protagonists in this abominable crime " .
The girl , whose identity has not been released , had " fallen in the hands of evildoers " , the cardinal said in an interview with local television on Tuesday .
In May Colombia 's constitutional court partially lifted the ban on abortion in this deeply Catholic country , allowing pregnancies to be terminated in cases of severe deformity of the foetus , when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or when the mother 's life is in danger .
The first test of the ruling came when the girl sought to terminate her pregnancy , which followed her being raped by her stepfather .
The man admitted to the abuse , which began when the child was seven .
When the case became public , doctors were wary of performing the abortion as the text of the court 's ruling has yet to be published and they feared prosecution .
But the high court issued a new ruling , compelling doctors to abide by its decision if the woman 's case fell within the criteria .
Once the ruling was handed down , the girl 's pregnancy was terminated at a public hospital in Bogotá .
Carlos Lemus , the director of Simon Bolivar hospital where the abortion was performed , said he respected the church 's decision but did not share its view .
" We acted within the constitutional framework , " Dr Lemus said .
" We were faced with the petition of a girl who wanted to go back to playing with her toys . "
He said Cardinal Trujillo " calls the doctors and nurses ' evildoers ' .
I think the person who raped her is the evildoer " .
A senator , Gina Parody , said : " The Vatican has the right to excommunicate whomever they choose .
But I would hope that they also excommunicate priests when they rape boys or girls . "
The president of Colombia 's ecclesiastic tribunal , Monsignor Libardo Ramírez , said according to canonical law excommunication was applied to anyone who participated in the " murder of a child in the womb " .
But he added that it would be up to Cardinal Rubiano Sáenz , as the leading figure of the Roman Catholic church in Colombia , to decide whether to formally apply the sanctions and to whom .
Public health authorities have estimated that more than 300,000 clandestine abortions are carried out each year in the country .
Illegal abortion is punishable by up to three years in prison for both the women who terminate their pregnancies and for the doctors who perform the procedure .
Generators
The Scanning Problem
Here 's a very common programming problem :
Repeatedly collect items from an input stream into chunks , until the stream is empty .
For example , compilers for C and Pascal , and the Lisp reader , collect characters from the input stream to form tokens , where each token is either a name or number or punctuation element .
Another example is compress on page 37 of Graham 's ANSI Common Lisp .
This function collects items from a list into pairs of the form ( number element ) , indicating how often each item is repeated .
Ideally , we 'd like our code to break down into two pieces :
a function that collects some input elements and returns a chunk
a function that applies the chunking function to the input until the input is emptied
The key problem in defining these scanning functions is that the second function needs two values from the first function :
a token or chunk of some kind
the remainder of the input
Doing this cleanly , following the Cardinal Rule of Functions , takes some thought .
Approach 1 : Extra Parameters
Graham 's definition of compress defined a new function , compr , that took three arguments :
the element being scanned for
the current number of elements seen so far
the input list remaining
The second and third arguments hold the two values needed , and recursion was used to repeat the process until the list was emptied .
Unfortunately , the function compr is not very clear .
It has a terrible name , but it 's hard to give it a good name because it violates the Cardinal Rule of Functions and mixes several tasks together .
Approach 2 : Chunk then Trim
In this particular example , it turns out to not be too hard to use a scanning function that takes an object and a list and returns the length of the run of that element .
We 'll give a recursive definition of the scanning function here :
( defun get - run ( x l ) ( cond ( ( null l ) 0 ) ( ( not ( eql x ( first l ) ) ) 0 ) ( t ( 1+ ( get -run x ( rest l ) ) ) ) ) )
An iterative definition would be better here , because it would handle runs of any length without overflowing the function call stack .
Even better would be to take advantage of Common Lisp 's large library of sequence functions , e.g. ,
( defun get - run ( x l ) ( or ( position x l : test - not # 'eql ) ) ( length l ) ) )
Or , if you want to avoid the " deprecated " : test - not feature :
( defun get - run ( x l ) ( or ( position x l : test ( complement # 'eql ) ) ( length l ) ) )
compress can then be defined as a repeated call to get - run :
( defun compress ( l ) ( cond ( ( null l ) nil ) ( t ( let ( ( run ( 1+ ( get -run ( first l ) ( rest l ) ) ) ) ) ( cons ( list run ( first l ) ) ( compress ( nthcdr run l ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Unfortunately , this version of compress is still a little messy .
More importantly , it does n't generalize well .
After get - run scans the list , it returns how many items it found .
This number is then used to trim the list .
It works because it 's easy and relatively cheap to use the run-length to trim off the items used so far , but this is n't always the case , plus it leads to the messy nesting .
Approach 3 : Generators
Because chunking streams is a common problem , we could go for a general solution and define some functions that capture the procedural flow underlying the general solution to this kind of problem .
Note .
generators.lisp contains everything given below , except for the compression - specific functions , plus a few extras .
First , we define a new concept , a generator .
A generator is a function that you call to get elements from some source .
That source can be an input stream , a list of elements , an incrementing counter , whatever .
A generator takes one argument :
If the argument is : get , the current generator element is returned , if any .
, the current generator element is returned , if any .
If that argument is : test , then nil is returned if there is no current element .
, then is returned if there is no current element .
If that argument is : next , the current element is advanced to the next one , if any , and the previous current element is returned .
( Odd as the last rule may seem , it tends to be the most useful of the obvious options , just as i++ is more commonly used than ++i in C and C ++. )
We can define generators using closures .
We can do this on as needed basis , but a couple of generator - creating functions are particularly useful and easy to define .
For example , make - number - gen makes generators that generate numbers from M to N .
If no N is given , the generator never runs out , i.e , never returns nil to : test .
( defun make - number - gen ( m &optional n ) # '( lambda ( cmd ) ( ecase cmd ( : test ( and ( numberp n ) (> m n ) ) ) ( : get m ) ( : next ( prog1 m ( unless ( and ( numberp n ) (> m n ) ) ( incf m ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Note the use of prog1 to save and return the old value of m .
The function make - list - gen makes generators that generate elements from a list , from left to right .
( defun make - list - gen ( l ) # '( lambda ( cmd ) ( ecase cmd ( : test ( null l ) ) ( : get ( car l ) ) ( : next ( pop l ) ) ) ) )
We could define more generator - making functions , but now let 's define three simple functions that will make code using generators more readable , and less dependent on how they 're implemented .
( defun empty - gen -p ( gen ) ( funcall gen : test ) ) ( defun gen-elt ( gen ) ( funcall gen : get ) ) ( defun advance - gen ( gen ) ( funcall gen : next ) )
A good example of a generator - using function , and a handy one for testing generators , is extrude .
( extrude n gen ) returns a list of the first N elements generated by the generator gen .
( defun extrude ( n gen ) ( do ( (l nil ( cons ( advance - gen gen ) l ) ) ( i 0 ( 1+ i ) ) ) ( ( or ( empty - gen - p gen ) ( >= i n ) ) ( nreverse l ) ) ) )
Here are some examples :
? ( extrude 5 ( make- number-gen 3 ) ) ( 3 4 5 6 7 ) ? ( extrude 5 ( make- number-gen 3 6 ) ) ( 3 4 5 ) ?
( extrude 5 ( make - list - gen '( a b c d e f ) ) ) ( A B C D E ) ? ( extrude 5 ( make - list - gen '( a b c ) ) ) ( A B C )
Now , with all this background out of the way , here is how we would use generators for our compression problem .
First , we define get - run .
It keeps calling the generator until an element different than the given element is returned .
It returns the pair ( number elt ) indicating how many occurrences of the element it saw , counting the given one .
( defun get - run ( elt gen ) ( do ( (n 1 ( 1+ n ) ) ) ( ( or ( empty - gen - p gen ) ( not ( eql elt ( gen-elt gen ) ) ) ) ( list n elt ) ) ( advance - gen gen ) ) )
Finally , compress just calls get - run until the generator is exhausted .
( defun compress ( l ) ( let ( ( gen ( make - list - gen l ) ) ) ( do ( ( run -pairs nil ( cons ( get -run ( advance - gen gen ) gen ) run-pairs ) ) ) ( ( empty - gen - p gen ) ( nreverse run-pairs ) ) ) ) )
Background
Generators have a long history in Lisp and other functional programming languages .
The Common Lisp standard defines a particularly sophisticated set of series , generators and gatherers .
See Common Lisp The Language , 2nd edition , by Guy L. Steele Jr. , Appendices A and B ( Digital Press , 1990 ) .
In Scheme , they 're called streams .
See Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs , Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman , Section 3.4 ( MIT Press , 1985 )
C++ has the same thing , only they call them iterators .
Mitchell Model explains quite nicely why C++ iterators are really not iterators , and why real iterators would be hard to do in C ++.
See Data Structures , Data Abstraction : A Contemporary Introduction Using C++ , Mitchell L. Model , p. 57 and Appendix C ( Prentice - Hall , 1994 ) .

Send mail to Chris Riesbeck .
Professor Alan Smithers ' exhaustive worldwide study of the benefits of single - sex schooling has revealed what many of us suspected : there are n't any .
Single - sex schools score highly in league tables but , as Smithers shows , it is because many of these schools are grammars or independent .
Here we have further evidence of the irrepressible dishonesty employed by those who seek to maintain - or to reintroduce - outmoded educational traditions .
Hold a neo -Victorian model up as being likely to improve academic standards , manipulate admissions criteria so an improvement in results is inevitable , and then spend the rest of the year shouting about how successful your new wheeze has been .
We live in a PR - infected world .
Much public service nowadays consists less of doing a job , more of stating ad nauseam how well it is being done .
Smithers ' findings mean we have yet another meaningless stock phrase to dump in the dustbin of unfunny jokes that populate much of the British education debate .
" Single - sex education causes academic improvement , " can be added to the hilarious " specialism drives up standards across the curriculum " gag currently making many staff at specialist schools choke on their lunch , and to that killer punch - line : " Improvement in results at academies is not down to manipulated admissions . "
My own objection to the idea of single - sex schooling is probably overly simplistic , and revolves around the fact that it is unnatural .
It engenders fear and distrust of a mysterious other .
We go to co-educational nurseries , and to mixed infant and primary schools .
And we do this happily and naturally , mixing with the other gender with ease .
When we reach the age of 11 , however , our education system can divide humans into two entirely distinct species .
Socially , this is almost as disastrous as educating different creeds in separate schools .
Teenagers who have grown up in single - sex schools , boys or girls , are not able to act naturally around the opposite sex , perhaps ever .
Any system that encourages half the population to be scared of the other half is idiotic by design .
It stores up a well of misunderstanding that festers mockingly within us , having ruinous effects throughout the journey of our lives .
There has been some suggestion that single - sex schools are under increasing threat .
Far from it - the education bill has provided for them to expand .
Let me explain .
Many girls ' schools are considered to be successful , and as " successful " schools are to consider expanding , it is likely that many girls ' schools will do so .
Where their neighbouring school is co-educational , the creaming off of more female students will inevitably affect the gender balance at the co-educational school .
There are already parts of the country where supposedly co-educational schools have a gender balance of three boys for every girl .
This does nothing for these schools ' results , thereby further conferring on them " sink " status ; and meaning more girls are recruited for their single - sex neighbour , so that eventually you are left with one school for high - performing girls , and another for the boys plus any girls who do n't pass academic muster .
This situation exists already , and will be exacerbated by the education bill .
Our children are more mature than many give them credit for , and can cope perfectly well with being in the same class as the opposite sex without turning into a raging sea of hormones .
I taught an all - boys class in a mixed school last year .
There were some benefits , but most interesting was the response of the girls who'd had the boys taken from their English lessons .
They were passionate in their opposition .
We need the boys back , they said , so that lessons are more lively , and they need us to help them .
5 hot products for the future
The Institute for the Future could n't get clients to read its trend forecasts .
So it started giving away prescient product ideas instead .
( Business 2.0 Magazine ) - Trendspotting is serious business .
So much so that the Institute for the Future , a Palo Alto - based think tank , produces an annual 96 - page 10 - year forecast - an exhaustive compendium of societal and technological trends , widely regarded as the bellwether of long - range planning .
Just one problem : " Clients were n't reading the reports , " admits Jason Tester , the IFTF 's research and design manager .
So , in summer 2003 , Tester tried a different tack that became known as " artifacts from the future " : mocked - up products claiming to be from , say , 2009 .
You might go to an IFTF presentation and see baskets of finessed fruit that promise cognitive enhancement .
Or you might wake up in the hotel where the IFTF seminar was being held to find your newspaper dated 10 years hence .
Artifacts were intended to start conversations .
They worked .
Mark Schar , senior vice president of financial software company Intuit , an IFTF client , says , " When you present forecasts to a group of executives , you 're standing there and waving your arms a lot .
When you put an artifact in front of them , they go , ' Oh , I get it . ' "
IFTF clients now pay the nonprofit as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for research that includes custom artifacts .
For Procter & Gamble ( Research ) , a client for 20 years , artifacts have inspired real products .
( P& G wo n't say which ones . )
Could what worked for P&G work for you ?
Is the IFTF offering prescient market research ?
We trawled Tester 's archive of artifacts to find out .
In one case ( the RFID blocker ) , a similar technology has been released since Tester did his mock - up .
Click here to see a photo gallery of the other ideas the nonprofit institute has come up with - and how likely each is to become serious business too .

Okay , this one was a little bit of a tongue twister so I was n’t quite sure how to say it .
Technically I should say Firefox 2 RC1 RC1 but I guess it would make more sense if I refer to it as the first Release Candidate of Firefox RC1 .
Well , it does n’t really matter how you say it , instead all that matters is that the download is available .
Here are the direct links for the downloads of the English versions ( the only language currently available ) :
There have been quite a few great visual changes going on since Firefox 2 Beta 2 was released .
I think everyone will be much more pleased with how the theme is progressing as we head into the final homestretch .
The tabs look much more streamlined and the navigation buttons do n’t look so washed out .
Oh , and we ca n’t forget about the cool new Refresh button in this release . :)
I have also put together a portable version of the RC1 to make it a little easier to try .
All you have to do is download the Firefox Portable file .
Then you unzip the file and browse for the file FirefoxPortable .exe .
Just execute that file and you will be running the first Release Candidate of Firefox 2 RC1 !
The profile is kept with the FirefoxPortable folder so you do n’t have to worry about messing up your other profile and the uninstallation process is simple … just delete the folder !
NOTE : Yes , the final release of Firefox 2 RC1 was supposed to be today but it has been pushed back until September 26 .
I would also expect to see the final release of Firefox 2 pushed back into early November because of the recent unexpected delays .
So I was pissed off first thing this morning .
I ran into an article written a few days ago on Cnet which quoted IBM Developer Sam Ruby saying the following about cellphones :
“ It ’s killing the landline ; it ’s killing watches ; it ’s changing the camera business ; it ’s changing the TV industry , the music industry , ” Ruby said Monday at the New Paradigms for Using Computers ( NPUC ) 2006 workshop at the IBM Almaden Research Center here .
“ It ’s destroying the pay - phone industry .
It ’s hurting the hotel industry and putting the squeeze on universities , ” he said during a talk titled “ Teenagers on the Go . ”
Wait a fucking minute , I thought .
Did n’t I say that ?
Verbatim .
I put on my Che Guevara shirt and seethed .
Then realized I was acting like a fucking idiot .
We live in the knowledge age .
And this generation probably has more obsolete knowledge in it ’s collective head than any other time in history .
99 % of what matters lies outside our own head .
And smart people suck up the ideas of others and remix them in a way that makes sense to them and their audience .
... So yeah I sampled your voice , you was usin it wrong
You made it a hot line , I made it a hot song ...
-- Jay -Z ( the Takeover )
Earlier today I linked to an article by a Yale professor about how copyright judges should look at copyright the same way economist look at the environment .
The environment is a complex system and so are copyrights .
But some of us ( even me sometimes ) want to look at things as if they are simple .
One of the hallmarks of this age is complexity .
Look at sports .
Think about how many people are employed by the typical baseball team .
The game has n’t really changed in 100 years but few would argue it ’s not more complex .
Multiply that by everything .
And that will give you a sense of how much more complex the world is today .
In a complex system , like the internet , or life in general , if you did n’t soak up or was anyway effected by the stuff around you could n’t be part of the system anyway .
In other words , if I did n’t want my thoughts remixed why did I post them on my blog in the first place ?

How to get people talking about your product
Scene : A Marketing Meeting in the Conference Room
Mickey the Product Manager has called Daisy and Goofy into a meeting to discuss promotional plans for their upcoming new product .
Mickey : Welcome , Team !
Time is growing short .
Our product is now in beta , so we need to decide how we 're going to do the marketing .
Any ideas ?
Daisy : Maybe we should run a bunch of ads in magazines ?
Goofy : Yeah !
That 's a great idea !
The professor in my marketing class told us that magazine ads are one of the most effective forms of promotion .
Mickey : Actually , I saw a post on Eric Sink 's blog which said that all magazines are going to be out of business by sometime this fall .
Any other ideas ?
Daisy : Maybe we should do some word of mouth marketing ?
Goofy : Yeah !
That 's a great idea !
The professor in my marketing class told us that word of mouth is one of the most effective forms of promotion .
Mickey : Excellent !
It 's settled then .
We 'll use word of mouth marketing to promote our new product .
Great work , Team !
Word - of - mouth is not a strategy
Everybody knows how powerful word - of - mouth and buzz can be .
Lots of ink has been spilled about all the nice things that happen when people are talking about your product .
But this is a little bit like explaining the nice things that rich people can buy .
It is obvious that good results are good .
We do n't need to be told that .
What we need to know is how to make those good results happen .
Word - of - mouth is not a strategy .
It is the result of a strategy .
How do we make it happen ?
Begging bloggers for links
In the last couple years , the most popular way of trying to generate word - of - mouth marketing is a two - part strategy that looks like this :
Make a list of all the top bloggers .
Send email to them and ask them to mention your product .
This wo n't work .
In fact , any marketing approach which is a post - processing step is going to give very disappointing results .
Recall that there are two phases of marketing :
Phase 1 , Strategy : Make decisions about your product to focus it on a certain market .
Phase 2 , Communications :
Tell everyone about your product .
If you want to generate buzz , you have to start early .
The foundation of buzz lies in the decisions you make in phase 1 , not in the tasks you perform in phase 2 .
How to Get No Buzz
The most popular two step product strategy is :
Find a Very Large Group of People Build a product and hope that 5 % of them will buy it .
This wo n't work .
It seems like it should work .
We chose a Very Large Group of People to make the numbers look good .
Five percent of a big number is a lot more revenue than five percent of a small number , right ?
And if our product has enough features , surely one out of every twenty people will like it , right ?
The result of this approach is that you do n't have enough focus to make good feature decisions .
The Very Large Group of People is simply too diverse .
You can't decide which features to leave out because every time you consider a feature , you can think of at least one person in your Very Large Group of People who might want it .
Your best case result with this strategy is that you end up with a product that everybody likes , but nobody loves .
Nobody is going to see your product and believe it was perfectly designed just for them .
Therefore , nobody is going to call , email or blog their friends and tell them how great your product is .
Bottom line :
No word - of - mouth .
No buzz .
Instead , focus on a smaller group
The better approach is far less intuitive , but far more effective :
Find a Very Small Group of People that share common interests Build a product that 100 % of them will love
Numerically , this sounds wrong :
You want me to focus on a small group of people ?
Why would I do that ?
Should n't I go after the largest market I can ?
And how am I supposed to get 100 % of the market ?
That 's just nonsense .
The reason this approach works is because it is much easier to delight a small homogenous group of people than a large diverse group of people .
And your product will ship sooner because you only need the features that are required by the folks in your Very Small Group of People .
And most importantly , when your product does ship , you will have set the stage for buzz and word - of - mouth to happen .
If your product is so perfectly designed to delight your customers , they will be dying to talk about it .
Build a product that is worth talking about
People do n't talk about products because somebody asked them to .
People talk about products because they 're interesting .
They talk about products they love .
Recently Scott Hanslemann posted a blog entry about a product called FinePrint .
Why did he do this ?
Did he post this entry because some marketing drone at FinePrint asked him to mention their product ?
No .
.
Did he post this entry because he is so impressed with FinePrint that he just can't manage to keep quiet about it ?
Probably .
The first step in getting people to talk about your product is to have a product that is worth talking about .
Design something insanely great .
Think about the folks in your Very Small Group of People , and build a product that they will love so much that they can't keep quiet about it .
An example of great word - of - mouth
Delphi is a programming language and development tool from Borland .
It is very highly regarded by its users .
People often speak of how it allows developers to be extremely productive and how it generates very efficient standalone Win32 executables .
Borland is currently in the process of spinning out its developer tools into a new company which is informally referred to as " DevCo " .
Three weeks ago I published chapter 9 of my Source Control HOWTO , in which I rather whimsically exaggerated by saying that Eclipse and Visual Studio are the only two IDEs left in the world .
I figured that this might ruffle the features of anyone who is using one of the many other IDEs that admittedly still exist , but I did n't expect any sort of backlash .
Nick Hodges , product manager for Delphi , responded by asking his readers to go to my blog and post a comment in protest .
As a result , 15 raving Delphi fans posted their complaints about Delphi and Borland 's products in general .
#ifdef FRIENDLY_TRASH_TALK
Fifteen people ?
That 's like 20 % of all the remaining Delphi users on earth , right Nick ?
;-)
#endif
Truth be told , I was impressed .
I 've always heard that Delphi is a great product .
It 's clear that Delphi 's fans are a great group of people as well .
They 're passionate and they 're tightly knit .
DevCo has some big challenges ahead , but do n't count them out as long as their customers love the product as much as they apparently do .
But I was even more impressed with the Delphi community last week when I saw this post by Tate Needham from FinalBuilder .
Basically , he announced the results of a survey in which he asked his customers " Which Version Control systems do you currently use , or plan to use in the next 12 months ? "
The top ten responses were as follows :
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe Borland StarTeam Subversion FreeVCS / JediVCS CVS SourceGear Vault QSC Team Coherence Microsoft Team System Perforce Rational ClearCase
I think this data is very interesting in several ways , but I want to zero in just one issue :
Why is QSC Team Coherence ranked so high ?
I mean no disrespect to Team Coherence .
It seems like a fine product .
One of their people , Ewan McNab , is a regular on the same forum where I hang out .
But seriously now --
Does anybody really think that Team Coherence is the seventh most popular version control tool in the world ?
How could QSC 's product rank so high in this survey ?
Here 's why :
All of the responders to this survey were customers of FinalBuilder .
And FinalBuilder is written in Delphi .
And Team Coherence is written in Delphi as well .
If a similar survey were conducted with a much larger and more diverse group of developers , the results would almost certainly be very different .
For example , Perforce would rank higher , while Team Coherence would rank lower .
Please note that I am not crying foul or bias or unfairness .
In fact , I am delighted ( and quite surprised ) that my product ranked as high as it did among FinalBuilder developers , especially since Vault is not open source and has no particular connection to the Delphi community .
Furthermore , I am not intending to disparage any of the products on this list .
All the version control tools on the list above are fine tools and worthy competitors .
Except of course for SourceSafe , which everybody knows is a steaming pile of cow dung . :-)
My point here is simply this :
The community of Delphi developers is very strong , and they talk to each other .
They 're a perfect example of a Very Small Group of People .
Build a product that they will love , and before long , they wo n't be able to keep quiet about it .
Postscript : Preemptive responses to comments
" Eric , how can you say that the Delphi community is a Very Small Group of People ?
There are 500,000 of us ! "
Neopets has 70 million users .
MySpace has 100 million users .
Visual Studio has 5 million users .
A group of 500,000 people is Very Small .
And yet , it 's a big enough market to sell a product into .
" Eric , how can you say that people choose products based on what language the product is written in ?
People just want software that works .
They do n't care if it 's written in C# , Delphi or Erlang . "
Normal people think that way .
Many developers do n't .
A developer whose primary community affiliation is around a programming language with minority market share will definitely be more inclined to buy a developer tool that is written in that language .
" Eric , you forgot to point out that FreeVCS / JediVCS is written in Delphi as well . "
No , I did n't forget .
" Eric , how can you say that we have to try and get 100 % of our market niche ?
That 's impossible , right ? "
Right .
The point is not that you have to get absolutely every customer .
The point is that going after all of a niche will help sharpen your decision making .
" Eric , did you really say that all magazines are going to be out of business sometime this fall ? "
No , but Mickey seems to think that 's what I said .
On the other hand , Mickey is obviously an idiot .
" Eric , have you even used Delphi ? "
Nope .
I just think the Delphi community serves nicely as an example of my point .
" Eric , if you think the Delphi community is so cool , why does n't your product support any integration with Borland tools ? "
Er , good question .
Maybe we do n't get very many requests for this feature ?
And maybe that 's because Team Coherence is doing such a fine job serving the needs of Delphi users already ?
" Eric , how can you say that all we have to do is build a great product and the word - of - mouth will just happen automatically with no marketing communications effort at all ? "
I did n't say that .
I admit that there are things that can be done in the marketing communications phase to help generate buzz .
I 'm just saying that being interesting is a necessary condition for buzz , but it is not necessarily a sufficient one .
" Eric , I 'm in charge of promoting a product that is n't interesting .
You 're basically saying that there is nothing I can do to generate buzz .
You 're saying that all of the real mistakes were made a long time ago when the initial product decisions were made and now it 's too late to fix it .
How does this help me ? "
It does n't .
Probably , nothing is going to help you .
Do n't shoot the messenger .
" Eric , how can you say those terrible , unkind things about SourceSafe ? "
Oh , settle down .
I 'm just kidding .
SourceSafe works just fine for lots of people .
Its bad reputation is partly deserved and partly exaggerated .
In part , that 's because exaggerating is fun .
" Eric , have you even seen a steaming pile of cow dung ? "
Yep .
Here in the Midwest you can find them all over the place .

A post on Lambda the Ultimate recently was about an Oberon interpreter written in Javascript , allowing Oberon to be embedded in the browser .
This reminded me of an near - R5RS compatible Scheme written in Javascript called jsScheme .
It 's a very nice implementation to play with but is IE 6 only .
I 've done some hacking at it and made it compatible with Firefox .
I 've put the modified version here .
The modified version has some changes to cater for Firefox and some things still do n't work .
JIT compilation for example , so I 've left the checkbox for this disabled by default .
This does slow things down quite a bit but I 'll enable it again when I find the problem .
For IE JIT works fine and you can enable it .
If you find any other issues I 'd be keen to get feedback .
Leave a comment here or email me .
I 've also put the modified version in a darcs repository available with :
darcs get http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/repos/javascript-scheme
Please send me any patches you 'd like to apply .
What 's nice about this system is it has most of R5RS scheme implemented , including tail recursion and first class continuations .
A simple FFI for calling into Javascript is also available .
For example , here 's how to do some Javascript Date manipulation :
( define d ( js-eval " new Date ( ) ; " ) ) ( display ( js- invoke d " toString " ) ) ( newline )
' js - eval ' will evaluate Javascript code and return the object .
' js - invoke ' will invoke methods on that object .
There is also ' js - call ' which can call Javascript functions .
Unfortunately Firefox had problem using ' js - call ' on things like ' alert ' and ' setTimeout ' so I wrapped these built-ins with Javascript functions which can be called :
( js - call ( js-eval " jsAlert " ) " Hello World ! " )
' js - call ' will a Javascript function object .
The ' js - eval ' was required to return that function object given the function name .
Lambda the Ultimate also pointed to a Links paper recently .
In this paper they describe compiling the Links language to Javascript in continuation passing style and using this to implement user level threading for client side Javascript .
This should be possible using this Scheme system as well .
We can create continuations using call / cc and use the ' set - timeout ! ' function I added which wraps ' setTimeout ' to do the scheduling .
Here 's an example of using ' set - timeout ! '.
( set - timeout ! ( lambda ( ) ( alert " Hello World " ) ) 1000 )
This example waits one second and displays the alert .
Any Scheme function can be passed , including continuations :
( define abort # f ) ( define ( yield ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set-timeout ! k 10 ) ( abort ) ) ) ) ( define ( spawn thunk ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set! abort k ) ( thunk ) ) ) ) ( define ( fib n ) ( yield ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 0 ( if ( = n 1 ) 1 (+ ( fib (- n 1 ) ) ( fib (- n 2 ) ) ) ) ) )
This code allows you to spawn a single thread which will run in the background of the browser .
That thread can call ' yield ' to return control back to the browser for a brief time .
A simple fibonacci function is provided which calls ' yield ' .
For example :
( spawn ( lambda ( ) ( display ( fib 10 ) ) ) )
This will return control immediately .
You can carry on using the browser and the result will be displayed when the thread completes .
A simple thread scheduler implementation would be an interesting exercise .
A DNA molecule that stiffens and folds when it encounters cocaine is the engine that drives a new handheld , fast - acting drug detector .
Reliable tests for cocaine take several hours at a laboratory .
And although police and customs agents have field tests for cocaine , criminals often use masking chemicals to thwart these so - called " Scott tests . "
In a Scott test , a chemical changes color when it is added to substances that contain cocaine .
The new detector — scientists have built a rudimentary prototype — sees through the masking agents and can also sense cocaine in body fluids or materials that it comes in contact with .
Detecting tiny traces of cocaine in blood or salvia could someday allow the device to work much like a breathalyzer for alcohol , said biochemist Kevin Plaxco of the University of California , Santa Barbara .
So far the device has sniffed out cocaine mixed with many of the substances drug dealers use to cut the drug , including flour , sugar , baking soda , coffee , and mustard powder .
It also sees through such chemical masking agents as cobaltous thiocyanate , which sophisticated drug dealers mix into cocaine to fool the Scott test .
The detector works by passing an electronic signal through a type of DNA molecule , called an aptamer , that binds with other specific molecules , in this case cocaine .
This particular type of aptamer , which is synthetic , is usually floppy .
When it binds with cocaine , however , it stiffens up and assumes a structured , folded shape , which causes it to allow electrons to pass through it more readily .
The drug detector 's engine is a 1 - millimeter square electrode that is coated with somewhere around 100 million of the cocaine - friendly molecules .
After each test this electrode can be rinsed and reused with a loss in sensitivity of just 1 percent .
That means an electrode could be used perhaps 100 times before it would have to be replaced .
It also can be used immediately after washing , a key feature for a portable tester , Plaxco says .
" We wash it with a cocaine - free buffer and it resets in seconds , " he said .
Now the scientists are improving the detector 's sensitivity to cocaine , Plaxco said .
One route is to make aptamer molecules that are even more receptive to cocaine .
" If the DNA molecule binds cocaine more tightly , then it will take less cocaine to cause the folding , " he explained .
They are also refining the device 's electronic system to detect smaller changes in electrical current , and so smaller amounts of cocaine .
By using different aptamer DNA molecules that favor other substances , the same technology could be expanded to find other drugs , both the illicit type and the therapeutic variety whose levels must be closely monitored in patients .
" We 're monitoring a very specific binding - induced change in the DNA itself .
And that 's why our sensor works straight in blood serum , " Plaxco said .
" That 's the real advantage .
Other people have built biosensors that are just as sensitive as ours .
Other people have built biosensors using aptamers even , that are just as generalizable as ours .
Ours has both of those attributes and it works in blood , and dirt , and food .
That 's the huge advance . "
Australia 's policy of restricting antibiotic use in food - producing animals may be linked with lower levels of drug - resistant bacteria found in its citizens , according to an article in the May 15 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases , now available online .
Campylobacter jejuni is a leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness in industrialized countries .
Drug resistance can make Campylobacter infections difficult for physicians to treat , and can result in longer bouts of diarrhea and a higher risk of serious or even fatal illness .
Bacterial resistance to drugs is generally attributed to inappropriate prescribing or overuse of antibiotics .
An Australian solution to the drug resistance problem has been to prohibit the use of certain antibiotics , called fluoroquinolones , in food animals such as poultry .
Such a policy puts Australia in a relatively unique position , since its animal and food production levels are comparable to those of other industrialized nations , but it has avoided using the antibiotics that have been standard in the other countries ' food animal production .
To evaluate whether the country 's restrictive antibiotic policy has affected bacterial drug resistance , Australian researchers examined C. jejuni isolates collected from 585 patients in five Australian states .
None of the patients had received fluoroquinolone treatment within the month prior to becoming ill .
The researchers discovered that only 2 percent of the locally acquired Campylobacter isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin , a type of fluoroquinolone .
Countries that allow fluoroquinolone use in animals may have a drug resistance prevalence of up to 29 percent .
Ciprofloxacin can be used to treat severe Campylobacter disease , so a low level of bacterial drug resistance should lead to better treatment efficacy .
" There are different causes that lead to bacterial antibiotic resistance , and use of antibiotics in food animals is only one of the multiple causes , " said lead author Leanne Unicomb , an epidemiologist with OzFoodNet and Australia National University .
However , the evidence indicates that " use of fluoroquinolones in food animals in other countries has increased the risk of resistance in [ Campylobacter ] isolates infecting humans , " she said .
The researchers concluded that the low drug resistance they found " probably reflects Australia 's policy of prohibiting fluoroquinolones for animal use . "
Other industrialized nations have also realized the apparent benefits of restricting antimicrobial use in animals .
Sweden prohibited the use of fluoroquinolones for food animals in 1986 , Norway has never licensed their use in food animals , and both countries have reported low trends -- similar to Australia 's -- in fluoroquinolone - resistant Campylobacter infecting humans .
The United States , in a recent effort to reduce American levels of Campylobacter drug resistance , has taken a cue from other countries ' success .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed banning fluoroquinolones in poultry in 2000 , but one drugmaker fought the ban until it was finally enacted in September 2005 .
Reducing the use of antibiotics in food animals , coupled with the authors ' additional recommendation of " sensible use of fluoroquinolones in clinical settings , " seem to be steps in the right direction toward curbing harmful foodborne bacterial drug resistance .

All Things Pythonic
Too Much Fun with Python on Nokia Phone
by Guido van van Rossum
February 14 , 2006
Summary
Nokia gave me a phone to run Python .
I wish I could blog all night about it !
The phone is great , but the really cool part is how much effort Nokia has put in opening up the functionality to Python programmers !
A tip of the iceberg .
Advertisement
Full disclaimer : Every once in a while I get a boondoggle out of being Python 's BDFL .
The most recent is a model 6630 phone that Nokia gave me as an early Valentine .
So my review cannot be considered objective -- be warned !
I do n't quite know where to start .
The phone itself , even without Python , is incredibly cool ; I spent much of the weekend using it as a camera , and it worked remarkably well considering that it does n't have an optical zoom or a flash , and is " only " 1.3 megapixels .
The phone came with a cable to connect it to USB port , and a CD full of software - Windows only .
I guess this means I can sync it to Outlook or so .
But I do n't use that any more .
On my Mac , plugging in the USB cable does n't seem to do anything , and there 's no Mac software on the CD , but guess what : iSync supports this phone over Bluetooth ( with the right icon and all ! ) .
And they do n't even sell this model in the US .
Great job , Apple !
Next , Python .
I still have n't written any significant Python code for the phone , but I 've explored Nokia 's examples a bit and walked through most of the MobiLenin.com tutorial ( see previous blog ) .
When writing Python code for a phone , of course the first obstacle is , how to write code ?
You do n't really want to edit your code on the phone 's numeric keyboard !
Fortunately there 's a way to connect a PC or Mac to the phone over Bluetooth , and the Python application on the phone supports interactive sessions this way ( as well as an interactive session on the phone 's own screen -- with 11 lines of about 20 characters each not very attractive beyond " print 2 * 2 " , but essential for mini - demos in Google 's hallways ) .
Thanks to Eric Smartt 's blog for giving me the hint I needed to get this working on the Mac .
So on to the vast array of APIs available .
Nokia has really done an outstanding job here .
There are extension modules that handle all of the phone 's devices : dial a call , snap a picture , send / receive SMS , Bluetooth , and Internet ( if your service provider offers it of course ) ; as well as the key applications ( calendar and address book , and probably more that I have n't even discovered ) .
You can also play sounds , view images , draw into a canvas , or open any file that the phone understands natively .
And of course the GUI library -- menus , dialogs , a low - level event loop , etc .
Stuff for which standard Python libraries exist generally uses those -- the filesystem ( ROM , RAM , memory card , flash ) of course , but also the Internet -- urllib " Just Works " ( TM ) , and you can even write a server if you want to ( your service provider will probably love it : I signed up with Cingular which charges a penny per kilobyte -- what a rip - off ) .
Anyway , gotta run ( sleep , more like it :-) .
I just had to put this out .
Oh , there are lots of resource pointers on the MobiLenin.com intro and resources pages .
Thanks Jürgen Scheible !!!

Frederick the Great [ PDF ] : “ Soldiers should fear their officers more than all the dangers to which they are exposed … .
Good will can never induce the common soldier to stand up to such dangers ; he will only do so through fear . ”
The Command and Control form of management is based on military management .
Primarily , the idea is that people do what you tell them to do , and if they do n’t , you yell at them until they do , and if they still do n’t , you throw them in the brig for a while , and if that does n’t teach them , you put them in charge of peeling onions on a submarine , sharing two cubit feet of personal space with a lad from a farm who really never quite learned about brushing his teeth .
There are a million great techniques you can use .
Rent the movies Biloxi Blues and An Officer and a Gentleman for some ideas .
Some managers use this technique because they actually learned it in the military .
Others grew up in authoritarian households or countries and think it ’s a natural way to gain compliance .
Others just do n’t know any better .
Hey , it works for the military , it should work for an internet startup !
There are , it turns out , three drawbacks with this method in a high tech team .
First of all , people do n’t really like it very much , least of all smarty - pants software developers , who are , actually , pretty smart and are used to thinking they know more than everyone else , for perfectly good reasons , because it happens to be true , and so it really , really bothers them when they ’re commanded to do something “ because . ”
But that ’s not really a good enough reason to discard this method … we ’re trying to be rational here .
High tech teams have many goals but making everyone happy is rarely goal number one .
A more practical drawback with Command and Control is that management literally does not have enough time to micromanage at this level , because there simply are n’t enough managers .
In the military , it ’s possible to give an order simultaneously to a large team of people because it ’s common that everyone is doing the same thing .
“ Clean your guns ! ” you can say , to a squad of 28 , and then go take a brief nap and have a cool iced tea on the Officer ’s Club veranda .
In software development teams everybody is working on something else , so attempts to micromanage turn into hit and run micromanagement .
That ’s where you micromanage one developer in a spurt of activity and then suddenly disappear from that developer ’s life for a couple of weeks while you run around micromanaging other developers .
The problem with hit and run micromanagement is that you do n’t stick around long enough to see why your decisions are not working or to correct course .
Effectively , all you accomplish is to knock your poor programmers off the train track every once in a while , so they spend the next week finding all their train cars and putting them back on the tracks and lining everything up again , a little bit battered from the experience .
The third drawback is that in a high tech company the individual contributors always have more information than the “ leaders , ” so they are really in the best position to make decisions .
When the boss wanders into an office where two developers have been arguing for two hours about the best way to compress an image , the person with the least information is the boss , so that ’s the last person you ’d want making a technical decision .
I remember when Mike Maples was my great grand - boss , in charge of Microsoft Applications , he was adamant about refusing to take sides on technical issues .
Eventually people learned that they should n’t come to him to adjudicate .
This forced people to debate the issue on the merits and issues were always resolved in favor of the person who was better at arguing , er , I mean , issues were always resolved in the best possible way .
If Command and Control is such a bad way to run a team , why does the military use it ?
This was explained to me in NCO school .
I was in the Israeli paratroopers in 1986 .
Probably the worst paratrooper they ever had , now that I think back .
There are several standing orders for soldiers .
Number one : if you are in a mine field , freeze .
Makes sense , right ?
It was drilled into you repeatedly during basic training .
Every once in a while the instructor would shout out “ Mine ! ” and everybody had to freeze just so you would get in the habit .
Standing order number two : when attacked , run towards your attackers while shooting .
The shooting makes them take cover so they ca n’t fire at you .
Running towards them causes you to get closer to them , which makes it easier to aim at them , which makes it easier to kill them .
This standing order makes a lot of sense , too .
OK , now for the Interview Question .
What do you do if you ’re in a minefield , and people start shooting at you ?
This is not such a hypothetical situation ; it ’s a really annoying way to get caught in an ambush .
The correct answer , it turns out , is that you ignore the minefield , and run towards the attackers while shooting .
The rationale behind this is that if you freeze , they ’ll pick you off one at a time until you ’re all dead , but if you charge , only some of you will die by running over mines , so for the greater good , that ’s what you have to do .
The trouble is that no rational soldier would charge under such circumstances .
Each individual soldier has an enormous incentive to cheat : freeze in place and let the other , more macho soldiers do the charging .
It ’s sort of like a Prisoners ’ Dilemma .
In life or death situations , the military needs to make sure that they can shout orders and soldiers will obey them even if the orders are suicidal .
That means soldiers need to be programmed to be obedient in a way which is not really all that important for , say , a software company .
In other words , the military uses Command and Control because it ’s the only way to get 18 year olds to charge through a minefield , not because they think it ’s the best management method for every situation .
In particular , in software development teams where good developers can work anywhere they want , playing soldier is going to get pretty tedious and you ’re not really going to keep anyone on your team .

CalREN Project : Study Tips
When to Study Find out how you use and misuse your time before making any changes .
Plan two hours of study time for every hour spent in class .
There are exceptions , but this is a good general rule .
Students making the transition from high school or community college are often unaware of the increased workload expected of them .
The benefits of following the rule will be apparent at exam time .
Study difficult ( or boring ) subjects first .
If your chemistry problems put you to sleep , get to them first , while you are fresh .
Most of us tend to do what we like first , yet the courses we find most difficult require the most creative energy .
Save the subjects you enjoy for later .
Avoid scheduling marathon study sessions .
When possible , study in shorter sessions .
Three three - hour sessions are far more productive for most students than one nine - hour session .
When you do study in long sessions , take a planned break every hour .
Work on several subjects and avoid studying similar subjects back to back .
Be aware of your best time of day .
Many students learn best in daylight hours .
Observe yourself and , if this is true of you , schedule study time for your most difficult subjects when the sun is up .
The key point is to determine your best learning time .
If early morning does n't work for you , find out what time is better .
Use waiting time .
Five minutes waiting time for the bus , 20 minutes waiting for the dentist , 10 minutes between classes -- waiting time adds up fast .
Have short study tasks ready to do during these times .
For example , carry 3X5 cards with equations , formulas , or definitions and pull them out anywhere .
Also , use time between classes or breaks during work to review class notes or notes on reading .
A solid review of a lecture can be completed in 15 minutes , and even five minutes can be valuable if you are prepared .
Keep a calendar for the semester .
Keep track of all your assignments , tests , and papers .
Make a weekly to - do list of important tasks and assignments that you need to complete .
Be sure to prioritize the list and to do the most important tasks first .
Where to Study Use a regular study area .
Your body knows where you are .
When you use the same place to study , day after day , your body becomes trained .
When you arrive at that particluar place , it will automatically sense that it 's time to study .
You will focus your concentration more quickly .
Do n't get too comfortable .
Put yourself into a situation where your mind is alert .
Use the library .
Libraries are designed for learning .
Entering a library is a signal to your body to quiet the mind and get to work .
Most students can get more done in a shorter time at the library .
Set up study groups .
A study group does n't take the place of individual study , but it forces you to articulate concepts and makes a review more fun and productive .
Also , it helps keep your review on schedule and helps you to avoid procrastination .
How to Handle the Rest of the World Pay attention to your attention .
Breaks in concentration are often caused by internal interruptions ; your own thoughts jump in to tell you another story about the world .
If this happens too often , perhaps you need to find a different study time or place .
Agree with living mates about study time .
This includes roommates , wives , husbands , parents , and / or kids .
Make the rules clear and be sure to follow them yourself .
Make explicit agreements -- even written contracts .
Hang a " do not disturb " sign on your door .
One student always wears a colorful hat when he wants to study .
When his roommates see the hat , they respect his wish to be left alone .
Avoid noise distractions .
Do n't study in front of the TV .
Turn off the stereo .
Many students insist that they study better with music , and that may be true .
Some students have reported good results with carefully selected and controlled music .
The overwhelming majority of research indicates that silence is the best form of music for study .
Notice how others misuse your time .
Be aware of repeat offenders .
Ask yourself if there are certain friends or relatives who consistently interrupt your study time .
If avoiding them is impractical , send a clear ( but gentle ) message .
Sometimes others do n't realize they are breaking your concentration .
Get off the phone / Un-plug from Social Media and Other Distractions
You do n't have to be a telephone victim .
Try saying , " I ca n't talk right now , I 'm studying " or let the call go to voicemail .
Or avoid the whole problem by studying at the library .
Learn to say no .
This is a valuable time saver for students , and a valuable life skill .
Many people feel it is rude to refuse a request .
Saying " no " can be done effectively and courteously .
Others want you to succeed as a student .
When you tell them that you can't comply with a request because you are busy educating yourself , 99 % will understand .
Things to Ask Yourself When You Get Stuck Ask :
What is one task I can accomplish toward my goal ?
This is a good technique to use on big , imposing jobs .
Pick out one small accomplishment , preferably one you can complete in about five minutes , then do it .
The satisfaction of getting one thing done often spurs you on to get one more thing done .
Meanwhile the job gets smaller .
Ask : Am I beating myself up ?
When you get frustrated with a reading assignment , or when you notice that your attention wanders repeatedly , or when you fall behind on problems due for tomorrow , take a minute to ask yourself , am I judging myself too harshly ?
Lighten up .
Allow yourself to feel a little foolish , recognize the feeling , and get on with it .
Do n't add to the problem by berating yourself .
Ask :
Is this a piano ?
Carpenters who build rough frames for buildings have a saying they use when they bend a nail or hack a chunk out of a two - by - four .
They say , " Well , this ai n't no piano . "
It means perfection is not necessary .
Ask yourself if what you are doing needs to be perfect .
You do n't have to apply the same standards of grammar to review notes that you apply to a term paper .
The basketball player who refuses to shoot until the perfect shot is available may never shoot .
If you can complete a job 95 percent perfect in two hours , and 100 percent in four hours , ask yourself whether the additional five percent improvement is worth doubling the amount of time you spend .
Sometimes it is a piano .
A tiny mistake can ruin an entire lab experiment .
Computers are notorious for turning little errors into monsters .
Accept lower standards where appropriate , especially when time is short .
Ask : How did I just waste time ?
Notice when time passes and you have n't accomplished what you planned .
Take a minute to review your actions and note the specific way you wasted time .
We operate by habit and tend to waste time in the same ways over and over again .
When you have noticed things you do that kill your time , you are more likely to catch yourself in the act next time .
Observing one small quirk may save you hours .
Ask : Would I pay myself for what I 'm doing right now ?
If you were employed as a student , would you be earning your wages ?
Ask yourself this question when you notice that you 've taken your third popcorn break in 30 minutes .
Most students are , in fact , employed as students .
They are investing in their own productivity and sometimes do n't realize what a mediocre job may cost them .
Ask : Can I do just one more thing ?
Ask yourself this question at the end of a long day .
Almost always you may have enough energy to do just one more short task .
If you get in the habit of working until you are done , then doing one more thig , those end - of - the - day tasks will soon add up .
The overall increase in your productivity will surprise you .

Seven Day Procrastination Elimination Plan
These are 7 strategies you can use to eliminate procrastination .
The suggestions are tied to the days of the week to help you recall .
On Monday , Make it Meaningful .
Why is that job important ?
If you have been putting off something , take a minute to list all the benefits of completing the task .
Look at the job in the perspective of your goals .
Write down the task you have been avoiding , then , below it , write your reason for doing it .
Relate the task to your goals , and be specific about the payoffs and rewards .
On Tuesday , Take it Apart .
Break big jobs into small , manageable parts .
Then be determined to complete one of those tasks .
Make each task something you can accomplish in 15 minutes or less .
Make the results measurable so you can see your progress .
If a long reading assignment intimidates you , break it into two - or three - page sections , list the sections , then cross off each section as you complete it .
Give yourself a visual experience of getting something done .
On Wednesday , Write an Intention Statement .
Use an intention statement in conjunction with a small task you have created .
Write your statement on 3X5 card , and carry it with you or post it in your study area where you can see it often .
For example , if you have a term paper to write and can't seem to get started , write yourself an intention statement that says , " I intend to write a list of at least ten possible topics for my term paper by 9 pm .
I will reward myself with an hour of guilt - free recreational reading . "
On Thursday , Tell Everyone .
Announce your intention publicly .
Tell a friend .
Tell your spouse , roommate , parents , or children .
Telling the world of your intention is an excellent technique to ensure its completion .
Make the world your support group .
On Friday , Find a Reward .
Rewards can be difficult to construct .
A reward must be something that you would genuinely withhold from yourself if you did not earn it .
Do n't pick a movie as a reward if you plan to go to anyway .
If you do n't complete what you set out to do , and go to the movie anyway , the movie would be an ineffective reward .
When you legitimately reap your reward , notice how it feels .
You may find that movies , clothes , or an extra hour studying one of your favorite subjects are more enjoyable when you feel like you 've earned it .
On Saturday , Settle it , Now .
Do it now .
The minute you notice yourself procrastinating , plunge into the task .
Imagine yourself at a mountain lake , poised to dive .
Gradual immersion would be slow torture .
It 's often less painful to leap .
Then be sure to savor the feeling of having the task behind you .
On Sunday , Say No .
When you notice yourself continually pushing a task into the low - priority category , re-examine the purpose for doing it at all .
If you realize that you really do n't intend to do something , quit telling yourself that you will .
That 's procrastinating .
Tell the truth and drop it .
Then you 're not procrastinating , and you do n't have to carry around the baggage of an undone task .

Techniques To Manage Procrastination
Set Priorities .
Not : I do n't know where to begin , so I can't begin at all .
Not : I have to do EVERYTHING !
Nothing less will do .
Instead :
The most important step is to pick one project to focus on .
Break the Task Down into Little Pieces .
Not :
There 's so much to do , and it 's so complicated .
I 'm overwhelmed by my English term paper .
Instead : I do n't have to do the whole project at once .
There are separate small steps I can take one at a time to begin researching and drafting my paper .
Set Up Small , Specific Goals .
Not : I have to write my thesis within two months .
Instead :
If I write 2 pages per day , Monday - Friday , I can finish a 1st draft in 1 month .
I 'll have a revised final draft in 2 months .
Take One Small Step at a Time .
Not :
It 's too much .
I 'll never get it all done
Instead :
What is the one next step on my list ?
I 'll concentrate on that step for right now
Reward Yourself Right Away When You Accomplish a Small Goal .
Not : I can't take any time out until I 'm completely finished .
Instead : I spent an hour working .
Now I 'll call a friend .
Use a Time Schedule .
Not : I must devote the whole week to this project
Instead : I can use these times this week to work on my project :
Monday 7 - 8 ; Tuesday 7 - 9 ; Saturday 10 - 12 .
Learn How to Tell Time .
Not : Sorting through these papers and reorganizing my file cabinet will be a snap .
It wo n't take me more than an hour , so I can do it any time .
Instead : Sorting papers always takes longer than I expect , so I 'll start tonight .
I 'll spend 1 hour filing 1 stack of papers .
Optimize Your Chances for Success .
Not : I 'll do my writing this weekend at home .
Instead : I 'll write during the week in a library .
( Choose whatever conditions are optimal for you to get work done . )
Delegate , if Possible .
Not : I am the only person in the world who can do this .
Instead : I do n't have to do this all by myself .
I can ask someone else to do part of the job and still feel a sense of accomplishment .
Just Get Started .
Not : I can't write this speech until inspiration hits .
Instead : I 'll write what first comes to mind , then improve it later .
Look at What You Have Accomplished .
Not : I have hardly made a dent in all there is to do .
Instead : I have reviewed my lecture notes and read 3 chapters .
That wo n't guarentee me an " A " , but it 's more than I did yesterday .
Be Realistic !
Not : I should be able to work full - time , take 4 classes , be president of the Esperanto Club , spend more time with friends , and play tennis 2 hours a day with no trouble at all .
Instead : I have limits .
I can take on fewer responsibilities and still like myself .
Learning by Listening .
Not everything is equally important in lecture .
Hold yourself accountable for being selective and differentiating between levels of importance .
Organize your notetaking as a way to review , test your understanding of ideas , and prepare for exams .
You can learn a lot through listening .
In college , it will be a prime source of information .
Listening is a skill which must be developed .
If you apply the following suggestions , you will find yourself listening more effectively .
The responsibility for developing interest and understanding is yours .
Be an active listener and get the most out of attending lecture .
Concentrate on what the speaker is saying .
Sit where you can see and hear the speaker easily and where other distractions are at a minimum .
Determine why what the speaker is saying is important to you .
If you do n't have an immediate , vivid reason for listening to a speaker , you are an unmotivated listener .
Practice the habit of paying attention .
Prepare to get the most out of lecture by reviewing the important points from the previous lecture .
Preview the assigned readings to establish some background knowledge .
Determine what you know and do not know about the material in order to focus your listening as an opportunity for learning .
Listen for the pattern of organization in lecture .
Does it begin or end with a brief summary of the main concepts , themes , or ideas ?
How are details or examples used to develop specific points ?
What is the relationship between the points presented ?
What is the structural format ?
Outline ?
Comparative analysis ?
Main idea , background information , supporting points ?
Inductive or deductive reasoning ?
Ask yourself :
What questions does this lecture answer ?
What are possible midterm questions that information from lectures could be used to answer ?
What is the relationship between the lectures and the readings ?
A System for Effective Listening and Notetaking
You can think about 4 TIMES FASTER than a lecturer can speak .
Effective LISTENING
requires the expenditure of energy ; to compensate for the rate of presentation , you have to acively intend to listen .
NOTETAKING is one way to enhance listening , and using a systematic approach to the taking and reviewing of your notes can add immeasurably to your understanding and remembering the content of lectures .
Before Class Develop a mind - set geared toward listening .
Test yourself over the previous lecture while waiting for the next one to begin .
Skim relevant reading assignments to aquaint yourself with main ideas , new technical terms , etc .
Do what you can to improve physical and mental alertness ( fatigue , hunger ; time of day , where you sit in the classroom may affect motivation ) .
Choose notebooks that will enhance your systematic notetaking : A separate notebook with full - sized pages is recommended for each course .
You might wish to mark off the pages into one of the formats shown at the end of this section .
INTEND TO LISTEN .
During Class Listen for the structure and information in the lecture .
Resist distractions , emotional reactions , or boredom .
Be consistent in your use of form , abbreviation , etc .
Pay attention to speaker for verbal , postural , and visual clues to what 's important .
Label important points and organizational clues : main points , examples .
When possible translate the lecture into your own words , but , if you can't , do n't let it worry you into inattention !
If you feel you do n't take enough notes , divide your page into 5 sections and try to fill each part every 10 minutes ( or work out your own formula ) .
Ask questions if you do n't understand .
Instead of closing your notebook early and getting ready to leave , listen carefully to information given toward the end of class ; summary statements may be of particular value in highlighting main points ; there may be possible quiz questions , etc .
After Class Clear up any questions raised by the lecture by asking either the teacher or classmates .
Fill in missing points or misunderstood terms from text or other sources .
Edit your notes , labeling main points , adding recall clues and questions to be answered .
Key points in the notes can be highlighted with different colors of ink .
Make note of your ideas and reflections , keeping them separate from those of the speaker .
Periodically Review your notes :
Glance at your recall clues and see how much you can remember before rereading the notes .
Look for the emergence of themes , main concepts , methods of presentation over the course of several lectures .
Make up and answer possible test questions .
Effective Note - Taking Lecture styles vary greatly from speaker to speaker .
Some lecturers are beautifully organized , some ramble , some present an hour of anecdotes and leave the student to determine their significance .
It is imperative that you figure out a lecturer 's style .
In the case of the rambler or story teller , you may find yourself at the end of an hour with only a sentence or two written down .
Check with other students , but do n't be surprised if it works out that your sentences do , indeed , represent the crucial points of the lecture .
Purposes of Note - Taking
In order to take efficient notes , the student is forced to listen carefully and critically to what is being said .
Taking notes aids comprehension and retention .
Personal notes in one 's own writing are easier to understand and remember than texbook material .
Lecture notes should represent a concise and complete outline of the most important points and ideas , especially those considered most important by the professor .
Lecture notes clarify ideas not fully understood in the text or elaborate on things that the text mentions only briefly .
A frequent complaint of students is that they are unable to determine during the lecture what is important and what might just as well be left out .
These students may attempt to write down every word uttered by the professor , combining page after page of isolated facts and details but missing a more general understanding of the material , as they are too busy writing to listen .
The following are some suggestions to aid the student in taking efficient lecture notes .
Before the Lecture
The single most important thing you can do is to read or skim the text prior to attending the lecture .
This will enable you to :
Get the general overview of main ideas , secondary points , and important concepts .
Listen with understanding and determine what is relevant and irrevelant .
Identify familiar terms with unfamiliar terms and concepts .
Look up the terms before class .
Listen for an explantion during the lecture .
Ask the professor or TA for an explanation .
Note portions of the material which are unclear .
Listen for an explanation during the lecture .
Develop questions to ask in class .
Look for other gaps in information which should be clarified or filled in .
During the Lecture Structure of Notes Each student should develop his own method of taking notes , however , the following suggestions may be helpful .
Keep a separate section of your notebook or binder for each course .
If there are several types of notes for one course , such as lecture notes , notes on outside readings , and computation of problems , you may want to arrange them on opposite pages for purposes of cross-reference .
Notes for each lecture should begin on a new page .
This makes for a greater legibility and allows for more freedom in organization .
Date your lecture notes and number all pages .
Make your notes brief .
Never use a sentence when you can use a phrase , or a phrase when you can use a word .
Use abbreviations and sumbols wherever possible .
Put most notes in your own words .
However , the following should be noted exactly : Formulae Definitions Specific facts
Note your lecturer 's chief pattern .
S/he may be summarizing the text and highlighting important points , or trying to draw relationships between new and previous understandings .
S/he may expect you to get the textbook material on your own while he discusses related outside material .
If s/he is highlighting the text , take down explanations and examples .
Seeing a concept stated in more than one way can help you understand it .
If s/he draws relationships and asks questions , note the questions and answers .
If s/he does n't give the answers , try to find them after class .
Do n't worry about outlining , but use indentations to distinguish between major and minor points .
Numbers and letters may be added later if you wish .
However , if the lecturer says s/he will make four or five points , list four or five causes , etc. , be sure to use numbers as a check on having taken them all down .
Note down unfamiliar vocabulary and unclear areas .
If the lecturer discusses something you do n't understand , take it down as best and as completely as you can .
Then you can check with the text or at least know what questions to ask if getting help from someone else .
If your instructor knows just what you do n't understand , s/he 's in a position to help you .
If you should miss something completely , leave a blank space and get it later .
Use margins for questions , comments , notes to yourself on unclear material , etc .
Develop a code system of note - marking to indicate questions , comments , important points , due dates of assignments , etc .
This helps separate extraneous material from the body of notes and also helps point out areas which are unclear .
Margins are excellent places for coded notations .
Some suggested codes are : ? - not clear at time of lecture Imp. or !
- important Q - questions * - assignment C - comment ( student 's own )
Attempt to differentiate fact from opinion .
Content .
Notes should include all main ideas and enough subordinate points to clarify understanding .
All formulae , rules , definitions , and generalizations should be included .
Inclusion of the speaker 's illustrations and examples may help clarify concepts when notes are reviewed .
Marginal notes facilitate speedy location of specific items .
Instructors usually give clues as to what is important to take down : previews and summaries material written on blackboard , other visual aids repetition vocal emphasis questions asked of the class word clues : four causes of ; four aspects of ; therefore ; in conclusion ; and so we see ; hence ; in a like manner ; on the other hand ; however ; cause - effect ; relationships ; etc .
After the Lecture Go over your notes as soon as possible after the lecture .
See below for an example of " mapping " Clear up illegibilities in writing , check for errors , fill in further facts and examples while the lecture is still fresh in your mind .
At this point you should clear up misunderstandings or fill in missing information by consulting the lecturer , TA , classsmates , the texts , or addtional readings .
Immediate review is essential to retention .
Unless you review within 24 hours after lecture or at least before the next lecture , retention will drop sharply and you will be relearning rather than reviewing .
Merely recopying notes without thinking about or revising them does not necessarily aid retention .
A more helpful practice is to manipulate the material by reorganizing it and putting it in your own words .
For a well - organized lecture , an outline can suffice , but in the case of material where important ideas and relationships are scattered throughout , there is a technique called mapping which can be very useful in restructuring and putting together the relevant points .
The use of this technique forces you to critically evaluate material in terms of main ideas , secondary points , and details , and to structure this content in an organized and coherent fashion .
Relationships must be observed and established , irrelevant material may be excluded .
This can be one of the most efficient means of immediate review for optimal retention .
Test Taking -- General Tips
Tests measure how you are doing in a course .
Usually test scores are the key determinants of your course grade .
Doing well on tests requires test - taking skills , a purposeful positive attitude , strategic thinking and planning , and , naturally , a solid grasp of the course content .
This article contains tips that apply to all types of tests : Additional tips are available for problem solving tests , objective tests , and essay tests .
How to Prepare for Tests Familiarize yourself with the test .
Ask the professor how long it will be and what kind of questions will be on it .
Ask your instructor which concepts are most important , which chapters to focus on , and what you will have to do on the test .
Also ask for some sample test questions and whether there is a copy of a similar test on file in a library .
Look over the tests you have already taken in the course to predict what you will need to prepare for .
Your aim is to determine both the content of the questions and the type of memory / intellectual skills you will be asked to use .
Examples of these skills include : Remembering specific facts .
Comparing , contrasting , and otherwise interpreting meaning in the information studied .
Applying principles and theories to solve problems ( that may not have been covered explicitly in the materials ) .
Predicting possible outcomes given a set of variables .
Evaluating the usefulness of certain ideas , concepts , or methods for a given event or situation .
Overview all the work to be done and schedule time to do it .
On the basis of your familiarity with the test , make a list of all the tasks you must complete to prepare for it .
Given what topics you expect to be most important on the test , set priorties among your study tasks and plan to do the most important ones first .
In scheduling your test preparation work , keep as much as possible to your own routines .
If you do not know how to make a study schedule , refer to the article on time management .
Avoid the " escape syndrome " .
If you find yourself fretting or talking about your work rather than studying , relax for a few minutes and rethink what you are doing - reappraise your priorities and if necessary rethink your study plan to address your worries and then START WORKING .
Deal with unread materials - succinctly .
Approach your unread materials keeping in mind all of your study plan , how much time you have to catch up on your reading , and what it is you need to pull out of the reading .
Preview the material , dividing it up into parts looking for the organizational scheme of the work .
Decide what parts in the reading you can omit , what parts you can skim , and what parts you want to read .
Set time limits for each part , and keep to the limits .
Use the following techniques to help move through the reading : Skim all the reading material first ( except the parts you have decided to omit ) so you will have at least looked at everything before the test .
Take notes on what you skim .
Read , emphasizing key sentences and concentrating on understanding the ideas expressed .
Try editorializing as you read by asking yourself questions regarding WHO , WHAT , WHERE , WHEN , and HOW about the information .
Recite the material to yourself immediately , self - testing at the end of each part to enhance recall even without later review .
Review actively .
Integrate notes , text , and supplementary information onto summary sheets by diagramming , charting , outlining , categorizing in tables , or simply writing paragraph summaries of the information .
Try to create a summary sheet for each study session , or for each main idea , or for each concept .
Use as many of the suggested ways possible , bringing all your senses as well as your sense of humor to bear on these summary sheets to make them really personally meaningful .
The more of yourself you put into these sheets , the better you will remember the information .
Practice doing what you will be doing on the test .
If you will be solving problems , then that is what you need to do while studying ; if you will be conjugating Spanish verbs , then write these out .
Answer unassigned problems or questions in the text or anticipate test questions by thinking frequently , ' If I were making up this test , I would probably ask ...' , and then answer your question .
Remember , the single most effective way to prepare for any test is to practice doing what you will have to do on the test .
It is frequently useful to study with other well - prepared students and to attend any review sessions if available .
Use these forums to clarify any questions you have about the materials and the test .
Do not expect review sessions to repeat any lectures nor to present any addition information .
The purpose of these sessions is to give you the opportunity to ask questions about the information to further your understanding .
How to Take Tests
Be prepared emotionally and physically as well as intellectually .
Get into a " fighting " attitude , emotionally ready to do your best .
Stay away from others right before the test .
Anxiety is highly contagious .
Focus on what you know rather than on what you do not know : Reinforce your strengths and arrest your weaknesses .
Get your rest the night before a test , eat well balanced meals , keep up with your regular exercise - prepare your brain for optimum functioning by keeping your physical resources well maintained .
Avoid fasts ; do not take any stimulants you are not used to , and if you are used to them ( i.e. coffee or soft drinks ) keep within moderate amounts .
Arrive at the test room early enough to arrange your working conditions , establishing a calm and alert mode .
Select a seat where the lighting is the best ( frequently in the front of the room ) and where your view of other students will be minimized .
When you receive your test , use the back to jot down all the information you are worried you might forget .
Remember first to ask whether you can write on the test form itself .
Preview the whole test before beginning to answer any questions .
Make sure your copy has no missing or duplicate pages .
Ask the instructor or proctor to clarify any ambiguities .
Read the directions carefully .
Plan your time .
Allow the most time for the questions which offer the most points .
Allocate time at the end to review .
Start with the easy questions to build your confidence and to gain time for the harder ones .
Work the entire test :
Put down some answer for each question , even if you must guess ( unless there is a penalty for guessing ) .
Do not panic if you see a question you did not anticipate or prepare for .
Use everything you know about the content of the course , the instructor 's explanations and your own reasoning ability to analyze the question and create a logical answer .
Go for partial credit when you know you cannot get all the points :
If you have studied , you are bound to know something .
Read the question as is .
Avoid overanalyzing or oversimplifying , or you will end up answering a question that exists only in your mind , not on the grading key .
Answer the question the testmaker intended : interpret the test within the scope of the course .
How to Analyze Returned Tests
If you receive your test back to keep , rework your errors trying to reason out why the correct answer was correct .
If you do not receive your test back , visit your instructor 's office to take a look at your answer sheet and the questions you missed .
Look for the origin of each question - text , notes , labs , supplementary reading , etc. Identify the reason you missed a question .
Did you fail to read it correctly ?
Did you fail to prepare for it ?
Was the test at a more difficult level than you prepared for ?
Did you run out of time ?
Check the level of detail and skill of the test .
Were most of the questions on precise details and facts or were they over main ideas an principles ?
Did the questions come straight from the text , or did the testmaker expect you to make sophisticated transformations and analyses ?
Did you have any problems with anxiety or blocking during the test ?
Taking Essay Tests
Preparing for Essay Tests Begin your preparation by reading your instructor 's course description and syllabus and then writing down whatever assumptions , biases , and teaching objectives are stated or implied in these materials .
Determine how the various course topics relate to one another , and note any repeated themes .
Think about any potential essay questions you can generate from this information , and then write them down .
Read assignments and listen to lectures and discussions with the purpose of determining how the course content supports the major themes and answers the major questions you have generated from the course description and syllabus .
Modify and refine these themes and questions throughout the course as you gain additional information .
At some point prior to the test - preferably a week or two before - quickly look over your notes and the chapter headings from your readings .
From this overview , generate a list of major topics for the course material covered .
For each major topic , create a summary sheet of all the relevant factual data that relates to that topic .
( See " Taking Tests - General Tips " ( below ) for more information about summary sheets .
In addition to learning the factual material , determine any logical relationships among topics .
These relationships are often predictive of essay test questions .
For example , if , in a history course , you find that two political movements are noticeably similar , then your instructor may very well ask you to compare and contrast the two movements .
Generate a list of possible essay questions and consider setting up and answering as many of these questions as time permits .
Taking Essay Tests Read all essay questions before you start to write .
As ideas and examples come to you , jot them down on scratch paper or on the back of the test so that you wo n't clutter your mind trying to remember everything .
Budget your time according to the point value of each question , allowing time for proofreading and any unexpected emergencies ( such as taking longer than you expected on a questions or going blank for a while . )
As you read the questions , underline key words ( eg. , compare , explain , justify , define ) and make sure you understand what you are being asked .
Begin with the questions that seems easiest to you .
This procedure reduces anxiety and facilitates clear thinking .
Before actually writing , determine the relationship implied by the question , even if the key word or words do not express a specific relationship .
For example , if you were given the following question , " The Progressive Movement was a direct response to the problems of industrialization .
Discuss . " , you might narrow your response to a more specific cause / effect relationship like the following : " What were the problems of industrialization that caused a response that we label The Progressive Movement ? "
After determing the relationship implied by the question , picture the relationship by creating a chart or matrix of the related elements .
Be sure to separate general issues you wish to bring up from supporting details and examples .
Once this framework for your ideas has been created , generate as many ideas as you can within the allotted time to fill in the categories you have established .
( See Figure 1 ) .

While You Write
Be sure your answer has a definite thesis that directly answers the question .
State this thesis within the first few sentences of your answer .
Provide specific as well as general information in your response by including examples , substantiating facts , and relevant details from your pre-writing matrix .
Use the technical vocabulary of the course .
Leave space for additions to your answer by writing on every other line and on only one side of each page .
Write legibly .
If your mind goes blank or you do n't know much about a question , relax and brainstorm for a few moments about the topic .
Recall pages from your texts , particular lectures , and class discussions to trigger your memeory about ideas relevant to the question .
Write these ideas down as coherently as you can .
When you reach the end of your alloted time period for a given question , move on to the next item : Partially answering all questions is better than fully anwering some but not others .
The instructor can't give you any credit for a question you have n't attempted .
If you find yourself out of time on a question but with more to say , quickly write down in outline form what you would write if you had time .
After You Write Re-read your answers and make any additions that are necessary for clarity and completeness .
Check your response for errors in grammar , spelling , and punctuation .
Analyzing Returned Essay Tests Read all comments and suggestions .
Look for the origins of the questions .
Did most of the information your instructor expected on your essay come from the lectures ?
From the texts ?
From outside readings ?
Determine the source of your errors .
Was there any course content tested for which you failed to prepare or were inadequately prepared ?
Did you misread or misunderstand any of the questions ?
Did you do poorly because you ran out of time ?
Were you too anxious to focus on the questions and your responses ?
Did the instructor criticize your writing skills - grammar , spelling , punctuation , sentence structure , style , or organization - or how you developed or argued your points ?
Check the level of difficulty or the level of detail of the test questions .
Were most of the questions asking for precise details or main ideas and principles ?
Did most of the quesitons come straight from the material covered , or did the instructor expect you to be able to analyze and / or evaluate the information ?
Did you have any problems with anxiety or blocking during the test ?

Taking Problem - Solving Tests
Preparing for Problem - Solving Tests Review notes and text - list the major concepts and formulas that have been covered .
Highlight those topics / problems that were emphasized .
Note why they were emphasized .
The single best way to prepare for problem - solving tests is to solve problems - lots of them .
Work problems not previously assigned .
Analyze all problems you work :
What concepts , formulas , and rules did I apply ?
What methods did I use ?
How did I begin ?
Have I seen this problem before ?
Is it similar to or dissimilar from other problems I 've done ?
How does my solution compare with the examples from the book and class ?
Could this problem be worked another way ?
Can I simplify what I did ?
In your own words , next to each problem - solving step , explain what you did and why .
Look for fundamental problem types .
Usually a course has approximately 5 fundamental groups of problems - make sure you can recognize what they are .
Practice working problems out of sequence .
For example , work a problem from Chapter 7 , then one from Chapter 5 , then one from Chapter 10 .
This randomness will allow you to see how different problems relate to each other and will simulate the test - taking experience .
Work with a time limit - aim to solve as many problems as you will have on the test within the test time limit ( i.e. , 30 problems in 50 minutes ) .
Make up a practice test .
Possibly you might cut / paste / xerox a test from your homework problems .
Taking Problem - Solving Tests
Before starting the test , turn it over and jot down all the formulas , relationships , definitions , etc. , that you are trying to keep current in memory .
Look the whole test over , skimming the questions and developing a general plan for your work .
If any thoughts come to you immediately as you look at a problem , note these down in the margin .
Plan your time .
Allow more time for high point value problems :
Reserve time at the end of the period to review your work and to handle emergencies .
Start with the easier problems , the ones for which you can specify a solution method quickly .
This will reduce anxiety and facilitate clear thinking .
For the more difficult problems :
Make absolutely sure that you understand the posed problem :
Mark key words , identify the givens and unknowns in your own words , sketch a diagram or picture of the problem , anticipate the form and characteristics of the solution ( e.g. , it has to be an integer , the solution is an algebraic expression , etc . )
Make a note , in symbols , diagrams , graphs or tables of all the information given .
For complex problems , list all the formulas you consider might be relevant to the solution , then decide which you will need to begin with .
If you have no solution method :
If possible , write out an equation to express the relationships among all the givens and unknowns , accounting for all the data and facts of the problem .
Think back to similar practice problems to select a solution method .
Solve a simpler form of the problem if dealing with complex configurations OR substitute simple numbers for unknowns to reduce the amount of abstract thinking required .
Break the problem into a series of smaller problems and work each part , thus building up to a solution .
Guess an answer and check it .
Possibly the checking process will suggest a solution method .
If all else fails , mark it to come back to later and work another problem .
You may find clues in subsequent problems .
For all problems , easy and difficult :
Once you have the solution method , follow it carefully .
Check each step for consistency in notation .
Document all your work so that it may be read easily ; write legibly .
Evaluate your solutions .
Check your answers against the original problem to make sure they fit .
Try all test problems .
If your mind goes blank , relax for a moment and contemplate the problem OR mark it to come back later .
If you run out of time and still have some problems left , try to gain at least partial credit by setting the problem up in a solution plan ( even if you can't follow through on calculations ) .
Analyzing Returned Problem - Solving Tests Read the comments and suggestions .
Locate the source of the test :
Did the problems come from the lectures , the textbook , or the homework ?
Note any transformations - how were the problems changed from those in the notes , text , and homework ?
Detemine the source of your errors :
Were your errors due to carelessness ?
For example , did you fail to carry a negative sign from one step to another ?
Did you misread questions ?
For example , did you fail to account for all the given data in your solution method ?
Did you consistently miss the same kind of problem ?
Could you produce the formulas , or did you remember them incorrectly ?
Were you unable to finish the test because you ran out of time ?
Were you unable to solve problems because you had not practiced doing similar ones ?
Did you have a difficult time during the test because you were too anxious to focus on the questions ?
Taking Objective Tests
Objective tests measure your ability to remember many facts and figures as well as your understanding of the course materials .
These tests are often designed to make you think independently - do not count on recognizing the right answer ; instead prepare yourself for high level critical reasoning and making fine discriminations to determine the best answer .
The most common objective test questions are multiple - choice , true - false , and matching items .
Doing well on these questions requires that you not only master the information but also interpret the test - maker 's intentions .
You know you have mastered the information if you can :
Recall specific terms , facts , names , and other key words ; become proficient in the language of the course .
Distinguish the ways in which ideas , facts , theories , or other observations differ from each other AND categorize ideas , facts , theories or other observations according to the ways these are similar .
Answer the questions and solve the problems in the text and create your own questions or problems .
Preparing for Objective Tests Review notes and text ( s ) - list the major concepts that have been covered Highlight those topics that were stressed .
Note why they were stressed .
Think vocabulary .
Every field of study has its own vocabulary .
Identify words / terms used to represent specific concepts ( i.e. , the word ' paradigm ' in a social science research course ) and treat them as you would a foreign language - make flash cards for frequent drills , and try to use these words whenever you work with course - related materials .
Compare and contrast .
Sometimes objective questions can be used to test your ability to distinguish concepts , ideas , theories , events , or facts from each other .
Construct diagrams , charts , tables , or lists to summarize relationships .
Recite for precision .
Review your retention of the information by recalling it often .
Use odd moments , in addition to 15 - 20 minute review sessions , to say or write out complete ideas , facts .
It is very important to verbalize the recalled information completely and in a detailed manner so that you will have a precise idea of your mastery of the material .
Taking Objective Tests General tips .
Plan your time .
Allow more time for high point value questions ; reserve time at the end to review your work , and for emergencies .
Before starting the test , turn it over and jot down all the facts and details you are trying to keep current in memory .
Look the whole test over , skimming the quesitons and developing a general plan for your work .
If any immediate thoughts come to you , jot them down in the margin .
Check with your instructor whether or not you can write on the test .
Read the directions very carefully .
Look for time limits , specific answering procedures ( i.e. , answer 3 out of the 4 questions below ) , how questions will be graded .
Start with the section of the test that will yield the most points , but begin working with the easiest questions to gain time for the more difficult ones and to warm up .
Work quickly , check your timing regularly , and adjust your speed when necessary .
Avoid reading into the question .
When you find yourself thinking along the lines of " this is too easy ; there must be a trick ... " mark the question and move on to another .
When you begin modifying the question , the answer you will come up with will be different from the one on the teacher 's key .
Interpret questions literally .
Choose the answer the testmaker intended - stay within the scope of the course .
If you know facts that are beyond the level of sophistication of the test , 1 ) Record the intended answer , and 2 ) point out the possible ambiguity and make a case for a different answer either in the margin of the test or during the next regular class .
Mark key words in every question .
To help find the key works ask yourself WHAT , WHO , WHERE , WHEN , and HOW ?
Multiple choice questions .
Probably the most commonly used objective questions , multiple choice questions , consist of 2 parts :
The stem - the statement or question .
The choices - also known as the distractors .
There are usually 3 to 5 options from which you choose the one that will complete the stem statement or question .
You are to select the correct choice , the option that completes the thought expressed in the stem .
There is a 20 % chance that you will guess the correct choice if there are 5 choices listed .
Although multiple choice questions are are most often used to test your memory of details , facts , and relationships , they are also used to test your comprehension and your ability to solve problems .
Reasoning ability is a very important skill for doing will on multiple choice tests .
Read the stem as if it were an independent , free standing statement .
Anticipate the phrase that would complete the thought expressed , then evaluate each answer choice against your anticipated answer .
It is important that you read each choice , even if the first choice matches the answer you anticipated , because there may be a better answer listed .
Another evaluation technique is to read the stem together with each answer choice as if it were a true - false statement .
If the answer makes the statement a false one , cross it out .
Check all the choices that complete the stem as a true statement .
Try to suspend judgment about the choices you think are true until you have read all the choices .
Beware of words like not , but , except .
Mark these words because they specify the direction and limits of the answer .
Also watch out for words like always , never , and only .
These must be interpreted as meaning all of the time , not just 99 % of the time .
These choices are frequently incorrect because there are few statements that have no exceptions ( but there are a few ) .
If there are two or more options that could be the correct answer , compare them to each other to determine the differences between them , and then relate these differences with the stem to deduce which of the choices is the better one .
( Hint : Select the option that gives the most complete information . )
If there is an encompassing answer choice , for example " all of the above " , and you are unable to determine that there are at least two correct choices , select the encompassing choice .
Use hints from questions you know to answer questions you do not .
Make educated guesses - eliminate options any way you can .
True - False Questions .
Also a popular question type , the true - flase question has only two options .
Your odds are always 50 - 50 with this type of item .
Typically , testmakers tend to focus on details in true - false questions .
In order for a statement to be true , it must be so 100 % of the time .
This means each part of the question .
Thus you must evaluate the trueness of WHAT , WHO , WHERE , WHEN , and HOW for each statement .
Beware of words that qualify and give specific meanings .
Words like some , usually , not frequently denote true statements , but be careful to interpret each statement as a special case .
Another type of word , such as always and never , should be interpreted as meaning without exception .
If you can think of an exception , the statement is false .
Testmakers often mismatch items or names with inappropriate events or definintions to test your mastery and alertness .
Matching Questions .
Matching questions give you some opportunity for guessing .
You must know the information well in that you are presented with two columns of items for which you must establish relationships .
If only one match is allowed per item , then once items become eliminated , a few of the latter ones may be guessed .
The relationship is the crucial factor in a set of matching items .
Usually the relationship is common to all included items .
For example , all the items in Column B define the terms in Column A , or the individuals named in Column A wrote the books listed in Column B .
For every match you make , cross the the items in both columns ( unless there is more than one match possible ) .
Begin with the lengthier column containing the information , evaluating the items in the column with shorter descriptions for a match .
This way you save time by not constantly having to re-read the lengthy statements .
New Jalisco Library , Gudalajara , Mexico ( competition )
Over 200 Boeing 727 and 737 fuselages are stacked in a north - south slant in relation to sun exposure for energy efficiency .
Two shifts in the direction of the main axis of the fuselages generate two large open spaces within the stack .
The building utilizes the space inside the fuselages to contain and organize functions that require enclosed spaces - such as book collections , meeting rooms and administration offices , - while the 2 large open spaces house a large atrium with all the reading areas on one side and two auditoriums on the other .
The library program is centered around the large glazed atrium , which develops vertically through the entire cross section of the building .
The lower part of the atrium , located on the second level and accessible directly from the new plaza thru escalators and elevators , functions as a lobby and information center .
At each upper level , the reading areas bridge between the two opposite interior facades generated by the cross sections of the fuselages that look onto the atrium .
A transparent LCD system is integrated in the atrium glazing and projects the library activities onto the new plaza expanding its presence on the outside with moving images and text .
The fuselage is the only part of a decommissioned airplane that cannot be effectively recycled .
The cost of its demolition exceeds the profit of aluminum resale .
A huge amount of fuselages lays in the deserts of the western states .
Boeing 727 and 737 are historically the most sold commercial planes and therefore the most common in these graveyards .
They are sold at very low prices completely stripped and in great structural conditions .
The fuselage becomes the basic module of this building .
It is insulated and furnished according to the program .
The internal subdivision generated by the existing floor joists is used to respond to functional needs : the upper section is used for inhabitation while the lower one houses independent and interconnected mechanical systems : HVAC , electrical , cabling , and a conveyor belts network for the mechanical distribution of the books .

Video files take much longer to upload than music files
In the last few years users have started to share that content with each other across the net , whether legal or not .
This is something that has plagued the music industry for several years .
And now , mainly thanks to a system called BitTorrent , the movie industry could face the same struggle .
But BitTorrent could also be the solution .
Hollywood is definitely interested in distributing its movies over the net .
King Kong is the first major film in the UK to be released as a download at the same time as on DVD .
Users on the web will visit a download site and pull the data onto their computers .
Many users can be served at once but , if demand is huge , users will effectively have to queue up and wait their turn .
But there is another way to get hold of content and it has caused a nightmare for the music industry of late , with users sharing content amongst themselves , their peers .
Using a peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file - sharing program and a decent internet connection , a user can make all his files available to anyone else who is using the same program .
If you wanted to get hold of a particular song , your file - sharing program would hunt for that file on other people 's hard drives .
When it finds it , it downloads a copy to your own computer .
The more users who download the file , the more places there are for other users to get it .
This reduces the likelihood of bottlenecks , and is a very efficient way of distributing files across the net .
Of course , it is illegal to share copyrighted material like that .
But this has not stopped people doing it .
Larger files
More recent developments include being able to download different parts of the same file from different users .
But video files are much larger than music files and have slower upload times .
This is where BitTorrent comes in .
It is an incredibly efficient way of distributing large files , like video , across the net , even when there is a high demand , and even when only one person has the complete file .
The key is that a user 's computer does not need to wait until it has downloaded the entire file .
As soon as it has downloaded a chunk , it starts uploading it to any other users who do not yet have that chunk .
Similarly , your computer finds other users who have chunks that you are missing , and downloads many at once .
The group of machines sharing a file is called a swarm , for obvious reasons .
And the torrent of data flowing between them is called a torrent .
The more people in the swarm , the faster the file spreads .
Using BitTorrent is not particularly difficult .
There are many different BitTorrent programs freely available for download .
These manage the uploading and downloading for you , maximising your internet connection , which can end up shifting gigabytes in a session .
Once finished downloading , it is considered good manners to stay online , allowing the program to continue sharing the file with other users .
Broadband ' hogs '
BitTorrent 's efficient use of broadband connections has hugely increased the amount of traffic going across the net , because it runs all users ' net connections flat out to deliver huge files .
Recent estimates say that around a third of all internet traffic is based around BitTorrent .
Some internet service providers think this is unacceptable .
Recently BT began clamping down on so - called " broadband hogs " , by starting to enforce a 40 GB monthly limit .
Certainly you could kind of see P2P as one of the killer applications for broadband
Jonathan Arber , Ovum
So - called traffic - shaping is part of an ongoing battle between ISPs and BitTorrent programmers .
As network providers look for smarter ways to identify torrent traffic , and reduce its impact on their network , more and more help sites are springing up showing users how to encrypt their data to avoid it being tracked and controlled .
Bulldog is one ISP which does not feel the need to traffic shape its data flow .
The company 's Gavin Young says this is because there are different types of ISPs .
He told Click : " Some ISPs are what we call infrastructure - based , and that means they build their own networks .
" But other ISPs , maybe just for example a brand , are paying money for the fibre , connectivity in that network , and maybe they can't even afford to buy a whole fibre and they 're just leasing per megabit units of bandwidth .
You 're going to be more inclined to try to shape your traffic to keep your cost base down . "
Jonathan Arber , a technology expert from Ovum , who specialises in file - sharing , believes ISPs are right to be worried about the amount of traffic that something like BitTorrent creates .
He said : " Certainly , you could see P2P as one of the killer applications for broadband .
What that means is that , if users find that their broadband service is actually limiting the application that they most want to use , they 'll simply go somewhere else . "
New approach
According to Bulldog 's Gavin Young , a recent online survey which asked people how ISPs should react to P2P traffic found most respondents wanted to slow it down .
In other words to traffic - shape .
He added : " Basically this is a kind of a robotic application to a lot of people .
" They do n't necessarily interact that much , they might kick off a download , and go to work or whatever , and so it 's not like you 're surfing the web , or expecting a response or an instant message .
" If something takes three hours instead of two hours , fine .
I suspect as people are doing more with video , as opposed to music and songs , that kind of kick - it - off - and - walk - away approach is going to be more common . "
But instead of traffic - shaping and limiting what could be the killer application for broadband , could not an ISPs just buy more bandwidth ?
After all , it is their business to provide this data flow .
Mr Young explained : " Unfortunately , if you buy more bandwidth , somebody has to cover the cost of that .
" What we 're seeing is ISPs introducing tiered services , so for example , given the opportunity for light users to maybe have a metered package , who pay per unit at a time or per amount of data you download .
So you can control your own costs as a user , and unlimited packages will inevitably cost a bit more .
There are many programs that use the BitTorrent protocol , but it is still not a completely user - friendly experience .
Ovum 's Jonathan Arber said : " The various applications , while they are getting more user - friendly , still require a degree of technical knowledge in order to really get BitTorrent working the way it should .
" If you want to kind of get the kind of download speeds that people talk about , you 're going to have to know a little bit about configuring the application , a little bit about configuring your own network as well . "

Python in Google Code Jam
by Guido van van Rossum
August 14 , 2006
Summary
Python is now an approved language in Google 's yearly Code Jam coding contest .
Advertisement
For a number of years , Google has run a yearly coding contest named Code Jam .
The smartest ( young ) programmers in the world compete against each other for prizes and fame .
There are 3 online rounds ( September 5 - 6 , September 14 and September 19 ) .
The top 100 will be invited for the final coding showdown at Google New York on October 27 , 2006 .
All travel and accommodation expenses will be covered by Google and there will be over $ 165,000 in cash and prizes .
What 's most exciting for me is that this year , for the first time , Python is one of the supported languages .
( The others are C++ , Java , C# and VB.
NET . )
I 'm hoping that at least some of the finalists will get that far by exploiting Python 's superior coding speed !
( Googlers , others involved in setting up the competition , and their families , etc. , etc. , are not allowed to participate , as is customary in such things . )
Talk Back !

THE word “ hacker ” is widely misused .
Among hackers themselves , it refers to someone who enjoys tinkering with technology , exploring its boundaries and getting it to do unexpected or unintended tricks , though in general use the word refers to individuals who break into computers for nefarious ends ( for whom hackers prefer the terms “ malicious hacker ” or “ cracker ” ) .
But a hacker is not necessarily bad and is not necessarily just someone who messes around with computers .
Thomas Edison was arguably a hacker , back in the 19th century .
Today 's technological tinkerers , however , have a far wider range of household gizmos to play with and modify , from cars to cameras .
Getting them to do new things , and not merely what the manufacturer had in mind , is an increasingly popular pastime .
It even has its own magazine , MAKE , which is filled with projects for the technologically intrepid .
Car enthusiasts have a long tradition of modifying their vehicles to improve on the manufacturer 's original specifications .
As cars become as dependent on electronics as they are upon mechanics , the business of tweaking their performance has become ever more elaborate .
Upgrades for various fuel - injection and ignition computers have been available for well over a decade , providing additional power — often at the expense of warranty cover and fuel efficiency — just by replacing a microchip or two in the engine compartment .
But such modifications are now passé .
The latest twist comes from TurboXS of Gaithersburg , Maryland .
Its DTEC boost controller uses a standard Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP handheld games console as its display and input device .
The software comes on a standard game cartridge , and provides a variety of read - outs and diagnostic options .
Wire up a few hardware sensors , and the games console becomes a tuning tool , allowing changes via the boost - controller hardware to the running engine configuration .
And all of this was done without any help from Nintendo , notes Nathan Kofahl of TurboXS .
It is a new , unintended use of the console — in short , a hack — that is , in turn , used to hack the car 's engine .
Hybrid and electric vehicles have also attracted the attentions of hackers .
After General Motors introduced the short - lived EV1 electric car in 1996 , intrepid owners soon worked out how to connect handheld computers to its built - in diagnostic systems and observe what was going on with their vehicles .
Armed with this knowledge , they could then change their driving behaviour to improve the car 's range on a single charge .
Today , attention is focused on the Toyota Prius , a hybrid - electric vehicle that uses battery power at low speeds ( in stop - start traffic , for example ) and a petrol engine at high speeds or on long journeys .
The problem , from the point of view of some drivers , is that the control system of the Prius , and the limited capacity of its nickel - metal hydride ( NiMH ) batteries , prevent it from being used as an all - electric vehicle , even on quite short journeys .
So a number of Prius owners have hacked their vehicles , fitting them with larger lithium - ion battery packs that can be recharged from the mains and tweaking the battery - control system to extend the car 's electric - only range .
EDrive , a firm based in Monrovia , California , is about to launch just such an upgrade package for Prius owners , at a cost of around $ 12,000 .
Closer to home , the ever more complex innards of consumer - electronics devices mean they are also ripe for modification by hackers .
The advent of the TiVo personal video recorder was significant in many ways : not only did it precipitate a dramatic shift in viewing habits , it was also one of the first consumer - electronics devices to be based upon Linux , the open - source operating system .
Most users , of course , were happily unaware of this fact .
But for the more technically minded , it made possible a wide variety of modifications , letting users make their TiVos work just the way they wanted .
Simple changes — different colours for the on - screen interface , installing a larger hard disk to increase recording capacity — quickly evolved into new software development that , for example , allowed the TiVo to be remotely controlled over the internet , enabling users to add a show to the device 's recording schedule from work .
This extensibility quickly gained the TiVo a passionate following , but also raised legal concerns .
Not content to add features to the device , TiVo users soon worked out how to download programmes to watch them on their laptops , or transfer them to DVD .
While TiVo made efforts to prevent this sort of thing , the ingenuity of its users prevailed and instructions have proliferated online .
Even when an electronic device is not based on Linux , it is usually not long before hackers get Linux running on it , which then makes tweaking much easier .
The unofficial installation of Linux on Apple 's iPod music - player , for instance , led to the discovery of some hardware secrets within it .
Some iPods , it turned out , actually had the internal circuitry required to record high - quality audio , though this feature is usually unavailable .
Other hacks include the ability to run games and display pictures , even on older iPods .
Phillip Torrone of MAKE says this type of modification simply “ unlocks the piece of hardware that you paid for . ”
But in some cases , such hacks can undermine the manufacturer 's business model .
Consider games consoles , for example , which operate on a “ razor and blades ” principle .
Consoles are often sold at a loss , but console - makers receive a licence fee of a few dollars for each game sold — so provided each customer buys enough games , the console - maker eventually makes money .
When Microsoft launched its Xbox console in 2001 , hackers raced to install Linux on it , which transformed it into a low - cost , high performance media - playback system .
While this was a minority sport , anyone who did this without buying any games was , in effect , receiving a subsidy from Microsoft .
Little wonder , then , that the new Xbox 360 console features significantly beefed - up security measures .
A second example is the low - cost “ disposable ” digital cameras sold by CVS , an American pharmacy chain .
These cameras are designed to be used once and then returned to the shop , where , for a processing fee , the stored pictures or movies are returned to you on CD or DVD .
The cameras are then reset and resold .
Inevitably , however , hackers have figured out how to access and reuse the cameras themselves .
( One even ended up being installed in the nose of a small rocket . )
If enough people do this , the business model breaks down .
Clever hacking by a few , in other words , could lead to higher prices for the many .
But some companies , at least , have chosen to embrace hackers .
iRobot , the company behind the Roomba robot vacuum - cleaner , includes an external data connector in the device and has even documented how to use it .
While most customers appreciate their Roombas for their autonomous cleaning skills , there is also a small minority of users who want to reprogram them .
iRobot is one of the few firms to acknowledge and appreciate customers who like to tinker .
After all , there are few manifestations of feedback as heartfelt as someone who is willing to spend their own time and effort to improve a product .
For those who care about stable updates

For those who care about stable updates Date : Thu , 9 Mar 2006 11:32:07 +0100 Archive - link : Article , Thread
I 'm sorry to announce this but you 'll have to find a new person who works on updating Debian stable and who is willing to cope with black holes and ftpmasters .
I 'm sick of being left in the void .
I 'm sick of ftpmasters not answering mails from the stable release manager to negotiate a timeline .
I 'm sick of ftpmasters suddenly creating arbitrary preconditions for stable updates .
I 'm sick of having to ask again and again and being constantly blocked by them .
I 'm sick of this entire situation .
It makes me ill , angry and utterly frustrated .
It causes me being frustrated of Debian and unable to work on other issues , needing a rest more often that planned .
I should do better with my limited life .
Hence , I give up .
Congratulations .
I have worked on updates to the stable Debian distribution since 2001 after I noticed that nobody is trying to integrate security updates into the once released distribution so that the archive does not contain tons of known security updates .
I 've tried to get stable updates done on a regular basis but miserably failed .
It 's is now five years since I started working on such updates and often they 've been a pain for me once they were ready , and also a source of utter grief and frustration .
Every once in a while the problems escalated and were discussed on mailing lists .
After that , an update was possible .
However , I was exhausted and frustrated .
That 's not a healthy situation to continue working on .
Since James
Troup as ftpmaster rejected my recent request to become an ftpmaster in order to be able to implement the changes on my own , and since ftpmasters do n't allow new people to become ftpmasters , and since the changes Anthony Towns is proposing and implementing wo n't change the requirement for an ftpmaster for stable updates , it is very clear to me that the situation is not going to improve in the future .
Hence , I 'm giving up .
Of course , I 'd support a new stable release manager in the beginning .
The tools I 've used are public anyway and so are the data .
Both could be used as a basis .

Since the game ’s introduction in November 2004 the company has expanded to more than 1,800 employees from around 400 .
Almost all of the additions have been customer - service representatives to handle World of Warcraft players , helping them with both technical advice and billing concerns .
“ Ultimately , what I ’d like is for the user to feel like they are having a very polished entertainment experience , ” said Mike Morhaime , 38 , Blizzard ’s president ( and a gamer since he first encountered Pong in 1976 ) .
“ We ’d like players to associate our name with quality , so if they see a box on the shelf and it says Blizzard Entertainment , they do n’t need to know anything more than that . ”
The basic genre that World of Warcraft belongs to is called the massively - multiplayer online game , or M.M.O.
The “ massive ” refers to the fact that in an M.M.O. , thousands of players simultaneously occupy one vast virtual 3 - D world .
( In a more traditional online game like Quake or Counter - Strike , there are generally fewer than a dozen people in each arena . )
Blizzard runs hundreds of copies of the Worlds of Warcraft universe , known as servers , and there might be a few thousand players on any server at any given time .
There are servers customized for six written languages : English , both simplified and traditional Chinese , Korean , German and French .
Spanish is in development .
To begin , a player creates an avatar , or character , customizing its physical appearance as well as race and profession , each of which has different skills and abilities .
An elf druid might specialize in healing , for example , while an orc rogue could be an expert in stealth and backstabbing .
The player is then set loose in a huge colorful fantasy world with cities , plains , oceans , mountains , forests , rivers , jungles , deserts and of course dungeons .
The players can explore on their own or team up with others to conquer more imposing challenges .
As a character completes quests and defeats monsters , it gains new abilities and collects more powerful magical equipment that in turn allow it to progress to the next set of challenges .
Players can fight other players if they choose , but much of the focus is on teaming up with other users in guilds like the Chosen to battle automated foes .
There were massively - multiplayer games before World of Warcraft , just as there were MP3 players before Apple ’s iPod .
Like the iPod , World of Warcraft has essentially taken over and redefined an entire product category .
Oops .
Something went wrong .
You ’re not sure what — was it you ?
Was it the website ?
What do you do now ?
Article Continues Below
Welcome to the world of the Error 404 page .
You ’ve requested a page — either by typing a URL directly into the address bar or clicking on an out - of - date link and you ’ve found yourself in the middle of cyberspace nowhere .
A user - friendly website will give you a helping hand while many others will simply do nothing , relying on the browser ’s built - in ability to explain what the problem is .
We can do better than that , ca n ’t we ?
I wo n’t go into details about how you set your server up to deliver a custom 404 page — instead , I ’ll refer you to these articles :
I will , however , suggest strategies for building a custom 404 page that makes the most of an otherwise lost cause .
To get started , we need to examine the most common reasons that people find themselves on a 404 page :
a mis-typed URL ( or an out - of - date bookmark / favourite )
a search - engine link that is out - of - date
an internal broken link that the webmaster has n’t noticed
They all amount to the same thing , but they need to be handled slightly differently — the 404 message needs to be customized for each eventuality .
There are some tricks that you can employ that apply to all scenarios , but my first suggestion is simple …
Do n’t point the finger #section2
Tell them what went wrong , by all means , but do n’t admonish the user , even if you know it ’s their fault !
The phrases , “ might have ” and “ possibly ” are good ones to use here .
Do n’t get off on the wrong foot with this visitor to your site — you might yet turn this problem around .
As well as the “ something went wrong ” text , you should ensure that your error page has the following :
A link to the site map ( if you have one ) and the home page .
This is the easiest way for users to bail out .
This no -brainer requires no clever scripting .
This is the easiest way for users to bail out .
This no -brainer requires no clever scripting .
A search box .
If you have a site search , add it to your 404 page .
If you do n’t have a site search and are in the habit of generating 404 errors , perhaps you should get one .
If you have a site search , add it to your 404 page .
If you do n’t have a site search and are in the habit of generating 404 errors , perhaps you should get one .
A distinctly minimalist look .
Avoid putting all your standard site navigation on this page .
You should aim to remove distractions .
Besides , insisting on including a complete site navigation strip may present a maintenance overhead ( your 404 page can easily lag behind the rest of the site if it is not dynamically updated with the rest of your site and the last thing you want is to have navigation on the 404 that is no longer relevant / working .
Oh the irony ! )
Also be sure to cut the jargon .
I mean , we can talk about 404s here , right ?
We ’re in good company .
But 60 - year - old Doris who got a broken link while browsing a knitting site wo n’t have a clue what a 404 error is .
If you want to use the phrase “ Error 404 , ” do it subtly — do it as a footnote , a nod to those who understand your freaky - deaky web speak .
Now , let ’s look at how you can make the 404 work for you , instead of against you .
Let ’s be intelligent about this #section4
At this point , I should point out that this may require a certain amount of JavaScript ( you may not be able to use server - side scripting to do this work , depending on your server set - up ) .
So be sure to use the < noscript > to serve up a suitable message for people who have disabled scripting .
If you can use server - side scripting , that would be preferable — no accessibility or browser support issues — so adapt the suggested code as appropriate .
First , you ’ll need to set up a few variables :
var strReferrer=document.referrer.toLowerCase( ) ; var blnSearchReferral = false ; var blnInsiteReferral = false ; var str= " " ; var strSite = " " ;
Now , how are we going to use these ?
The mis-typed URL#section5
A mis-typed URL ( or out - of - date bookmark ) will have no referrer , so your code to identify this scenario should look something this :
if ( strReferrer.length==0 ) { str +=' We think you will find one of the following » links useful : <\ /p > ' ; str+= '< a href= " \/home.php " >< img src= " / images / » home.gif " alt = " Home Page " width = " 100 " height = " 30 " » \/> <\/a >' ; str+='< a href= " \/site-map.php " >< img src= " / images / » site - map.gif " alt = " Site Map " width = " 100 " height= » " 30 " \/><\/a>' ; str+='< hr \/>' ; str+='< p>< strong >
You may not be able to find the » page you were after because of : <\ / strong > <\/p>' ; str+='< ol type = " a " > ' ; str+= ' < li>
An < strong > out - of - date bookmark\ / favorite » <\/strong ><\/li >' ; str+= ' < li>A search engine that has an < strong > out- » of - date listing for us </ strong ><\/li >' ; str+= ' < li>A < strong > mis- typed address</strong ><\/li >' ; str+='<\/ol >' ; document.write ( str ) ; }
The out - of - date search engine referral #section6
If there is a referrer value , we can look for an instance of specific search engines ( and you can obviously tweak this to your own taste ) .
Then we can split the search parameters up , look for significant matches to a list of terms you want to intercept and suggest a page that is probably appropriate to that search :
if ( strReferrer.length!=0 ) { if ( ( strReferrer.indexOf (".looksmart.co " ) >0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf ( ".ifind.freeserve " ) >0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf (".ask.co " ) > 0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf (" google.co " ) > 0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf (" altavista.co " ) >0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf ( " msn.co " ) >0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf ( " yahoo.co " ) > 0 ) ) { blnSearchReferral=true ; //get site domain — split at the first forward - slash var arrSite=strReferrer.split( " / " ) ; // now find search parameters var arrParams=strReferrer.split( " ? " ) ; var strSearchTerms = arrParams [ 1 ] ; arrParams=strSearchTerms.split( " & " ) ; strSite=arrSite [ 2 ] ; var sQryStr= " " ; // define what search terms are in use by the different engines var arrQueryStrings = new Array ( ) ; arrQueryStrings [ 0 ] = " q= " ; //google , altavista , msn arrQueryStrings [ 1 ] = " p= " ; //yahoo arrQueryStrings [ 2 ] =" ask= " ; //ask jeeves arrQueryStrings [ 3 ] = " key= " ; //looksmart for ( i=0;i< arrParams.length ;i++ ) // loop through all the parameters in the referring page ’s URL { for ( q=0;q.indexOf(sQryStr)==0 ) {// we’ve found a search term !
strSearchTerms = arrParams<i > ; strSearchTerms = strSearchTerms.split(sQryStr ) ; strSearchTerms = strSearchTerms [ 1 ] ; strSearchTerms = strSearchTerms.replace ( " + " , " " ) ; } } } // Tell the visitor what site is at fault , what the // search terms were document .
write ( " < p > You did a search on < strong > < a href= ' " + strReferrer + " ' target= ' _blank ' > " + strSite + " </a> </ strong > for " < strong > " +
strSearchTerms + " </ strong > " .
However , their index appears to be out of date .

You can now add in some lines to identify key search phrases that you do n’t want to be lost .
For example , say you ’re getting good search results for the words “ electronics ” and “ widgets ” but you ’ve just moved pages around in your site — no good losing all those existing Gooogle referrals , is it ?
if ( ( strSearchTerms.indexOf ( " widgets " ) >=0 ) || ( strSearchTerms.indexOf ( " electronics " ) > =0 ) ) { document.write ( " < a href= '/cool-widgets.htm '>
Our excellent widgets page </a>< br /> " ) ; } } }
Of course , if you have an internal site search , you could use the search parameters found in the URL to generate a search automatically , rather than this very manual process .
However , the manual approach may be preferred ( otherwise you may only be adding another hit - and - miss search process to one that already failed ) .
The broken ( in - site ) link #section7
With the errant search engine referrals taken care of , we now need to look at referrals that are not from a search engine ( or at least not a search engine you ’ve chosen to look for ) .
We ’ll need to add some more conditions :
if (! blnSearchReferral ) { strSite = strReferrer ; strSite = strSite.split( " / " ) ; strSite = strSite [ 2 ] ; document.write ( " < p > You were incorrectly referred to this page by : < strong > < a href= ' " + strReferrer + " ' target= '_blank ' > " + strSite + " </a></strong > < br />We suggest you try one of the links below : </ p > " ) ; }
… those links being the site map and home page mentioned right up front .
What if your own site is the problem ?
#section8
You cannot say in your 404 page “ This site had an incorrect link ” when the errant referrer is actually one of your own .
In this instance , you might need to change the language to admit some guilt !
blnInsiteReferral =(( strReferrer.indexOf ( " http://www.mysite.co.uk " ) >=0 ) || ( strReferrer.indexOf ( " http://www.myothersite.com " ) > =0 ) ) if ( blnInsiteReferral ) { document . write ( " < p > This one ’s down to us !
Please accept our apologies for this — we ’ll see to it that the developer responsible for this broken link is given 20 lashes ( but only after he or she has fixed this problem ) . </ p > " ) ; }
Fixing the problem#section9
> So , we ’ve provided routes out of the 404 black hole .
But have we actually fixed anything ?
No .
We do have some options though , as we know the page requested and the referring page ( if indeed there was a referrer ) .
We could capture this information in a database , either automatically or via a manual “ report this broken link ” button offered to the user when they hit the 404 page .
The latter should cut down on noise , and the hope is that you ’ll only get to hear about the most important broken links .
How you go about fixing them from here on in is up to you .

The BPI says CD sales fall because of illegal downloads
High Court judges ordered two men to pay the British Phonographic Industry between £ 1,500 and £ 5,000 for making thousands of songs available online .
One of the men said he did not know he was acting illegally .
The other said there was no evidence against him .
The BPI has launched 139 similar cases since October 2004 , most being settled out of court for up to £ 6,500 .
The two men , who the BPI decided not to name in publicising the cases , were accused along with three others of using peer - to - peer software to share 8,906 songs over the internet .
The cases , in which both men were ordered to stop sharing files illegally , were the first of their kind to be heard in the British courts .
Cases are pending against the other three people , who also refused to settle with the BPI .
No financial gain
The first defendant , from King 's Lynn , said the BPI had no direct evidence of infringement , but the judges dismissed this and ordered him to make an immediate payment of £ 5,000 .
Ignorance is not a defence
Judge Justice Lawrence Collins
His total costs are estimated at £ 13,500 and damages are expected to take the bill even higher .
The other man , a postman from Brighton , said he was unaware that what he was doing was illegal and did not seek to gain financially .
His case was also thrown out , with Judge Justice Lawrence Collins declaring : " Ignorance is not a defence " .
The postman , who is a father of two , was ordered to make an immediate payment of £ 1,500 , pending final determination of costs and damages .
A further 51 illegal file - sharers have been given a deadline of 31 January to settle cases and avoid court action .
The BPI says it believes internet music - swapping has led to a decline in sales of singles since 1999 .
The organisation 's lawyers called the decision a " massive step forward " for the industry 's fight against illegal file - sharing .
BPI chairman Peter Jamieson said illegal music - swappers were " stealing the future of artists and the people who invest in them " .
Now that Google has taken the next step with its GMail service and is now allowing you to manage your own domain name via GMail , my tip is it wo n’t be long before the free domain name train rolls back into town .
Remember , during Dot Com V1.0 there were a number of companies offering free domain names .
As far as I know none of those companies are still around , but Squash reckons the idea is about to be pulled out of the closet once more .
Actually , that ’s a given .
Microsoft has already promised that all users of its Office Live offering WILL receive a free domain name .
Google with this latest managed domain announcement has clearly demonstarted it wants to run interference on Office Live .
So , where it can it will almost certainly match Microsoft offer for offer .
Both Microsoft and Google will do this because a free domain is the ULTIMATE lock - in strategy .
I suspect the offer will work along these lines :
We ’ll register your domain for you for free , but we retain ownership of it .
You can use it as the basis for your email and IM identities .
We ’ll also throw in some free webspace tied to your domain for your website , photos , etc .
And all you have to give us in return is your loyalty .
Let ’s face it , if your domain name becomes your online identity , you ’re never going to change it .
If people know that they can check out your webspace at yourdomain.com , email and IM you at yourdomain.com , see your photos at picassa .
yourdomain.com , you tell me how you ’re EVER going to churn to another online provider .
The question is whether the couple of bucks that it costs to attain and then annually retain a customer ’s loyalty returns enough to make it to justify the investment .
You ’d have to say that only Google and Microsoft , maybe Yahoo and possible eBay have the strategy , product offerings and income streams to make this strategy worthwhile .
It appears more and more likely every day that any other online company is going to stand any chance in the future of dismantling the online oligopoly .

The meme today about how RSS may or may not “ break through ” is the perfect example of the new media vanguard not having a clue about real media .
( Dave Winer opines on how RSS can break through , Scoble says it already has , Dion Hinchcliffe thinks it can but it has to be easier to use )
Reality Check : People who use RSS readers to any degree will always be “ edge cases ” simply because your average person does n’t consume enough media or care enough about their media to go to the trouble of building their own reading lists or even consuming somebody else ’s reading list .
What they care about is finding a small number of sources , and usually it ’s one or two ‘ big picture ’ sources plus a couple of specific - interest sources , who they can trust and who reflect their general outlook on life .
Think about almost anyone you know who is an average media consumer .
They may have have a newspaper they read and a couple of magazines they buy about their special interests .
That ’s typical media consumption levels .
( In fact , these days just being a newspaper reader almost makes you an edge case because so many people will simply rely on their favourite television news broadcast ) .
One of the first things you learn as a journalist , is that the last thing your typical reader notices is the byline .
The assumption that your RSS crowd makes , is that people give a damn as to who you are and why your opinion matters .
And that people actually want to be that much more informed .
Try this experiment .
Set up the computer of your nearest and dearest who is n’t actually a geek with an ideal RSS environment .
Find all the feeds they might be interested in and pull it altogether for them .
See if it catches on .
I bet it does n’t .
Your best hope is if you choose one or two RSS feeds and feed it into something they already use like like GMail .
That push facility is quite useful to remind a user to consume media but it does n’t mean everybody is suddenly going to want to aggregate dozens of sources .
Another reality check :
How many non -techie do you know , who even consume media via email , which is the medium RSS is supposed to be replacing ?
In media land , you ’ve already had your rabid consumers and your average consumers .
Your rabid consumers like to be informed .
They like to think they know more than the bloke next door .
They ’ll probably use RSS in one form or another .
However , your average consumer actually does n’t need , or want to be , that informed .
Television news flashes are enought to satiate their information requirements .
And it ’s not a technology issue .
It ’s a media consumption issue .
This is why reading lists will never catch on .
If you ’re a sophisticated enough media consumer , you ’ll want to build your own .
If you ’re not , you wo n’t want a reading list at all .

Calculus with Analytic Geometry .

This is about calculus books , and there are seven important conclusions .
Let us go back to the beginning and look at the first calculus book , Analyse des
Infiniment Petits , pour L'intelligence des Lignes Courbes , published in Paris in
- 1696 and written by Guillaume François Antoine L'Hospital , Marquis de Sainte - Mesme ,
Comte d'Entrement , Seigneur d'Orques , etc .
To almost everyone , L'Hospital is just a
name attached to L'Hospital 's Rule and almost no one knows anything about him .
His
memory deserves better .
He displayed mathematical talent early , solving a problem
about cycloids at fifteen , and he was a lifelong lover and supporter of mathematics
who , unfortunately , died young , at the age of 43 .
Also , L'Hospital was no .
mean
mathematician .
He published several papers in the journals of the day , solving
various nontrivial problems .
I know that I could not have found , as he did , the
shape of a curve such that a body sliding down it exerts a normal force on it always
equal to the weight of the body .
Further , as Abraham Robinson has written ,
According to the testimony of his contemporaries , L'Hospital possessed a very
attractive personality , being , among other things , modest and generous , two
qualities which were not widespread among the mathematicians of his time .
His book was a huge success .
There was a second edition in 1715 , and there were
commentaries written on it .
I have the 1781 edition , with additions made by another
author .
Not many textbooks last almost 100 years .
Birkhoff and MacLane is not yet
50 years old .
L'Hospital 's book is about differentials and their applications to
curves and the style is exclusively geometrical .
There are not many equations , but
there are an awful lot of letters and pictures , just as I remember in my tenth grade
geometry text .
Mathematics was geometry then , and mathematicians were geometers .
There are many things not in the book .
There are no sines or cosines , no
exponentials or logarithms , only algebraic functions and algebraic curves .
There
are also no derivatives , only differentials .
Here is L'Hospital 's proof of
L'Hospital 's Rule , using differentials .
In Figure 1 , points on the graph of
f( x ) /g(x ) are found by dividing lengths of abscissas , except at a .
But if you dx
past a , the point on the graph will be dfldg .
Since dx is infinitesimal , that ratio
gives you the point at a .
Is that not nice ?
It took some time for calculus to become generally taught in colleges .
Eventually
it made it , and calculus textbooks began to appear in the nineteenth century .
I
have a copy of one , Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus , by Elias
Loomis , LI .
D. , Professor of Natural Philosophy at Yale College .
His calculus was
first published in 1851 , and my copy of it is the 1878 edition .
It sold in excess
of 25,000 copies , so it must reflect accurately the style and content of calculus
teaching of the time .
Just as with L'Hospital , the differential was the important
idea .
Loomis derived the formula for the differential of x " with no use of the
binomial expansion , ( d( xy ) / xy = dx /x + dy /y , d( xn ) / xn = dxlx + + dxlx , add and
simplify ) and his proof of L'Hospital 's Rule was short , simple , and clear , and also
one which does not appear in modern texts because it fails for certain pathological
examples .
Also , Loomis put all of his formulas in words , italicized words .
After
deriving the formula for the differential of a power of a function , he wrote
The differential of a function affected with any exponent whatever is the continued
product of the exponent , the function itself with its exponent diminished by unity ,
and the differential of the function .
It was a good idea .
It is also probably a good idea to do as L'Hospital and Loomis
did and talk about differentials instead of derivatives whenever possible .
Little
bits of things are easier to understand than rates of change .
It is a still better
idea to strive for clarity and let students see what is really going on , which is
what Loomis did , rather than putting rigor first .
But nowadays authors cannot do
that .
They must protect themselves against some colleague snootily writing to the
publisher , " Evidently Professor Blank is unaware that his so - called proof of
L'Hospital 's Rule is faulty , as the following well - known example shows .
I could not
possibly adopt a text with such a serious error . "
It is a shame , and probably
inevitable that calculus books are written for calculus teachers , but I have
nevertheless concluded
CONCLUSION #1 : CALCULUS BOOKS SHOULD BE WRITTEN FOR STUDENTS .
It would be worth a try .
Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson was quite
successful in its time , which ran for quite a while .
The second edition appeared in
1914 , and my copy was printed in 1935 .
It is still in print .
The book has a
motto :
What one fool can do , another can .
and a prologue :
Considering how many fools can calculate , it is surprising that it should be thought
either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the
same tricks .
...
Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow , I have bad to unteach myself the
difficulties , and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard .
Master these thoroughly , and the rest will follow .
What one fool can do , another
can .
Chapter 1 , whose title is " To Deliver You From The Preliminary Terrors " forthrightly
says that dx means " a little bit of x . "
Thompson did not include L'Hospital 's Rule .
Both Loomis and Thompson are like L'Hospital when it comes to giving applications
and examples : they are all almost entirely geometrical .
Loomis 's applications of
maxima and minima are all about inscribing and circumscribing things , and so are all
of Thompson 's except one .
In fact , all three books are full of geometry .
Thompson
concluded with arc length and curvature , Loomis had involutes and evolutes , cusps
and multiple points , and lots of curve sketching .
Did you know that the asymptote
to y3 = X3 + X2 is y = x + 1/3 ? 1 did n't until I read Loomis .
It is nice to know .
There must have been some reason why calculus books for more than 200 years taught
so much geometry .
Mathematics may no longer be synonymous with geometry , but we
have discarded , wrongly I think , the wisdom of the ages , and I have concluded
CONCLUSION #2 : CALCULUS BOOKS NEED MORE GEOMETRY .
Before writing this essay , I examined 85 separate and distinct calculus books .
I
looked at all of their prefaces , all of their applications of maxima and minima , and
all of their treatments of L'Hospital 's Rule .
By the way , I found five different
spellings of L'Hospital .
There were the two you would expect , and Lhospital , as
L'Hospital sometimes spelled his name .
In addition , one author , not wanting to take
chances , had it L'Hôspital , and one thought it was Le Hospital .
Why are there so
many calculus books , and why do they keep appearing ?
One could be cynical and say
that the authors are all motivated by greed .
But I do not think so .
I think that
authors write new calculus books because they have observed that students do not
learn much from the old calculus books .
Therefore , prospective authors think , " if I
write a text and do things properly , students will be able to learn . "
They are
wrong , all of them .
The reason for that is
CONCLUSION #3 : CALCULUS IS HARD .
Too hard , I think , to teach to college freshmen in the United States in the 1980s ,
but that is another topic .
If you plot the books ' numbers of pages against their year of publication , you have
a chart in which an ominous increasing trend is clear .
The 1000 - page barrier , first
pierced in 1960 , has been broken more and more often as time goes on .
New highs on
the calculus - page index are made almost yearly .
Where will it all end ?
We can get
an indication .
The magic of modern statistics packages produces the least - squares
line : Pages = 2.94 ( Year ) - 5180 , showing that in the middle of the next millennium ,
the average calculus book will have 2,270 , pages and the longest one , just published ,
will have 3,783 pages exclusive of index .
Why do we need 1000 pages to do what L'Hospital did in 234 , Loomis in 309 , Thompson
in 301 , and the text I learned calculus from , used exclusively for four whole
semesters , 14 semester - hours in all , in 416 ?
There are several reasons .
One , of
course , is the large number of reviewers of prospective texts .
No more can an
editor make up his mind about the merits of a text , it has to go out to fifteen
different people for opinions .
And if one of them writes that the author has left
out the tan ( x / 2 ) substitution in the section on techniques of integration , how can
he or she do that , we wo n't be able to integrate 3 / ( 4 + 5 sin 6 x ) , how can anyone
claim to know calculus who can't do that ; is n't the easiest response to include the
tan( x /2 ) substitution ?
Of course it is , in it goes , and in goes everything else
that is in every other 1000 - page text .
It is impossible to escape
CONCLUSION #4 : CALCULUS BOOKS ARE TOO LONG .
Another reason for the length is the current mania for Applications .
If you go to
Books in Print and look in the subject index under " Calculus " what you see is
The Usefulness of Calculus for the Behavioral , Life , and Managerial Sciences
Essentials of Calculus for Business , Economics , Life Sciences , and Social Sciences
and many , many similar titles .
Now authors have to explain , with examples , what
marginal revenue is , and consumer surplus , and what tracheae are whereas in the old
days , all their readers knew what a cone was .
A third reason is the supposed need
to be rigorous .
Now we see statements of L'Hospital 's Rule that take up half a page
and proofs of it that go on for three pages .
My 416 - page calculus book never even
mentioned L'Hospital 's Rule , and I never felt the lack .
Its author never proved
that the derivative of x ' was ex '- , but I was willing to believe it .
Trying to
include everything and trying to prove everything makes for long books .
Everything
gets longer .
Prefaces used to be short , a page or less .
Now they are five and six
pages , hard sells for the incredible virtues of the text that follows , full of
thanks to reviewers , to five or six editors , to wives , to students , even to cats .
Let me return to " applications . "
There are n't many , you know .
In the 85 calculus
books I examined , almost all of them had the Norman window problem - the rectangle
surmounted by a semicircle , fixed perimeter , maximize the area .
The semicircle
always " surmounts . "
This is the sole surviving use of " surmounted " in the English
language , except for the silo , a cylinder surmounted by a hemisphere .
Only one
author had the courage to say that the window was a semicircle on top of a
rectangle .
All the books had the box made by cutting the corners out of a flat
sheet , all have the ladder sliding down the wall , all had the conical tank with
changing height of water , all had the tin can with fixed surface area and maximum
volume , all had the V - shaped trough , all had the field to fence , with or without a
river flowing ( in a dead straight line ) along one side , all had the wire - usually
wire , but sometimes string - cut into two pieces to be formed into a circle and a
square , though some daring authors made circles and equilateral triangles .
There
are only finitely many calculus problems , and their number is very finite .
I
" Applications " are so phony .
Ladders do not slide down walls with the base moving
away from the wall at a constant rate .
Authors know the applications are phony .
One book has the base of the ladder sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet
per minute .
At that rate , you could finish up your painting with time to spare and
easily step off the ladder when it was a foot from the ground .
Another author has
the old run-and - swim problem - you know , minimize the time to oet somewhere on the
other side of the river - with the person able to run 25 feet per second and swim 20
feet per second .
That 's not bad for running ( it 's a 3:31.2 mile ) , but it is super
swimming , 100 yards in 15 seconds , a new world 's record by far .
There are no
conical reservoirs outside of calculus books .
Real reservoirs are cylindrical , or
perhaps rectangular .
The reason for this is found in the texts : in the problems ,
the conical reservoirs usually have a leak at the bottom .
Tin cans are not made to
minimize surface area .
I could give any number of examples of absurd applications
in which businessmen " observe " the price of their product decreasing at the rate of
$ 1 per month , or where the S. D. S. ( remember them ? ) " find " that staging x
demonstrations costs $ 250 x ' .
Why will authors not be honest and say that these
artificial problems provide valuable practice in translating from En- lish into
mathematics and that is all they are for ?
Surely they cannot disagree with
CONCLUSION #5 : FIRST - SEMESTER CALCULUS HAS NO APPLICATIONS .
Before getting to my next conclusion , here is my favorite " application . "
A cow has 90 feet of fence to make a rectangular pasture .
She has the use of a
cliff for one side .
She decides to leave a 10 foot gap in the fence in case the
grass should get greener on the other side .
Find .. . .
Hardly any authors dare to do that .
Calculus books are Serious .
The text from
which that problem came was titled Calculus Without Analytic Geometry and it is no
surprise that it did not catch on .
The existence of all those calculus books with " Applications " in their titles
implies a market for them ,
There must be students out there who are being forced to
undergo a semester of calculus before they can complete their major in botany and
take over the family flower shop .
I cannot believe that any more than a tiny
fraction of them will ever see a derivative again , or need one .
Calculus is a
splendid screen for screening out dummies , but it also screens out perfectly
intelligent people who find it difficult to deal with quantities .
I do n't know
about you , but I long ago concluded
CONCLUSION #6 : NOT EVERYONE NEEDS TO LEARN CALCULUS .
The book by Simmons is a fine one .
It was written with care and intelligence .
It
has good problems , and the historical material is almost a course in the history of
mathematics .
It is nicely printed ' , well bound , and expensive .
Future historians
of mathematics will look back on it and say , " Yes , that is an excellent example of a
late twentieth - century calculus book . "
This leads to my last conclusion
Reader Avner Ronen compares the Snakes on a Plane phenomenon with what happened to Serenity .
He notes :
I 'm looking forward to this movie as much as the next net.geek , but I do n't expect as much of a box - office surprise as many seem to be anticipating , because I 've seen it before .
What am I referring to ?
Serenity .
It would be hard to beat the online buzz Serenity was getting , and sometimes it seems like it 's difficult to find a blogger who is n't a fan of the prematurely cancelled series Firefly , but all of that buzz and a good deal of critical acclaim still could n't get people into the theaters .
He may well be right - it is very easy living at the hub of digital culture to imagine that all of the buzz we are hearing is generalizable across the population as a whole .
But let 's look for a moment at what happened with Firefly / Serenity and then , I will try to explain why I think Snakes on a Plane is in a somewhat different situation .
Praise Be the Whedon
Let 's be clear that I am a big fan of Firefly and of Joss Whedon 's other work in television and in comics .
I think he's one of the smartest and most creative people operating within the media industry today .
He has enormous respect for his fans and he has earned our respect in return .
He had constructed a television series he really believed in .
He was watching a very dedicated , very resourceful fan community form around a television series which either got canceled because a ) the ratings were low and it was not seen as having a broad general appeal or b) the ratings were low because the network had not successfully targeted its most likely audiences and given it a chance to develop the word of mouth needed to expand its core viewership .
We may never know which of these explanations is the correct one - I suspect some combination of the two .
Whedon still wanted to produce the content ; there was a group of people clammering for the content ; but the networks did n't think there 's a large enough audience to sustain a prime time broadcast series .
This is a situation we 've seen again and again in the history of broadcast media .
I think it 's about time we rewrote the rules .
Serenity and the Long Tail
We are now in the space which Chris Anderson has documented so well in his discussion of the Long Tail .
In Anderson 's account , media properties can succeed by appealing to niche rather than mass audiences if you can lower costs of production , publicity , and distribution , keep the content on the market long enough for consumer interest to grow , and count on the most passionate consumers to help spread the word about your brand .
By those criteria , Firefly should be as close to a natural for the Long Tail as anything produced for television so far and the brisk sales and rentals of the dvds of the original episodes illustrated that point pretty well .
But Whedon got greedy - or someone got greedy on his behalf - and Firefly moved the wrong direction up Anderson 's Long Tail - towards a blockbuster Hollywood movie which would have required even more viewers to be seen as successful than would have been required to keep the series on the air on a second tier network .
Yes , it was way cool to watch those characters up there on the big screen but Whedon set the bar much too high for the existing market for his property and we all paid a price for his hubris .
To make something that felt like a movie , he had to produce something that did n't feel like a television episode , creating a story that turned the world of the series upside down .
Along the way , he killed off some of the most beloved characters and lost some of the elements which many of us liked about Firefly in the first place .
At the same time , he compressed a season 's worth of plot developments into two hours or so of screentime with the result that he produced a work that was confusing to many first time viewers and that lacked the gradual character development that was the hallmark of Firefly .
I still liked a lot about the movie but what I did n't like was the fact that it would seem to have pretty much closed the door to further development in the Firefly franchise -- at least in the foreseeable future .
The Road Not Taken
Imagine , instead , that he had moved in the other direction down the tail , towards the production of television style episodes directly for dvd .
I 've discussed such a system in relation to Global Frequency ( a show that suffered an even more premature death than Firefly -- canceled before it even reached the air ) .
CMS graduate student Ivan Askwith has advocated the use of the video ipod as a distribution platform for essentially long tail television .
We have seen fan groups advocating such an approach for recently canceled series such as The West Wing and Arrested Development .
From the perspective of a producer like Whedon , who has a strong and existing fan base , this should be a very attractive proposition - make as many episodes as you want in whatever story structure you want with no risk that a network will stand between you and your audience , start making money as soon as the first product ships rather than waiting for syndication to turn a profit .
What would make it even more attractive would be to create a subscription based model so that readers paid in advance for episodes they wanted to see and they knew more or less what the core market was before production started .
This would be hard to arrange for a totally new property : easier for a canceled series or for a show by a brand - name creator like Whedon .
I 'd pay now to guarantee access to original content by Whedon , sight unseen , a year from now .
So would most of the other brown coats , I would bet .
And if he had gone that route , we would have been able to enjoy many more hours of quality science fiction / western action on television , where it belongs , instead of burning up the whole franchise in two hours of big screen excitement .
Yes , there are risks involved -- if for no other reason than because no television show has ever made this transition into direct to dvd production .
We can point to the example of a growing number of Disney animated features which have generated direct to DVD sequels with a fair amount of success with their core market .
But the risks involved would have been lower -- financially at least -- than trying to turn a failed television series into a Hollywood blockbuster .
Whedon could have done it if anyone could and if he had , a lot of other television producers would have followed his example .
What About Snakes ?
Serenity had one of the most committed fan bases in media history and they would have followed Whedon anywhere but they were n't enough on their own to make a success on the tall end of the Long Tail .
They needed to draw in lots of non-fans of the franchise .
We might imagine that non-fans were resistant to the film now for many of the same reasons that they were resistant to the original series and we can add one more factor : they were reluctant to jump onto a film they knew was based on a series that they had n't seen because they were afraid they were going to be lost .
Whedon worked hard to make the film accessible and we were told he was going to do so , but guess what , lots of folks did n't believe him .
So , if we follow the logic of the Long Tail , success on one end of the tail depends on deep commitments from a relatively narrow fan base ( that 's what Firefly had ) and on the other end , on superficial commitments from a broader range of viewers ( and that 's what Snakes on a Plane has . )
I doubt anyone really has the same level of passion for Snakes as they have for Firefly .
It 's a fun lark -- a one night stand , a vacation movie romance .
But it is n't a once in a lifetime passion .
But that 's okay .
What 's bad / good about the concept is something anyone can quickly grasp .
You hear the title and you chuckle .
You see the preview and you are hooked -- or not .
You do n't need to have seen another media product to consume this one .
There 's a star - Jackson - with some box office reputation - remember , Serenity had no stars except those who were in the television series .
It 's got some draw as a straight out peddle to the metal action film with a good leading actor and some appeal as the best example of camp and kitsch to hit the screen in some time .
Those are good reasons to think the film will have a broader appeal than Serenity - even if , especially if , it is nowhere near as good a movie .
Whedon bet that his fan followers could tell the public to turn out at the multiplex to see his movie .
The producers of Snakes have used the audience to tell them how to market this movie and then have applied the capacity of a major publicity campaign to amplify that approach towards the general audience .
Mr Richardson was allowed to tour Yongbyon nuclear plant
Bill Richardson said he was " very pleased " with North Korea 's willingness to make progress in six -nation talks .
Pyongyang has already pledged to abandon its nuclear weapons in an earlier round of the talks .
Mr Richardson , former US ambassador at the UN , said North Korea now wanted to focus on a civilian nuclear programme .
" Their view is that what needs to be addressed is the light water reactor , " he said .
North Korea has said it will renounce its nuclear weapons in exchange for aid and security guarantees and foreign help in building a civilian nuclear programme .
Mr Richardson said Pyongyang officials had indicated they may eventually allow US and other monitors into the country to ensure none of the spent fuel from a civilian reactor is diverted to weapons .
' Show of transparency '
Mr Richardson , the governor of the US state of New Mexico , spent several days meeting North Korean officials and touring their nuclear facilities last week .
He later told the South Korean foreign minister that the North had indicated it was willing to comply with international non-proliferation treaties and to allow UN monitoring of its nuclear programme .
" I was impressed with their tone , and their commitment to principles , " he told reporters in the South Korean capital , Seoul .
Mr Richardson said he had been allowed to tour a nuclear facility in Yongbyon , in an apparent " show of transparency " that " bodes well for six - party talks " .
The next round of talks - involving the two Koreas , China , Japan , the US and Russia - will be held in the first week of November , he said .
" My view is that we should not expect an agreement in the next round , " he said .
" There will be measurable progress that might lead to a future agreement . "
Food aid
The nuclear dispute with Pyongyang began in late 2002 , when the US accused North Korea of having a uranium - based nuclear arms programme , in violation of international agreements .
Separately , Mr Richardson said North Korea had told him UN food aid workers will be allowed to remain in the country , reversing an earlier threat to kick them out .
In recent years , the UN and other international agencies have been feeding up to six million of the poorest and most vulnerable North Koreans .
Mr Richardson said a new agreement could enable the UN's World Food Programme workers to stay on " under a renewed definition of what development aid is " .
The Role of Socratic Questioning in Thinking , Teaching , & Learning
One of the reasons that instructors tend to overemphasize “ coverage ” over “ engaged thinking ” is that they do not fully appreciate the role of questions in teaching content .
Consequently , they assume that answers can be taught separate from questions .
Indeed , so buried are questions in established instruction that the fact that all assertions -- all statements that this or that is so -- are implicit answers to questions is virtually never recognized .
For example , the statement that water boils at 100 degrees centigrade is an answer to the question “ At what temperature centigrade does water boil ? ”
Hence every declarative statement in the textbook is an answer to a question .
Hence , every textbook could be rewritten in the interrogative mode by translating every statement into a question .
To our knowledge this has never been done .
That it has not is testimony to the privileged status of answers over questions in instruction and the misunderstanding of teachers about the significance of questions in the learning ( and thinking ) process .
Instruction at all levels now keeps most questions buried in a torrent of obscured “ answers . ”
Thinking is Driven by Questions
But thinking is not driven by answers but by questions .
Had no questions been asked by those who laid the foundation for a field -- for example , Physics or Biology -- the field would never have been developed in the first place .
In fact , every intellectual field is born out of a cluster of questions to which answers are either needed or highly desirable .
Furthermore , every field stays alive only to the extent that fresh questions are generated and taken seriously as the driving force in a process of thinking .
To think through or rethink anything , one must ask questions that stimulate thought .
Questions define tasks , express problems and delineate issues .
Answers on the other hand , often signal a full stop in thought .
Only when an answer generates a further question does thought continue its life as such .
This is why it is true that only students who have questions are really thinking and learning .
Moreover , the quality of the questions students ask determines the quality of the thinking they are doing .
It is possible to give students an examination on any subject by just asking them to list all of the questions that they have about a subject , including all questions generated by their first list of questions .
That we do not test students by asking them to list questions and explain their significance is again evidence of the privileged status we give to answers isolated from questions .
That is , we ask questions only to get thought - stopping answers , not to generate further questions .
Feeding Students Endless Content to Remember Feeding students endless content to remember ( that is , declarative sentences or “ facts ” to remember ) is akin to repeatedly stepping on the brakes in a vehicle that is , unfortunately , already at rest .
Instead , students need questions to turn on their intellectual engines and they must themselves generate questions from our questions to get their thinking to go somewhere .
Thinking is of no use unless it goes somewhere , and again , the questions we ask determine where our thinking goes .
It is only when our thinking goes somewhere that we learn anything of value to us .
Deep questions drive our thought underneath the surface of things , force us to deal with complexity .
Questions of purpose force us to define our task .
Questions of information force us to look at our sources of information as well as at the quality of our information .
Questions of interpretation force us to examine how we are organizing or giving meaning to information and to consider alternative ways of giving meaning .
Questions of assumption force us to examine what we are taking for granted .
Questions of implication force us to follow out where our thinking is going .
Questions of point of view force us to examine our point of view and to consider other relevant points of view .
Questions of relevance force us to discriminate what does and what does not bear on a question .
Questions of accuracy force us to evaluate and test for truth and correctness .
Questions of precision force us to give details and be specific .
Questions of consistency force us to examine our thinking for contradictions .
Questions of logic force us to consider how we are putting the whole of our thought together , to make sure that it all adds up and makes sense within a reasonable system of some kind .
Dead Questions Reflect Dead Minds
Unfortunately , most students ask virtually none of these thought - stimulating types of questions .
They tend to stick to dead questions like “ Is this going to be on the test ? ” , questions that imply the desire not to think .
Most teachers in turn are not themselves generators of questions and answers of their own , that is , are not seriously engaged in thinking through or rethinking through their own subjects .
Rather , they are purveyors of the questions and answers of others -- usually those of a textbook .
We must continually remind ourselves that thinking begins within some content only when questions are generated by both teachers and students .
No questions equals no understanding .
Superficial questions equals superficial understanding .
Most students typically have no intellectual questions .
They not only sit in silence ; their minds are silent at well .
Hence , the questions they do have tend to be superficial , ill - formed and self - serving .
This demonstrates that most of the time they are not thinking through the content they are presumed to be learning .
In other words , most of the time they are not learning the content they are presumed to be learning .
If we want to engage students in thinking through our content we must stimulate their thinking with questions that lead them to further questions .
We must overcome what previous schooling has done to the thinking of students .
We must resuscitate minds that are largely dead when we receive them .
We must give our students what might be called “ artificial cogitation ” ( the intellectual equivalent of artificial respiration ) .
The Art of Socratic Questioning
The art of Socratic questioning is important for the critical thinker because the art of questioning is important to excellence of thought .
What the word ‘ Socratic ’ adds is “ systematicity , ” “ depth , ” and a keen interest in assessing the truth or plausibility of things .
There is a special relationship between critical thinking and Socratic questioning because both share a common end .
Critical thinking gives one a comprehensive view of how the mind functions ( in its pursuit of meaning and truth ) , and Socratic questioning takes advantage of that overview to frame questions essential to the quality of that pursuit .
The goal of critical thinking is to establish a disciplined “ executive ” level of thinking to our thinking , a powerful inner voice of reason , to monitor , assess , and re-constitute –in a more rational direction–our thinking , feeling , and action .
Socratic discussion cultivates that inner voice by providing a public model for it .
The Spirit and Principles of Socratic Questioning
While there are numerous ways in which Socratic questioning can be effectively executed in the classroom , there are a set of principles , which guide a Socratic dialog .
In this section , there principles are laid out in the form of directives .
Teachers engaged in a Socratic dialog should : Respond to all answers with a further question ( that calls upon the respondent to develop his / her thinking in a fuller and deeper way ) .
Seek to understand –where possible – the ultimate foundations for what is said or believed and follow the implications of those foundations through further
questions .
Treat all assertions as a connecting point to further thoughts .
Treat all thoughts as in need of development .
Recognize that any thought can only exist fully in a network of connected
thoughts .
Stimulate students –through your questions –to pursue those
connections .
Recognize that all questions presuppose prior questions and all thinking
presupposes prior thinking .
When raising questions , be open to the questions
they presuppose .
( See the section on logically - prior questions . )
Teachers engaged in Socratic dialog should systematically raise questions based on the following recognitions and assumptions : Focusing on The Elements of Thought Recognize that all thought reflects an agenda .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the agenda behind it .
( What are you trying to accomplish in saying this ?
What is your central aim in this line of thought ? )
Recognize that all thoughts presuppose an information base .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the background information that supports or informs it .
( What information are you basing that comment on ?
What experience convinced you of this ?
How do we know this information is accurate ? )
Recognize that all thought requires the making of inferences , the drawing of conclusions , the creation of meaning .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand the inferences that have shaped it .
( How did you reach that conclusion ?
Could you explain your reasoning ?
Is there an alternative plausible conclusion ? )
Recognize that all thought involves the application of concepts .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand the concepts that define and shape it .
( What is the main idea you are putting forth ?
Could you explain that idea ? )
Recognize that all thought rests upon other thoughts ( which are taken for granted or assumed ) .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand what it takes for granted .
( What exactly are you taking for granted here ?
Why are you assuming that ? )
Recognize that all thought is headed in a direction .
It not only rests upon something ( assumptions ) , it is also going somewhere ( implications and consequences ) .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought unless you know the implications and consequences that follow from it .
( What are you implying when you say that ?
Are you implying that ...?)
Recognize that all thought takes place within a point of view or frame of reference .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand the point of view or frame of reference which places it on an intellectual map .
( From what point of view are you looking at this ?
Is there another point of view we should consider ? )
Recognize that all thought is responsive to a question .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the question that gives rise to it .
( I am not sure exactly what question you are raising .
Could you explain it ? )
Systems and Contexts For Thought Recognize that all thought has three possible functions : to express a subjective preference , to establish an objective fact ( within a well - defined system ) , or to come up with the best of competing answers ( generated by competing systems ) .
Assume that you do not fully understand thinking until you know which of the three is involved .
( Is the question calling for a subjective or personal choice ?
If so , let ’s make that choice in terms of our personal preferences .
If not , then , is there a way to come up with one correct answer to this question ( a definite system in which to find the answer ) ?
Or , finally , are we dealing with a question that would be answered differently within different points of view ?
If the latter , what is the best answer to the question , all things considered ? )
Recognize that all thought has emerged within a human context .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the context which has given rise to it .
( Tell us more about the situation that has given rise to this problem .
What was going on in this situation ? )
How To Prepare To Lead a Socratic Discussion
One of the best ways to prepare to lead a Socratic discussion is by pre-thinking the main question to be discussed using the approach of developing prior questions .
Prior questions are questions presupposed by another question .
Hence , to settle the question “ What is multi-culturalism ? ” I should be able to first settle the question , “ What is culture ? , ” and to settle that question , I should be able to settle the question “ What is the basis of culture ? , ” that is , “ What are the factors about a person which determine what culture he / she belongs to ? ’ ”
Construct A List of Prior Questions
To construct a list of prior questions , simply write down the main question which you are going to focus your discussion on and then pose a question you would have to be able to answer before you could answer the first .
Then take the second question and do the same for it ( i.e. , determine what question you would have to answer to answer it ) .
Then , continue on , following the same procedure for every new question on your list .
As you proceed to construct your list keep your attention focused on the first question on the list as well as on the last .
If you do this well , you should end up with a list of questions which probe the logic of the first question , and hence , a list of questions which are relevant to a Socratic discussion of your first question .
During the Socratic dialog , you should loosely follow your list of logically prior questions , using it primarily as a guide for deeply probing the issue at hand .
A Sample List
As an example of how to construct logically prior questions , consider this list of questions that we developed in thinking through a key question intended for use in conducting a Socratic discussion on the question , “ What is history ? ”
What is history ?
What do historians write about ?
What is the past ?
Is it possible to include all of the past in a history book ?
How many of the events during a given time period are left out in a history of that time period ?
Is more left out than is included ?
How does a historian know what to emphasize or focus on ?
Do historians make value judgments in deciding what to include and what to
leave out ?
Is it possible to simply list facts in a history book or does all history writing
involve interpretations as well as facts ?
Is it possible to decide what to include and exclude and how to interpret facts
without adopting a historical point of view ?
How can we begin to judge a historical interpretation ?
How can we begin to judge a historical point of view ?
Sample Socratic Dialogue
In this final section , we provide a sample high school Socratic questioning dialog : Teacher ( T ) : This is a course in Biology .
What kind of a subject is that ?
What do you know about Biology already ?
Kathleen , what do you know about it ?
Kathleen :
It ’s a science .
T : And what ’s a science ?
Kathleen : Me ? A science is very exact .
They do experiments and measure things and test things .
T : Right , and what other sciences are there besides Biology ?
Marisa , could you name some ?
Marisa : Sure , there ’s Chemistry and Physics .
T : What else ?
Blake : There ’s Botany and Math ?
T : Math ... math is a little different from the others , is n’t it ?
How is math different from Biology , Chemistry , Physics , and Botany ?
Blake , what would you say ?
Blake :
You do n’t do experiments in math .
T : And why not ?
Blake : I guess cause numbers are different .
T : Yes , studying numbers and other mathematical things is different from studying chemicals or laws in the physical world or living things and so forth .
You might ask your math teacher about why numbers are different or do some reading about that , but let ’s focus our attention here on what are called the life sciences .
Why are Biology and Botany called life sciences ?
Peter : Because they both study living things .
T : How are they different ?
How is Biology different from Botany ?
Jennifer , what do you think ?
Jennifer : I do n’t know .
T : Well , let ’s all of us look up the words in our dictionaries and see what is said about them .
( Students look up the words )
T : Jennifer , what did you find for Biology ?
Jennifer :
It says : " The science that deals with the origin , history , physical characteristics , life processes , habits , etc ...of plants and animals : It includes Botany and Zoology " .
T : So what do we know about the relationship of Botany to Biology ?
Rick ?
Rick : Botany is just a part of Biology .
T : Right , and what can we tell about Biology from just looking at its etymology .
What does it literally mean ?
If you break the word into two parts " bio " and " logy " .
Blake , what does it tell us ?
Blake :
The science of life or the study of life .
T : So , do you see how etymology can help us get an insight into the meaning of a word ?
Do you see how the longer definition spells out the etymological meaning in greater detail ?
Well , why do you think experiments are so important to biologists and other scientists ?
Have humans always done experiments do you think ?
Marisa .
Marisa : I guess not , not before there was any science .
T : Right .
That ’s an excellent point .
Science did n’t always exist .
What did people do before science existed ?
How did they get their information ?
How did they form their beliefs ?
Peter .
Peter : From religion .
T : Yes , religion often shaped a lot of what people thought .
Why do n’t we use religion today to decide , for example , what is true of the origin , history , and physical characteristics of life ?
Peter : Some people still do .
Some people believe that the Bible explains the origin of life and that the theory of evolution is wrong .
T : What is the theory of evolution , Jose ?
Jose : I do n’t know .
T : Well , why do n’t we all look up the name Darwin in our dictionaries and see if there is anything there about Darwinian theory .
( Students look up the words )
T : Jose , read aloud what you have found .
Jose :
It says " Darwin ’s theory of evolution holds that all species of plants and animals developed from earlier forms by hereditary transmission of slight variations in successive generations and that the forms which survive are those that are best adapted to the environment . "
T : What does that mean to you .... in ordinary language ?
How would you explain that ?
Jose .
Jose :
It means the stronger survive and the weaker die ?
T : Well , if that ’s true why do you think the dinosaurs died out ?
I thought dinosaurs were very strong ?
Shannon :
They died because of the ice age , I think .
T : So I guess it ’s not enough to be strong , you must also fit in with the changes in the environment .
Perhaps fitness or adaptability is more important than strength .
Well , in any case why do you think that most people today look to science to provide answers to questions about the origin and nature of life rather than to the Bible or other religious teachings ?
Shannon : Nowadays most people believe that science and religion deal with different things and that scientific questions cannot be answered by religion .
T : And by the same token , I suppose , we recognize that religious questions cannot be answered by science .
In any case , how were scientists able to convince people to consider their way of finding answers to questions about the nature of life and life processes .
Kathleen , you ’ve been quiet for a while , what do you think ?
Kathleen :
To me science can be proved .
When scientists say something we can ask for proof and they can show us , and if we want we can try it out for ourselves .
T : Could you explain that further ?
Kathleen : Sure , in my chemistry class we did experiments in which we tested out some of the things that were said in our chemistry books .
We could see for ourselves .
T : That ’s right , science is based on the notion that when we claim things to be true about the world we should be able to test them to see if , objectively , they are true .
Marisa , you have a question ?
Marisa :
Yes , but do n’t we all test things .
We test our parents and our friends .
We try out ideas to see if they work .
T : That ’s true .
But is there any difference between the way you and I test our friends and the way a chemist might test a solution to see if it is acidic ?
Marisa : Sure , … but I ’m not sure how to explain it .
T : Blake , what do you think ?
Blake : Scientists have laboratories ; we do n’t .
T : They also do precise measurements and use precise instruments , do n’t they ?
Why do n’t we do that with our friends , parents , and children ?
Adrian , do you have an idea why not ?
Adrian :
We do n’t need to measure our friends .
We need to find out whether they really care about us .
T : Yes , finding our about caring is a different matter than finding out about acids and bases , or even than finding out about animal behavior .
You might say that there are two different kinds of realities in the world , the qualitative and the quantitative , and that science is mostly concerned with the quantitative , while we are often concerned with the qualitative .
Could you name some qualitative ideas that all of us are concerned with ?
Rick , what do you think ?
Rick : I do n’t know what you mean .
T : Well , the word qualitative is connected to the word quality .
If I were to ask you to describe your own qualities in comparison to your brother or sister , would you know the sort of thing I was asking you ?
Rick : I guess so .
T : Could you , for example , take your father and describe to us some of his best and some of his worst qualities as you see them ?
Rick : I guess so .
T : OK , why do n’t you do it .
What do you think some of your father ’s best qualities are ?
Rick :
To me he is generous .
He likes to help people out when they are in trouble .
T : And what science studies generosity ?
Rick : I do n’t know .
None , I guess .
T : That ’s right , generosity is a human quality ; it ca n’t be measured scientifically .
There is no such thing as generosity units .
So science is not the only way we can find things out .
We can also experience qualities in the world .
We can experience kindness , generosity , fear , love , hate , jealousy , self - satisfaction , friendship , and many , many other things as well .
In this class we are concerned mainly with what we can find out about life quantitatively or scientifically .
For next time , I want you to read the first chapter in your text book and I want you to be prepared to explain what the first chapter says .
I will be dividing you up into groups of four and each group of four will develop a short summary of the first chapter ( without looking at it , of course ) and then we will have a spokesperson from each group explain your summary to the class .
After that , we will have a discussion of the ideas mentioned .
Do n’t forget today ’s discussion , because I ’ll be asking you some questions that will see if you can relate what we talked about today with what was said in your first chapter .
Any questions ? … OK , … See you next time .

" The third is the one that we are very interested in , " Mr. Weiner said .
This is " social " or " community " searching , in which each attempt to find the right restaurant listing , medical advice site , vacation tip or other bit of information takes advantage of other people 's successes and failures in locating the same information .
The idea that human judgment can improve a search engine 's automatic findings is hardly new .
From the dawn of the Web 's history -- that is , over the last 15 years -- companies have invented tools to help users assess the quality and relevance of information , often by relying on others ' opinions .
Examples include Amazon 's user reviews , eBay 's feedback ratings and " trusted networks " created on many sites .
What is different is Yahoo's systematic plan to build " community intelligence " into nearly all aspects of its operation -- and in turn , to entice users to spend more and more of their time on Yahoo sites , where they can see Yahoo ads .
The clearest example , of many I heard about , can be seen at http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com, the beta version of a new search site .
A query from this page will return results from three sources .
One is " My Web , " or pages each user has marked and asked Yahoo to save for later reference .
( These pages are saved by Yahoo itself , on its servers , and do n't gum up your own machine . )
Another is " Everyone 's Web , " the general Internet .
Finally , there is " My Community 's Web , " pages marked as interesting or valuable by members of a social network .
Thus , a search for information on new cars would bring up normal Web results , but also listings you had seen and wanted to retain , as well as friends ' advice on brands and dealers they had tried .
Setting up a social network to provide advice can take time .
But Caterina Fake , one of the founders of Flickr and now a Yahoo executive , pointed out that virtually everyone under 30 had already created such networks .
What about those not young or hip enough to have done so yet ?
Eventually , according to Ms. Fake , more users would create networks as the process became easier and more worthwhile .
Mr. Nazem said , " We 're really about getting the average consumer to move their lives online . "
Why should Yahoo's community intelligence be better than others ' half - successful earlier attempts ?
This is where its argument about scale comes in .
" It is a key strength that our community is so large , " said Mr. Semel , who has seen Yahoo's user base double in his four years as chief executive .
With hundreds of millions of users , there is critical mass to create social networks that cover most locations and interests -- for instance , a large and active user group among women in the United Arab Emirates .
VAST scale presents its challenges .
" You can think about the way people will interact , as you sit in the usability lab , but until you put it in front of very large numbers of real people , you do n't really know , " Ms. Fake said .
" So you have to release products early and often , like perpetual beta . "

It was Meryl Streep ’s idea to auction off The Devil Wears Prada ’s couture costumes to benefit women ’s charities at the St. Regis last week , but it was surprise lots from the stars that brought in the big bucks .
Christine Schwarzman ( wife of Steve ) paid $ 8,000 for drinks and shoe shopping with Stanley Tucci .
Then Anne Hathaway offered her baby - sitting services .
“ You have to prove you actually have children , according to my boyfriend , ” she joked .
“ Come on !
Give your kids a memory !
I ’ll bring cupcakes ! ”
Bidding was so furious that , at CAA honcho Kevin Huvane ’s request , Hathaway sold two two - hour gigs at $ 20,000 apiece ( the buyers were Dan and Cynthia Lufkin and Craig and Caryn Effron , whose East Seventies townhouse was Streep ’s home in the movie ) .
Streep offered to dish Hollywood dirt at tea ( “ mar - tea - ni ” ) at the St. Regis , but by then the room ’s fervor had died down .
“ Anne Hathaway , you paid more for her .
Do n’t think I did n’t notice , ” Streep said with a sigh , before raising her hand and volunteering “ $ 17,000 … to drink alone . ”
A minute later , a Public Theater board member bought the tea for $ 18,000 .

Senior sources in the Metropolitan Police have told The Observer that members of the surveillance team who followed de Menezes into Stockwell underground station in London felt that he was not about to detonate a bomb , was not armed and was not acting suspiciously .
It was only when they were joined by armed officers that his threat was deemed so great that he was shot seven times .
Sources said that the surveillance officers wanted to detain de Menezes , but were told to hand over the operation to the firearms team .
The two teams have fallen out over the circumstances surrounding the incident , raising fresh questions about how the operation was handled .
A police source said : ' There is no way those three guys would have been on the train carriage with him [ de Menezes ] if they believed he was carrying a bomb .
Nothing he did gave the surveillance team the impression that he was carrying a device . '
Last night , Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair admitted he was told that shooting created ' a difficulty ' .
In an interview with the News of the World , Blair said that an officer came to him the day after the shooting and said the equivalent of ' Houston , we have a problem ' .
' He did n't use those words but he said " We have some difficulty here , there is a lack of connection " .
' I thought " That 's dreadful , what are we going to do about that ? " .'
The Observer can also reveal that the de Menezes family was offered £ 15,000 after the shooting .
The ex gratia payment , which does not affect legal action by the family or compensation , is a fraction of the $ 1 million ( £ 560,000 ) reported to have been offered the family .
Police yesterday denied they had made the offer , which the family has described as ' offensive ' .
Members of the firearms unit are said to be furious that de Menezes was not properly identified when he left his flat , the first problem in the chain of events that led to the Brazilian 's death .
Specialist officers with the firearms team active that day had received training in how to deal with suicide bombers .
A key element was advice that a potential bomber will detonate at the first inkling he has been identified .
They are trained to react at the first sign of any action .
The Observer now understands that seconds before the firearms team entered the tube train carriage , a member of the surveillance squad using the codename Hotel 3 moved to the doorway and shouted : ' He 's in here . '
De Menezes , in all likelihood alarmed by the activity , stood and moved towards the doorway .
He was grabbed and pushed back to his seat .
The first shots were then fired while Hotel 3 was holding him .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) is to investigate if the firearms officers , with only seconds to decide whether to shoot , mistakenly interpreted de Menezes 's movement as an aggressive act .
For the firearms officers involved in the death to avoid any legal action , they will have to state that they believed their lives and those of the passengers were in immediate danger .
Such a view is unlikely to be supported by members of the surveillance unit .
For reasons as yet unclear , members of the firearms team have yet to submit their own account of the events to the IPCC .
The two members of the team believed to have fired the fatal shots are known to have gone on holiday immediately after the shooting .
In one case , the holiday had been pre-booked , in the other the leave was authorised by Blair , who yesterday received the backing of the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke : ' I am very happy with the conduct , not only of Sir Ian Blair , but the whole Metropolitan Police in relation to this inquiry . '
Meanwhile , questions have been raised about the accuracy of the police intelligence that led to the raid on the block of flats occupied by de Menezes .
It was initially suggested that the flat was connected to the man known as Hussein Osman , who was arrested in Italy .
On the Saturday after the shooting , officers raided the flat in a high - profile operation watched by the world 's media .
As a result , a man , identified only as ' C ' , was arrested ' on suspicion of the commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism ' .
But he was released on 30 July with no charge , raising the possibility that the flats had no connection with the bombings .
The IPCC is also expected to look into selective briefings to the media over the days following the shootings .
The parents of de Menezes said they have rejected all financial offers made by the police .
' I feel hurt and offended , ' Jean 's mother , Maria Otoni de Menezes , told The Observer this weekend .
' I did n't think it was right to talk about money so soon after my son 's death . '
One document seen by The Observer and handed to the family on 1 August by the Met 's assistant deputy commissioner , John Yates , sets out a final settlement , on top of an agreement to pay repatriation and legal fees .
' The MPS offers £ 15,000 by way of compensation to you for the death of Jean Charles , ' says the document , dated 27 July .
' This ... extra gratia paymen ... means it is paid without any consideration of legal liability or responsibility . '
Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner is the favourite science fiction film of scientists , according to a poll for the Guardian .
Second and third places went to Stanley Kubrick 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey and the first two films of the original Star Wars trilogy .
Scott 's film , based loosely Philip K Dick 's short story , Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , presents a dystopian vision of a future Los Angeles in which a policeman is hunting four illegal androids .
" Blade Runner is the best movie ever made , " said Dr Stephen Minger , stem cell biologist at King 's College London .
" It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story - what is it to be human and who are we , where we come from ?
It 's the age - old questions . "
Professor Chris Frith , of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College , London , was impressed by the way the film used science as an integral part of its narrative .
The Voight - Kampff empathy test , for example , is used by the police in the film to differentiate androids - who have memories implanted and are programmed with artificial emotions - from humans .
" The Voight - Kampff empathy test is not far away from the sort of thing that cognitive neuroscientists are actually doing today , " said Prof Frith .
Kubrick 's 2001 was praised by scientists for its bold vision on the evolution of humanity .
Aubrey Manning , emeritus professor of natural history at Edinburgh , pointed to " the brilliance of the simulations - still never done better despite all the modern computer graphics .
The brilliance of using Brazilian tapirs as ' prehistoric animals ' .
The brilliance of the cut from the stick as club , to the space shuttle .
Kubrick declaring that once tool use begins - the rest is inevitable .
Hal : the first of the super computers with its honeyed East Coast establishment voice . "
The poll also established Isaac Asimov as the scientists ' favourite science fiction author .
He was praised for making the science in his books understandable .
" Unlike a lot of sci - fi writers , Asimov knew how to explain the science , and was a great populariser of real science , " said Professor Mark Brake , a science communication lecturer at Glamorgan University .
" But what sets him aside is that he was also masterful at documenting human responses to scientific progress . "
John Wyndham , author of The Day of The Triffids , and Fred Hoyle , author of The Black Cloud , were second and third favourite writers .

The nations do not want climate policies to affect economic growth
China , India , South Korea , Japan and Australia and the US account for nearly half of world greenhouse gas emissions .
The US - led initiative would tackle global warming with new technology supplied to countries most in need .
Critics say the new compact undermines Kyoto and is likely to be ineffective because it is non-binding .
' Superior ' deal
The pact will allow signed - up countries to set their goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually , with no enforcement mechanism .
The signatories argue it complements , rather than weakens , the 1997 Kyoto agreement , which imposes targets on industrialised countries to cut their emissions .
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said : " The fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the Kyoto protocol .
" It demonstrates the very strong commitment of Australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions , according to an understanding that it's fair in Australia and not something that will destroy Australian jobs and unfairly penalise Australian industries . "
US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick agreed the six nations " view this as a complement , not an alternative " to Kyoto .
Both the US and Australia have refused to ratify Kyoto , which came into effect earlier this year , partly , they say , because big developing countries like India and China escape emissions limits .
' Win-win '
They have also made clear their concern that climate change should only be addressed without harming development or economic growth .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " Our view is you really need to focus on technological change to solve the climate change problem ... and you do have to involve the major developing countries , which are very substantial emitters . "
A Chinese spokesman called the pact a " win-win solution " for developing countries .
A deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired
Worldwide Fund for Nature
The UK government 's chief scientific adviser , Sir David King , told the BBC's Today radio programme he doubted the new deal could work without setting caps on emissions .
But , he added , the surprise announcement should be seen as a sign of progress on climate change .
Environmental campaigners have criticised the new pact as ineffectual and serving the interests of industrialised nations .
The Geneva - based Worldwide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) said : " A deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired . "
Bob Brown , leader of Australia 's opposition Green party , dismissed the agreement as a " coal pact " involving four of the world 's largest coal producers - China , the US , India and Australia .
The new group 's first summit will be held in Adelaide , Australia , in November .
China has added strippers at funerals to its burgeoning list of proscribed activities , the BBC reports .
Bare - assed ladies are apparently deployed at rural send - offs to boost mourner numbers , since " large crowds are seen as a mark of honour " .
To show they mean business , the authorities have arrested the leaders of five striptease troupes , including two involved in a farmer 's funeral in Donghai county , Jiangsu province on 16 August , which was exposed by a Chinese TV station .
Local officials subsequently ordered an end to the traditional practice - which they dubbed " obscene performances " - and declared that " funeral plans have to be submitted in advance " , according to Xinhua news agency .
And just to make sure the ban sticks , the powers that be have set up a hotline where concerned citizens can earn cash rewards for reporting " funeral misdeeds " .
For the record , the attendance at the farmer 's farewell was estimated at 200 .
He can consider himself duly honoured . ®
Bootnote
We gather that strippers are commonly seen at Taiwanese funerals , where explicit displays are accompanied by hard - core commentary on the deceased 's virility .
Taiwanese lottery winners also hire strippers to disrobe in temples as a mark of gratitude for their good fortune .
The C of E might like to consider this practice as a way of boosting congregations .
A long time ago , I found somewhere on the web this story from Terry Dobson , a master of Aikido and conflict resolution .
I saved the text , but not its address , and I was not able to rediscover it .
Anyway , I think this page gives the clearest possible definition of Aikido , and so I put it on my web .
My apologies if anyone is offended .
THE TRAIN CLANKED and rattled through the suburbs of Tokyo on a drowsy spring afternoon .
Our car was comparatively empty - a few housewives with their kids in tow , some old folks going shopping .
I gazed absently at the drab houses and dusty hedgerows .
At one station the doors opened , and suddenly the afternoon quiet was shattered by a man bellowing violent , incomprehensible curses .
The man staggered into our car .
He wore laborers clothing , and he was big , drunk , and dirty .
Screaming , he swung at a woman holding a baby .
The blow sent her spinning into the laps of an elderly couple .
It was a miracle that the was unharmed .
Terrified , the couple jumped up and scrambled toward the other end of the car .
The laborer aimed a kick at the retreating back of the old woman but missed as she scuttled to safety .
This so enraged the drunk that he grabbed the metal pole in the center of the car and tried to wrench it out of its stanchion .
I could see that on of his hands was cut and bleeding .
The train lurched ahead , the passengers frozen with fear .
I stood up .
I was young then , some 20 years ago , and in pretty good shape .
Id been putting in a solid eight hours of Aikido training nearly every day for the past three years .
I like to throw and grapple .
I thought I was tough .
Trouble was , my martial skill was untested in actual combat .
As students of Aikido , we were not allowed to fight .
" Aikido , " my teacher had said again and again , " is the art of reconciliation .
Whoever has the mind to fight has broken his connection with the universe .
If you try to dominate people , you are already defeated .
We study how to resolve conflict , not how to start it . "
I listened to his words .
I tried hard I even went so far as to cross the street to avoid the chimpira , the pinball punks who lounged around the train stations .
My forbearance exalted me .
I felt both tough and holy .
In my heart , however , I wanted an absolutely legitimate opportunity whereby I might save the innocent by destroying the guilty .
This is it !
I said to myself , getting to my feet .
People are in danger and if I dont do something fast , they will probably get hurt .
Seeing me stand up , the drunk recognized a chance to focus his rage .
" Aha ! "
He roared .
" A foreigner !
You need a lesson in Japanese manners ! "
I held on lightly to the commuter strap overhead and gave him a slow look of disgust and dismissal .
I planned to take this turkey apart , but he had to make the first move .
I wanted him mad , so I pursed my lips and blew him an insolent kiss .
" All right !
He hollered .
" You re gonna get a lesson . "
He gathered himself for a rush at me .
A split second before he could move , someone shouted " Hey ! "
It was earsplitting .
I remember the strangely joyous , lilting quality of it - as though you and a friend had been searching diligently for something , and he suddenly stumbled upon it .
" Hey ! " I wheeled to my left ; the drunk spun to his right .
We both stared down at a little old Japanese .
He must have been well into his seventies , this tiny gentleman , sitting there immaculate in his kimono .
He took no notice of me , but beamed delightedly at the laborer , as though he had a most important , most welcome secret to share .
" Cmere , " the old man said in an easy vernacular , beckoning to the drunk .
" Cmere and talk with me . "
He waved his hand lightly .
The big man followed , as if on a string .
He planted his feet belligerently in front of the old gentleman , and roared above the clacking wheels , " Why the hell should I talk to you ? "
The drunk now had his back to me .
If his elbow moved so much as a millimeter , Id drop him in his socks .
The old man continued to beam at the laborer .
" What cha been drinkin ? " he asked , his eyes sparkling with interest .
" I been drinkin sake , " the laborer bellowed back , " and its none of your business ! "
Flecks of spittle spattered the old man .
" Ok , that s wonderful , " the old man said , " absolutely wonderful !
You see , I love sake too .
Every night , me and my wife ( shes 76 , you know ) , we warm up a little bottle of sake and take it out into the garden , and we sit on an old wooden bench .
We watch the sun go down , and we look to see how our persimmon tree is doing .
My great - grandfather planted that tree , and we worry about whether it will recover from those ice storms we had last winter .
Our tree had done better than I expected , though especially when you consider the poor quality of the soil .
It is gratifying to watch when we take our sake and go out to enjoy the evening - even when it rains ! "
He looked up at the laborer , eyes twinkling .
As he struggled to follow the old mans conversation , the drunks face began to soften .
His fists slowly unclenched .
" Yeah , " he said .
" I love persimmons too " His voice trailed off .
" Yes , " said the old man , smiling , " and I m sure you have a wonderful wife . "
" No , " replied the laborer .
" My wife died . "
Very gently , swaying with the motion of the train , the big man began to sob .
" I dont got no wife , I dont got no home , I dont got no job .
I am so ashamed of myself . "
Tears rolled down his cheeks ; a spasm of despair rippled through his body .
Now it was my turn .
Standing there in well - scrubbed youthful innocence , my make - this - world - safe - for - democracy righteousness , I suddenly felt dirtier than he was .
Then the train arrived at my stop .
As the doors opened , I heard the old man cluck sympathetically .
" My , my , " he said , " that is a difficult predicament , indeed .
Sit down here and tell me about it . "
I turned my head for one last look .
The laborer was sprawled on the seat , his head in the old mans lap .
The old man was softly stroking the filthy , matted hair .
As the train pulled away , I sat down on a bench .
What I had wanted to do with muscle had been accomplished with kind words .
I had just seen Aikido tried in combat , and the essence of it was love .
I would have to practice the art with an entirely different spirit .
It would be a long time before I could speak about the resolution of conflict .

Ten - dollar AI
The other day Will Wright , the genius behind Sim City and the Sims , handed me this tennis ball - size orb and said , “ It knows what you are thinking . ”
Most of the time it will guess what you have in mind after asking you twenty yes / no questions .
It is eerily smart , and slightly addictive .
I see it as an educational toy .
Burned into its 8 - bit chip is a neural net that has been learning for 17 years .
Inventor Robin Burgener programmed a simple neural net on a DOS machine 1988 .
He taught it 20 questions about a cat .
He than passed the program around to friends on a floppy and had them challenge the neural net with their yes / no answers to the object they had in mind .
The neural net learns only when it plays a game ; no data is added except for the yes / no answers of visitors .
So the more people who test it , the more they teach it .
In 1995 Burgener put the now robust neural net onto the new web where anyone could play it ( that is , train it ) 24 hours a day .
And they did .
Burgener ’s genius was to turn the hard tedious work of training a neural net into a fun game for humans .
Last year , after 1 million rounds of 20 questions online , the neural net had accumulated 10 million synaptic associations .
It has a 73 % success rate of guessing what you thought .
Burgener then compressed the 20Q code to run on a chip , and had the neural net select 2,000 of the most popular 10,000 objects it then knew about .
He then had the neural net select out the most useful 250,000 synaptic connections related to those 2,000 objects , and hard wired that learning into the chip in the orb .
In other words , this sphere is a handheld version of Burgener ’s Twenty Questions web site .
( Because it knows about fewer objects than the web version , it gets confused less often , so its success rate is ironically higher . )
The toy is remarkable .
Because it is so small , so autonomous , its intelligence is shocking to the unprepared .
Most children can’t stump it , and if you stick to objects it will stump smart adults about 80 % of the time with 20 questions and most of the time with an additional 5 questions .
I love to watch people ’s reactions when they think of a “ hard ” thing , and after a seemingly irrational set of questions you are convinced are dumb , the sly ball tells you what you had in mind .
( For instance , it can correctly guess “ flying squirrel ” without asking “ does it fly ? ” )
People who play chess machines wo n’t be surprised , but just about everyone else is tickled .
It feels like the future .
While the 20Q orb does n’t learn , the web neural net continues to learn and grow .
It has now played 16 million games of 20 questions , and is racking up 2 million additional games every month .
I asked Robin Burgener if it was still getting smarter .
“ It is learning , but it is not increasing its success rate .
What happens is that it is learning to play more kinds of people , people who do n’t speak English easily , or who have never played 20 questions , or who come from different cultures , and to understand more difficult kinds of things . ”
Has he given this intelligence a name ?
“ No , but it sure does have a personality .
Some days it does well , and some days , it ’s just off . ”
Right now , 20Q is being ported over to Apple servers to keep up with the traffic , and it is being trained in new languages : French , Spanish , Chinese , Italian to start with ( it will become separate neural nets for each language ) .
In the future , there may be medical versions of 20 questions to help emergency triage , or other expert uses .
But right now , for ten bucks , you can get an amazing little artificial intelligence , about as smart as an insect — but an insect which specializes in guessing what object you are thinking of .
And in that part of the brain , it ’s smarter than you are .

Once introduced into a home , bedbugs can crawl into adjoining apartments or hitch a ride to another part of town in the cuff of a pant leg .
" Anyone who stays in a hotel , rich or poor , can bring them home in a suitcase , " said Richard Kourbage , whose company , Kingsway Exterminating in Brooklyn , does about a dozen bedbug jobs a day .
" Some of the best hotels in New York have them . "
Unlike mice and roaches , which are abetted by filthy surroundings , bedbugs do just fine in a well - scrubbed home , although bedroom clutter gives them more places to hide and breed .
When engorged with blood , they grow slightly plumper than the O on this page , although the nymphs , which appear almost translucent before their first meal , are not much bigger than the period at the end of this sentence .
And they do n't dwell just in mattresses and box springs : any wall or floor crack the thickness of a playing card can accommodate a bedbug .
Although some people try to treat the problem themselves , most hire exterminators , at $ 300 per room .
The modern bedbug is immune to hardware - store - variety insecticides , and setting off a cockroach bomb in the bedroom will only scatter them farther afield .
And because they are active only at night , many people do n't discover them until their population has grown into the hundreds , or even thousands .
Exterminators recommend bagging and washing every bit of clothing and fabric in the room and taking apart bureau drawers and bed frames in preparation for the application of four kinds of chemicals .
The process often needs to be repeated .
Worst of all , bedbug sufferers say , is the stigma of living with an insect that feeds on blood -- though it does not transmit disease -- and leaves behind a trail of red bumps that many dermatologists mistakenly identify as hives or scabies .

At first you may feel nervous , sad , and restless .
Try to relax and understand that doing nothing does not mean that you 're being unproductive or irresponsible .
Keep in mind that you are doing this in order to clear your mind and ultimately extend your life so that you will have even more time .
In the end , setting time aside to recharge your batteries will make you more productive , creative , and more able to concentrate in the long run , and that 's very good for work , school , or other areas of your life .

" But when are you going to get to the economics ? "
It was the end of my first day volunteering to teach " basic economics " to a group of fifth graders .
The teacher looked bemused as she asked the question .
" That 's what I 'm doing , " I whispered a little curtly in reply .
Realizing her offense , she quickly explained her meaning : " You know , with all the graphs and big words and stuff . "
I realized this teacher was under the common misperception ( perpetuated by most economics professors ) that economics is about math , models , and strange lands where a complete lack of real competition is called " perfect competition " and it is possible to visualize ( and measure ) human happiness using " utility curves . "
But I had no intention of subjecting these students to economics of this sort .
My goal was far more ambitious .
I wanted to show them that economics stems from ordinary human behavior in the real world we face every day .
So here is what we did .
My approach was painfully modest .
I simply introduced the students to one economic concept per week .
Lesson 1 : " Trade "
The first week 's " word for the day " was trade .
To illustrate trade , I gave each student a very small , inexpensive gift I had purchased at a Dollar General nearby .
I distributed the gifts randomly , then told the students they could trade their gifts ( if they wanted to ) with their immediate neighbors .
Some did .
Then I opened the class up to unrestricted trade and said they could trade with anyone in the whole classroom .
Many more now traded .
When they were finished I asked how many of them had traded because they believed by trading they would be better off .
All said they had .
Once they settled down again , we talked about the concept of trade in general .
I was impressed with how well they already understood this concept ; they seemed to clearly understand that exchange involves giving up something you value less for something you value more and finding someone else with opposite valuations .
For good measure , I ended the day by snatching away the gifts of two students and forcing a trade where none had been performed .
One student was happy with the exchange , the other unhappy .
This allowed us to discuss the idea of a " fair " trade — which I defined as a trade where both parties voluntarily take part .
Again , I was impressed with how easily they seemed to grasp this idea as I replaced the items I had snatched away for my " forced " trade . [ 1 ]
Lesson 2 : " Money "
The second week our economic concept was money — something all of the students had a keen awareness — if only a shadowy understanding — of .
To illustrate the nature of money I wrote a short play and gave the students different roles .
( There was no shortage of volunteers . )
The play was the story , familiar to students of Austrian School economics , of a long - ago egg farmer who had plenty of eggs but desired shoes .
Unfortunately , the shoemaker in his town did not like eggs , but often wanted wheat .
Fortunately , there was a wheat farmer nearby who wanted eggs and was willing to exchange wheat for eggs , which he did .
This gave the egg farmer a supply of wheat that he did not wish to consume but rather to employ as a " medium of exchange " to allow him to obtain shoes .
In other words , he used wheat as a form of money .
Of course the play was embellished with some ( attempted ) humor and silly characters , but the story was basically quite simple and the students seemed to understand its meaning well .
We then talked about what makes some goods better suited as money than others .
For instance , wheat is better than eggs or fish because it lasts longer and is more easily divisible into units of equal quality .
We then discussed things even better suited as money , such as gold or silver .
That was as far as we got , but by the end of the hour , I was at least satisfied that my students had a basic understanding of the nature and origin of " money " — something I was fairly certain none of them had heard before nor perhaps would hear again . [ 2 ]
Lesson 3 : " Savings "
On the third week of my class the economic concept of the day was savings .
In this day 's activity we divided the class into two " villages " — one made up of people who " live for the day " ( believing with Keynes that , in the long run , we 're all dead ) and the other village made up of savers .
Every day the kids in both villages went fishing with their bare hands and caught two fish each .
In the first village each person would eat both fish at a big party and feast .
In the second village , each student just ate one fish and put the second in a small pond located in their village .
Soon an intelligent villager came up with the idea for a net to help catch fish .
The trouble was the net would take a lot of time and effort to make .
Since several days were required , only the kids in the savers ' village had the resources available to abandon daily fishing to devote time to making a net .
Once they had a net , fewer " savers " were required to catch fish , freeing up other villagers to make bows and arrows , huts , and so on .
The " quality of life " in the savers ' village seemed to take off geometrically while life in the other village remained the same .
Interestingly , while at first many students had said they would prefer living in the " party " village , by the end of the class , most said they would prefer living in the savers village .
We ended the class period talking about the role of savings in allowing people to do things aimed at improving their lives : pursuits that also require time , such as attending school or changing jobs .
Lesson 4 : " Competition "
During the fourth week 's class the word for the day was competition and we played a game I call the " gas station game . "
Several students play the role of commuters and , at first , one student plays the role of a filling station owner .
In the first round of the game , the commuters travel from one side of the classroom to the other , but they require gasoline to make the full trip .
I allow the gas station owner to buy a supply of gasoline and then sell it at whatever price he wishes .
The commuters are free to car pool if they want , but must otherwise purchase some gasoline .
During round one , the station owner sold her gasoline for $ 2 per gallon , giving her a healthy profit of $ 1 per gallon sold .
In round two , I allowed a volunteer from the class to open a second gas station and charge whatever price he wanted .
This was repeated a third time until three competing stations were jockeying for the commuters ' dollars and gasoline was selling for an average of $ 1 per gallon ( one student was selling at a loss ) .
When the game was over we talked about what happened to the price of gasoline when competition occurred and even discussed how things would have been different if the " rules of the game " had prevented new competitors from coming along .
Lesson 5 : " Price "
At our final meeting , we talked a little about career choices .
I had the kids take a career - interest test and then discuss jobs they might want to some day have .
We then changed gears completely and discussed the economic concept of price .
To illustrate " prices " we held an auction .
Again I brought small gifts to the class and gave the kids pretend money ( in exchange for points they earned from the previous weeks ' activities ) .
Some kids had a lot of money ; others had less .
Still , each item was auctioned off to the highest bidder .
Items that had several bidders sold for higher prices than items with few bidders — establishing a role for " demand , " and when only one or two units of a particularly appealing item , such as chewing gum , remained , its price had a tendency to sky - rocket , showing that the physical quantity of a good matters in light of the human demand imposed on that quantity .
After this exhilarating exercise we discussed how what we had just learned about prices for goods might apply to salaries for the different careers they had discussed at the beginning of the hour .
We found that the same rules that established prices for the goods in the auction would also establish salaries or wages for different careers .
Demand for a labor service — acting on the available supply of people who can perform that service — will set the " wage " for that service .
Thus supply and demand , we found , could explain both the price of goods and the price of the human factors supplying those goods .
Conclusion
My goal with these fifth graders was not just to introduce them to the basics of economic science , but to inoculate them against future attempts to teach them bad economics .
By showing them that trade , money , savings , competition , and prices all have distinctly human origins and purposes , I hoped to help them make better sense out of the " economics " they will some day be exposed to .
Indeed , the concepts we discussed can easily be shown to relate quite directly to other economic concepts ; for instance , trade is related to opportunity cost as well as profit and loss ; money facilitates trade as well as economic calculation , savings is tied to investment , capital , and production , while competition and prices are related to demand , supply , and relative scarcity .
The constant animating force behind all human action , and the creativity it unleashes , cannot be captured in predictive models or in mathematical formulas .
It is precisely this fact that precludes employing the methods of the natural sciences to solve problems of human action . [ 3 ]
The fifth - grade teacher may have struggled with this understanding of economic science , but fortunately , her students had no trouble with it .
Notes
[ 1 ] According to some economists , we could have determined the appropriateness of this " trade " by subtracting the unhappy student 's loss of utility from the happy student 's increase in utility .
If we reached a positive number , the forced trade should have been allowed to stand .
[ 2 ] Mainstream economics treats money as a " store of value " and a thing whose quantity can be manipulated by monetary authorities in order to maintain " appropriate " interest rates , full employment , consumer confidence , etc .

Lawrence Lessig on Copyright
Lawrence Lessig is Professor of Law at Stanford Law School , the author of Free Culture , a monthly columnist at Wired since 2003 , blogger , and father of the Creative Commons movement .
He says for him there ’s “ too much travel , too much email , not enough time for reading or writing , ” but he found some time to answer my questions by email .
( Feel free to share . )
I got a feeling the world of copyright is in a big mess today .
What do you think is the single biggest problem ?
The problem is fear .
The copyright industry fears the internet , and they are exercising their ( considerable ) power to achieve control .
That effort is creating huge problems for a wholly creative and productive use of digital technology .
Current laws aside , what forms of copying / republishing / making derivative works do you think are clearly immoral or harmful to society – and which do you think are moral ?
I think , with important exceptions , breaking the law is immoral , even if the law itself should be changed .
So I think the law governing copyright should change , but I do n’t support p2 p file sharing under the current state of the law .
Can you give some of the “ important exceptions " ?
When you ’re willing to suffer the penalties as an act of civil disobedience .
Is DRM always evil ?
I do n’t think technology should enforce copyright , so I would always prefer no DRM to DRM .
But if there is DRM , it must permit fair us , and it must give authors the right to opt out of technological control .
Why should n’t technology enforce copyright ?
Because copyright was designed with a human enforcer in mind .
How does the human enforcer claim his copyright ?
Is n’t that tedious to do , hunting down copyright breakers when technology can do it automated ?
It is difficult .
But repressing speech should n’t be easy .
Do you think bloggers should have better tools to defend against splogs , automated spam blogs ?
Or do you too think here the human enforcer must do some work and hunt them down , and then contact the blog providers ?
Yes , and no .
I think there needs to be legislation and a bounty system to make it enforceable .
How would a DRM look like that would allow people to make “ fair use ” of the work ?
It would allow them to turn the DRM off , and use the work under an assertion that the use was fair .
Is it legal for me to break DRM ( e.g. with a software tool I download ) for “ fair use ” purposes ?
Not according to the DMCA , but it should be .
In your book Free Culture you ’re detailing the legal system in the US ( and its faults ) .
How much more complicated is the copyright law on a global perspective ?
Which laws apply in digital publishing anyway – is it the home - country of the server which is being published on ?
Copyright law is insanely complicated , everywhere .
And the law that US law thinks applies is the place where the activity occurs .
So if I download in the US work protected by US law but in the public domain in the country where the server is , the download is still a violation .
The Digital Millennium Copyright
Act , from what I understand , allows people to make hosting services , search engines and so on take down copyright - infringing material .
However I ’ve also heard that some hosting services take down content upon only the receipt of such a note – without verifying the claim .
Can you confirm this ?
When a site gets a notice and takedown , it can remove the material .
But if the person whose material has been removed challenges the removal , then the site must determine whether the takedown was justified .
So with DMCA take - downs , the material can be removed before the creator is asked ?
Yes , but the creator has a right to demand it be put up , and then the site must decide .
What do you think is the ideal term for works to stay copyrighted , and at what renewal rate ?
Are n’t the 50 years you talk about in Free Culture too long already ?
Certainly , but we need first steps to reasonableness .
What do you think of DVD country codes that do n’t allow me to play DVDs I ordered in the US on a typical German DVD player ( or PC ) ?
They are a clumsy tool of price discrimination , which can be good as well as bad .
I know many of the problems with region codes , but can you give an example of where society benefits from them ( or possibly , companies ) , as you mentioned ?
If they mean that the price can be lower in poorer regions , then it is good .
Where do you see Creative Commons now in terms of where you want it to be ?
CC is my child .
One is never settled about the life of one ’s child .
Many Creative Commons licenses allow non-commercial only republication , but I ’m often unsure where “ commercial ” starts .
For example , what if I have ads next to your Creative Commons - licensed book on my server to be able to cover my server costs ?
( And what if one day those ads make more money than just that ? )
It is an important problem .
We ’re in the process of clarifying , but it is a hard problem to clarify .
Who are your biggest enemies in the copyright war , and have you ever been threatened ?
There are no enemies , just people who do n’t yet understand .
And yes , I have been threatened , but by an ally , not an enemy .
Who was the ally that threatened you ?
He was the person I was intentionally vague in describing .
What was your biggest single achievement in the copyright wars ?
I ’ve not achieved anything significant .
If sharing is better for the music industry and its artists , why are n’t the RIAA simply allowing it more freely ... out of egoism ?
What is good for artists is not necessarily good for record companies .
I ’m playing devil ’s advocate here : why does creativity always mean to copy something ?
Ca n’t I be creative by being completely original ?
I ’d like to see you try .
Do you think a more fair copyright law will emerge and how do you think people can help the cause ?
Not yet , but if people pushed for it , yes .
What do you think of software patents ?
Government regulation of the creative process that does more harm than good .
What could be done to prevent rich people to threaten poor people others with ( copyright infringement ) law - suits ?
Aggressive judges who pushing abusers .
When you go shopping in Shanghai and other Chinese cities , there are lots of public shops which sell cheap , seemingly mass - manufactured copycat DVDs of Hollywood movies ( often these movies are just released to US cinemas ) .
If you take a guess why do you think the Chinese authorities do n’t fight this more strongly ?
And do you think it ’s a big problem for Hollywood ?
It hurts , not much , and certainly does n’t benefit the Chinese .
What is the purpose of a trademark ?
And why does Marvel seem to get away with putting a “ ™ ” after the word “ super heroes " ?
Trademarks are designed to avoid confusion – so you do n’t believe you ’re getting something from X when you are in fact getting something from Y .
But I do n’t underatand Marvel ’s claims .
Are you more of an Apple or Windows man ?
I use a Mac .
Are there any new books currently in the making next to the Wiki- revised edition of “ Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace “ ?
There are three – all secret .

There 's no denying her stamina .
Less than 48 hours after painfully giving birth to a " New Middle East " , Condoleezza Rice flew by helicopter into Beirut .
At least , I think she did .
" There 's no official confirmation that she 's coming , " a Lebanese government spokeswoman told me shortly after the BBC , CNN and just about everyone else had reported her arrival .
" If she comes , there will be no press conference . "
In fact , the only visible evidence that a Very Important Foreigner was in town came from the Lebanese army which , for the first time since this war began , showed its face on the streets of Beirut in significant numbers , with soldiers standing nonchalantly in ones and twos on corners .
Having failed to catch a glimpse of Ms Rice , I headed off to the UN building , where Jan Egeland , the emergency relief coordinator , was due to announce an appeal for $ 150 m ( £ 81 m ) to alleviate the suffering caused by Israeli bombs .
It was a sunny afternoon and I decided to walk there .
From the relative normality of Hamra district , I made my way downtown to what is supposedly the business and financial hub of Lebanon .
It was closed .
The streets radiating from the normally throbbing Place de l'Etoile were eerily silent and utterly deserted apart from a soldier here and there and an occasional private security guard lounging in the shade .
With the whole place to myself , I began to wonder if there was something everyone else knew that I did n't .
It resembled that scene in cowboy films where everyone has rushed inside and bolted their door before the gunfight .
I half - expected John Wayne to swagger into view at one end of the street and Clint Eastwood at the other , twiddling revolvers around their index fingers .
But perhaps this was n't a western after all - just my first glimpse of Ms Rice 's New Middle East , where security is all and human beings figure nowhere .
And so into Riad el - Solh Square and the UN building , strolling leisurely across a road where normally you have to run for your life .
The UN building is where the Nice People hang out : Swedes , Danes , liberal - minded Arabs - that sort of folk .
Nice , well meaning , but sadly ineffective most of the time .
But even the Nice People have got the security bug now .
You used to be able to wander in , announce yourself at the reception desk and talk to officials .
In the New Middle East , though , you enter - one at a time - through a revolving cage , and they do n't let the next person in until they 've checked the previous one thoroughly .
Explaining the planned relief effort yesterday , Mr Egeland did not repeat his remark from Sunday about Israeli " violations of humanitarian law " , but the description of civilian damage in an accompanying report made the picture very clear .
His calls for " safe passage " of essential supplies also underlined the humiliating position that the UN - and most of the world , for that matter - finds itself in : begging for Israel 's permission to feed 300,000 Lebanese civilians who have been cut off by the bombing and to help half - a- million more who have been driven from their homes or affected by the onslaught in other ways .
This relief effort , of course , is short - term stuff .
The initial $ 150 m UN programme is scheduled to last for only three months .
After that there may well be a need for more .
When the war eventually ends , there will be other questions about what the UN ought to be doing - American vetoes permitting .
The most recent parallel that I can think of in the Middle East , in terms of an attack on the civilians of a largely defenceless country , is Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .
On that occasion , Iraq was ostracised , international sanctions were imposed and there were moves to indict the Ba'athist leaders .
I do n't suppose it will happen in this case , though the thought of Ehud Olmert , the Israel prime minister , sharing a cell with Hassan Nasrallah , the Hizbullah leader , for several years during their trial at The Hague is quite appealing .
The attack on Kuwait also led to the creation of the UN Compensation Commission to deal with millions of financial claims resulting from war damage .
In Iraq 's case , the money was recouped by taking control of its oil exports and making deductions from the revenue .
If there were any justice , the same would happen now - but I can't see Israel being made to pay up , let alone Hizbullah .
Aside from whatever may lie in store for Lebanon politically , it is hard to imagine that the rest of the Middle East will be unchanged by all this .
Washington 's problem , as always , is that it fails to make the necessary distinction between regimes and their people .
It does make the distinction with regimes it dislikes ( such as Iran , where it blindly hopes the mullahs will be overthrown at any moment ) , but not with the regimes it likes .
And so we have the spectacle of the Egyptian and Saudi regimes hobnobbing with Washington and being broadly supportive , while their people are not .
The Egyptian and Saudi regimes have their own reasons for wanting to clamp down on Hizbullah - partly to discourage armed militants at home , and partly because they are Sunni regimes and do n't much like the Shia anyway .
Meanwhile , as a reward for their cooperation , and despite public statements to the contrary , Washington seems perfectly willing to take the heat off these regimes in terms of pressing for reform and democracy .
In a way , Condoleezza is right .
We may indeed be witnessing the birth pangs of a New Middle East , but not the one she imagines .
It is a Middle East in which the US , Israel and the " friendly " but moribund Arab regimes are becoming ever more discredited , leaving the populace at large ever more radicalised and disaffected .
The study looked at monetary exchanges
Exposure to an oxytocin " potion " led people to be more trusting , tests by University of Zurich researchers found .
They report in the journal Nature that the finding could help people with conditions such as autism , where relating to others can be a problem .
But one expert warned it could be misused by politicians who want to persuade more people to back them .
Some may worry about the prospect that political operators will generously spray the crowd with oxytocin at rallies of their candidates
Dr Antonio Damasio , University of Iowa College of Medicine
It also acts on other brain regions whose function is associated with emotional and social behaviours , such as the amygdala .
And animal studies have shown oxytocin is linked to bonding between males and females and mother - infant bonding .
Reaping rewards
The Swiss and American team of researchers suspected the same effect may occur in humans and invited 58 people to take part in a " trust test " .
The participants in the study played a game , in which they were split into " investors " and " trustees " .
The investors were then given credits and told they could choose whether to hand over zero , four , eight or 12 credits to their assigned trustee .
If the investor showed trust , the total amount which could be distributed between the two increased , but the trustee initially reaped all the reward .
It was then up to them to decide if they would honour the investor 's trust by sharing the profit equally - or if they would keep the lot .
At the end of the game , the credits were translated into real money , meaning both participants had a selfish financial incentive .
Investors and trustees were either given oxytocin via a nasal spray , or a dummy , or placebo , version .
Of 29 investors who were given oxytocin , 13 ( 45 % ) displayed " maximal trust " by choosing to invest highly , compared with six ( 21 % ) of the 29 investors who were given the dummy spray .
Oxytocin did not change the behaviour of trustees .
In addition , when trustees were replaced by a computer , the oxytocin effect was no longer seen on the investors .
Possible ' abuses '
The researchers , led by Dr Ernest Fehr , say this suggests the chemical promotes social interaction , rather than simply encouraging people to take risks .
And they say it appears to over - ride obstacles such as the fear of being betrayed .
Writing in Nature , the team says : " Oxytoxin does not increase the general inclination to behave prosaically .
Rather , oxytocin specifically affects the trusting behaviour of investors . "
They suggest this is because people in the position of " investors " have to take the first step .
The scientists say their findings could potentially be used to help people with conditions such as social phobia and autism which can be linked to persistent fear and avoiding social situations .
" Our results might lead to fertile research on the role of oxytocin in several mental health disorders with major public health significance . "
In the same journal , Dr Antonio Damasio of the Department of Neurology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine , US , said some might fear the findings could be used by those trying to gain people 's trust .
" Some may worry about the prospect that political operators will generously spray the crowd with oxytocin at rallies of their candidates .
" The scenario may be rather too close to reality for comfort , but those with such fears should note that current marketing techniques - for political and other products - may well exert their effects through the natural release of molecules such as oxytocin in response to well - crafted stimuli .
" Civic alarm at such abuses should have started long before this study . "
Like a lot of the best fresh starts , this one 's a total psych - out ; also , like most of the best ones , you wo n't believe how well it works until you actually try it for yourself .
Open your email program and create a new folder called " DMZ " Go to your email inbox and Select All You might alternatively choose all email older than n days
Drag those emails from your inbox into the DMZ folder Go , and sin no more .
Is this the email equivalent of covering your ears and singing loudly ?
Not really .
You still need to deal with all the emails in your DMZ folder ( personally I 'd recommended " archiving " anything older than 21 days ) , but , most importantly , you 're drawing a line in the sand .
You 're saying " Okay , starting this minute I quit letting ' being behind ' stop me from making good decisions now and going forward . "
Hence the " fresh start . "
Get it ?
Tomorrow morning you arrive to a spanking fresh inbox and the chance to start anew .
Of course , using your fresh start to develop an actual new habit is entirely optional , but it 's certainly more reachable than ever now , right ?
Right .
Basically , this works at accomplishing the one thing you need more than anything else right now : to stop digging .
Think about it : how much stuff in your life has gotten unmanageable simply because you decided at some point that you were too behind to ever make a difference ?
More than anything you need a way to recover these projects from the brink -- to find the handle that lets you stop making it worse and start seeing a way back toward daylight .
After an on - again , off - again review process that finally culminated with full State Department approval last year , the US government has finally issued its first passports containing RFID chips .
The embedded chips in the new passports -- which are being issued to a group of diplomats as part of a pilot program -- contain the same information that 's in the printed document , including a photo of the passport holder .
Government officials have said that the use of the RFID chip allows passports to be scanned and cross-referenced with security databases more easily , while privacy advocates have argued they 'll make it easier for identity thieves and terrorists to extract information -- especially after a security firm successfully demonstrated that they were able to crack the encryption used on prototype Dutch RFID passports .
Despite such concerns , the new passports are scheduled to be rolled out nationally in October .
There are two kinds of distraction , at least .
I 'm getting so much spam .
Hundreds of messages a day trying to seduce me by appealing to my darkest lusts and my greed .
So I 've gone back to basics .
I stopped using my fancy word processor and installed WordPerfect for DOS , which was last updated about a decade ago , and which lets me type in gray letters on a blue screen without using any windows and without the need of a mouse .
It never crashes .
I also bought a little device called an AlphaSmart Neo , which is mostly sold to schools .
The Neo is just a keyboard that stores text as you type it .
It does nothing else .
It does n't tell the time or let me play games .
It runs off of double - A batteries and the batteries last for hundreds of hours .
Using the AlphaSmart and WordPerfect I 've started to enjoy computing again .
There is no Wikipedia , no email , no constantly changing the MP3s I 'm listening to , no downloading going on .
The spam still piles up but I 'm not aware of it , because my email program is shut down until I want to send a message .
Right now there 's a new buzzword out there : Web 2.0 .
No one is quite sure what it means but the basic idea is that by some clever programming you can bring forward some of the latent abilities of a web browser you can make applications that are more dynamic and more interactive than regular web pages .
Pages that update dynamically and reward interaction .
Google is the pioneer here , with its clickable Google Maps and zippy Google Mail .
Being the geek that I am I have looked closely at the blog posts and articles about Web 2.0 and I understand what 's going on , the new paradigms .
I enjoy seeing all of the creativity going into these new dynamic
To - do lists and calendars and forums .
But I do n't feel much like participating .
I 'm still programming at work , doing my job , but the rose has lost its bloom .
I can't convince myself to stay up nights reading programming manuals .
It 's not because I 'm nostalgic for the old days of Web 1.0 .
They came and went and it was fun to be part of something so exciting as the early blossoming of the Internet , when everything seemed possible and young people could become rich just by willing it .
But more and more I want my computer to do less and less .
I do n't want more information , more feeds , more sources .
When I write , when I think , the Internet is just too much for me to fathom .
It 's a wonderful tool for research , a good way to kill a few hours .
I grew up with computers , started hacking away when I was twelve .
I always thought that the Internet would make me more productive , more aware of the world around me but instead I 'm using technology that was laughable in 1995 and getting much more done .
I feel more in command of my own mind , more reliant on my own thoughts , when I work in this stripped - down fashion .
I figure there are two different kinds of distractions : the wide kind and the narrow kind .
The Internet is the widest possible distraction because it lets you wander so far afield that getting work done if you are , like me , the distractable sort of person -- getting work done is almost impossible .
I 'm not the sort of person who can read a book with footnotes and ignore the footnotes .
I have to read every footnote .
I often prefer the footnotes because they point in so many directions .
But when wide distractions are available I avoid the narrow distractions , and those are the useful distractions .
Let 's say you 're thinking hard about a concept -- say , kittens .
Kittens are young cats .
They have paws and they are sometimes friendly .
Your stepmother , you remember , did n't let you have a kitten .
Why was that ?
Was she allergic , or did she really just hate you ?
Now , that 's something worth thinking about .
A concept worth exploring .
That 's a narrow distraction , a good distraction .
But with a wide distraction you think about kittens and all of a sudden your email pops up and you 're thinking about Viagra , and about how horrible the world is and how it 's filled with rapacious greedy spammers .
You 're not able to think about kittens any more so you check out the news to find out that China has a manned space program .
Click .
And that peak oil is a real problem and we might be living in an age where electricity becomes prohibitively expensive .
Click .
And that Apple just released a new iPod again , and everyone is all aflutter .
There 's really no way to bring all of that back to kittens .
You 've been broadly distracted .
You might as well play some solitaire and go to bed .
Distraction is necessary .
Minds need to wander to get anything done .
But the Internet is sort of the mental equivalent of the snack aisle at a convenience store , filled with satisfying fatty chips and tasty cream - filled cakes .
God knows I 've spent enough time with both the Internet and cream - filled cakes to see the similarities .
And I now know that what I want , mentally , is a well - cooked meal .
A book gives me that , a well - written , carefully - edited book .
Even though your average book is filled with distractions -- I mean , Ahab does n't just chase the whale .
There 's all sorts of stuff in Moby Dick besides that .
Otherwise it probably would n't be that good of a book .
But the distractions are useful .
They get us from one point to another .
Sailing wide seas of opinion in a million does not do the same thing .
This is not to condemn blogs .
They are often great .
But there are so many of them , and I will be dead for a long , long time .
And on my deathbed do I want to say , I sipped mightily of Metafilter , and saw many video clips that made fun of Rosie O'Donnell , and I am richer for it ?
Or should I try to make contact with the culture that existed before 1992 ?
The Internet makes it so easy to think that nothing of importance ever took place before the ARPANET was created .
It is a wonder of the world , the Web .
I have facts at hand by the thousands about everything from the different kinds of government to the names of the stars of television shows I 've never even seen .
I 'm smarter , then , with my computer on , but not much deeper .
I worry that my knowledge of the world is actually growing shallower , in fact , because for every idea there are a dozen articles and Wikipedia entries to read that allow me to avoid thinking for myself .
And it 's not like any of that is going away , nor will I be staying away from it .
Just putting it aside for a few hours a day so that I can think without the world humming in my ear , sitting in front of my blue screen with gray text , or stretched in bed with my little portable keyboard , a working setup so bland it 's actually inspiring .
Das Fritz - Walter - Stadion aus Lego
" on the right for more pics .
Details include absolute gems like a functioning floodlight , one Lego person being used for every fan , the late Honorary Captain Fritz Walter 's seat remaining empty even in the sold - out Lego stadium just as in the real stadium , little speakers that play the songs sung by fans at the Betzenberg ... this is probably the greatest Lego stadium ever constructed .
Of course , the city paid for it as a prestige object .
The whole thing used about a million Lego parts and weighs a ton , with no word on the cost .
The German intelligence officials responsible for one of the most important informants on Saddam Hussein ’s suspected weapons of mass destruction say that the Bush administration and the CIA repeatedly exaggerated his claims during the run-up to the war in Iraq .
Five senior officials from Germany ’s Federal Intelligence Service , or BND , said in interviews with The Times that they warned U.S. intelligence authorities that the source , an Iraqi defector code - named Curveball , never claimed to produce germ weapons and never saw anyone else do so .
According to the Germans , President Bush mischaracterized Curveball ’s information when he warned before the war that Iraq had at least seven mobile factories brewing biological poisons .
Then - Secretary of State Colin L. Powell also misstated Curveball ’s accounts in his prewar presentation to the United Nations on Feb. 5 , 2003 , the Germans said .
Curveball ’s German handlers for the last six years said his information was often vague , mostly secondhand and impossible to confirm .
“ This was not substantial evidence , ” said a senior German intelligence official .
“ We made clear we could not verify the things he said . ”
The German authorities , speaking about the case for the first time , also said that their informant suffered from emotional and mental problems .
“ He is not a stable , psychologically stable guy , ” said a BND official who supervised the case .
“ He is not a completely normal person , ” agreed a BND analyst .
Curveball was the chief source of inaccurate prewar U.S. accusations that Baghdad had biological weapons , a commission appointed by Bush reported this year .
The commission did not interview Curveball , who still insists his story was true , or the German officials who handled his case .
The German account emerges as the White House is lashing out at domestic critics , particularly Senate Democrats , over allegations the administration manipulated intelligence to go to war .
Last week , Vice President Dick Cheney called such claims reprehensible and pernicious .
In Congress , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is resuming its long - stalled investigation of the administration ’s use of prewar intelligence .
Committee members said last week that the Curveball case would be a key part of their review .
House Democrats are calling for a similar inquiry .
An investigation by The Times based on interviews since May with about 30 current and former intelligence officials in the U.S. , Germany , England , Iraq and the United Nations , as well as other experts , shows that U.S. bungling in the Curveball case was worse than official reports have disclosed .
The White House , for example , ignored evidence gathered by United Nations weapons inspectors shortly before the war that disproved Curveball ’s account .
Bush and his aides issued increasingly dire warnings about Iraq ’s biological weapons before the war even though intelligence from Curveball had not changed in two years .
At the Central Intelligence Agency , officials embraced Curveball ’s account even though they could not confirm it or interview him until a year after the invasion .
They ignored multiple warnings about his reliability before the war , punished in - house critics who provided proof that he had lied and refused to admit error until May 2004 , 14 months after the invasion .
After the CIA vouched for Curveball ’s accounts , Bush declared in his 2003 State of the Union speech that Iraq had “ mobile biological weapons labs ” designed to produce “ germ warfare agents . ”
Bush cited the mobile germ factories in at least four prewar speeches and statements , and other world leaders repeated the charge .
Powell also highlighted Curveball ’s “ eyewitness ” account when he warned the United Nations Security Council on the eve of war that Iraq ’s mobile labs could brew enough weapons - grade microbes “ in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people . ”
The senior BND officer who supervised Curveball ’s case said he was aghast when he watched Powell misstate Curveball ’s claims as a justification for war .
“ We were shocked , ” the official said .
“ Mein Gott !
We had always told them it was not proven ....
It was not hard intelligence . ”
In a telephone interview , Powell said that George J. Tenet , then the director of central intelligence , and his top deputies personally assured him before his U.N. speech that U.S. intelligence on the mobile labs was “ solid . ”
Since then , Powell said , the case “ has totally blown up in our faces . ”
Many officials interviewed for this report , including the German intelligence officers , spoke on the condition they not be identified because they were bound by secrecy agreements , were not authorized to speak to the news media or because the case involved classified sources and methods .
Curveball lives under an assumed name in southern Germany .
The BND has given him a furnished apartment , language lessons and a stipend generous enough that he does not need to work .
His wife has emigrated from Iraq , and they have an infant daughter .
The BND has relocated him twice because of concerns that his life was in danger .
They still watch him closely .
“ He is difficult to integrate ” into local society , said a BND operations officer .
“ We are still busy with him . ”
Curveball could not be interviewed for this report .
BND officials threatened last summer to strip him of his salary , housing and protection if he agreed to meet with The Times .
“ We told him , ‘ If you talk to anyone on the outside ... you are out and you get no more help from us , ’ ” the BND supervisor said .
CIA officials now concede that the Iraqi fused fact , research he gleaned on the Internet and what his former co-workers called “ water cooler gossip ” into a nightmarish fantasy that played on U.S. fears after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Curveball ’s motive , CIA officials said , was not to start a war .
He simply was seeking a German visa .
German journey
The Curveball chronicle began in November 1999 , when the dark - haired Iraqi in his late 20s flew into Munich ’s Franz Josef Strauss Airport with a tourist visa .
The Baghdad - born chemical engineer promptly applied for political asylum in Arabic and halting English .
He told German immigration officials he had embezzled Iraqi government money and faced prison or worse if sent home .
The Germans sent him to Zirndorf , a refugee center near Nuremberg once used for Soviet defectors , where he joined a long line of Iraqi exiles seeking German visas .
Abruptly , his story changed .
He once led a team , he told BND officers , that equipped trucks to brew deadly bio-agents .
He named six sites where Iraq might be hiding biological warfare vehicles .
Three already were operating .
A farm program to boost crop yields was cover for Iraq ’s new biological weapons production program , he said .
Germany provided Europe ’s most generous benefits to Iraqi refugees , and several hundred arrived each month .
But few had useful credible intelligence on Baghdad ’s suspected weapons programs .
Intelligence agents became accustomed to exaggerated claims .
“ The Iraqis were adept at feeding us what we wanted to hear , ” said a former official of the Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency who helped debrief about 50 Iraqi emigres in Germany before the war .
“ Most of it was garbage . ’'
But for this defector , the Germans assigned two case officers as well as a team of chemists , biologists and other experts .
They debriefed him from January 2000 to September 2001 .
Since the Iraqi had arrived in Munich , U.S. liaison with German intelligence was assigned to the local DIA team .
Their clandestine operating base was an elegant 19th century mansion known as Munich House .
There he was assigned his codename : Curveball .
The base cryptonym “ ball ” was used to signify weapons , two former U.S. intelligence officials said .
An earlier informant in Germany , for example , was called Matchball .
In DIA files , Iraqi sources were listed as “ red ” if U.S. intelligence could interview them .
Curveball was a “ blue ” source , meaning the Germans would not permit U.S. access to him .
Curveball said he hated Americans , the Germans explained .
As a result , the DIA -- like the BND -- never tried to check Curveball ’s background or verify his accounts before sending reports to other U.S. intelligence agencies .
Despite that failure , CIA analysts accepted the incoming reports as credible and quickly passed them to senior policymakers .
The reports had problems , however .
The Germans usually interviewed Curveball in Arabic , using a translator , although the Iraqi sometimes spoke English .
“ But a case officer wants to speak directly to his source , ” said the senior BND officer .
“ Curveball began to learn German , and thus there was a big mix [ of languages ] that went on .
This explains some of the confusion . ”
It got worse , like a children ’s game of “ telephone , ” in which information gets increasingly distorted .
The BND sent German summaries of their English and Arabic interview reports to Munich House and to British intelligence .
The DIA team translated the German back to English and prepared its own summaries .
Those went to DIA ’s directorate for human intelligence , at a high - rise office in Clarendon , Va .
Clarendon passed 95 DIA reports to the Weapons Intelligence , Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center , known as WINPAC , at CIA headquarters in nearby Langley .
Experts there called other specialists , including an independent laboratory , to help evaluate the data .
Spy satellites were directed to focus on Curveball ’s sites .
CIA artists prepared detailed drawings from Curveball ’s crude sketches .
The system led to confusion , not clarity .
“ Analysts were studying drawings made by artists working from descriptions by a guy we could n’t talk to , ” explained a former senior CIA official who helped supervise the case and the postwar investigation .
“ It was hard to figure out . ”
“ Our fear is that as it was analyzed and translated and reanalyzed and retranslated , and comments got added , it could have gotten sexed up by accident , ” agreed a former CIA operations official .
The British Secret Intelligence Service , known as MI6 , blamed the BND for omitting what a Parliamentary inquiry called “ significant detail ” in the reports they sent to London .
At issue were Curveball ’s trucks .
In an e-mail to The Times , Robin Butler , head of the British inquiry into prewar intelligence , said “ incomplete reporting ” by the BND misled the British to assume the trucks could produce weapons - grade bio-agents such as anthrax spores .
But Curveball only spoke of producing a liquid slurry unsuitable for bombs or warheads .
At the CIA , bio - warfare experts viewed the defector ’s reports as sophisticated and technically feasible .
They also matched the analysts ’ expectations .
After the 1991 Gulf War , U.N. inspectors struggled to unravel Baghdad ’s secret biological weapons program .
They speculated that the regime produced germs in mobile factories to evade detection .
American U - 2 spy planes looked for suspicious vehicles , and U.N. teams raided parking lots .
In 1994 , acting on tips from Israeli intelligence , U.N. inspectors even stopped red-and - white trucks in Baghdad marked : “ Tip Top Ice Cream . ”
Inside they found ice cream .
“ We thought they could easily transport other materials around , ” said Rolf Ekeus , who headed the U.N. inspectors from 1991 to 1997 .
Finally , in mid-1995 , Iraq officials admitted that before the Gulf War they had secretly produced 30,000 liters of anthrax , botulinum toxin , aflatoxin and other lethal bio-agents .
They had deployed hundreds of germ - filled munitions and researched other deadly diseases for military use .
They denied they ever had mobile production facilities .
Curveball ’s story to the Germans in 2000 and 2001 neatly dovetailed with that history and continuing CIA suspicions .
The Iraqi defector said he was recruited out of engineering school at Baghdad University in 1994 by Iraq ’s Military Industrial Commission , headed by Saddam Hussein ’s son - in - law Hussein Kamil .
He said he went to work the following year for “ Dr. Germ , ” British - trained microbiologist Rihab Rashid Taha , to build bio - warfare vehicles .
Kamil and Taha had headed the pre-1991 bio-weapons program .
Curveball said he was assigned to the Chemical Engineering and Design Center , behind the Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad .
That also fit a pattern , as the center provided a cover story for Iraq ’s first bio - warfare program .
Curveball said he had helped assemble one truck - mounted germ factory in 1997 at Djerf al Nadaf , a tumble - down cluster of warehouses in a gritty industrial area 10 miles southeast of Baghdad .
He helped the Germans build a scale model of the facility , showing how vehicles were hidden in a two - story building -- and how they entered and exited on either end .
He designed laboratory equipment for the trucks , he said , providing dimensions , temperature ranges and other details .
He sketched diagrams of how the system operated , and identified more than a dozen co-workers .
But the story had holes .
“ His information to us was very vague , ” said the senior German intelligence official .
“ He could not say if these things functioned , if they worked . ”
Curveball also said he could not identify what microbes the trucks were designed to produce .
“ He did n’t know ... whether it was anthrax or not , ” said the BND supervisor .
“ He had nothing to do with actual production of [ a biological ] agent .
He was in the equipment testing phase .
And the equipment worked . ”
David Kay , who read the Curveball file when he headed the CIA ’s search for hidden weapons in 2003 , said Curveball ’s accounts were maddeningly murky .
“ He was not in charge of trucks or production , ” Kay said .
“ He had nothing to do with actual production of biological agent .
He never saw them actually produce [ an ] agent . ”
But the CIA and the White House overlooked the holes in the story .
In a February 2003 radio address and statement , Bush warned that “ first - hand witnesses have informed us that Iraq has at least seven mobile factories ” for germ warfare .
With these , Bush said , “ Iraq could produce within just months hundreds of pounds of biological poisons . ”
Curveball had told the Germans that Taha ’s team planned to build mobile factories at six sites across Iraq , from Numaniyah in the south to Tikrit in the north .
But he visited only Djerf al Nadaf , he said .
His information about the other sites , he told the Germans , was second - hand .
Flawed witness
Curveball ’s reports were highly valued in Washington because the CIA had no Iraqi spies with access to weapons programs at the time .
One detail particularly impressed the CIA : Curveball ’s report of a 1998 germ weapons accident at Djerf al Nadaf .
Powell cited the incident in his prewar U.N. speech .
An “ eyewitness ” was “ at the site ” when an accident occurred , and 12 technicians “ died from exposure to biological agents , ” Powell said .
Lawrence B. Wilkerson , then Powell ’s chief of staff , said senior CIA officials told Powell the “ principal source had not only worked in mobile labs but had seen an accident and had been injured in the accident ....
This gave more credibility to it . ”
But German intelligence officials said the CIA was wrong .
Curveball only “ heard rumors of an accident , ” the BND supervisor said .
“ He gave a third - hand account . ”
The incident led to the first questions inside the CIA about Curveball ’s credibility .
In May 2000 , the Germans allowed a doctor from the CIA ’s counter - proliferation branch to meet Curveball and draw a blood sample .
Antibodies in the blood could indicate if he had been exposed to anthrax or other unusual pathogens in the accident .
The medical tests were inconclusive , but the meeting was memorable .
The BND , insisting Curveball spoke no English and would not meet Americans , introduced the doctor as a German .
The CIA physician remained silent , because he was not fluent in German .
He was surprised , he later told others , that Curveball spoke “ excellent English ” to others in the room .
Moreover , Curveball was “ very emotional , very excitable , ” the doctor told one colleague .
And although it was early morning , Curveball smelled of liquor and looked “ very sick ” from a stiff hangover .
German intelligence officials said Curveball did n’t have a drinking problem .
But they had other concerns .
Like many defectors , Curveball at first seemed eager to please .
He thanked his new friends and laughed at their jokes .
He was charming and clearly intelligent , providing complex engineering details .
But as the questions intensified , Curveball grew moody and irritable .
His memory began to fail .
He confused places and dates .
He fretted about his personal safety , about his parents and wife in Baghdad , and about his future in Germany .
“ He was between two worlds , sometimes cooperative , sometimes aggressive , ” said the BND supervisor .
“ He was not an easy - going guy . ”
Curveball largely ceased cooperating in 2001 after he was granted asylum , officials said .
He would refuse to meet for days , and then weeks , at a time .
He also increasingly asked for money .
“ He knew he was important , ” said the BND analyst .
“ He was not an idiot . ”
Defectors are often problem sources .
Viewed as traitors back home , many embellish their stories to gain favor with spy services .
In the shadow world of intelligence , Curveball ’s inability or reluctance to provide many details actually helped convince analysts he was telling the truth .
Had Curveball claimed expertise with biological weapons or direct access to other secret programs , said the BND analyst , “ It would be easier to assume he was lying . ”
A former British official involved with the case said Curveball ’s behavior should be seen through another lens .
He is convinced that Curveball was under intense stress , terrified both that his visa scam would be exposed , and that his lies would be used to start a war .
“ He must have been scared out of his mind , ” he said .
But concerns about Curveball ’s reliability were growing .
In early 2001 , the CIA ’s Berlin station chief sent a message to headquarters noting that a BND official had complained that the Iraqi was “ out of control , ” and could n’t be located , Senate investigators found .
MI6 cabled the CIA that British intelligence “ is not convinced that Curveball is a wholly reliable source ” and that “ elements of [ his ] behavior strike us as typical of ... fabricators , ’' the presidential commission reported .
British intelligence also warned that spy satellite images taken in 1997 when Curveball claimed to be working at Djerf al Nadaf conflicted with his descriptions .
The photos showed a wall around most of the main warehouse , clearly blocking trucks from getting in or out .
U.S. and German officials feared that Ahmad Chalabi had coached Curveball after the defector said his brother had worked as a bodyguard for the controversial Iraqi exile leader .
But they found no evidence .
Curveball “ had very little contact with his [ bodyguard ] brother , ” the BND supervisor said .
“ They are not close . ’'
More problematic were the three sources the CIA said had corroborated Curveball ’s story .
Two had ties to Chalabi .
All three turned out to be frauds .
The most important , a former major in the Iraqi intelligence service , was deemed a liar by the CIA and DIA .
In May 2002 , a fabricator warning was posted in U.S. intelligence databases .
Powell said he was never warned , during three days of intense briefings at CIA headquarters before his U.N. speech , that he was using material that both the DIA and CIA had determined was false .
“ As you can imagine , I was not pleased , ” Powell said .
“ What really made me not pleased was they had put out a burn notice on this guy , and people who were even present at my briefings knew it . ”
But BND officials said their U.S. colleagues repeatedly assured them Curveball ’s story had been corroborated .
“ They kept on telling us there were three or four sources , ” said the senior German intelligence official .
“ They said it many times . ”
Behind the scenes , the CIA stepped up pressure to interview Curveball .
The BND finally accepted a compromise in the fall of 2002 .
They let CIA analysts send questions , but they could not interview the Iraqi .
The frustration was intense at the CIA .
But it was n’t surprising .
Relations long have been rocky between the CIA and BND , officials in both spy services acknowledged .
The friction dates to the Cold War , when the BND complained it was treated as a second - class agency .
Spy services jealously guard their sources , and the BND was not obligated to share access to Curveball .
“ We would never let them see one of ours , ” said the former CIA operations officer .
Intelligence shift
Despite the lack of access or any new reports from Curveball , U.S. intelligence sharply upgraded its assessments of Iraq ’s biological weapons before the war .
The shift is reflected in declassified portions of National Intelligence Estimates , which are produced as the authoritative judgment of the 15 U.S. intelligence agencies .
In May 1999 , before Curveball defected , a national intelligence estimate on worldwide biological warfare programs said Iraq was “ probably continuing work to develop and produce BW [ bio - warfare ] agents , ” and could restart production in six months .
In December 2000 , after a year of Curveball ’s reports , another national intelligence estimate cautiously noted that “ new intelligence ” had caused U.S. intelligence “ to adjust our assessment upward ” and “ suggests Baghdad has expanded ’’ its bio-weapons program .
But the caveats disappeared after the Sept. 11 attacks and the still - unsolved mailing of anthrax - laced letters to several U.S. states .
Iraq “ continues to produce at least ... three BW agents ” and its mobile germ factories provide “ capabilities surpassing the pre-Gulf War era , ” the CIA weapons center warned in October 2001 .
The CIA followed up with a public White Paper and briefings for the White House and three Senate committees .
The CIA had n’t seen new intelligence on Iraq ’s germ weapons .
Instead , analysts had estimated what they believed would be the maximum output from seven mobile labs -- only one of which Curveball said he had seen -- operating nonstop or six months .
But even Curveball ’s description of a single lab was a fiction .
Similar misjudgments filled the most important prewar intelligence document , the National Intelligence Estimate issued in October 2002 .
It was sent to Congress days before lawmakers voted to authorize use of military force if Hussein refused to give up his illicit arsenal .
For the first time , the new estimate warned with “ high confidence ” that Iraq “ has now established large - scale , redundant and concealed BW agent production capabilities . ”
It said “ all key aspects ” of Iraq ’s offensive BW program “ are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War . ”
The assessment was based “ largely on information from a single source -- Curveball , ” the presidential commission concluded .
It was one of “ the most important and alarming ” judgments in the document , the panel added .
And it was utterly wrong .
A handful of bio-analysts in the weapons center , part of the CIA ’s intelligence directorate , controlled the Curveball reports and remained confident in their veracity .
But across the CIA bureaucracy , the clandestine service officers who usually handle defectors and other human sources were increasingly skeptical .
Tyler Drumheller , then the head of CIA spying in Europe , called the BND station chief at the German embassy in Washington in September 2002 seeking access to Curveball .
Drumheller and the station chief met for lunch at the German ’s favorite seafood restaurant in upscale Georgetown .
The German officer warned that Curveball had suffered a mental breakdown and was “ crazy , ” the now - retired CIA veteran recalled .
“ He said , first off , ‘ They wo n’t let you see him , ’ ” Drumheller said .
“ ‘ Second , there are a lot of problems .
Principally , we think he ’s probably a fabricator . ’ ”
The BND station chief , contacted by The Times during the summer , said he could not “ discuss any of this . ”
He has since been reassigned back to Germany .
His BND supervisors declined to discuss the lunch meeting .
Drumheller , a veteran of 26 years in the CIA clandestine service , said he and several aides repeatedly raised alarms after the lunch in tense exchanges with CIA analysts working on the Curveball case .
“ The fact is , there was a lot of yelling and screaming about this guy , ” said James Pavitt , then chief of clandestine services , who retired from the CIA in August 2004 .
“ My people were saying , ‘ We think he ’s a stinker . ’ ”
The analysts refused to back down .
In one meeting , the chief analyst fiercely defended Curveball ’s account , saying she had confirmed on the Internet many of the details he cited .
“ Exactly , it ’s on the Internet ! ” the operations group chief for Germany , now a CIA station chief in Europe , exploded in response .
“ That ’s where he got it too , ” according to a participant at the meeting .
Other warnings poured in .
The CIA Berlin station chief wrote that the BND had “ not been able to verify ” Curveball ’s claims .
The CIA doctor who met Curveball wrote to his supervisor shortly before Powell ’s speech questioning “ the validity ” of the Iraqi ’s information .
“ Keep in mind that this war is going to happen regardless of what Curve Ball said or did n’t say and the Powers That Be probably are n’t terribly interested in whether Curve Ball knows what he ’s talking about , ” his supervisor wrote back , Senate investigators found .
The supervisor later told them he was only voicing his opinion that war appeared inevitable .
Tenet has denied receiving warnings that Curveball might be a fabricator .
He declined to be interviewed for this report .
Powell said that at the time he prepared for his U.N. speech in early 2003 , no one warned him of the debate inside the CIA over Curveball ’s credibility .
“ I was being as careful as I possibly could , ” he said .
Working from a CIA conference room adjoining CIA Director Tenet ’s seventh - floor office suite , Powell and his aides repeatedly challenged the credibility of CIA evidence -- including the mobile germ factories .
“ We pressed as hard as we could , and the CIA stood by it adamantly , ” Powell recalled .
“ This is one we really pressed on , really spent a lot time on ....
We knew how important it was . ”
No smoking gun
On Feb. 5 , 2003 , Powell told the packed U.N. chamber that his account was based on “ solid sources ” and “ facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence . ”
“ We thought maybe they had the smoking gun , ” recalled the BND supervisor , who watched Powell on TV .
“ My gut feeling was the Americans must have so much from reconnaissance planes and satellites , from infiltrated spotter teams from Special Forces , and other systems .
We thought they must have tons of stuff . ”
Instead , Powell emphasized Curveball ’s “ eyewitness ” account , calling it “ one of the most worrisome things that emerge from the thick intelligence file . ”
A congressional staffer on intelligence said she realized the case was weak when she saw Powell display CIA drawings of trucks but not photos .
“ A drawing is n’t evidence , ” she said .
“ It ’s hearsay . ”
Powell ’s speech failed to sway many diplomats , but it had an immediate impact in Baghdad .
“ The Iraqis scoured the country for trailers , ” said a former CIA official who helped interrogate Iraqi officials and scientists in U.S. custody after the war .
“ They were in real panic mode .
They were terrified that this was real , and they could n’t explain it . ”
An explanation was available within days , but U.S. officials ignored it .
On Feb. 8 , three days after Powell ’s speech , the U.N. 's Team Bravo conducted the first search of Curveball ’s former work site .
The raid by the American - led biological weapons experts lasted 3 1/2 hours .
It was long enough to prove Curveball had lied .
Djerf al Nadaf was on a dusty road lined with auto repair shops and small factories , near the former Tuwaitha nuclear facility and a sewage - filled tributary of the Tigris River .
Behind a high wall , a two - story grain silo adjoined the warehouse that Curveball had identified as the truck assembly facility .
“ That ’s the one where the mobile labs were supposed to be , ” said a former U.N. inspector who worked with the U.S. and other intelligence agencies .
“ That ’s the one we were interested in . ”
The doors were locked , so Boston microbiologist Rocco Casagrande climbed on a white U.N. vehicle , yanked open a metal flap in the wall , and crawled inside .
After scrambling over a huge pile of corn , he scraped two samples of residue from cracks in the cement floor , two more from holes in the wall and one from a discarded shower basin outside .
Back at the Canal Hotel that afternoon , he tested the samples for bacterial or viral DNA .
He was searching for any signs that germs were produced at the site or any traces of the 1998 bio-weapons accident .
Test results were all negative .
“ No threat agents detected , ” Casagrande wrote in his computer journal that night .
“ Got to climb on a jeep and crawl into buildings and play second - story man , but otherwise spent the day in the lab . ”
A British inspector , who had helped bring the intelligence file from New York , found another surprise .
Curveball had said the germ trucks could enter the warehouse from either end .
But there were no garage doors and a solid , 6 - foot - high wall surrounded most of the building .
The wall British intelligence saw in 1997 satellite photos clearly made impossible the traffic patterns Curveball had described .
U.N. teams also raided the other sites Curveball had named .
They interrogated managers , seized documents and used ground - penetrating radar , according to U.N. reports .
The U.N. inspectors “ could find nothing to corroborate Curveball ’s reporting , ” the CIA ’s Iraq Survey Group reported last year .
On March 7 , 2003 , Hans Blix , the chief U.N. inspector , told the Security Council that a series of searches had found “ no evidence ” of mobile biological production facilities in Iraq .
It drew little notice at the time .
The invasion of Iraq began two weeks later .
Phantom labs
Soon after U.S. troops entered Baghdad , the discovery of two trucks loaded with lab equipment in northern Iraq brought cheers to the CIA weapons center .
Curveball examined photos relayed to Germany and said that while he had n’t worked on the two trucks , equipment in the pictures looked like components he had installed at Djerf al Nadaf .
Days later , the CIA and DIA rushed to publish a White Paper declaring the trucks part of Hussein ’s biological warfare program .
The report dismissed Iraq ’s explanation that the equipment generated hydrogen as a “ cover story . ”
A day later , Bush told a Polish TV reporter : “ We found the weapons of mass destruction . ”
But bio-weapons experts in the intelligence community were sharply critical .
A former senior official of the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research called the unclassified report an unprecedented “ rush to judgment . ”
The DIA then ordered a classified review of the evidence .
One of 15 analysts held to the initial finding that the trucks were built for germ warfare .
The sole believer was the CIA analyst who helped draft the original White Paper .
Hamish Killip , a former British army officer and biological weapons expert , flew to Baghdad in July 2003 as part of the Iraq Survey Group , the CIA - led Iraqi weapons hunt .
He inspected the truck trailers and was immediately skeptical .
“ The equipment was singularly inappropriate ” for biological weapons , he said .
“ We were in hysterics over this .
You ’d have better luck putting a couple of dust bins on the back of the truck and brewing it in there . ”
The trucks were built to generate hydrogen , not germs , he said .
But the CIA refused to back down .
In March 2004 , Killip quit , protesting that the CIA was covering up the truth .
Rod Barton , an Australian intelligence officer and another bio-weapons expert , also quit over what he said was the CIA ’s refusal to admit error .
“ Of course the trailers had nothing to do with Curveball , ” Barton wrote in a recent e-mail .
The Iraq Survey Group ultimately agreed .
An “ exhaustive investigation ” showed the trailers could not “ be part of any BW program , ” it reported in October 2004 .
The now - discredited CIA White Paper remains on the agency ’s website .
A CIA spokesman said the report was posted because it was part of the historical record .
After U.S troops failed to find illicit Iraqi weapons in the days and weeks after the invasion , the CIA created the Iraq Survey Group to conduct a methodical search in June 2003 .
Tenet appointed Kay to head it .
The pugnacious Texan was convinced that Baghdad had hidden mobile germ factories .
Kay ’s teams returned to Djerf al Nadaf and other sites identified by Curveball .
One CIA - led unit investigated Curveball himself .
The leader was “ Jerry , ” a veteran CIA bio-weapons analyst who had championed Curveball ’s case at the CIA weapons center .
They found Curveball ’s personnel file in an Iraqi government storeroom .
It was devastating .
Curveball was last in his engineering class , not first , as he had claimed .
He was a low - level trainee engineer , not a project chief or site manager , as the CIA had insisted .
Most important , records showed Curveball had been fired in 1995 , at the very time he said he had begun working on bio - warfare trucks .
A former CIA official said Curveball also apparently was jailed for a sex crime and then drove a Baghdad taxi .
Jerry and his team interviewed 60 of Curveball ’s family , friends and co-workers .
They all denied working on germ weapons trucks .
Curveball ’s former bosses at the engineering center said the CIA had fallen for “ water cooler gossip ” and “ corridor conversations . ”
“ The Iraqis were all laughing , ” recalled a former member of the survey group .
“ They were saying , ‘ This guy ?
You ’ve got to be kidding . ’ ”
Jerry tracked down Curveball ’s Sunni Muslim parents in a middle - class Baghdad neighborhood .
“ Our guy was very polite , ” Kay recalled .
“ He said , ‘ We understand your son does n’t like Americans . ’
His mother looked shocked .
She said , ‘ No , no !
He loves Americans . ’
And she took him into [ her son ’s ] bedroom and it was filled with posters of American rock stars .
It was like any other teenage room .
She said one of his goals was to go to America . ”
The deeper Jerry probed , the worse Curveball looked .
Childhood friends called him a “ great liar ” and a “ con artist . ”
Another called him “ a real operator . ”
The team reported that “ people kept saying what a rat Curveball was . ”
Jerry and another CIA analyst abruptly broke off the investigation and took a military flight back to Washington .
Kay said Jerry appeared to be nearing a nervous breakdown .
“ They had been true believers in Curveball , ” Kay said .
“ They absolutely believed in him .
They knew every detail in his file .
But it was total hokum .
There was no truth in it .
They said they had to go home to explain how all this was all so wrong .
They wanted to fight the battle at the CIA . ”
Back home , senior CIA officials resisted .
Jerry was “ read the riot act ” and accused of “ making waves ” by his office director , according to the presidential commission .
He and his colleague ultimately were transferred out of the weapons center .
The CIA was “ very , very vindictive , ” Kay said .
Soon after , Jerry got in touch with Michael Scheuer , a CIA analyst who felt he had been sidelined for criticizing CIA counterterrorism tactics .
Scheuer would quit within a year .
“ Jerry had become kind of a nonperson , ” Scheuer recalled of their meeting .
“ There was a tremendous amount of pressure on him not to say anything .
Just to sit there and shut up . ”
A CIA spokeswoman confirmed the account , but declined to comment further .
Jerry still works at the CIA and could not be contacted for this report .
His former supervisor , reached at home , said she could not speak to the media .
“ What was done to them was wrong , ” said a former Pentagon official who investigated the case for the presidential commission .
“ But we did n’t see it so much as a cover - up as an expression of how profoundly resistant to recognizing mistakes the CIA culture was . ”
Kay ’s findings
In December 2003 , Kay flew back to CIA headquarters .
He said he told Tenet that Curveball was a liar and he was convinced Iraq had no mobile labs or other illicit weapons .
CIA officials confirm their exchange .
Kay said he was assigned to a windowless office without a working telephone .
On Jan. 20 , 2004 , Bush lauded Kay and the Iraq Survey Group in his State of the Union Speech for finding “ weapons of mass destruction - related program activities ....
Had we failed to act , the dictator ’s weapons of mass destruction program would continue to this day . ”
Kay quit three days later and went public with his concerns .
In Germany , the BND finally agreed to let the CIA interview Curveball .
The CIA sent one of its best officers , fluent in German and gifted at working reluctant sources .
They met at BND headquarters in Pullach , a suburb of Munich , in mid-March 2004 -- one year after the Iraq invasion .
Alone with Curveball at last , the CIA officer steadily reviewed details and picked at contradictions like a prosecutor working a hostile witness .
He showed spy satellite images and other evidence from the sites Curveball had identified .
Each night , he would file an encrypted report to CIA headquarters on his computer , and then call Drumheller .
“ After the first couple of days , he said , ‘ This does n’t sound good , ’ ” Drumheller recalled .
“ After the first week , he said , ‘ This guy is lying .
He ’s lying about a bunch of stuff . ’ ”
But Curveball refused to admit deceit .
When challenged , he would mumble , say he did n’t know and suggest the questioner was wrong or the photo was doctored .
As the evidence piled up , he simply stopped talking .
“ He never said , ‘ You got me , ’ ” Drumheller said .
“ He just shrugged , and did n’t say anything .
It was all over .
We told our guy , ‘ You might as well wrap it up and come home . ’ ”
It took more than a month to track and recall every U.S. intelligence report -- at least 100 in all -- based on Curveball ’s misinformation .
In a blandly worded notice to its stations around the world , the CIA said in May 2004 :
“ Discrepancies surfaced regarding the information provided by ... Curveball in this stream of reporting , which indicate that he lost his claimed access in 1995 .
Our assessment , therefore , is that Curveball appears to be fabricating in this stream of reporting . ”
The CIA had advised Bush in the fall of 2003 of “ problems with the sourcing ” on biological weapons , an official familiar with the briefing said .
But the president has never withdrawn the statement in his 2003 State of the Union speech that Iraq produced “ germ warfare agents ” or his postwar assertions that “ we found the weapons of mass destruction . ”
U.S. , British and German intelligence officials still debate what Curveball really saw , and what he really did .
One possible answer was buried in records the Iraq Survey Group recovered at the engineering and design center in Baghdad .
They show that Iraqi officials considered installing seed handling gear on trucks in 1995 , but instead put the machinery in warehouses , like those at Djerf al Nadaf .
Perhaps Curveball heard about the modified trucks and spun them into a bio-weapons system for gullible intelligence agencies .
“ You ’re left at the end with uncertainty , ” said the former CIA official who helped supervise the Curveball case and the postwar investigation .
“ We know what he said .
We know we do n’t believe him .
But was he making it all up ?
Was he coached ?
Did he hear something and then embellish it ?
These things are still unresolved . ”
Not for Curveball .
“ He is convinced his story is true , ” said the BND analyst .
“ He has no doubts to this day . ”

Should anyone doubt that the Republicans have become the sworn enemies of the forces of supply and demand , as well as free enterprise , the following statements should change the minds of most skeptics :
Congressional GOP leaders on Monday formally called on President Bush to launch an investigation into possible price gouging by oil companies , as gas costs shot up nearly 25 cents a gallon in two weeks .
" Anyone who is trying to take advantage of this situation while American families are forced into making tough choices over whether to fill up their cars or severely cut back their budgets should be investigated and prosecuted , " House Speaker Dennis Hastert , R- Illinois , and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , R - Tennessee , wrote in a letter to President Bush .
" Therefore , we believe that Federal law enforcement agencies and regulators should take every available step to ensure that all Federal laws protecting American consumers from price - fixing , collusion , gouging and other anti-competitive practices are vigorously enforced . "
Once upon a time in that former country known as the Soviet Union , much of the law centered around the existence of what the government called " economic crimes " or " speculation " ( a code word for " free enterprise " ) .
Today , we see the top lawmakers in the United States trying to take a page out of the USSR in calling for prosecution — and , one would suppose , imprisonment — of oil company executives because gasoline prices have risen drastically at the pump .
Lest one think that Frist and Hastert are not serious , the following should remind all of us that they are serious about wanting to criminalize the latest episode of price increases :
" Anyone who is trying to unfairly profit by forcing American families to make tough choices over whether to fill the car up with gas or severely cut back on their budgets should be investigated and prosecuted , " said Ron Bonjean , spokesman for Hastert .
Unfortunately , we are seeing an annual affair , although the recent statements by the Congressional leaders have served to ratchet up the rhetoric — and possible consequences both for business leaders and for consumers .
Six years ago , when we had the first of what now are annual spring price spikes in gasoline prices , I pointed out that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were chiefly to blame for the problem .
Moreover , members of Congress , when one clears through the fog of false statements , intuitively know that they carry much of the blame .
Included in the Frist - Hastert threats was the following :
Hastert and Frist asked Bush to direct the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to investigate the rising oil prices and also will request that certain areas be exempt from having to use a more expensive but cleaner blend of gasoline .
( Emphasis mine )
If one wishes to hear an economic explanation of why we are seeing the sudden increases at the pump , such explanations are available , and , furthermore , they tend to make much more sense than the latest press release from the Frist - Hastert tag team or Sen.
Charles Schumer , who , like his Republican counterpart Arlen Specter , is calling for new anti-trust legislation and the destruction of present oil firms .
What we are seeing today is nothing less than the culmination of bad policies , beginning with the US foreign excursion in Iraq and environmental policies at home , complete with political favoritism being lavished upon the corn / ethanol lobby and culminating with more political favoritism , this time for the trial lawyers lobby .
Let us begin .
That the conflagration in the Middle East is affecting the price of crude oil is a no-brainer .
From the war in Iraq to the current tensions involving Iran , not to mention places like Nigeria and Venezuela , it is not surprising that oil traders are nervous and are bidding up the prices of futures contracts for oil delivery .
By affecting the supply of crude oil , it is hardly surprising that these real issues are being reflected at the pump by higher gasoline prices .
However , the situation with crude oil explains only part of the current puzzle , and that is where Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency are playing a key role .
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required gasoline refiners to include mixtures to ( allegedly ) enable gasoline to burn more cleanly during the warmer months .
In fact , beginning with the gasoline price spikes of April , 2000 , price increases at the pump have been an annual " rite " of spring , complete with statements of outrage from politicians who are convinced that all this is a nefarious plot by oil executives .
Not to be outdone , Congress mandated even more ethanol mixes in the " energy bill " it passed during the summer of 2005 , which has continued this economic madness .
Oil refiners have complied with congressional directives using either Methyl tert - butyl ether ( MTBE ) or ethanol .
( Furthermore , MTBE has been found to leach into water tables , creating taste and odor problems , making it less desirable as an additive because of the liability involved .
Congress has refused to grant oil refiners immunity from MTBE lawsuits , thus throwing a sop to the trial lawyers ' lobby .
Ethanol , on the other hand , cannot be moved via pipeline and , thus cannot be mixed into gasoline at the refinery , unlike MTBE . )
Both additives supposedly help fuels burn more cleanly ( that is , burn more completely , leaving less waste ) , but their effectiveness is questionable :
Oxygen helps gasoline burn more completely , reducing harmful tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles .
In more modern vehicles , the emissions reduction is negligible .
We need to read this carefully , because if Congress is claiming that oil executives are guilty of criminal fraud and conspiracy ( the favorite two sets of charges levied by federal prosecutors ) , then we know that Congress as a whole is a body of liars and maybe even criminals ( with a few exceptions , like Rep. Ron Paul of Texas ) .
Congress is requiring a set of expensive mixtures in gasoline in the name of environmental protection , yet researchers have found no proof that these mixtures provide that protection .
Furthermore , when the consequences of these foolish policies have affected consumers , instead of admitting to the damage they have done , members of Congress , as well as the Administration , point to business executives , declare them to be criminals , and threaten to imprison them .
This is the height of cynicism .
No , the purpose of this latest monstrosity from Congress ( dutifully signed by President George W. Bush , and then administered by the Environmental Protection Agency ) is to force motorists to pay more for fuel in order to increase the incomes of politically connected ethanol manufacturers , as well as corn farmers in the " red states " of the Midwest .
As the Wall Street Journal recently editorialized :
There 's been unconscionable behavior all right , most of it on Capitol Hill .
A decent portion of the latest run-up in gas prices — and the entire cause of recent spot shortages — is the direct result of the energy bill Congress passed last summer .
That self - serving legislation handed Congress 's friends in the ethanol lobby a mandate that forces drivers to use 7.5 billion gallons annually of that oxygenate by 2012 .
At the same time , Congress refused to provide liability protection to the makers of MTBE , a rival oxygenate getting hit with lawsuits .
So MTBE makers are leaving the market in a rush , while overstretched ethanol producers ( despite their promises ) are in no way equipped to compensate for the loss of MTBE in the fuel supply .
Ethanol is also difficult to ship and store outside of the Midwest , which is causing supply headaches and spot gas shortages along the East Coast and Texas .
These columns warned Republicans this would happen .
As recently as last year , ethanol was selling for $ 1.45 a gallon .
By December it had reached $ 2 and is now going for $ 2.77 .
So refiners are now having to buy both oil and ethanol at sky - high prices .
In short , the only market manipulation has been by politicians .
So , let us trace this sorry story to its most recent beginnings .
( 1 ) Congress requires new fuel mixtures during the warm weather months which are costly and disrupt available supplies , but those mixtures do not make the air any cleaner ; ( 2 ) The President and Congress decide to invade Iraq and now are making threats toward Iran , thus guaranteeing political instability and violence in the largest oil - producing region of the world ; ( 3 ) Congress requires even more ethanol mixtures , despite the fact that it disrupts supplies and ethanol manufacturers cannot meet the goals ; ( 4 ) gasoline prices spike , and members of Congress call for arrest and imprisonment of oil executives .
Something obviously is wrong with this picture .
Not surprisingly , almost all of the anger from consumers — if editorial cartoons are an indication of the direction of the rage — is pointed toward oil companies and their executives .
On the other hand , members of Congress , which created this current crisis , are calling for the near - destruction of oil companies , imprisonment of executives , as well as a whole new set of taxes that would further reduce available fuel supplies — all in the name , of course , of lowering gasoline prices .
We can not put these things into the category of bad policies made by well - meaning people .
Instead , we are seeing the attempted destruction of one of the most vital industries in our country to be carried out by incompetent , venal tyrants who have no intention of telling the truth — and we have a cynical media acting as the mouthpiece .
There is a way out of this mess — reinstitute free markets in gasoline and oil — but Congress and the President of the United States , not to mention those who are politically connected , have no intention of permitting the markets to work .
Here in Bangalore , a city of 6.5 million known for its booming high - technology industry , pleasant climate and good private schools , local health managers commonly pay bribes to senior bureaucrats or elected officials to get good jobs , say investigators , civic leaders and senior civil servants .
The health professionals then exact payments from subordinates and patients , emulating their bosses .
" Most of the district health officers have to pay bribes to get promotions and postings , and they in turn collect bribes from their staff and patients , " said Hanumappa Sudarshan , the vigilance director for health and education in Karnataka State 's anticorruption agency .
" It 's a vicious cycle . "
Mr. Sudarshan 's boss , Nanjegowda Venkatachala , a retired Indian Supreme Court justice who heads the agency , put it even more bluntly : " The greed of politicians is ruining the country .
There 's nothing to mince in this regard . "
No matter where the corruption starts , it moves down through the ranks and finally to the poor , for whom it is an inescapable burden .
Though Bangalore has made progress in fighting corruption , it persists in the hospitals .
In the narrow lanes of the slums and working - class neighborhoods around the 30 - bed Austin Town maternity hospital , families with babies and toddlers described their personal experiences of bribery .
Shobha Rani , the doctor in charge , emphatically disputed such accounts in an interview earlier this year .
" I 've not come across even one patient who 's come here and said I 've been charged for anything , " she said .
" So many times , I 've spoken to patients without the knowledge of my staff .
I say : ' Tell me the truth .
What did you face ? '
They always give me a good report . "
But people who have used the hospital tell a different story .
Nagaratna Hanumanthu , 23 , and her husband , Hanumanthu , 28 , a sugar - cane - juice vendor with a single name , lost their first baby to a raging fever just two days after he was born .
Their anxieties were high last November when their daughter was born at Austin Town .
CEV vs. Apollo Notable differences between new CEV and Apollo moon capsule By Dawn Stover
Popular Science
When CEV returns to Earth , it will most likely land on dry ground .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) Popular Science or or Create Your Own ( Popsci.com ) --
When NASA administrator Michael Griffin unveiled the agency 's plans for the Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) , he described it as " Apollo on steroids . "
The resemblance is easy to see -- each is a blunt - nosed , cone - shaped capsule that 's strapped to a rocket and sent to the moon , where it deploys a lunar lander and then returns to Earth for a parachute landing .
There are important differences , however : Size :
The four - person CEV will be 18 feet in diameter , compared with 12.8 feet for the cramped three - person Apollo capsule .
Yet CEV will be only 10 to 15 percent heavier , because it will be made from newer materials such as carbon composites and aluminum alloys .
Launch : Apollo was launched by the massive Saturn V , the biggest rocket ever built ; the CEV capsule will be launched by a smaller rocket .
That 's because the CEV will not go directly to the moon .
Instead the crew will meet up with heavier pieces of their moon - going spaceship -- launched by a separate rocket -- in Earth orbit .
Range : CEV will carry more fuel than Apollo , so astronauts will be able to go anywhere on the face of the moon .
Apollo had only enough fuel to land on the lunar equator .
Controls : CEV 's computers will be much more powerful than Apollo's , enabling all four astronauts to descend to the moon 's surface while their spaceship orbits in autopilot mode .
Landing : When CEV returns to Earth , it will most likely land on dry ground .
Apollo capsules landed in the ocean , which exposed them to corrosive saltwater and required expensive recovery efforts involving boats and aircraft .

When I discovered Playboy in Braille years ago , it was in a box in an abandoned building .
I found myself in a state of disbelief .
The kind you feel when you ’re being chased by a leprechaun with a crossbow .
It ’s normal to not want Playboy in Braille to exist .
Because it ’s weird .
It raises too many questions .
Questions like :
Why is the government printing Playboy in Braille ?
And :
How do you explain a naked woman to a pubescent , visually impaired teen ?
“ Elka leans against a wall , wearing only a carpenter ’s tool belt .
She ’s hot .
Believe me . ”
“ Katsumi arches unnaturally over a coffee table .
You can see the whole thing . ”
“ Anja ’s Mediterranean skin is a warm brown , like the craft paper Playboy you ’re reading with your finger . ”
Playboy in Braille makes you think .
It ’s exciting but uncomfortable at the same time .
Like Courtney
Love fixing your stove .
Run your fingers over the pages , never really knowing if you ’re touching a gorgeous blonde or an essay by Tom Clancy .
Was that Cindy Crawford ’s bum , or an interview with Gore Vidal ?
Frankly , it ’s whatever you want it to be .
That ’s the glory of Playboy in Braille .
November 1995 .
Volume XLII , No. 11 .
It ’s number 2 in a 4 part series .
I do n’t know where the other parts are , but you ’d only miss them if you could read Braille .
And you can ’t , because you ’re reading this .
This would be a terrible gift for the visually impaired , because you do n’t give the visually impaired one quarter of a decade - old Playboy as a gift .
But for you ?
Put it out on the coffee table like I did .
Owning Playboy in Braille is like having a Day - Glo orange monkey that can curse in Farsi .
It gets attention .
People talk .
You want Playboy in Braille .
Playboy in Braille wants you .
At least that ’s what I think it says .
[ In a fit of irony , eBay removed the listing , citing it as being for “ Mature Audiences . ” ]

Discovery 's homecoming has been delayed yet again
The orbiter is riding piggyback on a modified jumbo jet , more than a week after it landed in the Mojave desert .
The pair arrived in Louisana on Friday for an overnight stop , but bad weather has delayed departure until Sunday .
The 3,591 km ( 2,232 mile ) trip is expected to cost the US space agency a hefty $ 1 m ( £ 560,000 ) .
Discovery and its seven member crew touched down on 9 August at the Edwards Air Force Base after a 14 - day mission to service the International Space Station .
Nasa diverted the landing to California after poor weather prevented the shuttle from returning to Florida .
After landing , Discovery underwent maintenance and crews worked around the clock to prepare the shuttle for departure by purging it of hazardous substances and removing fuel from the on - board tanks .
Technicians attached an aluminium tail cone to the shuttle to reduce drag during the flight , and coupled Discovery to the 747 jet just hours before takeoff .
Uncertain homecoming
Discovery 's homecoming has been tempered by uncertainties about the future of the shuttle programme .
DISCOVERY FLIGHT TIMELINE 26 July : Lift - off 30 July : First spacewalk to check repair techniques 1 August : Second spacewalk to fix faulty gear 3 August : Makeshift repairs completed 9 August : Touch - down
In pictures : Ride home
The fleet was grounded after a large piece of foam was shed from Discovery 's external fuel tank during lift - off on 26 July .
A similar problem caused the shuttle Columbia to break up on re-entry to the atmosphere in 2003 , killing all seven astronauts on board .
" From an overall standpoint we think really 4 March is the time frame we are looking at , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , Nasa 's new head of space operations and the official overseeing the foam fix .
" The teams are making very good progress .
But we are still not complete by any stretch of the imagination . "
Nasa chief Michael Griffin told journalists in Washington that there had been complacency in the past but that there was now a new culture at Nasa .
Technicians attached an aluminium tail cone to the shuttle to reduce drag
Space shuttle Atlantis had been due to blast off in September .
But Nasa engineers will now have to make modifications to the shuttle 's external fuel tank , particularly to an area known as the Protuberance Air Load ( Pal ) ramp .
Minority report
Seven members of an oversight panel said Nasa had not learned key lessons from the Columbia disaster .
Their " minority report " was contained within the final report by the 26 - member Return to Flight task group appointed to evaluate how the US space agency meets the recommendations by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( Caib ) .
So much emphasis was placed on trying to meet unrealistic launch dates that some safety improvements were skipped , said the seven members .
" We expected that Nasa leadership would set high standards for post - Columbia work ... we were , overall , disappointed , " the panellists wrote in the report .
The seven critics included a former shuttle astronaut , former undersecretary of the Navy , a former congressional budget office director , former moon rocket engineer , a retired nuclear engineer and two university professors .
Dr Griffin said he was " changing the game " on thinking regarding the shuttle 's usage by Nasa ahead of its September 2010 retirement .
It was originally calculated that about 28 further shuttle flights would be needed to complete the International Space Station .
That prediction was later reduced to about 15 .
Now , Dr Griffin said , Nasa was " not trying to get a specific number of flights out of the shuttle system " .
He added : " The United States has a commitment to its partners to complete the station .
We believe that , absent of major problems , we ... can essentially complete assembly of the station with the shuttle fleet in the time that we have remaining . "

The Electoral College is an antidemocratic relic .
Everyone who remembers 2000 knows that it can lead to the election of the candidate who loses the popular vote as president .
But the Electoral College 's other serious flaws are perhaps even more debilitating for a democracy .
It focuses presidential elections on just a handful of battleground states , and pushes the rest of the nation 's voters to the sidelines .
There is an innovative new proposal for states to take the lead in undoing the Electoral College .
Legislatures across the country should get behind it .
Both parties should have reason to fear the college 's perverse effects .
In 2000 , the Democrats lost out .
But in 2004 , a shift of 60,000 votes in Ohio would have elected John Kerry , even though he lost the national popular vote decisively .
Just as serious is the way the Electoral College distorts presidential campaigns .
Candidates have no incentive to campaign in , or address the concerns of , states that reliably vote for a particular party .
In recent years , the battleground in presidential elections has shrunk drastically .
In 1960 , 24 states , with 327 electoral votes , were battleground states , according to estimates by National Popular Vote , the bipartisan coalition making the new proposal .
In 2004 , only 13 states , with 159 electoral votes , were .
As a result , campaigns and national priorities are stacked in favor of a few strategic states .
Ethanol fuel , a pet issue of Iowa farmers , is discussed a lot .
But issues of equal concern to states like Alabama , California , New York and Indiana are not .
The news archive search is one of several new Google services
The web - based tool allows users to explore existing digitised newspaper articles spanning the last 200 years and more recent online content .
People using the search are shown results from both free and subscription - based news outlets .
Partners in the project include the websites of US newspaper the New York Times and the Guardian from the UK .
Other sources include news aggregators , websites which collect and display news stories from multiple sources .
" The goal here is to be able to explore history as it unfolded , " said Anurag Acharya , an engineer at Google and one of the team behind the project .
" It 's fascinating to see how people 's attitudes and emotions have changed through time . "
History lesson
The new service searches hundreds of different news sources to answer a user 's query .
The exact number of sources is confidential .
Results are presented in similar fashion to a Google News search , with " related " articles about the same event grouped together .
Free and charged - for articles are displayed side by side .
The ability to browse this historical overview allows users to identify key time periods and get some sense of the flow of events
Anurag Acharya
Google 's empire
With pages from commercial websites , the cost of viewing them is also shown .
Google says search results are based on relevance , not partnerships with companies .
Users can also view articles using a timeline that displays key dates associated with a story .
So the first Moon landing would highlight 1969 as a key date , but also identify other years when lunar landings took place or when the topic was in the news .
" The ability to browse this historical overview allows users to identify key time periods and get some sense of the flow of events , " said Mr Acharya .
The earliest known searchable story is , he said , from " somewhere in the mid-1700s " - considerably older than the current 30 - day archive offered through Google News .
The service is accessed through the news archive website or the Google news page .
It is also activated when it can provide relevant results to a user 's search on google.com .
In this case , links to the most relevant historical news articles are displayed separately above the normal search results .
Historical challenge
The launch of the news archive search extends Google 's influence over how the world 's information is indexed , searched and accessed .
The way we access information is changing
According to online research firm Nielsen / NetRatings , more than 380 million people used the search engine every month in 2005 .
The company is also expanding into areas other than search .
In August it announced plans to offer consumers the chance to download and print classic novels free of charge .
" I 'm strongly in favour of the democratisation of access to historical documents , but also cautious about how much information Google now controls , " said Professor Roy Rosenzweig , a historian from the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University in the US .
He says that increasingly the model of how we access information and what information we have access to is changing , as public archives such as libraries are replaced by private companies .
But , he says , he is " extremely excited " about Google 's latest offering .
" As a scholar and historian I want as much information as possible , accessible to as many people as possible at the least cost , and the extent to which Google is doing that is compelling . "
Google says it plans to launch the news archive search service on other international Google sites soon .

“ Having worked with insurance companies , law firms and doctors , Baker brings experience and perspective to his book , which is sure to be important and controversial in future debates . ”
— Publishers Weekly “ Citing major studies mostly from medical and legal literature , he debunks a litany of perceived myths around malpractice lawsuits and convincingly makes the case that malpractice lawsuits actually improve patient care and that big payments are the rare exception , not the rule .
… Well researched with more than ten pages of references , Baker ’s timely book is appropriate for public , medical , and academic libraries . ”
— Library Journal “ Finally someone has demonstrated how complex this challenge really is .
Narrow , facile answers wo n’t solve the problem . ”
— Senator Richard J. Durbin
An excerpt from The Medical Malpractice Myth Tom Baker Medical malpractice premiums are skyrocketing .
“ Closed ” signs are sprouting on health clinic doors .
Doctors are leaving the field of medicine , and those who remain are practicing in fear and silence .
Pregnant women cannot find obstetricians .
Billions of dollars are wasted on defensive medicine .
And angry doctors are marching on state capitols across the country .
All this is because medical malpractice litigation is exploding .
Egged on by greedy lawyers , plaintiffs sue at the drop of a hat .
Juries award eye - popping sums to undeserving claimants , leaving doctors , hospitals , and their insurance companies no choice but to pay huge ransoms for release from the clutches of the so - called “ civil justice ” system .
Medical malpractice litigation is a sick joke , a roulette game rigged so that plaintiffs and their lawyers ’ numbers come up all too often , and doctors and the honest people who pay in the end always lose .
This is the medical malpractice myth .
Built on a foundation of urban legend mixed with the occasional true story , supported by selective references to academic studies , and repeated so often that even the mythmakers forget the exaggeration , half truth , and outright misinformation employed in the service of their greater good , the medical malpractice myth has filled doctors , patients , legislators , and voters with the kind of fear that short circuits critical thinking .
This fear has inspired legislative action on a nationwide scale three times in my lifetime .
The first time was back in the mid-1970s .
I remember sitting at the dinner table listening to my father report what he ’d heard at his medical society meeting : “ Medical malpractice insurance premiums are going through the roof .
Frivolous litigation and runaway juries will drive doctors out of the profession . ”
The answer , the medical societies and their insurance companies said , was medical malpractice tort reform — to make it harder for misguided patients and their lawyers to sue .
What the medical societies did not tell my father , or almost anyone else , was that their own research showed that the real problem was too much medical malpractice , not too much litigation .
In the mid-1970s the California Hospital and Medical Associations sponsored a study on medical malpractice that they expected would support their tort reform efforts .
But , to their surprise and dismay , the study showed that medical malpractice injured tens of thousands of people every year — more than automobile and workplace accidents .
The study also showed that , despite the rhetoric , most of the victims did not sue .
But almost nobody heard about the study because the associations decided that these facts conflicted with their tort reform message .
Two years after they achieved their goal of enacting restrictive medical malpractice tort reform in California , the associations printed the results of the study , but only as an association report .
All that was published for outside consumption was a technical summary , which did not feature the dramatic findings .
The report was not widely distributed , and it was written in exceptionally dry and technical language .
The next time I heard about frivolous litigation and runaway juries driving doctors out of practice was while I was in law school in the mid-1980s .
Medical malpractice premiums were back through the roof .
And , once again , the answer from the medical societies and their insurance companies was tort reform : raise the bar on getting into the courthouse and , in many states , limit what juries could do once victims got inside .
That time , more people were skeptical about the claims of the medical societies .
But this was the 1980s , and organized medicine still knew best .
Nobody had pulled together enough facts about medical malpractice litigation .
And hardly anyone knew about , or could have easily understood , that buried California report .
The result was a virtual avalanche of restrictive tort reform legislation proposed — and often enacted — in legislatures across the county .
The third time began in 2002 and continues today .
This time around we have a lot more information .
But you would not know it from the tort reform remedies that the medical societies , the hospitals , and their insurance companies are pushing .
What do we know ?
First , we know from the California study , as confirmed by more recent , better publicized studies , that the real problem is too much medical malpractice , not too much litigation .
Most people do not sue , which means that victims — not doctors , hospitals , or liability insurance companies — bear the lion ’s share of the costs of medical malpractice .
Second , because of those same studies , we know that the real costs of medical malpractice have little to do with litigation .
The real costs of medical malpractice are the lost lives , extra medical expenses , time out of work , and pain and suffering of tens of thousands of people every year , the vast majority of whom do not sue .
There is lots of talk about the heavy burden that “ defensive medicine ” imposes on health costs , but the research shows this is not true .
Third , we know that medical malpractice insurance premiums are cyclical , and that it is not frivolous litigation or runaway juries that drive that cycle .
The sharp spikes in malpractice premiums in the 1970s , the 1980s , and the early 2000s are the result of financial trends and competitive behavior in the insurance industry , not sudden changes in the litigation environment .
Fourth , we know that “ undeserving ” people sometimes bring medical malpractice claims because they do not know that the claims lack merit and because they cannot find out what happened to them ( or their loved ones ) without making a claim .
Most undeserving claims disappear before trial ; most trials end in a verdict for the doctor ; doctors almost never pay claims out of their own pockets ; and hospitals and insurance companies refuse to pay claims unless there is good evidence of malpractice .
If a hospital or insurance company does settle a questionable claim to avoid a huge risk , there is a very large discount .
This means that big payments to undeserving claimants are the very rare exception , not the rule .
Finally , we know that there is one sure thing — and only one thing — that the proposed remedies can be counted on to do .
They can be counted on to distract attention long enough for the inevitable turn in the insurance cycle to take the edge off the doctors ’ pain .
That way , people can keep ignoring the real , public health problem .
Injured patients and their lawyers are the messengers here , not the cause of the medical malpractice problem .
Jesica and Jeanella
No one who follows the medical news is likely to forget Jesica Santillan , who died after a receiving a heart and lung transplant at Duke University Hospital in February 2003 .
Brought to the United States from a poor Mexican town in search of better medical care , she inspired her new North Carolina community to raise money for a heart and lung transplant , and she inspired people to care about the problem of the medically uninsured .
When she received the transplant , it turned out to be the wrong blood type — a basic , easily avoidable , and tragic mistake .
Her body began rejecting the new organs even before the transplant surgery was over .
Her supporters launched a national public relations effort to find a second , compatible , set of heart and lungs , while accusing Duke of trying to stifle their efforts to avoid publicizing the mistake .
She died shortly after receiving a second transplant , less than two weeks after the first , while the whole world watched .
At the same time , doctors , hospitals , medical liability insurance companies , and their trade and professional organizations were mounting a fierce campaign for tort reform all over the United States .
Beginning in about June 2002 and reaching a peak in early 2003 , the medical malpractice crisis dominated the medical news .
This , too , contributed to the attention on Jesica : a public and almost impossible to understand mistake at a leading medical center , at a time when doctors claimed that frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits and outrageous jury verdicts were the problem .
Fewer people know that Jesica Santillan was actually the second girl in seven months to die after receiving a transplant with the wrong blood type at a prominent medical center .
Jeanella Aranda was the first .
She received a transplant of part of her father ’s liver at Children ’s Medical Center in Dallas in July 2002 , allegedly after a surgical mistake in an earlier operation had destroyed her own liver .
Due to a “ laboratory mix - up , ” according to the New York Times , doctors thought that her father ’s blood type was a good match , when it was actually her mother ’s who matched .
“ The blood type mismatch was not detected until Aug. 5 , 19 days after the surgery , when Mrs. Aranda , who was aware that her husband had type A blood , noticed that Jeanella ’s transfusions were Type O , and asked whether the transplant had been a mismatch . ”
Jeanella died on August 6 , 2002 .
Shortly after Jesica died in February 2003 , the Los Angeles Times linked her story to Jeanella ’s while criticizing medical liability reform proposals in Congress .
“ Communication errors of the sort that doomed Jesica and Jeanella are all too common in medicine , ” the Times reported .
The Times quoted Carolyn M. Clancy , director of the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , who said , “ There ’s more double - checking and systematic avoidance of mistakes at Starbucks than at most health - care institutions . ”
And the Times cited a survey published in the New England Journal of Medicine , reporting , “ Only 30 % of patients harmed by a medical error were told of the problem by the professional responsible for the mistake . ”
Jesica ’s and Jeanella ’s stories became even more tightly linked to the medical malpractice debate when the families of both girls brought medical malpractice claims .
As far as I have been able to tell , no one called those claims frivolous .
Quite the reverse .
Duke Hospital publicly apologized to Jesica ’s family , offered to fund a new program in her name , and announced that it had changed its organ transplant procedures .
Children ’s Medical Center appointed a new medical chief for its organ transplant program and announced that it had adopted new policies and procedures “ designed to improve every link of the quality control chain . ”
Both cases settled .
Throughout the medical malpractice crisis , leading newspapers carried accounts of other obvious medical mistakes .
Like the L.A. Times piece on Jesica and Jeanella , the accounts often linked the particular mistakes to the larger story about the extent of medical malpractice in U.S. health care .
The report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science , To Err Is Human , was a common source .
That report summarized research showing that nearly 100,000 people die in the United States each year from medical mistakes — more than die from automobile and workplace accidents combined .
Because of that research and reporting , public opinion is coming around to the view that , distressingly , Jesica ’s and Jeanella ’s problems are not unique ; our health care system has a serious medical - injury problem .
But at the same time , public opinion remains firmly anchored to the view that we have an explosion of what President George W. Bush calls “ junk lawsuits ” and that medical malpractice lawsuits contribute significantly to the high cost of health care in the United States .
Stories like Jesica ’s and Jeanella ’s helped shift public opinion about medical malpractice only because they were linked to research and reporting that reframed medical malpractice as a public health problem .
But their stories did not shift public opinion about medical malpractice lawsuits , because they were not linked to research and reporting that reframed malpractice lawsuits as a public good .
Like any durable and effective myth , the medical malpractice myth can accommodate almost any number of real - life examples that conflict with the myth — by classifying those examples as exceptions .
Nobody but a researcher has the time or inclination to go out and take a systematic look at medical malpractice lawsuits in order to evaluate what is the rule and what is the exception .
Everyone else has to take individual examples as they come .
As a result , lawsuits like Jesica ’s and Jeanella ’s do not pose a serious challenge to the myth .
No one says that all the lawsuits are frivolous .
But everyone “ knows ” that most of them are .
Even a regular drumbeat of contrary examples does not call the myth into question , because the myth provides the context in which we understand the examples , not the reverse .
It is time to change that context .
The Power of the Tort Litigation Myth
The medical malpractice myth is part of a larger story about the litigation explosion , the litigiousness of Americans , and the debilitating effect that lawsuits have on the U.S. economy .
I have often encountered this larger story in my work directing the Insurance Law Center at the University of Connecticut School of Law in Hartford , Connecticut .
We try very hard to get university and insurance industry people to talk to each other .
People in universities call on me to find out what is happening in the insurance industry , and people in the insurance industry call on me to find out about the university research .
One good example came in the summer of 2003 when I was invited to speak to a meeting of insurance company CEOs in London .
My assignment was to provide an overview of the academic research on how the U.S. tort system really works and , in particular , to report on the substantial research debunking many of the claims about the litigation explosion .
My host invited me to come to the whole meeting , even though my session was near the end .
I had never met a CEO from any significant company , let alone an insurance company .
For me , the chance to spend two days with dozens of insurance company CEOs was quite an opportunity .
I used the time to meet and talk with quite a few of the CEOs , to see what they were like and also to get a sense of what they were expecting to hear from me .
They were smart , hard - working people .
They were at least as well read and informed about current events as most of my university colleagues , and on the whole they were more informed about what was happening in countries other than their own .
I was surprised and a bit concerned , however , to find that almost everyone assumed I was there to provide them with the latest research on the extent of the litigation explosion and the particular ways in which the U.S. tort system was out of control .
At first I worried that they thought I had been paid to tell them whatever they wanted to hear .
( I had not been paid and , even if I had , I would not have done that . )
So I checked with my host to make sure he knew what they were in for .
He did .
In fact , he was rather looking forward to the fireworks .
My concerns addressed , I put on my participant observation research hat and resolved to find out why the CEOs expected that from me .
What I learned was that they assumed I was there to talk about the out - of - control tort system not because they thought I was paid to tell them what they wanted to hear , but rather because they believed , intensely , that chaos was the real situation .
That was interesting .
I had always harbored a suspicion that insurance industry leaders promoted the tort litigation myth despite what they really knew to the contrary .
Maybe some do , but not these people .
The CEOs were well informed about political and economic matters generally .
They were especially well informed about things that affect their business .
And the U.S. liability situation affects their business .
So , as far as they were concerned , if they thought that there was a tort litigation explosion in the United States and if they thought that the U.S. tort system was out of control , then that was how it was .
Whatever else anyone might think , their support for tort reform was not a cynical effort to make money at the public ’s expense .
While the CEOs did in fact think that tort reform was in their industry ’s interest , the emotion that fired them up came from belief — a belief that is not rooted entirely in self - interest .
The debate over the other major issue for which they brought outside experts to their meeting ( new international accounting standards ) was pale by comparison .
Yet , in financial terms that other issue would have a much bigger immediate impact on their business than liability reform , especially for the life insurance CEOs , who are not even in the liability insurance business .
The CEOs tried to get fired up about it , but they could not .
Accounting rules simply do not plug into beliefs about right and wrong in remotely the same way as tort liability .
They were concerned about the litigation explosion , not just because it affected their business , but also because of the impact they expected it to have on the larger economy and society .
They were concerned about the United States , where they saw the explosion originating , and Europe , where they saw signs that it was spreading .
They were looking forward to hearing from me so they could better understand and treat this American disease .
In this regard at least , I am sure that I disappointed my audience .
As I reported to them , except for auto accidents and the occasional “ mass tort ” situation like asbestos , Agent Orange , or breast implants , Americans actually do not bring tort claims all that often , especially compared to the number of accidents and injuries there are .
We now have two decades of solid research documenting this fact .
What is more , the rate of auto lawsuits — the most frequent kind of tort lawsuit — is going down .
And , despite the media focus on mass torts , products liability , and medical malpractice , those kinds of cases are far less important in dollar terms than either auto accidents or workers ’ compensation .
In 2003 U.S. businesses paid $ 27 billion for auto liability insurance premiums , $ 57 billion for workers ’ compensation insurance premiums , and less than $ 5 billion for products liability insurance premiums .
Doctors , hospitals , and other health professionals paid only about $ 11 billion in medical malpractice insurance premiums .
This means that the real insurance money and the real claiming action for U.S. business does not lie in high - profile areas like products liability and medical malpractice .
The real action lies in routine , below - the - radar areas like workers ’ compensation and automobile lawsuits .
U.S. businesses paid less than half as much for products liability and medical malpractice insurance , combined , as they paid for auto insurance , alone , and only a quarter of what they paid for workers ’ compensation insurance .
Products liability and medical malpractice insurance look even less significant compared to what ordinary Americans paid for personal auto liability and no -fault auto insurance : $ 115.5 billion in 2003 .
That is more than U.S. business paid for auto , workers ’ compensation , products liability , and medical malpractice insurance combined .
Adding all the premiums of all the different kinds of liability insurance together results in a big number — about $ 215 billion in 2003 — but that number is hardly exploding , and the medical malpractice insurance share — $ 11 billion — looks pretty small by comparison .
It looks even smaller next to the $ 1.5 trillion plus ( that is more than 1,500 billion dollars ) we spent on health care that year .
Something that amounts to less than 1 percent of health - care costs simply cannot have the impact on health care that the medical malpractice myth would have us believe .
Even on a per doctor basis , that medical malpractice insurance number is not as high as many people think .
There were nearly 900,000 doctors in the United States in 2003 .
That means that medical malpractice insurance premiums were about $ 12,000 per doctor , and of course hospitals , dentists , and other health - care professionals buy malpractice insurance , too .
So the average premium doctors paid was less .
Some kinds of doctors have to pay much more .
Obstetricians are the best - known example .
But there is a simple insurance reform that will solve that problem , as I will explain in chapter 8 .
Where Americans do excel in litigation is in the area of business lawsuits .
If you read the business section of the newspaper , you know that B2B — business - to - business — sales are hot .
So is B2B litigation .
Some of the business executives who complain about the litigation explosion must be thinking about their own behavior .
In one indication , the proportion of lawyers who bring personal - injury lawsuits has remained steady since 1975 , while the share of lawyers involved in business litigation has more than tripled .
I enjoyed the London presentation , and , as predicted , we had some vigorous debate .
Did I persuade the CEOs that the tort litigation explosion is a myth ?
They did not get to be CEOs by lacking confidence , so they were not shy about telling me what they thought .
Some argued with me then .
Some continue to argue with me .
But we are still talking .
And their people are reading the research .
I also told them , and I continue to repeat every chance I get , that they should be careful what they wish for .
What other industry asks the government to reduce the demand for its product ?
Tame the tort system , and hospitals and other big businesses will decide that they do not need liability insurance .
Take away the risk of a really big lawsuit , and a line of credit is nearly as good as an insurance policy , and , with a line of credit , you pay only for the credit you use .
Once businesses can predict their liability losses with enough certainty , a monthly savings plan is even better , and it costs even less .
Who knows how long it will take me to convince them , if I ever will .
But I have already noticed a change in the rhetoric , from complaints about the number of lawsuits to complaints about the size of the lawsuits .
Complaints about the size of lawsuits represent a real improvement , because at least they have some basis in reality .
Medical malpractice claims are getting bigger .
So are auto claims and workers ’ compensation claims .
Of course , the fact that claims are getting bigger does not mean that the tort system is out of control .
Tort claims are getting larger mostly because health care costs more than ever before .
Putting the Medical Malpractice Myth in a Political Context
My interest in the medical malpractice myth grows out of a variety of experiences that have nothing to do with politics .
My father and father - in - law are both doctors .
I regularly teach tort law , the branch of law that includes medical malpractice law .
My field research on personal - injury litigation introduced me to many lawyers on both sides of medical malpractice lawsuits .
And my role as the director of an insurance education and research program virtually guaranteed that I would want to understand the medical malpractice insurance crisis that broke out in 2002 .
Despite the fact that my interest in medical malpractice is not political , there is no avoiding the fact that medical liability reform has become a very partisan issue .
With some exceptions , Republican legislators favor cutting back on tort liability and Democratic legislators do not .
And over the course of the last thirty years , tort reform has become one of the top political objectives of groups like the Chamber of Commerce , the American Manufacturers Association and other traditionally business - oriented trade associations .
These groups support medical liability reform as part of their effort to limit tort law more broadly .
The effort currently underway in Washington to include pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers under the umbrella of national medical liability reform shows how medical malpractice reform can pave the way for broader efforts to limit liability .
Pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers are not the target of medical malpractice lawsuits .
Instead they face the same kinds of product liability claims as any other manufacturer .
But their products are used in the medical field , and therefore the medical liability reform tent may be big enough to hold them , too — or so their Washington , D.C. , lobbyists contend .
From there , it is a small step to limit liability in other areas , so that all defendants receive equal treatment .
Doctors have conflicting interests in the larger political struggle over access to the courts .
On the one hand , efforts to limit medical liability serve their long - term interest in self - regulation and professional autonomy .
As researchers from Harvard Medical School have explained , “ Physicians and their societies are actively resisting the legitimacy of the law as a means of controlling and regulating the practice of medicine .
. . .
The profession ’s organizations have invested extensive financial , cultural and political resources to resist what both rank - and - file practitioners and the professional collective regard as infringements on medical work . ”
On the other hand , doctors are consumers and , increasingly , employees and independent contractors who work for large organizations .
In these roles they have a strong interest in maintaining access to courts .
These conflicting interests are playing out right now in my state of Connecticut .
On the one hand , our state medical society has been lobbying the Connecticut legislature , hard , in favor of medical liability reform .
On the other hand , the society has filed lawsuits against several big health insurance companies that doctors believe are not playing fair .
After the medical society achieved a favorable result in one of the lawsuits , I spoke to their executive director , suggesting that there might be some irony in their using the courts to advance doctors ’ interests — while at the same time trying to limit what patients could do in court .
He explained that there is no conflict in the two positions : the medical society ’s lawsuits involve different issues and different fields of law than medical malpractice .
I had to agree that he was correct in technical , legal terms .
But to my mind , the society is walking a tightrope .
The skilled artisans and craftsmen who formed the American Federation of Labor used to think that they had more in common with businessmen than with the industrial trade unions .
They changed their view in the early part of the twentieth century , when the expansion in the scope of manufacturing and construction restricted their independence and control over the workplace .
Will doctors follow a similar path in the twenty - first century , when large health plans place greater pressure on health - care providers to control costs and take a more businesslike approach to health care ?
Part of the art of politics is keeping supporters focused on the things they agree upon so they do n’t break up the coalition by fighting about other things .
Tort reform is one issue on which doctors , health insurers , and most businesses clearly agree .
The medical malpractice myth helps to maintain that alliance , by keeping rank - and - file doctors and the medical societies completely committed to tort reform and grateful to the ( mostly Republican ) politicians who deliver it .
President Bush ’s January 2005 speech on medical liability reform in Collinsville , Illinois , shows just how strongly his administration is promoting the medical malpractice myth .
As with any major political address by a politician from either party , the visual images , alone , tell a significant story .
The White House video of the speech opens with a wide - angle shot of the president walking toward a podium stationed in front of a bleacher full of cheering doctors in white coats , beneath a large banner on which the words “ Affordable Healthcare ” are framed between two large images of the caduceus — the twined snake and wing symbol of the American medical profession .
When the camera pulls in tight for the speech , we see a striking image : President Bush , the presidential seal on the podium below , and doctors in white coats all around .
In advance of the Collinsville address , the White House had announced that the president would be discussing medical liability reform .
By linking “ affordable health care ” with medical liability reform and surrounding the president with cheering doctors , the image conveyed a clear message .
Medical malpractice lawsuits are a big reason health care is so expensive .
The president supports doctors ’ efforts to eliminate that cost .
And doctors support the president .
The speech itself delivered the same message .
“ I ’m here to talk about how we need to fix a broken medical liability system , ” the president announced to a roar of applause .
He mentioned by name the Illinois Republican politicians attending the speech , explained how they are supporting the cause , and offered special thanks to the Republican legislator who was “ leading the medical liability reform effort ” in the Illinois state legislature .
After running through the top agenda items for his administration and a few other health - care reform ideas designed to control health - care costs , he arrived at his main topic :
What ’s happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors .
That ’s just a plain fact .
And they ’re doing it for a simple reason .
They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor .
Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in recent years .
That means every claim filed by a personal - injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court .
That ’s what that means .
Doctors and hospitals realize this .
They know it ’s expensive to fight a lawsuit , even if it does n’t have any merit .
And because the system is so unpredictable , there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award .
So doctors end up paying tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle claims out of court , even when they know they have done nothing wrong .
From there , the speech proceeded point by point through the medical malpractice myth : the frivolous lawsuits , the courts ’ bias against doctors , the skyrocketing jury awards , the huge settlements in cases in which doctors did nothing wrong , the direct link between lawsuits and insurance premiums , the doctors leaving the practice of medicine , the patients who cannot find doctors , and the huge waste of money on defensive medicine .
“ This liability system of ours is , ” the president said , “ what I ’m telling you , is out of control . ”
It was an effective , succinct , and powerful statement of the medical malpractice myth .
It would take a book — this book I hope — to set the record straight after a speech like that .
Read the story below before you look at the pictures .
This is a true story , it happened in Utah and was on the news !
I thought each of you could use a little comic relief today .
Here ’s the story .
A city councilman , Mark Easton , lives in this neighborhood .
He had a beautiful view of the east mountains , until a new neighbor purchased the lot below his house and built .
Apparently , the new home was 18 inches higher than the ordinances would allow , so Mark Easton , mad about his lost view , went to the city to make sure they enforced the lower roof line ordinance .
Mark and his new neighbor had some great arguments about this as you can imagine — not great feelings .
The new neighbor had to drop the roof line — no doubt at great expense .
Recently , Mark Easton called the city and informed them that his new neighbor had installed some vents on the side of his home .
Mark did n’t like the look of these vents and asked the city to investigate .
When they went to Mark ’s home to see the vent view , this is what they found … ( see attached pictures ) .
The origin of these amusing photographs is essentially as described above , something that arose over a dispute between neighbors in the southwest Salt Lake Valley , Utah , community of Riverton over an adjacent property owner ’s construction work on his home .
The conflict started in 2005 when Darren Wood excavated dirt from a hill on which the homes of his neighbors , Mark Easton and Stan Torgersen , sat .
The Eastons and Torgersens were concerned about the stability of the hill and contacted city officials , who ordered Wood to have a soil test performed .
Wood was disgruntled by the decision because the previous owner had already done a soil test , and performing it again would cost him $ 3,000 and delay his construction project by four months .
Then , when Wood began raising the frame for his house around mid-2006 , his neighbors were again concerned because the structure rose higher than the rooftops of the other homes around his lot and partially obstructed their view of nearby mountains .
Easton and Torgersen again asked city officials to intervene because they believed Wood ’s house exceeded the maximum height allowed by local building code .
Although Wood conceded that his house might have exceeded the height limit by about a foot , he was again disgruntled because he maintained that once the house was completed and the landscaping laid out , the home would fall within the code , and , in any case , the city had already approved his plans .
Feeling that he was being unfairly harrassed by his neighbors and upset that the construction interruptions they prompted had cost him an additional $ 25,000 , on 15 August 2006
Wood created a visible symbol of his displeasure by installing the vent covering pictured above , which he described as a decorative piece of “ abstract art ” representing a cactus .
His neighbors , of course , viewed the vent cover as a giant hand flipping them off , sending them back to city officials to complain about Wood ’s home for a third time .
Wood said he would remove the vent cover art if he received apologies from his neighbors .
When , a week later , Mark Easton “ expressed to him that I am sorry for any discomfort that I have caused his family or him , and that I had no intent to do any harm to him when I called the city with my concern about safety , ” Wood apparently found that sufficient and took down the controversial abstract “ cactus . ”

Since we were foolishly underestimating the role of publications and spent no time for that ( perhaps , we would not have been successful in trying to send papers to journals or conferences -- we were students first and even later had no higher academic degrees like PhDs ) , the community did not hear / read about our work .
Those who heard about reacted in different ways : Students in other faculties of TUB tried to imitate our ES .
Most professors took our ideas for nonsense , except for two : a biologist and Prof.

I have decided to start a series of posts on the History of Evolutionary Computation ( HEC ) .
Therefore , I shall focus my attention to the three main branches of Evolutionary Computation ( EC ) : Evolution Strategies ( ES , from the German word ) ; Evolutionary Programming ( EP ) ; and Genetic Algorithms ( GA ) .
The inner core of this ( somehow ) difficult " endeavour " would be writing and reporting what the creators of those methods did to bring into life a new myriad of nature inspired algorithms which have setting up a whole new area of research , their insights and experiments that helped them to write their stories and , also , the history of a new field .
This post does not intend to claim one method is better ( or even the best ) than any other ( a thunderous voice speaks : ) , but just a humble try to understand what were the main ideas behind something new and that represented at its time an example of innovation , what could help contemporary researchers , engineers , achievers , innovators , and so on to build their own innovations .
I think that the difficulties and necessities those pioneers faced and , more important , overcame are full of interesting lessons we may learn from and use them as a source of inspiration , or a manner to simply admire their works .
This first post deals with the pioneer work of three German students that performed early experiments on what would later develop into a new evolutionary algorithm : Evolution Strategies .
Their first experiments happened during the Summer of 1964 at the Technische Universität Berlin ( TUB , Technical University of Berlin ) .
Below , the images of Ingo Rechenberg and Hans - Paul Schwefel .
Ingo Rechenberg ( ) : Hans - Paul Schwefel ( ) : The third student was Peter Bienert ( it is a pity there is no picture of him on the Internet ) , responsible for an early evolvable hardware experiment : FORO 1 ( ) , the research robot .
When Ingo Rechenberg ( born 1934 ) and Hans - Paul Schwefel ( born 1940 ) were students at TUB , both of them had the opportunity to attend some lectures on the then growing field of cybernetics .
Even though those lectures were not on a regular basis , they could listen to researchers such as Dr. Karl Steinbuch ( 1917 - 2005 ) , a visionary who predicted the modern world of multimedia and an early designer of neural networks :
The learnmatrix Professor Karl Steinbuch : Another professor influenced them : Heinrich Hertel ( 1901 - 1982 ) , a professor of aircraft construction and an instigating mentor who advised his pupils to look into nature as a source of inspiration for aerodynamics shapes and related subjects , and never missed a chance of comparing biological forms ( dolphins , birds , fishes , and etc. ) to the archetypical aerodynamical forms .
It would be worthful noting that Schwefel almost became Eugen Sänger 's ( 1905 - 1964 ) assistant , but Sänger died right before Schwefel accomplishing his diploma thesis .
In such an environment , Rechenberg and Schwefel saw a close connection between cybernetics and any search strategy .
Professor Heinrich Hertel : Professor Eugen Sänger and his wife , Irene Brendt The , a project by Sänger and Irene Brendt .
This project was one of the designs considered for the Amerika - Bomber mission Another historical figure along that time that was ainfluence for any engineer was , with no doubt , the German rocket engineer Wernher von Braun Norbert Wiener can be considered as an early pioneer of cybernetics , the field that gave birth to a whole new generation of scientific investigations :
His seminal book on the same subject :
That was the spirit of the time ( or the ) in which the evolution strategies ( ES ) came to this world .
It seems that was a fruitful age for new ideas ... The first meeting of Rechenberg and Schwefel at TUB was not in 1964 , as some evolutionary computation insiders think , but in November 1963 .
Schwefel was a coworker newbie student at TUB 's Hermann Föttinger - Institute for Hydrodynamics ( HFI ) and Rechenberg was a seasoned student at the same institute .
Both were studying aerospace technology engineering and their respective duties had nothing to do with cybernetics , bionics , or optimization methods .
Rechenberg , being a more experient member of HFI , could use the wind tunnel during the afternoons -- when the main research assistants had already left .
They started investigating wall shear stress measurements , a subject Rechenberg had been doing for some time .
Later , they decided to work on their own subject : , specially for improving ( or optimizing ) forms of slender bodies ( wings , airfoils , airplane bodies , etc. ) under air flow .
Schwefel main work during this time was ( and for which he was paid for ) organizing exercises for other students , particularly on measurement techniques in fluid dynamics .
Below there are Ingo Rechenberg ( background ) and Hans - Paul Schwefel ( foreground ) at TUB 's wind tunnel : Despite at that time there were well established methods ( mainly gradient - based ones , Gauss - Seidel and etc. ) to deal with problems holding continuous variables , Rechenberg and Schwefel had found out that the traditional approach of changing one variable at a time and the discrete gradient method did not work in experimental optimization , what was the first focus of their research toward evolution strategies ( ES ) .
This impracticality of using those methods is due to the nature of the optimization that takes place in that kind of experiment : Instead of optimizing the parameters of a problem through a computer , the investigator must optimize the real object itself -- without computers !
Experimental optimization means that you have a real physical , mechanical , electrical , optical , chemical , etc. object or some model , like physical , of the real object -- and absolutely no computer -- and you want to alter some of its properties ( size , charge , temperature , pressure , etc. ) in order to achieve an improved performance according to some criterion ( criteria ) .
Before the end of the 1960s Ingo Rechenberg and Hans - Paul Schwefel did not think of using this procedure ( an early form of evolution strategy , but without computers ) as a numerical method .
Computers were not yet available in larger numbers , and if so , their power was rather weak .
Let alone noisy measurements and multimodality .
However , unlike traditional approaches of that time , changingvariables at the same time in some random fashion ( smaller changes more frequently than larger ones ) could work a little better .
This was the seed of what would later be a new evolutionary algorithm .
At this point almost everything had already been set up for applying their new method .
But another idea came from a somehow strange source ...
A science fiction story by a not so well known writer : Insel der Krebse ( The Island of the Crabs ) , by Anatolij Dnjeprow .
That story has to do with artificial and synthetic evolution ocurring in an island and made by synthetic organisms whichthemselves to .
Rechenberg states that this story ( also ) was his inspiration for using a " population " ( it was just a ( 1 + 1 ) - ES , that is , one parent generating one offspring and both , later , struggling for survival to become the parent in the next generation / iteration ) instead of just one point of search , as it was / is the agenda of traditional methods at the time .
The front cover of Even thoughliterarily covered some of the fundamental ideas ( trial and error , mutation and struggling for life ) of what would later be evolution strategies ( ES ) , there were some methods at the time that had some , even though loosely , similarities with ES , such as George E. P. Box EVOP and the gradient method itself .
But trial and error experimentation with further selection of the best variatons ( mutations ) composed the core of what would be the ( 1 + 1 ) - ES ( also known asor ) .
First there is just one parent ( μ = 1 ) generating , through random mutation , an offspring ( λ = 1 ) .
Then , both of them struggles for survival and the best is taken as the parent of the next generation .
The basic skunk of evolution strategies was born with discrete binomially distributed mutations centered at the ancestor 's position , and just one parent and one descendant per generation .
Since there is only one parent the use of a recombination operator makes no sense .
The absence of a recombination / crossover operator was due to the lack of , at TUB 's Hermann Föttinger - Institute for Hydrodynamics ( HFI ) , several objects ( airfoils , kinked plates , nozzles , etc. ) and several wind tunnels that could operate at same time .
The reader should remember that the first evolution strategies experimentsperformed in computers .
They were all about experimental optimization , using real world objects and optimizing directly into their features ( charge , weight , drag , thrust and so on ) .
Despite not using a recombination operator during early experimental optimization , some few years ( 1971 ) later , Rechenberg , in his PhD. dissertation , had demonstrated the advantage of such an evolutionary operator , although investigating the effects of crossover on a ( μ + 1 ) - ES ( extinction of the worst ) on a study concerning numerical optimization -- it was along this time he developed a simple self - adaptation mechanism to cope with numerical optimization ( the so called ) .
Moreover , doing some theory was much easier for mutation only .
Therefore , this was done first .
It is a common misconception in genetic algorithm community that evolution strategies emphasize mutation and neglect recombination , what is not true .
Now , having all the ingredients gathered , it was the crucial moment to test the concept of their new method .
Thewas done at TUB on June 12th , 1964 : Six plane planks linked by five adjustable hinges .
It is an aerodynamics problem and its optimum solution is trivial :
All the plane planks must align horizontally ( but the optimal configuration may change depending on the air flux direction ) .
Before doing the experiment , Schwefel used a mechanical calculator with the sum of squares function on integers using binomial mutations to demonstrated the ( 1 + 1 ) - ES would work , at least in principle .
The principal objective of that experimental optimization was minimizing the kinked plates ' drag .
The , an example of experimental optimization : There are 51 ( or 345 025 251 ) possible combinations for the five adjustable hinges .
The first series of tries on thewas made with random start conditions , later other initial conditions were taken into account , even turning out to be easier , requiring less mutations to reach a satisfactory solution , although the optimum solution was known and trivial .
The idea behind using a problem holding a known solution was twofold :
A ) Be able to prove convergence ;B)
Demonstrate that the experimental method devised by Rechenberg and Schwefel did not take too much iterations to reach the optimum ( or a satisfactory solution ) .
Some critics at the time predicted that such a method would need years or even millions of years to find a reasonable solution .
Today it is not uncommon finding out people who claim on the grounds of pure random search when it comes to natural evolution .
The problem set up for the ( experimental ) optimization was finding the best reachable solution for the kinked plates ' aerodynamic configuration , optimizing , along the way , some variables , mainly the drag .
That experiment can be considered as a sort offor an experimental optimization task .is a well known fitness function applied to retrieve the initial feedbacks from a new evolutionary algorithm and / or optimization method .
That function is just a bit counting problem in which the algorithm must find the a binary string that has the maximum number of bits one .
Therefor , if a binary string has length 5 ( 5 bits ) : =
BThen , the best ( optimum ) solution in thatproblem is the string in which all tge bits Bare 1:= 1 1 1 1 1 The core procedure to find the best solution is simply summing up each bit in the string .
Anoptimized by an evolution strategy : Rechenberg and Schwefel selected a simple problem ( the kinked plates experimental optimization ) because they could verify the initial behavior of their method during the optimization search and , thus , they could get the first impressions of their method .
For solving theproblem , they used an early form of a simple ( 1 + 1 ) - ES with binomially distribution random changes in the current best kinked plates ' shape .
In a ( 1 + 1 ) - ES there is just one parent ( μ = 1 ) generating a single offspring ( λ = 1 ) through random mutation .
The whole optimization was made without any computer aid and completely performed by hand .
In the 1960s West Germany , computers were not available as they are today , let alone during that time computational power was weak .
Not to mention the fact that Rechenberg and Schwefel did not think at all of using their method as a numerical optimization search technique until around 1970 .
The migration of the early evolution strategy from the experimental optimization realm to the numerical venue was Schwefel 's " " idea when he began looking for a competitive derivative - free numerical optimization method .
The mutation operator applied was some kind of children 's playing chips with a plus sign on one side and a minus sign on the opposite side .
In the simplest case with two chips the result could be : 1 ) ++ with probability 1 / 4 for changing a variable in positive direction , or ; 2 ) -- also with probability 1 / 4 for changing a variable in negative direction , or ; 3 ) +- ( or -+ ) with probability 1 /2 for no change .
With more chips one could of course produce broader binomial probability distributions .
A Galton box was used too , but only for demonstration purposes ( see the image below ) .
A Galton box and the The amount of iteration ( or generations ) the simple two membered ( 1 + 1 ) - ES needed was not 200 , but different amountd in two successive tries .
The best solution found was not flat at all , because drag measurements were not exact enough to distinguish between what would be flat and nearly flat .
The experimental optimization 's iterations for the Schwefel 's diploma thesis , finished in March 1965 , revealed the simple two membered ( 1 + 1 ) - ES can get stuck in such a discrete environments and , henceforth , they decided to concentrate on continuous Gaussian mutations .
For his diploma thesis , Schwefel simulated an evolution strategy on a ZUSE Z23 computer , a creation of the German computer pioneer Konrad Zuse .
In the same year , another student , called H. J. Lichtfuß ( , 1965 ) , got good results optimizing bended pipes through evolution strategy made as an experimental optimization procedure .
Z23 computer data sheet :
The Z23 computer was applied on a wide range of areas , from contructional engineering to ballistics and electronics design .
It was available with compilers for the German formula code and for ALGOL 60 .
The Z23 console : Konrad Zuse : Schwefel programmed the first cotinuous and computer implemented evolution strategy in the Z23 , writing the code in an assembly - like programming language named .
This language was designed for solving mathematical problems and in an easier manner than writing the code in pure machine language .
He took 1000 random numbers from a book and stored them as an array .
His continuous and computer implemented ( 1 + 1 ) - ES program was put on a punched tape .
The objective ( or fitness ) function used was a simple two dimensional parabolic ridge with positive integer numbers for the two variables .
He started his simulation on an evening and got the results the next morning .
When Schwefel got his results he got astonished about the patterns of failure the method revealed depending on the angle of inclination of that ridge and the pattern of the mutations ( e.g. in the Moore neighborhood only ) that method , the ( 1+1 ) - ES with binomially distributed mutations , could be stuck in solutions that even were not local optima .
He found a theoretical explanation for that , finally , within his diploma thesis in 1965 .
Since he could easily see that the univariate ( or Gauss - Seidel or one - variable - at - a - time or coordinate ) strategy would have even more problems on the ridge and that problem would be too easy for a ( continuous ) gradient strategy , he did not test them explicitly .
Although the somehow good results Ingo Rechenberg and Hans - Paul Schwefel achieved using the simple ( 1 + 1 ) - ES , the German academic establishment at that time did not welcome their evolution strategy method in a good way .
The establishment was , indeed , skeptical .
Maybe , this reaction could be an expression of the 1960s optimization methods ' .
Even there were optimization researchers claiming they did not need another search method except the gradient one ( steepest ascent / descent ) .
One of the main researchers at TUB 's Hermann Föttinger - Institute for Hydrodynamics ( HFI ) went to the point of saying that .
After this , Rechenberg and Schwefel had to come back to work in fluid dynamics or they would have to leave HFI and they decided to leave .
After getting away from HFI , Ingo Rechenberg started to investigate the theoretical aspects of the ( 1+ 1 ) - ES and Hans - Paul Schwefel got a job because he had married with his girlfriend , Ms. Antje Schulte - Sasse ( now Ms. Antje Schwefel and the person behind the biennial report Blaues Heft ) and got children some time after marrying .
Then , Schwefel went to an industrial research facility at AEG ( Allgemeine Elektrizitäts - Gesellschaft ) and also maintened an academic connection with the Institute of Nuclear Technology of the Technical University of Berlin .
At the AEG research laboratory , Klockgether and Schwefel made an interesting evolution strategy application :
The optimization of a two - phase flashing nozzle .
That was , again , made as an experimental optimization .
Klockgether and Schwefel needed about 200 generations ( or iterations ) to find a sub-optimal solution for such a problem and it was made 45 improvements on the nozzle initial configuration .
This was made , again , without computers , It was one of the early uses of gene deletion and duplication as evolutionary operators .
The two - phase flashing nozzle set up :
Even today , it is not possible to calculate what happens within such a nozzle : thermodynamically far away from equilibrium , drag between slow water droplets and fast steam , three - dimensional turbulent boundary layer with liquid sub-layer , supersonic behind nozzle throat , and etc .
As someone could ask himself , that design principle behind that nozzle was never applied to real rocket propulsion , because , to do this , someone would need to do the experiments once more for bigger rockets .
At the time , there were some arguments against that nozzle design , being the principal one the non-optimal shape achieved and the strange design method employed .
The first part of this argument seems strange because there was no a priori optimal solution known for the nozzle problem and there is no way of stating a speficic shape is the optimum .
Below , the intial and final nozzle designs :
The two - phase flashing nozzle video : Despite achieving good results employing the new - born evolution strategy method , Rechenberg and Schwefel needed research grants to continue their investigations , but could not get finnancial support because both of them lacked a PhD. degree at the time .
Even though , they made a request for finnancial support , but it was denied .
Later , they tried to convince their professors , Professor Helmcke ( a biologist ) and Professor Gast , to undersign a research proposal on evolution strategies and employ them as research assistants .
But , there were some negative recommendations coming from peer reviewers that analysed the proposal and there was someone who disliked the term " evolution strategy " , what made the " wanna be " research assistants guessing it was made by some creationist .
It was a pity the research proposal was denied , because Rechenberg and Schwefel were thinking of new features for their method : Bigger populations ; theoretical analysis ; new mutation operators ; real - valued variables ; new computer implementations ; and the contruction of an automaton ( FORO 1 , by Peter Bienert ) operating under the rules of their method .
Those features were only investigated some years later along the 1970s and expanded throughout the next 20 years .
But it all makes sense when viewed under the light of how important publications were and are .
Without them , it is almost impossible of obtaining research grants .
The only " publication " they got was a brief article in the popular magazineBelow , Ingo Rechenberg and thearticle :
On the role of publications , Schwefel states : Ingo Rechenberg , Hans - Paul Schwefel and Peter Bienert would come back to work together , in the early 1970s , at the Institute of Measurement and Control Engineering .
Schwefel 's PhD. dissertation was not finished before 1974 , but in the next year he got his PhD. , while Rechenberg got his professorship at , ironically , Technical University of Berlin .
It seems that Peter Bienert stayed at Rechenberg 's new born group at TUB : .
Schwefel 's dissertation results demonstrated that the simple two membered ( 1 + 1 ) - ES behaved very similar to other local search methods , and he realized only multimemberd evolution strategy ( an evolution strategy that has a population bigger than one or two ) could do a satisfactory optimization job with some possitive probability .
Along the 1970s , Rechenberg began to more thoroughly study the theoretical aspects of evolution strategies .
For this task , he used quite simple objective ( or fitness ) functions , such as the sphere model and the corridor .
From these investigations , was born one of the early mechanisms to self - adapt the parameters of an evolution strategy :
The so called 1/5 Success Rule .
The 1/5 rule states :
If less than 20 % of the generations are successful ( i.e. offsprings better than parents ) , then decrease the step size for the next generation ; if more than 20 % are successful , then increase the step size in order to accelerate convergence .
It is an extremely simple rule and its robustness can be considered everything but weak .
However , it was a fisrt step into the quest for a strong self - adaptation mechanism .
The cannonical self - adaptation mechanism was devised by Hans - Paul Schwefel in the second half of the 1970s .
It uses a lognormal function and it is as follow :
The aforementioned self - adaptation mechanism distributes the Gaussian density function in the following way along the axes :
We can clearly see that the use of that mechanism spread the mutation distribution in a ellipsoidal fashion through the fitness landscape , but it can only follow directions that are aligned with the coordinate system and it has no capabilities for getting interdependence among objective ( or fitness ) function 's variables .
When dealing with problems of big dimensions , the ellipsoids become hyperellipsoids that can expand or contract along the axes directions only .
There is a simpler lognormal self - adaptation mechanism :
It also distributes the mutations in the same manner as the previous mechanism , but , instead of being ellipses , the shapes are circles :
It sees no interdependence among variables too and cannot expand or contract along the axes directions as the former mechanism does .
For problems of high dimensions , the circles become hyperspheres .
The other mechanism is almost the same as those ones above , but this one can take into account the interdepence among the variables .
It sees the interdepence through the calculation of the covariance matrix :
The alphas are rotation angles and theis a constant value chosen as 0.0873 .
Now , the mutation operator can spread an offspring along directions non-aligned with the coordinate system :
Now , there is an extra degree of freedom , since the ellipsoids now not only can contract and expand along axes directions , but they can also rotate toward directions that are not aligned with those axes .
Below , there is an example of a generic representation for an evolution strategy individual :
Those developments came from Schwefel 's experiences with numerical optimization and he introduced in his PhD. thesis the well known evolution strategy nomenclature :
The so called comma notation , ( μ , λ ) - ES ; and the plus notation ( μ + λ ) - ES .
Now , instead of using just one parent ( μ = 1 ) and one offspring ( λ = 1 ) , there are μ parents generating λ offspring .
The main difference between the comma and the plus strategies has to do with the selection mechanism .
The plus strategy works as follows :
There are μ parents generating λ offspring and , then , both parents and offspring compose a temporary population from which the best μ individuals are selected to become parents in the next generation ( or iteration ) .
The comma strategy follows a similar fashion , that is , there are μ parents generating λ offspring too , but the selection takes place only in the offspring set from which the best μ individuals are selected to be parents in the next generation .
The plus strategy seems to work better when it comes to combinatorial problems and it can get stuck easily in local optima when performing continuous optimization .
On the other hand , the comma approach is better suited to continuous / parametric optimization problems and one of its main advantages is exactly the selection mechanism which permits a temporary degradation of the best solution found so far to overcome local optima -- however , the comma approach can work poorly if ill configured , for example setting μ = λ , what is a simple random walk .
The inclusion of the crossover ( or recombination ) operator changed a little the " official " evolution strategy notation , adding a new parameter :
The number of individuals involved in recombination , ρ .
Then , the aforesaid notations would be : ( μ/ρ , λ ) - ES and ( μ/ρ + λ) - ES , ρ can be set up to μ ( ρ = μ ) , what permits multi-individual crossover .
There are two types of crossover : Intermediary and discrete .
The first one is just a centroid calculation or the center of mass .
The intermediary crossover scheme :
The other scheme is a simple random selection following a coordinate wise procedure .
The discrete crossover scheme :
In a paper from 1995 , Hans - Paul Schwefel and Günter Rudolph proposed what they calledand included another parameter into the notation :
The lifespan , represented by κ .
The new notation would be ( μ/ρ , λ , κ ) - ES .
That new parameter is important because it would avoid a candidate solution of surviving forever and trapping the search in local optima .
Recently , the derandomization approach has been incorporated into evolution strategies , such as CMA - ES , but this is other long story .
Along the time Rechenberg and Schwefel were developing the evolution strategy , in the other side of Atlantic Ocean there was another community investigating a similar algorithm .
The evolutionary computation communities in each side of the Atlantic Ocean would only meet in 1990 , at PPSN I ( Paralell Problem Solving from Nature , David Edward Goldberg helped to translate that conference name into English from the German ) .
But there was an " unofficial " meeting before this date , in 1989 David E. Goldberg and Yuval Davidor met in Germany , what could be considered the first encounter of both communities .
It is fair to say that when Rechenberg and Schwefel finished their respective PhD. dissertations , no one was aware of Professor John Holland 's pioneer work on genetic algorithms , that was made almost concurrently with the German evolution strategies .
The Germans even " missed " Holland 's seminal book Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems when it was published for the first time , but , later , both of them got aware of Holland 's work ( Schwefel gave Holland 's book as a birthday gift to Rechenberg ) .
Around 1969 - 1970 , Schwefel began to sistematically search for derivative free optimization methods and found interesting works that had , in essence , a similarity with evolutionary approaches : Schwefel tried to contact some of those researchers .
He first got into contact with Rastrigin , in Riga ( USSR ) and with Matyas in CSR -- Rastrigin even sent him a copy of a book ( monograph ) about a random search method he developed in which trials were done on the surface of a hypersphere .
Some years later , Schwefel got into contact with Bremermann , but was unable to maintain any academic connection due to the lack of Bremermman 's address .
Schwefel got some papers from and a copy of Lawrence J. Fogel 's book Artificial Intelligence Through Simulated Evolution
There were no important evelution strategy developments between 1976 and 1988 .
Schwefel began his professorship at University of Dortmund ( now Technical University of Dortmund ) in 1985 and evolutionary algorithms were just a minor topic inside the main branch named systems analysis .
The first student interested in evolutionary algorithms appeared only in 1989 , after hearing of genetic algorithms .
In the next decade ( 1990s ) , evolution strategy and evolutionary computation researchers focused their attentions to theoretical and complexity analysis of evolutionary algorithms and from those investigation have arisen the first steps to formalize evolutionary algorithms , despite disagreements between researchers .
The 1990s also saw the emergence of a new evolutionary based approach : Estimation of Distribution Algorithms
The kind of work Ingo Rechenberg , Hans - Paul Schwefel and Peter Bienert made in the 1960s can be considered an achievement that rarely happens during a lifetime .
After 45 years of hard work it is very beautiful to see their work has helped to establish a whole new research area and all the results investigators all around the world ( and , alas , other planets ) have got .
Nowadays , Ingo Rechenberg is the head of Bionik & Evolutionstechnik group at Technischen Universität Berlin .
Peter Bienert works with him there .
Hans - Paul Schwefel is now retired from the former systems analysis chair ( now algorithm engineering ) at University of Dortmund .
He is an emeritus professor at Dortmund .

In his decision yesterday , Judge Kennelly said there had been no comparable confirmation by the government or AT&T of “ the existence or nonexistence of AT&T ’s claimed record turnover . ”
He refused to rely on news accounts of the program as proof of its existence and noted that “ no executive branch official has officially confirmed or denied the existence of any program to obtain large quantities of customer telephone records . ”
The case was brought by the journalist Studs Terkel , five other individual plaintiffs and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois .
They argued that the program violated a federal law that forbids the disclosure of some customer records to the government , and they sought a court order to stop it .
Among the papers the government submitted to Judge Kennelly to urge the dismissal of the case on state secrets grounds was a declaration from John D. Negroponte , the director of national intelligence .
“ Even confirming that a certain intelligence activity or relationship does not exist , either in general or with respect to specific targets or channels , ” Mr. Negroponte said , “ would cause harm to the national security because alerting our adversaries to channels or individuals that are not under surveillance could likewise help them avoid detection . ”
Judge Kennelly noted his “ great antipathy ” for dismissing the suit .
“ Nothing in this opinion , ” he wrote , “ prevents the plaintiffs from using the legislative process , not to mention their right of free speech , to seek further inquiry by the executive and legislative branches into the allegations in their complaint . ”
More than 30 lawsuits over government surveillance programs are pending in the nation .
Only one , in Detroit , has moved beyond questions of procedure and privilege to consider the legality of the wiretapping program .
A decision in that case is expected soon .

「自分を変えられるのは自分しかいない」。2006年9月5日，ソフトウエア開発プロセスの一つ，eXtreme
Programming （XP）を提唱しているKent Beck氏を囲んで記者懇談会が開催された。自分が変われば，必ずまわりは変わる。そんな信念が感じられた懇談会だった。
Beck氏の著書であ る 「 XPエクストリーム・プログラミング入門 第 2 版 」 は「 XP is about social change .
」という文章で始まっている。日本語版では「XPとは社会改革のことである」と訳されているが，ソーシャルのニュアンスが少し違うという意見もある。そこでまず「XPでいうソーシャルとはどういう意味か」と質問した。
Beck氏はソーシャルの例として「 14歳になる私の娘は，ある友人と1時間くらい話をし，別の友人と同じ話をまた1時間くらいする。彼女はソーシャルな子供だ」と語った。つまり「社交的」
「コミュニケーションの能力がある」といったニュアンスである。
一方，プログラマは，人よりコンピュータと付き合う時間の方が長く，一般にはあまり“ ソーシャル” ではない。Beck氏も以前は 「 自分がパーフェクトなプログラマであれば，プロジェクトは問題なくうまくいく」と考えていたという。「こういうことを言ったほうがいいとか，こんなことを言ったらおもしろいといったことを考えたことはなかった」（同氏）。ところが，15年ほど前に「プログラミングだけでなく，まわりを取り巻く様々な要素に着目することで，プログラミング自体が大きく変わる」ということに気付いたという。コンピュータのテクニックだけでなく，コミュニケーションのスキルを身に付ける必要性を感じたのだ。つまり「social change」である。
例えば，コミュニケーションには，言葉以外にも，アイコンタクト，言葉のトーン，言葉の選択，ボディランゲージ，といった様々な要素があるという。ただ「誰でも変化には抵抗感がある」（Beck氏）。自身も，コミュニケーションの能力を身に付けようと努力するなかで，納得できないやり方がいろいろあったという。同氏は「娘は自然にソーシャルな能力を身に付けた。これに対し，私は違ったやり方，経験のないやり方をしなければならず困難もあった」と振り返る。それでも「特性，適性度にかかわらず，学ぶことはできる」と強調する。
「 XPを広めるにはどうしていけばいいか」という質問に対しては，Beck氏は「まずは努力して自分を変える」ことだと答えた。「自分が変わることによって，立ち居振る舞いや行動がどう変わったかを人に見せる。その変化がどれだけプラスの方向に働いているかを証明する。自分がよい方向に変われば，対人関係もよくなる。そこから信頼が生まれる。そこまでいけば，まわりは『自分も変わってみようか』と思う」（同氏）。「相手を説得しよう，相手が言うことを覆して自分が言うことを納得させよう」という態度では決して伝わらないのである。「まわりの人間のどこが悪い，ここが悪いという点に注目するのではなく，ポジティブな方向性でよりよくものごとを変えていく」という心構えが必要だという。
Beck氏は，アーキテクト，プログラマ，テスターといった古典的な役割分担の弊害にも触れた。「分業体制では，責任を分けることで，その部分しか責任を負わないことになってしまう」というのだ。ただ「5年前，10年前にはプログラマはテストを書いていなかった。ところが，今は書いている。役割分担に対する見直しが起こっている」（同氏）。
重要なの は 「
すべての人々が責任を持って開発に携わる」ことである。Beck氏は，それを示す一つの逸話を紹介した。1960年代のNASAの掃除担当者にある人が「あなたの仕事は何ですか」とインタビューしたところ，その人は「私の仕事は人類を月に送ることだ」と答えたという。同氏は「トイレを掃除しています，コードを書いています，テストを書いています，ということではなく，最終的なゴールを全員が共有する」ことが大切だと語った。
No high - level officials have been prosecuted for the atrocities in Darfur
The ban comes as the chief prosecutor from the International Criminal Court told the UN Security Council that he wanted more co-operation from Sudan .
Luis Moreno Ocampo said he had identified mass killings and rape but had not decided who to prosecute .
Some two million people have fled their homes in the three - year Darfur war .
Sudan 's Justice Minister Muhammad Ali al - Mardi told the BBC that the ICC had no jurisdiction to try Sudanese nationals .
" We have the national law authority ...
The government is willing and able to try to these cases , " he said .
President targeted
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says only a few low - level military officers have faced charges over the violence in Darfur , which has left tens of thousands dead .
Millions of people have been displaced by the conflict
An earlier investigation by a UN - appointed commission drew up a list of 51 possible suspects for alleged war crimes in Darfur .
But Mr Ocampo said the ICC would conduct its own investigations and no decision had been taken as to whom to prosecute .
On Monday , lobby group Human Rights Watch called for senior Sudanese officials - including the president - to be investigated for crimes against humanity in Darfur .
Its latest report names more than a dozen civilian and military officials it says helped co-ordinate militias and armed forces who attacked civilians .
It adds that the leadership in Khartoum relied on the civilian administration , the military and Janjaweed militias to implement a counter - insurgency policy that deliberately targeted civilians .
A Sudanese official dismissed the report as " ridiculous " and " baseless " .
Sudan 's government has said that the violence in Darfur is a tribal conflict and the attacks are carried out by militias and rebels .
It denies that the state has co-ordinated the violence .

Did you know that Paul McCartney , the ex-Beatle , never actually left the band because . . . he died in 1966 and was then replaced by a lookalike ?
It sounds bizarre , and it is .
The " Paul is dead " myth is one of the most popular myths set in the world of rock music and perhaps the most fun to follow up .
It all began on October 12 , 1969 , when Russ Gibb , a DJ for Detroit 's underground station WKNR - FM , received a phone call by a man named " Tom , " who claimed that some Beatles records contained hidden clues suggesting that Paul McCartney had actually died .
The evidence for a conspiracy revolved around the theory that Paul had been decapitated in an automobile wreck after he left Abbey Road studios in London , where the Beatles recorded their music .
Paul had apparently left upset over an argument with the other Beatles , took his Aston Martin sportscar , and perished in a horrible accident that killed him .
This accident supposedly took place at 5 a.m. on November 9 , 1966 , and was caused by a hitchhiker named Rita who Paul had picked up along the road .
With Paul 's death , however , a big problem arose : the Beatles were at the peak of their career and the loss of one of their members would mean the end of the show for them and for the industry behind them .
Thus , somebody had the idea of never revealing Paul 's death and hiring an impostor in his place , somebody who looked like him and could play music .
Some sources claimed that the imposter was an actor named William Campbell , the winner of a Paul McCartney lookalike contest and , conveniently , an orphan from Edinburgh .
Of course , it did n't hurt to assume that Campbell could write the same type of songs as McCartney and just happened to have the same voice .
The arrival of an impostor in November 1966 , then , could have explained why the Beatles stopped touring that same year ( it would have been too easy to spot a fake McCartney performance on stage ) and started to grow moustaches ( the face was almost identical , but not perfect : it needed some disguise ) .
However , this terrible secret generated in the remaining Beatles , John Lennon , George Harrison , and Ringo Starr , a strong sense of guilt and induced them to insert many hints and clues to the truth in their songs and album covers .
I buried Paul
What had revealed the existence of a conspiracy to the mysterious " Tom " was the publication , two weeks before his telephone call , of the Beatles 's latest album , titled Abbey Road .
The album cover showed the four Beatles walking in a single file across the now - famous crosswalk at Abbey Road .
This was thought to symbolize a funeral procession : John Lennon , dressed in white , represented the Church ( and white is the traditional color of mourning in many Eastern cultures ) ;
Ringo , dressed in black , represented the undertaker .
Paul was out of step with the other three Beatles , with his eyes closed and barefoot : in a number of societies , it appears that corpses are buried without their shoes ; furthermore , Paul held a cigarette in his right hand , when everybody knew that the real McCartney was left - handed !
George Harrison , last in line , was dressed in work clothes and , to many , represented the gravedigger .
On the street there is also a parked Volkswagen Beetle whose license plate shows an eerie message : " LMW 28 IF , " interpreted to mean that Paul would have been 28 if he had lived .
The fact that Paul was actually 27 years old when Abbey Road was released does n't seem to make much difference , for in far Eastern societies ( the Beatles had quite a fascination with the Far East ) an individual 's birth included the time spent in the mother 's womb .
In that case , Paul would indeed have been 28 .
These " revelations " quickly launched an unprecedented outbreak of hysteria in the pop world and in the media , as more and more " clues " were found in previous Beatles records .
First of all , the clue - diggers looked at Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , the first album that the Beatles recorded after Paul 's supposed demise .
Released on June 1 , 1967 , the record was among the most influential in music history .
The cover , another famous picture , showed the four Beatles dressed in band uniforms , gathered around a bass drum bearing the album title and with a crowd of cut - out people around them .
It proved to be a goldmine for clue - diggers .
Again , the spectators resembled the mourners at a funeral and the flowers in front of them not only spelled the word " Beatles , " but also a set of yellow hyacinths formed the shape of a left - handed bass guitar , McCartney 's instrument .
Paul had a right hand raised above his head : again , supposedly , in certain Far Eastern societies , this was a symbol of death .
Also , while the other Beatles held bright , golden , band instruments , Paul held a black clarinet : another supposed symbol of mourning ?
A doll wore a striped " Welcome the Rolling Stones " sweatshirt : on her leg there is a small model car , strongly resembling an Aston Martin that seems to be heading towards the word " Stones . "
Perhaps a hint of the accident ?
If you then held a flat mirror perpendicular to the center of the words " Lonely Hearts " appearing on the bass drum this hidden message appeared : " I ONE IX HE ‡ DIE " .
" I ONE IX " is a direct reference to the supposed fatal crash day ( 11/9/66 ) , " HE " refers to Paul , as the diamond that points directly to McCartney confirms , " DIE " .
In the open album jacket , the Beatles appear still in the Sgt. Pepper 's uniforms and McCartney wore an arm patch that read " OPD " : an abbreviation for " Officially Pronounced Dead " ?
This was also the first album in history that included the lyrics to the songs appearing in the record , and they were published on the back cover , along with a picture of the four Beatles in their outfits .
Strangely , Paul is the only one turning his back to the camera , and also strange is the fact that George 's thumb points to the opening lines of " She 's Leaving Home . "
The lyric states : " Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins , " another reference to the day and time of Paul 's fatal accident ?
In another song of the album , " A Day in the Life , " John sings " He blew his mind out in a car , " and in another , " Good Morning , Good Morning , " he starts by singing : " Nothing to do to save his life " ( and was the title a play on the words " morning " and " mourning " ? )
And what about " Lovely Rita " ?
Was the song a reference to the girl that caused Paul 's death ?
Could be , since in it McCartney ( or the imposter ) sings : " Took her home and nearly made it . "
More clues were also found in subsequent albums .
The Magical Mystery Tour cover showed the Beatles dressed in animal costumes .
In the center was a black walrus and , in certain Scandinavian countries , a walrus is considered a harbinger of death .
Was the imposter dressed in the walrus skin ?
Apparently not , for John Lennon sings in the album the song titled " I am the Walrus . "
But on the album cover , as if scribbled later , the complete title appears to be : " I am the Walrus ( ‘ No You 're Not ! ' Said Little Nicola ) . "
So who was the walrus ?
In a later Beatles release ( titled simply The Beatles , the record became better known as the White Album because the cover was plain white ) , in a song titled " Glass Onion , " Lennon sings : " Well here 's another clue for you all , the walrus was Paul " !
On the booklet included in Magical Mystery Tour , the clues abounded : Paul is shoeless in some pictures , is the only one to wear a black flower on his lapel while the others are red , has a hand above his head in various pictures , and he even sits behind a sign stating " I Was . "
Near the end of the song " Strawberry Fields Forever , " upon careful listening , a faint voice stated something like " I buried Paul . "
You could also turn the Magical Mystery Tour album jacket upside - down and look at its reflection in the mirror : the title , detailed as stars , became the digits to a phone number .
The rumor further explained that if the numbers were dialed , the listener would get the true details of Paul McCartney 's death .
On the White Album , if you listened to a strange murmuring following the song " I'm So Tired , " you could n't make out what it said .
But , should you decide to play the record backwards the words became something like : " Paul is dead now , miss him , miss him , miss him . "
Nothing compared to the chilling revelations of " Revolution No. 9 , " where , after reversing the song , you could hear a voice saying : " Turn me on dead man , " and then the sound of a terrible collision , the sounds of crackling flames and a voice screaming " Let me out !
Let me out ! "
A recreation of Paul 's terrible accident ?
" My death ?
An exaggeration "
It seems unimaginable that the American public would believe such an unfounded rumor .
However , this same generation had been raised on the idea that there may have been a conspiracy to kill President John F. Kennedy and that the Warren Commission had actually worked to hide this fact from the public .
Would it be so impossible , then , to believe that Paul McCartney 's death may have been hidden from the public ?
The rumors became so noisy that Paul McCartney himself had to reassure his fans that he was still alive .
In an exclusive interview with Life magazine ( November 7 , 1969 ) he stated , paraphrasing Mark Twain , that " Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated .
However , if I was dead , I 'm sure I 'd be the last to know . "
He also offered a number of explanations for the mysterious clues .
The OPD patch he wore on Sgt. Pepper 's actually meant " Ontario Police Department " ; he wore a black flower in Magical Mystery Tour because they had run out of red ones ; it was John wearing the walrus outfit and , on Abbey Road , he was barefoot only because it was a hot day .
Other " clues " had similar simpler explanations : John did not say " I buried Paul " at the end of " Strawberry Fields " but , as can be clearly heard now on a clearer take of the song in Anthology 3 , he says " cranberry sauce . "
However , while it is true that most clues can be easily attributed to coincidence and wishful thinking , there are little things that must have been put there by the Beatles for some purpose , like the various " walrus " claims , the backward messages , and some other hints in the album covers .
It may just be , as John Lennon said , that they only wanted to have a laugh at the expense of those critics reading cryptic messages in everything they did .
What is sadly true is the fact that Charles Manson and his " family " also believed that there were hidden messages in Beatles songs hinting at the Armageddon .
He thought that the Fab Four were actually angels sent by God to reveal the secrets of the approaching apocalypse and that , in order to start the end of the world , they needed Manson 's help .
This is the tragically absurd reasoning he gave for the murder of Sharon Tate , the pregnant wife of film director Roman Polanski , and the guests she was hosting at their house in Hollywood .
According to R. Gary Patterson , author of the well - researched " The Walrus Was Paul " ( New York : Fireside , 1996 ) , " Perhaps the Beatles became concerned that if they admitted to planting clues they could very well be charged in some sort of conspiracy that would indirectly link them to the Manson murders .
Perhaps it would be much safer to give up the hoax and deny it ever happened .
This way , the Beatles would be safe from any lawsuit implicating the band members . "
Perhaps .
In a lighter vein , however , the rumor also helped to further boost the sale of the Beatles catalog and inspired a lot of cartoons and comedy skits , like one that was presented on The Ed Sullivan Show on Februrary 23 , 1970 , involving two angels in heaven :
Angel One :
Is there any truth to the rumor that Paul McCartney is still alive ?
Angel Two : I doubt it .

TWO shifty businessmen and one huge bodyguard carrying a large bag enter Vladikavkaz airport , a stone 's throw from the cemetery in which the victims of last year 's terrorist atrocity at Beslan are buried .
They whisper to an airport official , who takes their documents and sees to their check - in .
The three men and their un - X - rayed bag are next seen heading for their plane from a side door in the terminal .
Caught out by an obscure regulation , a driver tells a Moscow traffic policeman that he wants to settle things quickly , but without breaking the law .
“ Too many things are illegal in our country , ” grumbles the cop , implying that a more sensible government would make bribery legal as well as universal .
So how much does he want ?
“ Give me what your soul tells you . ”
Those recent examples are from your correspondent 's experience — but corruption in Russia is everywhere .
Often , it seems not a by - product of policy and events , but the main reason for them , a stronger force even than resurgent nationalism .
It poisons people 's relations with the police , bureaucrats and politicians ( see chart ) .
And it appears to be getting worse .
Being covert , the precise dimensions of corruption are hard to measure .
But trends are discernible .
In the latest international “ corruption perceptions index ” produced by Transparency International ( TI ) , a watchdog , Russia has fallen to rank alongside Niger , Sierra Leone and Albania .
A recent survey by Indem , a Russian think - tank , found an enormous hike , since 2001 , in the number and size of bribes given by young men and their families to avoid conscription and , relatedly , in those paid to get into universities .
( Fixing a court case , Indem found , has got a bit cheaper . )
Within the armed forces , the graft is astonishing .
Andrei , a conscript from Novosibirsk , recalls that his unit was forced to raise cash to buy a car for an officer , by begging and selling purloined military kit .
Russia 's defence minister was recently obliged to issue a special order designed to stop officers hiring troops out as day labourers , and using them to build dachas .
Indem 's most controversial finding was a surge in the volume of bribes paid by businesses , to a total amounting to more than double the federal budget .
An exaggeration perhaps ; but most businessmen confirm the deterioration .
The difference now , says the boss of one building firm , is that bureaucrats take the cash , but do n't then interpret the opaque regulations in the way they had promised — the most economically damaging kind of corruption , according to academic studies .
Forbidden means expensive
Another Moscow - region developer estimates that 10 % of his costs go in bribes : a project requires 50 licences , and every licence needs a bribe .
“ It 's like the last days of Pompeii , ” he says , adding that at least the uniformed extortionists have squeezed out the organised bandits .
Big business is less talkative , but no cleaner .
Nigeria was good training for Russia , says a western executive .
To put it in another way , Russia is a country where top state officials live luxuriously and make decisions which have no innocent explanation .
Faced with a problem that it cannot credibly deny , the usual Kremlin approach is to say that it is not a problem for Russia alone .
This has been President Vladimir Putin 's attitude to corruption ; it is , he says , an issue in all transitional countries .
But Russian corruption has some peculiar characteristics .
It is partly an age - old function of the country 's size and poverty : the tsar in Tolstoy 's “ Hadji Murad ” is convinced it is “ a characteristic of officials to steal ” .
Communism bequeathed little regard for private property or civic duty , and left big networks of patronage dating back to institutions such as the KGB .
Next came wholesale privatisation amid weak regulation , and lots of oil money .
An optimistic view is that these effects will wear off .
Indem did find that even as state officials get greedier , public aversion grows — for instance over the cost of “ free ” hospital care ( though some bribes may simply have become unaffordable ) .
But Russian corruption does n't just make life inconvenient , or hold back the economy : it kills people .
When two aircraft blew up after taking off from Moscow last year , investigations revealed many ways in which bombs could be put on planes for cash .
After the Beslan attack , reporters in Moscow proved it was possible to obtain official documents while using a photograph of Aslan Maskhadov , the Chechen leader who was later killed .
The Beslan hostage - takers are thought to have bribed their way across internal borders .
And how did over a hundred militants gather and arm themselves before launching the city - wide battle that struck Nalchik , not far from Beslan , last week ?
“ How can we withstand terrorism , ” asks Vladimir Lukin , the human - rights ombudsman , “ with such a level of corruption ? ”
It has also prolonged and aggravated the terrorists ' main grievance : the conflict in Chechnya .
Poor as the region is , it is lucrative : there are kidnappings , many of them , says Mr Lukin , corruption - related ; embezzlement of reconstruction money ; smuggling ; and even , it is said , arms sales by the army to insurgents .
Elsewhere in Russia , security services are said to control poaching and prostitution .
Across the north Caucasus , corrupt local elites have monopolised the economy .
The new president of Kabardino - Balkaria , of which Nalchik is the capital , this week conceded that unemployment and “ not being able to start up one 's own business without links to the authorities ” had pushed youngsters towards militant Islam .
The cost in lives is one reason why corruption in Russia is not , as some say , an efficient way to live with over - regulation .
Corruption , says Mikhail Grishankov , chair of a parliamentary anti-corruption committee , offers the same efficiency as the justice system in “ The Godfather ” .
Paying up encourages further extortion , ultimately raising costs all round .
Worse , the traffic policeman who takes your bribe may take one next from a drunk — or a terrorist .
In a country where money talks , it is easy to deliver a bomb , says Elena Panfilova , of TI 's Russian chapter .
Corruption , says Georgy Satarov of Indem , is like pain , a symptom of other problems .
In Russia , they include a neutered parliament , subservient ( and sometimes intimidated ) media and a suborned judiciary .
But experience elsewhere suggests that measures short of wholesale democratisation have some impact .
Rasma Karklins , of the University of Illinois at Chicago , says “ islands of integrity ” can be established in regions or institutions ; high - profile prosecutions can help .
Since corruption was a key motive behind the revolutions that have ousted three post - Soviet regimes in the last two years , the Kremlin should worry .
It has tried raising some official salaries ; corrupt bureaucrats , like the taxman arrested in Moscow this week for soliciting a $ 1 m bribe , are sometimes punished .
But in general what Ms Karklins calls a system of “ mutual blackmail ” seems to prevail .
Officials are promoted because of , not in spite of , their corruption , which makes them pliable .
“ A corrupt official is a more loyal official , ” says Ms Panfilova .
Punishment happens when spoils are n't shared , or an official steps on to somebody else 's turf .
Consider Mikhail Kasyanov , prime minister and head of the ( inert ) presidential anti-corruption council until his ouster last year .
After signalling his own presidential dreams , Mr Kasyanov faced damaging allegations — of corruption .

What is it about today 's school system that so many find unsatisfactory ?
Why have generations of reformers failed to improve the educational system , and , indeed , caused it to degenerate further and further into an ever declining level of mediocrity ?
In this radical and scholarly monograph , out of print for two decades and restored according to the author 's original , Murray N. Rothbard identifies the crucial feature of our educational system that dooms it to fail : at every level , from financing to attendance , the system relies on compulsion instead of voluntary consent .
Certain consequences follow .
The curriculum is politicized to reflect the ideological priorities of the regime in power .
Standards are continually dumbed - down to accommodate the least common denominator .
The brightest children are not permitted to achieve their potential , the special needs of individual children are neglected , and the mid-level learners become little more than cogs in a machine .
The teachers themselves are hamstrung by a political apparatus that watches their every move .
Rothbard explores the history of compulsory schooling to show that none of this is accident .
The state has long used compulsory schooling — backed by egalitarian ideology — as a means of citizen control .
In contrast , a market - based system of schools would adhere to a purely voluntary ethic , financed with private funds , and administered entirely by private enterprise .
An interesting feature of this book is its promotion of individual — or home — schooling , long before the current popularity of the practice .
As Kevin Ryan of Boston University points out in the introduction , if education reform is ever to bring about fundamental change , it will have to begin with a complete rethinking of public schooling that Rothbard offers here .
From time to time , I get dragged into the Mac OS X Console application .
Either it ’s because I ’m printing debugging output via NSLog and Xcode has suddenly stopped showing it in the “ Run ” window , or I ’ve just started seeing some wiggy stuff happen with my computer and I need to check under the hood .
What starts out as an innocent enough expedition often ends up with me scratching my head about something else I see in the Console log .
This is the festering trash heap where every programmer ’s worst “ it could n’t really happen ” nightmare output goes .
Well , there ’s also a lot of annoying “ forgot to remove the NSLog ” type innocuous output there , too .
But at any rate , I usually feel a little ashamed that I was n’t aware earlier that such and such app has been unable to open a window for the past 3 days .
I wish I could keep up with this stuff , but I do n’t want to be one of those nerds who leaves the Console window open all the time just waiting for junk to happen .
I want to live !
So I had an idea .
I ’ll track this junk the way I track all the other junk .
With NetNewsWire !
What is syndication for ?
It ’s for packaging data in a format conducive to my computer tracking changes in junk over time .
I want to “ subscribe ” to my Console log .
What I ’ve come up with is sort of an embarrassing hack , but it does kind of work :
But wait a minute .
If it ’s an embarrassing hack , then should n’t I keep my mouth shut ?
Why would I want to go spreading my half - assed solutions across the Internet ?
Is n’t that bad marketing ?
Yes , but I have ulterior motives :
I sort of want to show it off , anyway .
I need your help .
Yes , you !
I need your geeky , unixy , sysloggy help .
I ’ve got this fun little hack , which I ’m now prepared to let you download , because you ’ve read along so patiently .
What are you downloading ?
It ’s a small shell tool whose only purpose is to translate your Console log into RSS format .
You get no options .
You just run it , and hope that you like what you see .
If you ’re using NetNewsWire , you can “ subscribe ” directly to the executable .
So just put the file somewhere on your disk , and then select “ New Special Subscription … ” from the File menu .
You have to tell NetNewsWire that it ’s a “ Script , ” and then you have to tell it that it ’s a “ Shell Script , ” even though it ’s a binary executable .
Now update and see your last 30 console “ chunks ” directly from NetNewsWire .
What ’s a chunk ?
Aha !
Yes , this is where you and the “ help ” thing come into play .
One of the problems with syndicating something large and unwieldy is figuring out how to glom together related items .
It would be overwhelming to the point of uselessness if every single line in the Console ended up as a separate feed item .
So I have to try to be clever .
What I ’m doing right now roughly follows this logic : starting at the end of the file , move up line by line , collecting lines into a “ chunk ” until a line “ looks like ” it belongs to a particular application .
Once a particular application is identified , keep moving up the file , until a line that does n’t identify an application , or that identifies a different application , appears .
Sounds complicated , huh ?
Yeah , well that was the easy part .
That works great when output looks like this :
See – that ’s the “ dream chunk . ”
It is so easy to parse .
I could even turn the timestamp into a feed item timestamp .
It ’s just to beautiful .
Then you run into examples like these ( grouped together for convenience of presentation ) :
Bad boys like this pop up all the time .
Is n’t somebody in charge here ?
Argh – different application services are allowing logging to happen that follows different or no conventions .
So my happy little “ chunk things together ” strategy starts to fall apart .
So I drop this funny little hack in your lap in the hopes that you ’ll be inspired to try it out , and if you ’re just the kind of thing who enjoys this kind of analysis , you ’ll help me come up with a systematic approach for “ chunking ” the Console log .
The real problems are when there ’s some really well - defined line like the Xcode examples given above , followed by a dozen lines of output that were spewed by that program ’s last “ well - defined ” timestamped log -point .
I suppose I could compromise and just say “ all unidentifiable stuff ” goes into a chunk of its own .
Then you ’d end up with random spewage orphaned from its owner , but it would still be temporally near and therefore show up contiguously in the feed .
A new logic for the tool might be :
Look at this line , does it “ look like it starts with a date ” and “ have a decimal number in square brackets ” ?
If so , try to find lines above it with the same number in the square brackets .
Put all of these lines into a feed item with a date of the bottom - most line .
Look at this line , does it look unidentifiable ?
If so , group it with unidentifiable lines above it until I regain sanity .
For consistency , give this feed item the same date as either the chunk below or the chunk above .
I ’d be particularly curious to hear the opinions of anybody who ’s done this kind of log file parsing before .
Heck , one of you is probably going to post a link to something that already does exactly this .
That would be beautiful !
I ’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts .

Ben Klemens has written a book , Math You Can't Use , on copyrights , patents and software , specifically on the problem of subject matter expansion in patent law in the last decade .
Klemens has thought of yet another convincing reason why software patents are counterproductive .
When I heard about the book , I asked him if I could share a chapter with you .
He , and the Brookings Institution , graciously agreed , and they picked Chapter 6 [ PDF ] , " The Decentralized Software Market " , which they have also put up on the Brookings Bookstore site if you prefer a pdf .
I know you guys , though , and I know some of you would rather read it here than click on a link , so here it is .
Keep in mind this is copyrighted material , not under the Creative Commons license .
I did n't know until they sent me the chapter that Groklaw is mentioned in a footnote . : )
I found it interesting , because it raised an issue I had n't thought of before .
Software is n't produced like tractors .
There are only a few tractor companies , relatively speaking , but almost every corporation has programmers inhouse , making software a decentralized market , with a lot of software being written specially for companies who are not in the software business .
How do you keep track of patents in that kind of atmosphere ?
It makes the patent process , which works well for tractors , counterproductive for most software , because it compels businesses to keep up to date on patents regarding their core business , whatever it is , and then on software too , which is being written by everyone out there , raising transaction costs :
If a technology needs a centralized group to help it advance , then it makes sense to design a mechanism to support those few specialized experts who push forward the frontiers .
In such a field , the patent - thicket problem is not a problem because there are only a few actors in the business , so the transaction costs of negotiating exchanges are low .
But this story is entirely removed from the reality of software .
A third of the industry consists of centralized organizations that only write software while the rest is largely a decentralized body of workers supporting themselves and their innovations through immediate , direct application rather than waiting to put out a product in the near future .
As far as Coasian arguments about transaction costs are concerned , this is absolutely the worst case , since buyers and sellers are distributed across the planet .
Because every patent is unique , there is no easy way to create a simple market to make patent trading cheap .
The rule that independent invention is not a defense in infringement claims makes sense in a centralized industry .
Patents are public record , and it is reasonable to assume that every tractor manufacturer is exerting some effort to watch every other such manufacturer .
In the decentralized software industry , this does not make any sense at all : should the sofa company spend time and effort on monitoring Microsoft and Novells patent portfolio ?
Add in the software patent search problems from chapter 5 , and the assumption that everyone has full knowledge of the patent playing field becomes still more tenuous .
In short , patents in a decentralized market are Coases worst nightmare : every player needs to expend vast quantities searching for the owner of every part of every program , meaning transaction costs piled upon transaction costs .
These costs will always exist in every field , but they are magnified in a dense , decentralized network of actors .
There is one segment of the software market that he says does benefit from patents .
Klemens : Patents favor the shrink - wrap market , which is the segment of the market likely to experience a decline .
In this context , software patent laws are among those that economists despise most : namely , laws that artificially prop up an industry in decline ....
From the perspective of society , and even the software industry as a whole , there is no need to protect the shrink - wrap segment of the market , or to change the rules to favor it over the labor - oriented segment .
Yet that is exactly what software patents do , at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars wasted in litigation .
Ben Klemens is a guest scholar at the Center on Social and Economic Dynamics at the Brookings Institution , where he writes programs to perform quantitative analyses and policy - oriented simulations .
He also consults for the World Bank on intellectual property in the developing world and computer - based simulations of immigration policy .
On the same subject of patents and subject matter expansion , PubPat.org has filed an amicus brief [ PDF ] with the Supreme Court in an important case currently pending before the Court , Laboratory Corporation v. Metabolite Labs , that involves the extent to which patents may cover abstract ideas , laws of nature and natural phenomenon .
As the Pubpat press release explains , " Supreme Court precedent states such fundamental truths and abstract thoughts are not patent eligible , but lower courts have ignored that precedent and held that ' anything ' can be patented . "
Here , then , is Chapter 6 .
If you like it and want to read more , you can buy the book at the Brookings Bookstore .
I 've coded it so that you can click on the footnotes and then click to come back to your place in the chapter .
One final word : some of what he writes in this chapter is ironic , not to be taken literally .
I mention that because I write with irony sometimes myself , and I know some people simply do n't get irony and tend to take it literally .
That results in distressed emails , which requires time to explain the joke and ... well , send all such email to him , please , not to me .

Math You Can't Use -
Patents , Copyrights , and Software
~ by Ben Klemens , Guest Scholar , Brookings Institution CHAPTER 6 The Decentralized Software Market
The world of software engineering is in no way restricted to software companies .
Beyond Microsoft or thousands of smaller software vendors , almost every corporation in the world keeps a stable of programmers in the basement to write little scripts that move the companys e-mail and make the add to cart button do what it should .
I am a programmer because I write simulations and statistical analyses .
Even you are a software programmer if you use the Record Macro feature of your spreadsheet or word processor .
The variety in types of software producers engenders two distinct methods of pricing software .
One , shrink - wrap pricing , derives from more ephemeral markets : software is sold by the unit ( packaged in shrink - wrapped boxes , for example ) at a per unit cost .
The other , labor oriented pricing , follows from an hourly wage or an annual salary paid to people in the basement who write code .
To give a music analogy : a band may record an album in the studio and then charge for each copy of the recording , or it can be paid for playing a live gig , and then audience members can bootleg the concert and listen at home for free .
Both are viable means of making recordings for the public and money for the band .
The latest accounting from the Bureau of Economic Analysis divides the software market into three parts : retail , consultants , and in - house , which are evenly split in the U.S. economy .
Of the $ 232.5 billion spent on software in 2002 , 32.6 percent bought prepackaged programs , 36.4 per cent custom - built ones , and 31.0 percent software written in - house .
Since patent law is built around traditional products that are much more homogeneous , it is worth considering what will happen when the law for primarily product - oriented markets ( such as drugs , machinery , and materials ) is applied to a market that is one - third product oriented , one - third service oriented , and one - third a mix of the two .
Comparative Advantage and the Programmers in the Basement A good company , according to the management self - help books , stays focused on its core functions .
If a company is good at making orange juice , it does not digress into selling autos , even if the owner knows an awful lot about cars .
But any business of more than a few people , regardless of its actual purpose , will need word processors , an accounting and inventory system attached to a database , a website , e-mail , and somewhere from one person to an entire department to take care of all that software .
By contrast , no companies have a drug manufacturer in the basement to make sure that the accounting department has all the Prozac it needs to function smoothly , and if the accountants find that off - the - shelf Prozac does not quite work , they cannot hire a chemist to hack , patch , or customize Prozac for the companys specialized needs .
Yet no matter how much work is shifted to Microsoft , SAP , or other contractors , it will always come down to the in - house information technology ( IT ) department to make sure the companys software is installed and working properly .
Although they are often invisible ( until something breaks ) , the people in the basement are an integral part of the software industry .
The Communists Are Coming !
What happens to the software in the basement after it is written ?
Most software is so entirely location and task specific that it is used once and forgotten .
Sometimes , however , it is so useful and new that the programmers in the basement form a company and start selling CDsin fact , this is how a number of shrink - wrapped software products started out : for example , the SABRE flight reservation system ( originally written at American Airlines , now owned by SABRE Holdings ) , the CADAM design program ( originally from Lockheed , now owned by CADAM , Inc. ) , the Eudora e-mail client ( written at and used by the University of Illinois , now owned by Qualcomm ) , or GAMS mathematical modeling software ( written at the World Bank , now owned by GAMS Development ) .
With increasing frequency , software is also being given away to anyone who asks .
Locking down a piece of software to license and sell it is just not worth the effort in the vast majority of cases if a company has a comparative advantage in selling insurance or sofas , what business does it have in software consulting ?
It may have some great programmers in the basement , but hiring a sales team , getting the legal department up to speed on software licensing , and finding new ways to distribute software instead of sofas is a stretch far beyond the companys primary comparative advantage .
If a company is not hoping to make big profits from a piece of software , its best bet is to go to the other extreme and open the code base entirely , allowing for free and open collaboration .
There are programmers in hundreds of basements who need a good database client .
One writes the core of a database client and puts all the code out for inspection .
Then another programmer , ensconced in another basement , finds that the code does what her company needs but has a few bugs , which she fixes .
In another basement , another wage slave finds that the code works well , except it is missing support for BLOBs ( binary large objects ) , so she adds that .
The process continues , as everybody contributes the feature that makes the code perfect in their eyes , until for the time needed to write a few functions everyone has a full - featured and well tested database .
Such collaboration in software dates back to when there were a handful of computers in the United States and a small community of programmers who knew how to work them .
Since then collaboration has become infinitely easier thanks to the Internet .
Although some would claim that the collaborative system is the latest trend , shrink - wrapped software sold at unit cost is the new business model in this field .
It may sound like wishful thinking , but the collaborative method has produced some very heavy - duty software .
As of September 2005 , 69.15 percent of web sites use Apache , a free program developed in about the same manner as just described .
As well as web pages , ones e-mail probably arrives via collaborative software ( either Sendmail or IBM sponsored Postfix ) , and all the computers involved found each other via the Internet addressing program that most servers use , Berkeley Internet Name Daemon ( BIND ) , which is also free software .
Such software goes by a variety of names , including free software , libre software , open source software , or the catch - all FLOSS .
A report assessing the popularity of FLOSS in three European countries has found some variation in its use : only 18 percent of establishments in Sweden use some sort of open - source software ; 31 percent do so in the United Kingdom ; and 44 percent do in Germany .
Sectors also vary greatly in this regard , with public sector organizations using more open source software than those in the private sector .
Thirty - six percent of the companies surveyed agreed with the statement ,  Our software developers are free to work on Open Source projects within their time at work ,  while 46 percent disagreed .
In other words , the plurality of companies insist that their employees work remain the companys property , but a large percentage of for - profit enterprises allow some of their employees work to be given away for free .
Open - source programmers are often characterized as hobbyists who are learning computer science or just having fun with pet projects of no real significance .
Although some of them would certainly meet that description , a reported 29 percent of Europes open - source programmers are paid for developing free software at work , and 24 percent are not paid for doing so but do it on company time anyway .
Add to this the 17 percent of developers who are students , and only a few remain who are developing open - source software in their spare time .
The European Commission study states that  the development of Open Source / Free Software is not at all a matter of leisure work at home .
Ninety - five percent of the sample claim that they use OS / FS at work , school , or university . 
Making Money on Free Software
A number of little companies use free software to make money .
For example , IBM sells mainframes , but if it can throw in free software that makes its mainframes powerful web and e-mail servers , then it can move more metal .
In a similar vein , Sun gives away Java .
Another name on the list of success stories is Red Hat , which provides consulting services for corporations and creates neat packages of free software for consumers .
Hans Reiser , designer of the best UNIX file system ( the reiserfs ) , sells features : he has a to - do list of a dozen features that he wants to implement in his file system , but when the president of MP3.com offered him tens of thousands of dollars to implement a feature necessary for MP3.com business , he quickly obliged .
MP3.com saved millions of dollars by switching to free software using Reisers free file system , and Reiser profited from what he would have done anyway .
Collaborative software is clearly a threat to the shrink - wrapped software market , because , as the saying goes , it has to compete with free .
But for the labor - oriented side of the market , the wealth of ready - to - download software merely creates new opportunities .
Free Software and Optimal Pricing
What does economic theory say about free software written by profit maximizing firms ?
It says that this behavior is efficient .
In a free and open market with many competitors , each unit of a good should be priced at the cost of producing that very unit ( that is , the marginal cost ) .
The first unit of software requires some amount of labor , and that needs to be compensated in full by paying the programmer a salary or wage .
The second unit can be produced at basically no cost , since it only needs to be copied , so a zero price for the second unit and beyond is what the theory predicts and can be shown to be efficient .
Meanwhile , shrink - wrapped software is not priced by marginal cost , but closer to average costspend a million dollars making the first CD , then make ten thousand copies and charge $ 100 for each of them .
Since vendors have a copyright on their work , their software will differ in enough ways from that of their competitors to allow them to charge well above marginal cost for their products .
In practice , of course , products are seldom priced at marginal cost .
Few goods in this world are truly standardized , and even among those that are ( corn of a certain grade , or government bond futures , for example ) , some units still sell at well above marginal cost .
The amazing thing about open - source software , from the perspective of the theoretical economist , is that it actually fits the theory .
Most markets experience problems that theory must ignore or explain away : inventories , shipping costs , transaction costs , massive up - front investments , and the risks those imply .
Given such imperfections , it makes sense to correct them by imposing laws that would otherwise be suboptimal a primary example being patent law , which solves the up - front investment problem .
But collaborative software actually fits the models : transaction costs are nil , investment problems are solved without patents , and one can actually apply the theories that predict optimality without apology .
For open - source software , patents solve an economic problem that had not existed to begin with .
Open Source and Patents
Not only do patents have no value or relevance to open - source software , but they have the potential to be a significant hindrance .
By definition , open - source software lacks a centralized body through which to obtain patents , not to mention lawyers to defend against patent threats ( although both IBM and Sun made limited pledges to support open source authors in some patent - related issues , and even Lloyds of London intends to sell liability insurance for servers running open - source software ) .
Adobe can sue Macromedia and vice versa , and both can afford to hire lawyers to keep them in business , but if anyone were to sue a collaborative project that does not have a patron backing it , the project would have no choice but to shut down .
The collaborative system depends on the source being open to all and making sure that everyone is free to modify the code .
People who intend the code to be collaborative have an ingenious method of making it so : they copyright the code and claim complete control over its use .
Then , in licensing out the code , they explicitly specify that users are free to redistribute or modify the code as they see fit , provided they do not impose their own restrictions .
Although there are dozens of such contracts to choose from , the standard one delineating these rules is the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , where GNU stands for GNUs Not Unix .
Here is the key message from the GPL :  This program is free software ; you can redistribute it and / or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License . 
How would this work if some portion of the code were patented ?
If the patent - holder charges a licensing fee , the software cannot be costless any more .
If the software can be freely redistributed , the patent - holder must give up his or her right to limit distribution .
Since the software can be reworked into other applications , the patent holder even gives up the right to redistribution in a potentially wide range of applications .
Clearly , any patent - holder who wants to retain any vestige of control would not consent to a patent being used in GPLed code .
The GPL explicitly acknowledges that if a claim is asserted for patented code in a project , the project must shut down as a public endeavor :  If a patent license would not permit royalty - free redistributon of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you , then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program . 
In short , patents and collaborative software cannot coexist , and if the two collide , patents win .
Collaborative software does have one advantage over patents .
If a patent - holder threatens to shut down a collaborative project , the entire project may shift to finding prior art that would invalidate the patent .
With hundreds of people from diverse parts of the computer science world all focusing on searching for prior art , the odds are very high that something will turn up .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has used this strategy to locate prior art about items in its list of the worst software patents .
This approach still relies on a great deal of publicity , so if a specialized project receives a cease - and - desist letter or there is a flood of patent claims throughout the open - source community , the required critical mass of eyeballs required to find good prior art may not be reached .
Every web designer in the world could probably contribute something to a prior art search pertaining to Amazons infamous patent 5,960,411 , on one - click purchasing .
But if the GNU Scientific Library gets a takedown notice for violating one of the fast Fourier transform patents ( see page 63 ) , a far smaller population could come to the GSLs support .
Even if a community of users find prior art immediately , it still needs to be ruled upon by the courts or the U.S. Patent and Trade Office ( USPTO ) , which would take months ( in Internet Time , several centuries ) and may still fail on the details .
Many users would be too risk - averse to wait for the ruling and would stop using the technology until clarity is restored .
Much has been made of security risks to the Internet and the potential havoc a terrorist could cause by a well - placed worm , virus , or technical glitch that might bring down large parts of the network .
But here is the surest and simplest way to shut down the Internet : find a function or data structure in BIND or Apache that is under the scope of a patent , hire a lawyer , and start suing as many people as possible .
For BIND especially , there are few alternatives , and switching is technically difficult and who knows whether the alternatives are patent - free ?
Microsoft has even thrown out a few warnings that such lawsuits are inevitable for users of open source software .
Fortunately , the company provides its own operating system and server software ( IIS on Windows ) , which risk - averse companies can use to replace Apache on Linux , and provides indemnification protection by ( and from ) Microsofts legal department .
Indeed , at least one case ( J2 Global Communications v. Mijanda , Inc. ) has cropped up over alleged patent infringement by open source software used by the defendant .
Even a single function could lead to a patent suit , so lawsuit - averse programmers had best purchase function libraries from vendors instead of writing their own and glue them together using a purchased copy of Microsofts Visual Studio instead of a freely downloaded copy of the GNU Compiler Collection .
Perhaps the best bet is to simply stop writing programs entirely and purchase all software from those centralized vendors who own the patent thickets that can provide indemnification .
At one time , the labor market and the shrink - wrap market were in a balanced relationship : software companies sold their goods to the labor oriented side , which applied them to their projects , and everybody made money .
But now that there is a well - established and tested mechanism to allow the labor - oriented side to incrementally build the operating system and desktop - level software that is the specialty of the shrink - wrap vendor , the goods - oriented side of the couple has been spurned .
It is only natural that the goods - oriented side would use all of the weapons available to ensure that the labor side remains bound to the union .
Decentralization Another way to cast the difference between the goods - oriented and labor - oriented market is to say that the labor - oriented market is massively decentralized .
On one hand , there are only a few tractor companies , which maintain a full - time staff of the best and brightest .
If those central repositories of mechanical knowledge are not well supported , the tractor arts cannot advance .
There may be some inventive tinkerers cobbling together contraptions outside of these companies , but the vast majority of tractor technology is developed and supported by tractor vendors .
On the other hand , every basement of every corporation has its programmers , and they are producing fully operable software .
If I want a program to do any given function , say , convert document formats or implement a database , dozens or even hundreds of viable options are at my disposal , only a fraction of which were written by people at software companies .
The abundance of languages and libraries helps : for any given task , there are so many tools already in existence that a designer can have a basic running program rather quickly .
A wealth of database engines are lying around just for the taking , waiting to be built into larger devices ; the same certainly could not be said of tractor engines .
The structure of software also makes decentralized programming easy .
So long as he does not change the functions interface , a programmer can tweak , debug , and optimize the function implementation all he wants without affecting the other parts of the project that use the function .
This means that after the overall high - level design is done , there is little or no benefit to having all of the programmers in one place .
Of course , the fact that the product can be e-mailed instantaneously at zero cost helps as well .
I stress this decentralization because some pro-patent authors believe patent difficulties can be attributed entirely to the relationship between patents and open - source software .
Since open - source advocates are mere hobbyists on the fringe , they reason , one can safely ignore them and focus policy on the vendors of software .
As already mentioned , open - source software is neither written primarily by hobbyists nor produced on the fringe .
Even so , the central problem is not about open source , but about centralized versus decentralized production .
The best examples of decentralized production are indeed open source the Linux kernel was written by 418 programmers from 35 countries , on every continent but Antarctica but even the companies with a no - open - source policy have programmers in the basement working full time on code and software .
If a technology needs a centralized group to help it advance , then it makes sense to design a mechanism to support those few specialized experts who push forward the frontiers .
In such a field , the patent - thicket problem is not a problem because there are only a few actors in the business , so the transaction costs of negotiating exchanges are low .
But this story is entirely removed from the reality of software .
A third of the industry consists of centralized organizations that only write software while the rest is largely a decentralized body of workers supporting themselves and their innovations through immediate , direct application rather than waiting to put out a product in the near future .
As far as Coasian arguments about transaction costs are concerned , this is absolutely the worst case , since buyers and sellers are distributed across the planet .
Because every patent is unique , there is no easy way to create a simple market to make patent trading cheap .
The rule that independent invention is not a defense in infringement claims makes sense in a centralized industry .
Patents are public record , and it is reasonable to assume that every tractor manufacturer is exerting some effort to watch every other such manufacturer .
In the decentralized software industry , this does not make any sense at all : should the sofa company spend time and effort on monitoring Microsoft and Novells patent portfolio ?
Add in the software patent search problems from chapter 5 , and the assumption that everyone has full knowledge of the patent playing field becomes still more tenuous .
In short , patents in a decentralized market are Coases worst nightmare : every player needs to expend vast quantities searching for the owner of every part of every program , meaning transaction costs piled upon transaction costs .
These costs will always exist in every field , but they are magnified in a dense , decentralized network of actors .
Centralizing the patent search process ( by hiring centralized full - time patent search firms to support the decentralized programmers ) will not help much : searchers will still have to check every computational nut and bolt , and owing to the joys of mathematical abstraction , hundreds of patents like the singular value decomposition patent apply to hundreds of different fields .
Because any Turing machine can be applied to any effectively computable problem , computer science itself is a dense network of concepts , each one a step or two away from virtually every other .
To do a proper search , then , one would have to check almost every prior use of a Turing machine : in all , 170,000 patents and counting .
As an aside , the political landscape of software is a manifestation of the collective action problem : a centralized group that stands to gain significantly from a policy will lobby more vehemently than a decentralized group of many people who all stand to lose from the policy , and so inefficient political decisions are often made to please the most concentrated and vocal interests .
At the height of the European debate , centralized producers with large patent portfolios such as Adobe , Cisco Systems , IBM , and Microsoft spent a great many resources on lobbying the EUs decision makers .
The patent problems discussed in this chapter are not about open source ; they are about decentralization .
Software design was decentralized before open source became mainstream , and at least a third of the market , including a large subportion that does not open its source , remains decentralized .
Patents were not designed to cover goods produced by thousands of companies that do not even work in the industry in question .
There are many reasons to believe that they are not as good a fit for a massively decentralized system as for traditional centralized systems of production .
How Patents Affect the Bifurcated Market Patents primarily benefit the authors of shrink - wrapped software .
Returning to the music metaphor , the band that makes its money playing gigs needs no IP protection .
If fans do not pay at the door , they will not hear the music .
The band that focuses on CD sales depends heavily on IP protection , since copies of its CDs are near - perfect substitutes for the originals .
Similarly , the provider of a software product needs to differentiate his from that of others in order to charge a unit price greater than the near zero unit cost .
Copyright is sufficient for this , but as discussed in chapter 5 , patents as they exist today are so broad that a patent - owner can carve out sole ownership of a much larger part of the market than a copyright owner could .
Meanwhile , a strictly labor - oriented employee is more indifferent to IP protection : if the company does not pay at the door , then the programmer will withhold his or her labor no IP required .
As already mentioned , patents make the most sense and provide the most economic benefit in a system built around a few centralized vendors of goods .
Conversely , they make no sense at all in the context of a decentralized network of laborers especially if everyone has already found incentive to innovate in the need to do his or her own job better .
In real life , of course , the class of programmers does not bifurcate into those who provide only shrink - wrapped software and those who provide only day - to - day labor , but includes people whose work falls all along the range .
In the middle are a variety of consultants , who typically offer both software ( either off the shelf or custom made ) and implementation services .
To the extent that they differentiate themselves through their unique software , patents may help ; to the extent that they differentiate through high - quality labor , patents are irrelevant .
Just as some bar bands prefer to strictly control bootleg recordings and profit from their sale , labor - oriented providers may be able to profit from controlling the software they produce .
In the context here , there is potential for a labor - oriented programmer to turn into a product - oriented programmer .
However , recall the matter of comparative advantage : the sofa company is not oriented toward software sales or software patent licensing , and reorienting the business would be costly .
Meanwhile , vendors of shrink - wrapped software know the software market and need to make little or no extension to the main business to apply for and license software patents .
In short , software patents are designed for and can help shrink - wrap vendors but do nothing for the labor - oriented sector except to the extent that labor - oriented workers are or could become shrinkwrap vendors as well .
The Future of Software Allow me to make my predictions for the future of the software market .
Computer services overall will continue to expand , while the market for shrink - wrapped software will become a smaller part of the equation , and the market for programming labor will expand .
Of course , well - written shrink - wrapped software will always have a place in retail .
Apple has shown that there is much to be said for having a professional design team working on the look and feel of a product , while authors of open - source and task - specific software are famous for poor graphic design .
The open source code base is constantly expanding , but that is no help here : although programs written in the mid-1980s often work perfectly today , goods that have not had a design overhaul since then look terrible to modern eyes .
Retail firms that put their effort into a good user interface will always have a market .
Since consumers care much more about how their software looks and feels than database maintainers do , much of the demand is on the consumer side rather than the enterprise side .
If nothing else , there is the games market : gamers have an insatiable desire for the faster , flashier , and newer items .
However , games have no corporate clientele ( at least not while the boss is watching ) , so they will never garner the hourly wage programmers , and open - source hobbyists have never been able to develop the critical mass of people necessary to put together the art , storyline , game play , and rendering needed to make a top - notch game .
Even so , gaming software is not just small change : sales in 2004 totaled $ 7.3 billion .
There is more money yet in business software that nonprogrammers use ( such as word processors and spreadsheets ) , which falls somewhere between the two extremes of beautiful games and ugly - but - efficient back ends .
On the one hand , efficiency matters , but on the other , office workers are still human beings , and if they are going to spend a third of every twenty - four hours staring at a computer screen , it may as well look nice .
In this range , things could go either way .
To date , shrink - wrapped software has won out , because of aesthetic considerations and a strong focus on ease of initial use .
But it does not have to be this way : the Department of Defense could hire programmers to add eye candy to OpenOffice.org ( a collaboratively written office suite ) , and may still save money over licensing Microsoft Word .
Collaborative software is only getting better .
OpenOffice.org is already more than sufficient for writing letters and balancing a home users checkbook in a spreadsheet , and for all but the most demanding business uses .
Even the French national police force uses this software on its 80,000 PCs .
The code base for OpenOffice.org will not disappear .
If anything , the percentage of people who download free software that meets their needs is likely to expand in comparison with the percentage who spend a few hundred dollars on an office suite that does a little more and comes with animated characters .
People prefer familiar , tested software , which currently means proprietary products , but companies such as Google and municipalities such as the State of Massachusetts are using open - source software , so the getting - acquainted phase has already begun .
I expect that five years from now , collaborative software will be as familiar as the common brand names of today .
This is a looming threat for the shrink - wrap market , but neither a plus nor a minus for the labor market .
On the consumer side , there is only so much that users need a word processor to do .
Unless users can be persuaded to upgrade on a regular basis , software may be a one - time investment .
For example , I have many friends who use Windows 95 .
They admit it with shame , since the name clearly indicates that the software is a decade old .
Yet it still meets their needs and they see no value in the expense of upgrading .
At the same time , things always break , so individuals and companies will need IT professionals on hand long after the software licenses have been paid for .
I still get calls from my friends with Windows 95 , since problems continue to crop up at a regular pace .
By contrast , business computing needs are complex .
Corporations are no longer satisfied with a straightforward personnel database they want one that automatically makes hiring decisions the way the vice president would make them , that integrates seamlessly with the accounting database , and that has an interface on the companys website .
None of these things can be pulled out of a box ; a programmer who knows the company will have to be hired to implement them .
Authors of retail software can be located in Seattle , India , or anywhere in between .
As noted earlier , any competent programmer can implement any sufficiently detailed interface design , although a consultant hired to design the interface for a company is very likely to be on site , getting the lay of the companys virtual land .
With increasing outsourcing and offshoring ( todays software market buzzwords ) , the number of domestic programmers writing shrink - wrapped software will decrease , but there will be less effect on the domestic programmers writing customized software .
For all of these reasons , I foresee slower growth or even some contraction for shrink - wrapped software in the near future , whereas the market for custom programming labor will expand in close proportion to the increasing ubiquity and complexity of computing .
Back to Patents Patents favor the shrink - wrap market , which is the segment of the market likely to experience a decline .
In this context , software patent laws are among those that economists despise most : namely , laws that artificially prop up an industry in decline .
Like a spurned lover , the centralized vendors will fight to keep their portion of the market .
Stronger patent laws to bear down on decentralized labor are a primary weapon in the fight .
If the market does not stay as it is today but shifts further from the per unit model toward the labor model , it is hard to predict whether the total number of programmers will rise or fall .
Certainly , the information technology sector as a whole is not likely to suffer .
On a more abstract level , free software or task - specific software can be expected to add as much or more value than shrink - wrapped software , and authors in the software labor market are likely to match or outdo software vendors when it comes to innovativeness .
From the perspective of society , and even the software industry as a whole , there is no need to protect the shrink - wrap segment of the market , or to change the rules to favor it over the labor - oriented segment .
Yet that is exactly what software patents do , at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars wasted in litigation .

The naming of this type of software hints at some massive infighting among FLOSS advocates , even though they agree on virtually everything else .
In a recent interview (  Thus Spake Stallman ,  Slashdot , May 1 , 2000 [ slashdot.org/interviews/00/05/01/1052216. shtml ] ) , Richard Stallman , founder of the Free Software Foundation , takes pains to point out that I am not affiliated with the Open Source Movement .
I founded the Free Software Movement .
He reserves especial vitriol for the writing of leading open - source advocate Eric S. Raymond , perhaps because Raymond has said of Stallman :  As an evangelist to the mainstream , hes been one fifteen - year long continuous disaster  ( www.catb.org/~esr/ writings/shut-up-and-show-them.html ) .
The naming fight underscores the idea that the software should be free of licensing restrictions ( free as in speech ) rather than simply free of cost ( free as in beer ) .
The term FLOSS is a pleasing compromise because it forms a common , albeit irrelevant , word from all of the options .
Here , I refer to FLOSS as opensource  software because I think it sounds nicer and also use the term collaborative software to refer to the means of producing software in a decentralized manner even when the output is not free or open .

New York Times National reporter Jodi Rudoren ( formerly Jodi Wilgoren , and therein lies a self - absorbed tale ) has a Saturday front - page story on yet another investigation of a congressman , Rep. Alan Mollohan of West Virginia .
“ As lawmakers have increasingly slipped pet projects into federal spending bills over the past decade , one lawmaker has used his powerful perch on the House Appropriations Committee to funnel $ 250 million into five nonprofit organizations that he set up .
Those actions have prompted a complaint to federal prosecutors that questions whether any of that taxpayer money helped fuel a parallel growth in his personal fortune .
“ The most ambitious effort by the congressman , Alan B. Mollohan , is a glistening glass - and - steel structure with a swimming pool , sauna and spa rising in a former cow pasture in Fairmont , W.Va. , thanks to $ 103 million of taxpayer money he garnered through special spending allocations known as earmarks . ”
Notice anything missing ?
Right .
Although the rumor around D.C. is that Mollohan is a Democrat , Rudoren does n’t inform us of that fact until this casual line in the eighth paragraph : “ The case has led several Republican leaders to call for Mr. Mollohan 's removal from the House ethics committee , where he is the senior Democrat . ”
Contrast that with how readily Carl Hulse reported the Republican status of Rep. Randy Cunningham in one of the first stories on the now - jailed congressman ’s legal woes , from July 15 , 2005 : “ Under investigation for a real estate deal and his ties to a military contractor , Representative Randy Cunningham , an eight - term Republican , announced Thursday that he would not seek re-election next year in his district in the San Diego area . ”
And John Broder ’s November 29 , 2005 lead left no doubt as to Cunningham ’s party affiliation .
“ Representative Randy Cunningham , a Republican from San Diego , resigned from Congress on Monday , hours after pleading guilty to taking at least $ 2.4 million in bribes to help friends and campaign contributors win military contracts . ”

Yet one major difference between the United States and Britain , some say , is the United States ’ historical ideal of being a melting - pot meritocracy .
“ You can keep the flavor of your ethnicity , but you are expected to become an American , ” said Omer Mozaffar , 34 , a Pakistani - American raised here who is working toward a doctorate in Islamic studies at the University of Chicago .
Britain remains far more rigid .
In the United States , for example , Pakistani physicians are more likely to lead departments at hospitals or universities than they are in Britain , said Dr. Tariq H. Butt , a 52 - year - old family physician who arrived in the United States 25 years ago for his residency .
Nationwide , Pakistanis appear to be prospering .
The census calculated that mean household income in the United States in 2002 was $ 57,852 annually , while that for Asian households , which includes Pakistanis , was $ 70,047 .
By contrast , about one - fifth of young British - born Muslims are jobless , and many subsist on welfare .
Hard numbers on how many people of Pakistani descent live in the United States do not exist , but a forthcoming book from Harvard University Press on charitable donations among Pakistani - Americans , “ Portrait of a Giving Community , ” puts the number around 500,000 , with some 35 percent or more of them in the New York metropolitan area .
Chicago has fewer than 100,000 , while other significant clusters exist in California , Texas and Washington , D.C .
Pakistani immigration to the United States surged after laws in the 1960 ’s made it easier for Asians to enter the country .
Most were drawn by jobs in academia , medicine and engineering .
It was only in the late 1980 ’s and 90’s that Pakistanis arrived to work blue - collar jobs as taxi drivers or shopkeepers , said Adil Najam , the author of the book on donations and an international relations professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University .
After that experience I have difficulty understanding anyone who equates Israel with apartheid South Africa .
What I saw in the Hadassah Mt Scopus hospital was inconceivable in the South Africa where I spent most of my life , growing up and then working as a journalist who specialised in exposing apartheid .
It did n't happen and it could n't happen .
Blacks and whites were strictly separated and blacks got the least and the worst .
And this is only one slice of life .
Buses , post offices , park benches , cinemas , everything , were segregated by law .
No equation is possible .
That is what came to my mind as I read the Guardian 's two - part report this week about Israel and apartheid .
The writer , Chris McGreal , is an outstanding reporter .
I admire his dispatches from Israel / Palestine .
Day by day he honestly and correctly portrays the conflict .
But these articles are disappointing .
He has lost his way in thickets of information .
He has been unable to untangle the confusion and complexities of group relations here .
He is muddled in distinguishing between the situations of Israeli Arabs and West Bank Arabs and Jerusalem Arabs .
It is not that he is wholly wrong .
Arabs suffer severe discrimination .
Israel is in occupation of the West Bank and is responsible for oppressive and ugly actions .
But he fails to explain the why and the wherefore .
He had a choice in deciding how to decipher the situation .
He could have adopted the approach of Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley , well - known Canadian academics specialising in South Africa and the Middle East .
In their book , Seeking Mandela , published last year , they say : " Although Israel and apartheid South Africa are often equated as ' colonial settler societies ' , we argue that the differences outweigh the similarities . "
They warn that the " simplistic assumption that the South African model readily lends itself to export may actually retard necessary new solutions by clinging to visions or processes of negotiation that may not work in another context " .
That assessment is surely far more relevant than quoting the debased views about South Africa and Israel of the late Hendrik Verwoerd , a father of apartheid , as McGreal has strangely done .
McGreal had to decide whether the glass is half - full or half - empty .
His approach could have been that here is a tiny country which came into being , in the shadow of the Holocaust , less than 58 years ago .
It has been under continual attack since the start and is still beset by enemies sworn to its destruction , whether Islamic Jihad and Hamas through suicide bombings , the Arab states through their refusal to recognise its existence , the recent " wipe - out " call by Iran 's president , or the actions and declarations of a mixed bag of malevolent forces , anti-semites and semi-Jews .
That induces a siege mentality among Israel 's Jews .
They fight to live and do not always do it pleasantly .
They make horrible mistakes and inflict suffering on others .
It is not secret .
I do not know why Chris McGreal says the Israeli public is unaware of what is happening : newspapers publish the details in profusion , provoking discussion and action .
Yes , racism does exist in Israel - directed against Arabs , and also among Jews .
Amir Peretz , new leader of the Labour party , is said to be having problems with western - born Ashkenazi voters because he is Moroccan - born and Sephardic .
An explanation offered for the police violence in clearing the Amona outpost last week was the antagonism between the protesting young people , who were mainly religious Ashkenazi , and the police , who were a mixture of Moroccan and Russian immigrant stock , Bedouin and Druze .
Is Israel so different from other countries that struggle to come to terms with their minority groups ?
Why depict this country as a chamber of horrors like no other in the world ?
The glass is indeed half - full .
In South Africa , change for the better was simply not possible : the apartheid system had to be eradicated .
In contrast , change is possible in Israel .
An accusation by a member of the Knesset , Ahmed Tibi , who is Arab , that the central Bank of Israel had a discriminatory employment policy with no Arabs among its 800 staffers , drew the assurance from the bank's then governor that tenders would be advertised in the Arab - language press .
He added : " Bank of Israel hires according to criteria of merit , and ignores differences in religion , sex , race or nationality . "
Tibi also complained that the state monopoly Israel Electric did not employ Arabs ; a start has since been made with the hiring of six Arabs .
There is continual progress : the evidence is there if you want to see it .
The first Arab was appointed to the high court of justice two years ago .
Last year , for the first time , an Arab was appointed director - general of a government ministry .
McGreal notes that inside Israel , 93 % of the land is reserved for Jews while South Africa 's whites kept 87 % of the land for themselves .
Thus Israel and apartheid South Africa are the same .
But the QED is not as straightforward as his citing of these figures would have us believe .
In law , land in Israel is open to everyone but , yes , in practice , through legal stratagems , 93 % of the land has been only for Jews .
This , however , has been breached by the Arab Ka'adan family : in a 10 - year legal struggle , they have established their right to buy land and build a home in the " Jewish " community settlement of Katzir in northern Israel .
The high court of justice has given a precedent - setting decision that the state cannot discriminate on the basis of religion or nationality when allocating state land to Israeli citizens .
The case has dragged on but final success is in sight .
Other court actions are underway .
Land exemplifies both the negative and positive aspects of the lives of Israel 's Arabs : it conveys the discrimination - and the movement towards change ; slow , slow , but underway .
On education , McGreal states that separate and unequal education systems were a central part of the apartheid regime 's strategy to limit black children to manual and service jobs - something I observed firsthand and fought against in South Africa .
But I have to question his reference to what he says is the current belief among Arab parents that their children 's schools are deliberately starved of state resources so that Arabs will be doomed to lesser jobs .
Every government school , whether Jewish or Arab , gets identical funding ; differences , and hence resources , arise through what parents pay and what local authorities pay ( most local authorities in Israel are in poor financial shape ; Arab local authorities are even worse off with problems in collecting local property taxes ) .
The Jewish schools are Jewish day schools .
The Arab schools are Muslim and use Arabic , which is an official language in Israel .
There is no bar to Arabs attending Jewish schools , and some do .
I am also puzzled by the health ministry figures that McGreal has chosen to use about state spending on development of health facilities in Arab areas ( the clear implication being that Arabs are starved of health care ) .
Contrary to the picture painted , health is a visible indicator of the differences between apartheid South Africa and Israel .
In South Africa , the infant mortality rate ( IMR ) in 1985 was 78 per 1,000 live births .
Among colour groups : whites 12 , Asians 20 , coloureds 60 , blacks 94 to 150 .
In Israel , in the 1950s , the IMR among Muslims was 60.6 and among Jews 38.8 .
Major improvements occurred in health care during the 1990s and by 2001 the IMR among Arabs was 7.6 ( Muslims 8.2 , Christians 2.6 , Druze 4.7 ) .
Among Jews , 4.1 .
According to the health ministry , the higher Muslim figure was due mainly to genetic defects as a result of marriages between close relatives ; poverty is also a factor .
Other countries in 2000 : Switzerland , 8.2 , and 12.3 for Turks living there ; United States , whites 8.5 , blacks 21.3 .
He is also mistaken in saying that Arabs have been singled out for discrimination in getting reduced child allowances .
They are the same as Jewish ultra-Orthodox families .
These two groups have the largest number of children and have suffered equally from cutbacks in allowances , especially for the fifth child and beyond .
Here in Jerusalem on Monday , I watched the BBC's Auschwitz on television .
The episode dealt with French collaboration in delivering Jews to the Nazis for destruction , and how British policemen on Guernsey handed over three Jewish women .
It was a reminder , if any be needed , of why Israel exists : to fulfil the centuries - old dream of a homeland for Jews and as a sanctuary for Jews .
It 's not a perfect society .
It struggles to find itself as a Jewish state ( with no consensus about what that means ) , and it struggles to evolve as a democratic society with full rights for minorities .
It deserves criticism for its flaws and mistakes .
It also merits sympathy and support in facing unfounded attack .

It is high time to shift out of the pragmatic mind - set that has been our national characteristic .
The grand alternatives for social organization must be reconsidered .
The loss of faith in the socialist dream has not , and probably will not , restore faith in laissez - faire .
But what are the effective alternatives ?
Does anarchism deserve a hearing , and , if so , what sort of anarchism ? — James M. Buchanan , 1986 Nobel Laureate in Economic Science
Most people do not even consider the idea that society can be organized without a state .
Anarchism is simply too idealistic or too different from the current world .
But does that prove that a stateless society is unworkable or that it should not be pursued ?
Or does that prove that most social order depends on the state ?
Throughout history , political structures have varied vastly over time , and just because a system was uncommon at one point in time does not mean that it can never come about .
Tribalism , monarchism , socialism and democracy have all been tried .
Why not anarchism ?
Perhaps civil society can be attained without government .
Without considering all potential methods to organize society , one cannot determine the best system .
Anarchists want their vision considered .
Whereas Thomas Hobbes believed that a war of all against all characterizes anarchy , anarchists believe the opposite .
Government is near - ubiquitous today , yet in the past century millions of people have been murdered by their own governments ( Rummel , 1994 ) .
Perhaps government does not create order and instead does the opposite .
Could it be the case that cooperation does not depend on government ?
Could it be the case that more cooperation would occur without a state ?
Although most people agree with Hobbes that some form of government is necessary , until recently the issue was merely an assumption that had never been analyzed from an economic point of view .
This changed in the early 1970s when members of the Center for the Study for Public Choice became the first group of economists to engage in a systematic study of these questions .
Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy and Further Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy , published in 1972 and 1974 ( Tullock , 1972 and 1974 ) , contained contributions by economists who became extremely influential in the following decades : James Buchanan , Winston Bush , Thomas Hogarty , J. Patrick Gunning , Laurence Moss , Warren Samuels , William Craig Stubblebine and Gordon Tullock .
These authors decided to ask the big questions rather than debating small changes in public policy .
In his autobiography , James Buchanan describes the project :
Winston Bush galvanized our interests in the theory of anarchy , an organizational alternative that had never seriously been analyzed .
What were the descriptive features of Hobbesian anarchy ?
Could something like an anarchistic equilibrium be defined ?
Bush was instrumental in organizing a series of weekly workshops in 1972 during which each participant in turn presented papers on differing aspects of the theory of anarchy .
As revised , these papers were published in Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy .
Those weeks were exciting because never before or since have I participated so fully in a genuinely multiparty ongoing research effort , one that we knew to be relevant in some ultimate sense …
For me this brief period of research activity was important because it gave me a new focus on my whole enterprise .
( 1992 : 116 )
From a Nobel Laureate , this says a lot .
James Buchanan dedicated his 1975 Limits of Liberty to Winston Bush , and from reading subsequent scholarship in public choice one can see how significant Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy was .
Considering the impact of Buchanan 's Limits of Liberty and Tullock 's Social Dilemma on the profession , it is not difficult to conclude that Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy is too important to be ignored .
As Winston Bush ( 1972 : 5 ) wrote , " Anarchy as an organizing principle for society must appeal to anyone who places individual freedom high on his scale of values . '
With the exception of Moss ( 1974 ) , however , none of the contributors to the original volumes believed anarchism was a viable alternative .
They believed that when government is lacking , people will be unable to engage in contracts , and their property rights will be insecure .
The lesson that most readers take from the original volumes is that government is necessary for social cooperation .
But did these public choice economists prove the necessity of the state ?
Maybe not .
James Buchanan seems less sure today than he was three decades ago .
In a recent publication , Buchanan ( 2004 : 268 ) wrote , " As I now reflect on that burst of interest in the theory of anarchy , I now realize that we were perhaps too influenced by the Bush - Tullock presumption to the effect that the behavioral hypotheses used were necessarily empirically grounded . "
The Hobbesian beliefs about human behavior might not always hold .
Buchanan ( ibid. ) wrote that their pessimistic assumptions " led us to neglect at that time any effort to work out just what an ordered anarchy would look like .
What would be the results if persons should behave so as to internalize all of the relevant externalities in their dealings among themselves ? "
Shortly after the publication of Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy , other free - market economists began defending the idea that the state is unnecessary ( Anderson and Hill , 1979 ; Cuzan , 1979 ; Friedman , 1973 , 1979 ; Peden , 1977 ; Rothbard , 1973 , 1977a ; Sneed , 1977 ) .
To these authors , society can have law , order , and private property without government at all .
In fact , they argued that government law enforcement is antithetical to the market system .
When Nozick 's ( 1974 ) Anarchy , State , and Utopia appeared , arguing that ordered anarchy is impossible , many authors voiced their disagreement ( Barnett , 1977 ; Childs , 1977 ; Davidson , 1977 ; Paul , 1977 ; Rothbard , 1977 b ; Sanders , 1977 ) .
Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy , however , has not received the same attention until now .
This volume contains seven responses to the essays in Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy , as well as reprints of seven original articles and new rejoinders by James Buchanan , Gordon Tullock , Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and Peter Boettke .
The younger generation has noticeably less faith in government than their predecessors .
They question whether markets are as fragile as the public choice economists believed and question whether government can be relied on as a solution .
Let us consider the arguments .
Winston Bush wrote the pioneering article , " Individual welfare in anarchy ' .
His work , a later version of which was published in the Journal of Economic Theory ( Bush and Mayer , 1974 ) , provides a mathematical model of social interaction without a state .
When people interact , they can choose to respect the other 's property or to engage in predation .
Bush argues that in a state of anarchy , individuals expend too many resources on predation , making both parties worse off .
After the distribution of property rights under Hobbesian anarchy is established , agreeing on a common set of rules will be mutually beneficial .
Although he favors society without rules , Bush believes that predation would prevail .
When Robinson Crusoe and Friday first meet , they know little of each other , might never interact again , and have no ability to rely on external enforcement , so we might expect the results of the standard prisoner 's dilemma to hold .
Bush might be considered one of the first pessimistic anarchists .
Jason Osborne , on the other hand , contends that even in these circumstances , people will engage in less cheating than the Winston Bush model foretells .
Drawing from work of Ronald Heiner , Osborne argues that individuals can adopt a strategy known as contingent cooperation .
This model postulates that even in one - shot games , individuals can communicate before interacting , thereby enabling them to detect signals about the likelihood that the other party will cooperate .
Even in one - shot games , humans have more knowledge about other people than the prisoner 's dilemma assumes .
Even if signal detection is far from perfect , we will see less predation than standard assumptions predict .
Gordon Tullock 's " The edge of the jungle " advances the Winston Bush hypothesis and argues that cooperation would be limited under anarchy .
Without government enforcement , long - term contracting and many other beneficial trades would not occur .
People would spend too many resources engaging in opportunistic behavior , which would eventually lead to anarchy 's demise .
Tullock maintains that those with a comparative advantage in the use of force will overpower the weak and impose government .
Although government could be used to redistribute resources , Tullock argues that creating this external enforcer could benefit all members of society .
The government apparatus still uses power to enforce the law , but it eliminates the use of force by others .
The ensuing reduction of conflict creates incentives for production rather than predation .
Christopher Coyne responds by describing how private law enforcement may solve the problems in Hobbesian anarchy .
Yes , society may need law enforcement , but it need not be public .
Coyne argues that Tullock has a narrow view of anarchy : anarchy means lack of government , not lack of rules .
Could it be that public choice economists would embrace an anarchy composed of privately generated rules ?
Coyne 's response describes the many types of private rule - enforcing bodies that exist and discusses how customary law , arbitration and systems of private security have created and enforced rules independently of the state .
The possibility of private property anarchy is a real one .
J. Patrick Gunning does not rule out ordered anarchy , but he believes that anarchy can only function at a primitive level .
He believes that more advanced relations involving trade require external enforcement .
In Gunning 's words , " Even if trades are expected to be infinitely recurring , there may be no trade . '
He gives an example of a pygmy and a giant who would be unable to make contracts unless a third party , a super - giant , entered the picture .
The supergiant is an analogy for the government that prevents cheating .
In this view , the government is potentially beneficial to all because it enables people to engage in contracts .
Peter Leeson responds by arguing that many contracts do in fact take place without external enforcement .
Perhaps Gunning 's assumption that parties necessarily cheat is nothing more than an assumption .
Leeson cites evidence from experimental economics to show that even in one - shot games without external enforcement , people are less likely to cheat than Hobbesian theory predicts .
We can not rely on law in the vast majority of social interactions , but the market still creates incentives for cooperation .
For example , businesses provide good service not because of rules but because they want future business .
In addition to cases without third - party enforcement , Leeson provides examples of third - party enforcement that do not use force .
He describes how multilateral reputation mechanisms can induce contractual compliance even though compulsion is not involved .
Engaging in contracts without government is only one issue ; having property rights without government is another .
James Buchanan analyzes the situation of Hobbesian anarchy as a prisoner 's dilemma in " Before public choice . "
Buchanan believes that people will act opportunistically when given the incentive , and although they would be better off following common rules , they have no way to commit .
Buchanan uses this to derive a contract theory of the state .
By implementing an external enforcer , the prisoner 's dilemma can be solved .
Benjamin Powell , in contrast , takes the assumptions of Buchanan 's model and asks whether government can bring an improvement .
Where Buchanan concludes that people will engage in opportunistic behavior when external enforcement is lacking , Powell does not question the result .
Instead , he uses the same assumptions as Buchanan to analyze the situation after we implement government .
Powell argues that the idea that government can solve the prisoner 's dilemma only holds if we assume the state to be an external force not constituted of humans .
Once we recognize that government is necessarily composed of flesh and blood , the same results do not hold .
If all people are Hobbesian egoists , why would we not expect government to act opportunistically ?
No theory or evidence suggests that people will become better once they join government .
Even if we accept the pessimistic assumptions , anarchy cannot be ruled inferior .
Thomas Hogarty tries to rule anarchy inferior on empirical grounds .
He provides three case studies to support why we should have government .
As his first example of anarchy , Hogarty points out that brown rats do not have government , and , in fact , often bite each other .
As his second example , Hogarty discusses how the children in Lord of the Flies did not have government and engaged in many malicious acts .
As his final example , Hogarty argues that a prisoner - of - war camp during the American Civil War provides an example of individual interaction without a state .
Rather than acting cooperatively , the prisoners engaged in aggressive behavior .
All three case studies lack cooperation , so Hogarty concludes we need government .
In response , Virgil Storr questions whether Hogarty 's examples justify government .
Yes , Storr agrees , brown rats removed from their familiar packs and placed among rats from different localities do in fact bite each other , but he questions how much this experiment can tell us about human cooperation .
Storr also questions the extent to which a children 's novel , a work of fiction , can be used to draw inferences about interaction under anarchy .
Finally ,
Storr takes issue with the treatment of an overcrowded POW camp as a case study in anarchy .
When government imprisons a group of people and controls their supplies , we should not be surprised if conflict arises .
To Storr , none of these examples provides evidence of deficiencies in anarchy .
Not only may anarchy be possible , but Laurence Moss argues that the idea has a long history in American thinking .
Although anarchist theory has been developed further in recent years , the idea that markets can function without government was popular in eighteenth - century America as well .
Moss argues that eighteenth - century anarchists such as Josiah Warren , Lysander Spooner , and Benjamin Tucker were simply defending the ideals of the Declaration of Independence .
Moss then discusses how this tradition has been picked up by Murray Rothbard and other modern free - market economists .
Even though most people consider anarchism to be radical , Moss concludes , " Property anarchism is as American as apple pie ! "
Warren Samuels dislikes this apple pie and worries about a pure market economy .
He believes that power relations will be present under private property anarchism , or any form of markets for that matter .
He sympathizes with the anarchist goals of freedom , order , and markets , while sharing a suspicion of the state , but he questions whether anarchism will deliver those ends .
Samuels maintains that agencies enforcing libertarian law would be nominally private but equivalent to government .
Samuels criticizes Murray Rothbard for simply wanting to replace one type of coercion with another .
To Samuels , the theory of anarchism fails to resolve the problem of power relations and thus should not be considered a superior alternative to government .
Not so , says Scott Beaulier , who takes issue with the argument that private law enforcement is just as coercive as government .
He points out that Samuels 's notion of power is so broad that any exercise of choice is an exercise of power .
Beaulier argues this cannot be used as a criticism against anarcho - capitalism , so the question is , what type of power relations do we want ?
Public law enforcement involves a coercive monopoly on power , whereas private law enforcement gives individuals a choice .
Because political power gives people no choice , it is often misused .
Politics simply replaces voluntary market relations with involuntary ones .
How does Buchanan respond to the new works herein ?
Does he take issue with the authors who reject the necessity of Leviathan ?
Surprisingly , Buchanan does not defend government against its critics .
Instead , he argues that the arguments miss their mark .
Buchanan maintains , " The seminar papers , as published in the small volumes edited by Gordon Tullock , as well as Tullock 's book , The Social Dilemma ( 1974 b ) and my own book , The Limits of Liberty ( 1975 ) , should , at least in part , be interpreted as reactions to the times . "
He argues they were a response to the encroaching disorder on many university campuses in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
This alternative explanation that Explorations in the Theory of Anarchy was less concerned with establishment of government but more with the establishment of rules is welcome .
Could these rules be privately produced according to Buchanan 's ( 1965 ) theory of clubs ?
Buchanan does not answer this question , but we hope future public choice economists will .
One such economist is Gordon Tullock .
Tullock takes on libertarian anarchist arguments in his response .
He maintains that although modern examples of private law enforcement are quite common , they all take place in the shadow of the state .
He argues that private police companies , detectives , mediators and arbitrators depend on government .
Reputation and boycott can work against untrustworthy businessmen but cannot work against those who use force .
Tullock argues that we need government to impede such banditry .
Those who are unable to protect themselves will be conquered or destroyed .
A professional military will nearly always be more successful than a band of disorganized militiamen ; hence the need , or the inevitability , of a national armed force .
Finally , Tullock brings up a number of other problems he sees with anarchy , such as traveling over private roads , quarantine and fire protection .
Although he recognizes that private communities do provide these services , Tullock attempts to blur the line between proprietary communities and local governments .
Jeffrey Rogers Hummel objects .
Tullock is wrong , Hummel argues , to conflate rules with government .
Just because condominiums undertake certain activities that governments also undertake does not make them governments .
Hummel further states , " Just as government is not a necessary condition for rule of law , it is equally obvious that government is not a sufficient condition for effective defense against invasion . "
He points out that nations are often overtaken by others , so the simple existence of government does not solve the world 's problems .
To Hummel the solution lies not in government but in persuading enough people to support liberty .
The use of force by any entity cannot persist if the public remains in opposition .
Peter Boettke concludes the volume by discussing the evolutionary potential of anarchy as a research program .
Boettke outlines how analytical anarchism is more than a normative endeavor .
The world has many puzzles that cannot be explained by theories that assume the dependence of markets on government .
In many cases contracts are enforceable , yet trade takes place .
By documenting how private parties find ways to eliminate opportunism , the anarchist research program provides a more accurate picture of the market process .
Even under conditions of large group settings and near - anonymity , market participants find ways to cooperate rather than cheat .
The endogenous creation and enforcement of rules is part of the market process .
Boettke concludes , " Work along these lines is not only valuable at a fundamental theoretical level , but also of practical significance as well as we attempt to wrestle with the great social transformations of our era . "
Although the younger authors believe the public choice economists of the 1970s offered a promising start , we believe that their analysis was incomplete .
Is social interaction without the state as bad as Hobbes and these public choice economists believe ?
Much of the recent analysis suggests otherwise .
But maybe it is true that humans are inherently prone to conflict .
Perhaps the Hobbesian dilemma is a real threat .
Whatever the case may be , government does not seem to offer a solution .
Either Leviathan is part of the problem or Leviathan is superfluous .
Under either scenario , anarchy might be the best choice after all .
We are glad that public choice economists started studying this topic three decades ago , and we hope to see a resurgence in explorations in the theory of anarchy .

BBC News science reporter , at the Kennedy Space Center
The events were captured in onboard video and the agency says it now needs to consider their significance .
In one case , a heatshield tile seems to have been affected on the underside of the shuttle .
Discovery 's astronauts are to use a 15 m - long robotic arm to inspect the orbiter 's exterior .
The arm is equipped with sensor and camera attachments .
A full sweep of the shuttle 's key surfaces will take several hours .
It appears the tip of the shuttle 's external fuel tank also hit a bird as it launched from Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday .
Spot investigation
John Shannon , STS - 114 mission operations representative , pointed out video frames apparently showing a piece of heatshield tile breaking off from the underside of the shuttle .
SHUTTLE RETURN TO FLIGHT Mission known as STS - 114 Discovery 's 31st flight 17th orbiter flight to ISS Payload : Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Lift - off : 1039 EDT , 26 July Location : Kennedy Space Center , Launch Pad 39B Discovery crew : Collins , Kelly , Noguchi , Robinson , Thomas , Lawrence and Camarda

" We 're very interested in that , " he told reporters .
" That 's something we 're going to get better pictures of on flight - day three . "
Mr Shannon said it could simply be that part of the black covering on the orbiter 's underside was damaged exposing the heatshield tile .
But he added that it was equally possible the tile itself had been dented or sheared .
The missions operations representative also showed journalists video footage of a dark object falling from the external tank .
Experts cannot yet determine its size , but it did not appear to hit the shuttle , they said .
News outlets had reported details of this piece of debris falling off the tank earlier in the day .
Parts and supplies
Tuesday 's successful launch was Nasa 's second go at a lift - off in the current launch window .
PERFECT FLORIDA DAY
Everything seemed to go right for Nasa and the cheering spectators
In pictures
Nasa says it has learnt the safety lessons of the Columbia disaster , which cost the lives of seven astronauts , and has made this the most scrutinised shuttle flight ever .
Columbia broke up as it attempted to re-enter Earth 's atmosphere .
Nasa has been considering the issue of bird - strike on launch
Nasa had positioned more than 100 cameras , both on the ground and in the air , to capture as much detail as possible on Discovery 's ascent into orbit .
Discovery will take parts and supplies to the ISS and test new safety features such as a repair - kit for heatshield tiles and a 15 m - long robotic arm that will inspect the shuttle for damage in orbit .
Discovery is due to touch down at Kennedy Space Center on 7 August at 0546 EDT ( 0946 GMT ; 1046 BST ) .
